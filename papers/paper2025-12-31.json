    "abstract": "Recent advances in 3D reconstruction have achieved remarkable progress in high-quality scene capture from dense multi-view imagery, yet struggle when input views are limited. Various approaches, including regularization techniques, semantic priors, and geometric constraints, have been implemented to address this challenge. Latest diffusion-based methods have demonstrated substantial improvements by generating novel views from new camera poses to augment training data, surpassing earlier regularization and prior-based techniques. Despite this progress, we identify three critical limitations in these state-of-the-art approaches: inadequate coverage beyond known view peripheries, geometric inconsistencies across generated views, and computationally expensive pipelines. We introduce GaMO (Geometry-aware Multi-view Outpainter), a framework that reformulates sparse-view reconstruction through multi-view outpainting. Instead of generating new viewpoints, GaMO expands the field of view from existing camera poses, which inherently preserves geometric consistency while providing broader scene coverage. Our approach employs multi-view conditioning and geometry-aware denoising strategies in a zero-shot manner without training. Extensive experiments on Replica and ScanNet++ demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction quality across 3, 6, and 9 input views, outperforming prior methods in PSNR and LPIPS, while achieving a $25\\times$ speedup over SOTA diffusion-based methods with processing time under 10 minutes.

    "source": "arXiv",
    "abstract": "Recognizing fine-grained actions from temporally corrupted skeleton sequences remains a significant challenge, particularly in real-world scenarios where online pose estimation often yields substantial missing data. Existing methods often struggle to accurately recover temporal dynamics and fine-grained spatial structures, resulting in the loss of subtle motion cues crucial for distinguishing similar actions. To address this, we propose FineTec, a unified framework for Fine-grained action recognition under Temporal Corruption. FineTec first restores a base skeleton sequence from corrupted input using context-aware completion with diverse temporal masking. Next, a skeleton-based spatial decomposition module partitions the skeleton into five semantic regions, further divides them into dynamic and static subgroups based on motion variance, and generates two augmented skeleton sequences via targeted perturbation. These, along with the base sequence, are then processed by a physics-driven estimation module, which utilizes Lagrangian dynamics to estimate joint accelerations. Finally, both the fused skeleton position sequence and the fused acceleration sequence are jointly fed into a GCN-based action recognition head. Extensive experiments on both coarse-grained (NTU-60, NTU-120) and fine-grained (Gym99, Gym288) benchmarks show that FineTec significantly outperforms previous methods under various levels of temporal corruption. Specifically, FineTec achieves top-1 accuracies of 89.1% and 78.1% on the challenging Gym99-severe and Gym288-severe settings, respectively, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability.

Using high-throughput data for Fe, FeO, and NiO, we obtain a 2-4 times reuduction in DMFT iterations. Leveraging this improvement, we generate correlated energies and forces for Fe at core pressures, train a neural-network interatomic potential, and determine the melting curve via two-phase coexistence simulations. We obtain a predicted melting temperature of 6225 K at 330 GPa."

The review covers the generation of spatial-temporal waves, supercontinuum broadening, and advanced modeling techniques, such as multimode unidirectional pulse propagation equations for describing optical pulse evolution. Experimental demonstrations involving discretized conical waves and supercontinuum generation optimization are detailed. The paper emphasizes the unique capabilities of photonic crystal fibers, especially hollow-core variants, in achieving broad supercontinua and Raman frequency combs, ultrashort pulse compression, high-harmonic generation, plasma formation, and nonclassical light production. Our outlook highlights ongoing research into spatiotemporal helicon waves, ultrashort pulse propagation, vacuum ultraviolet and mid-infrared supercontinuum generation, and innovative fiber technologies.

    "abstract": "Many regularization priors for Bayesian regression assume the regression coefficients are a priori independent. In particular this is the case for standard Bayesian treatments of the lasso and the elastic net. While independence may be reasonable in some data-analytic settings, incorporating dependence in these prior distributions provides greater modeling flexibility. This paper introduces the orthant normal distribution in its general form and shows how it can be used to structure prior dependence in the Bayesian elastic net regression model. An L1-regularized version of Zellner's g prior is introduced as a special case, creating a new link between the literature on penalized optimization and an important class of regression priors. Computation is challenging due to an intractable normalizing constant in the prior. We avoid this issue by modifying slightly a standard prior of convenience for the hyperparameters in such a way to enable simple and fast Gibbs sampling of the posterior distribution. The benefit of including structured prior dependence in the Bayesian elastic net regression model is demonstrated through simulation and a near-infrared spectroscopy data example."

Such global anomalies can be canceled by anomalous symmetry-preserving topological quantum field theories (TQFTs), which contain no local point operators but only extended excitations such as line and surface operators. In this work, we study mixed gauge-gravitational nonperturbative global anomalies of Weyl fermions (or Weyl semimetals in condensed matter) charged under discrete Abelian internal symmetries in four-dimensional spacetime, with spacetime-internal fermionic symmetry $G=$Spin$\\times_{\\mathbb{Z}_2^{\\rm F}}\\mathbb{Z}_{2m}^{\\rm F}$ or Spin$\\times\\mathbb{Z}_n$ that contains fermion parity $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\\rm F}$. We determine the minimal finite gauge group $K$ of anomalous $G$-symmetric TQFTs that can match the fermionic anomaly via the symmetry-extension construction $1 \\to K \\to G_{\\rm Tot} \\to G \\to 1$, where the anomaly in $G$ is trivialized upon pullback to $G_{\\rm Tot}$, computed by Atiyah-Patodi-Singer eta invariant. This allows one to replace a $G$-symmetric four-dimensional Weyl fermion by an anomalous $G$-symmetric discrete-$K$-gauge TQFT as an alternative low-energy theory in the same deformation class. As an application, we show that the four-dimensional Standard Model with 15 Weyl fermions per family, in the absence of a sterile right-handed neutrino $ν_R$, exhibits mixed gauge-gravitational global anomalies between baryon and lepton number symmetries $({\\bf B \\pm L})$ and spacetime diffeomorphisms. We identify the corresponding minimal $K$-gauge fermionic TQFT that cancels these anomalies and can be interpreted as a gapped, topologically ordered dark sector replacing missing Weyl fermions via symmetry extension, without invoking conventional Anderson-Higgs symmetry breaking."

Our analysis reveals, for the first time within a renormalization group framework, a quantum critical point across which the Kondo effect goes from being destroyed to dominating. Our findings elucidate not only the Kondo destruction quantum criticality but also an accompanying global phase diagram of heavy fermion metals."

In practice, fulfillment networks require that shipments with the same origin and destination follow the same transfer path. This unsplittable flow requirement complicates the MCND problem, requiring integer programming (IP) formulations in which binary variables replace continuous flow variables. To enhance the solvability of this variant of the MCND problem for large-scale logistics networks, this work focuses on strengthening dual bounds. We investigate the polyhedra of arc-set relaxations, and we introduce two new classes of valid inequalities that can be implemented within solution approaches. We develop one approach that dynamically adds valid inequalities to the root node of a reformulation of the MCND IP with additional valid metric inequalities. We show the effectiveness of our ideas with a comprehensive computational study using path-based fulfillment instances, constructed from data provided by a large U.S.-based e-commerce company, and the well-known arc-based Canad instances. Experiments show that our best solution approach for a practical path-based model reduces the IP gap by an average of 26.5% and 22.5% for the two largest instance groups, compared to solving the reformulation alone, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving the dual bound. In addition, experiments using only the arc-based relaxation highlight the strength of our new valid inequalities relative to the linear programming relaxation (LPR), yielding an IP-gap reduction of more than 85%."

Then, we derive the gradient flow that the training process follows in the ``wide network limit'' and analyze the limit of this flow as the training time tends to infinity. These results combined show that the generalization error of DGFMs tends to zero as the number of neurons and the training time tend to infinity."

The former question is studied in spectral geometry, and the latter is a central concern in numerical analysis. In this short expository survey we revisit the process of eigenvalue approximation, from the perspective of computational spectral geometry. Over the years a multitude of methods -- for discretizing the operator and for the resultant discrete system -- have been developed and analyzed in the field of numerical analysis. High-accuracy and provably convergent discretization approaches can be used to examine the interplay between the spectrum of an operator and the geometric properties of the spatial domain or manifold it is defined on. While computations have been used to guide conjectures in spectral geometry, in recent years approximation-theoretic tools and validated computations are also being used as part of proof strategies in spectral geometry. Given a particular spectral feature of interest, should we discretize the original problem, or seek a reformulation? Of the many possible approximation strategies, which should we choose? These choices are inextricably linked to the objective: on the one hand, rapid, specialized methods are often ideal for conjecture formulation (prioritizing efficiency and accuracy), whereas schemes with guaranteed, computable error bounds are needed when computation is incorporated into a proof strategy. We also review instances where the demanding requirements of spectral geometry -- the need for rigorous error control or the robust calculation of higher eigenvalues -- motivate new developments in numerical analysis."

    "abstract": "While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate reasonable zero-shot capability across many downstream tasks, fine-tuning is a common practice to improve their performance. However, a task's data efficiency--i.e., the number of fine-tuning examples needed to achieve a desired level of performance--is often unknown, resulting in costly cycles of incremental annotation and retraining. Indeed, we demonstrate across a curated set of 30 specialized tasks that performant LLMs may struggle zero-shot but can attain stronger performance after fine-tuning. This motivates the need for methods to predict a task's data efficiency without requiring incremental annotation. After introducing a concrete metric that quantifies a task's data efficiency, we propose using the gradient cosine similarity of low-confidence examples to predict data efficiency based on a small number of labeled samples. We validate our approach on a diverse set of tasks with varying data efficiencies, attaining 8.6% error in overall data efficiency prediction and typically eliminating hundreds of unnecessary annotations on each task.

The concept of a PT transition has been extended to Markovian open quantum systems, which are described by the GKSL equation. Interestingly, the PT transition in many-body Markovian open quantum systems, the so-called \\textit{Lindbladian PT (L-PT) phase transition}, is closely related to two classes of exotic nonequilibrium many-body phenomena: \\textit{continuous-time crystals} and \\textit{non-reciprocal phase transitions}. In this review, we describe the recent advances in the study of L-PT phase transitions. First, we define PT symmetry in three distinct contexts: non-Hermitian systems, nonlinear dynamical systems, and Markovian open quantum systems, highlighting the interconnections between these frameworks. Second, we develop mean-field theories of L-PT phase transitions for collective-spin systems and for bipartite bosonic systems with particle-number conservation. Within these classes of models, we show that L-PT symmetry can induce a breaking of continuous time-translation symmetry down to a discrete one, leading to persistent periodic dynamics. We further demonstrate that the L-PT phase transition point is typically \\textit{a critical exceptional point}, where multiple collective excitation modes with zero excitation spectrum coalesce. These findings establish an explicit connection to continuous-time crystals and non-reciprocal phase transitions. Third, going beyond the mean-field theory, we analyze statistical and quantum properties, such as purity and quantum entanglement indicators of time-independent steady states for several specific models with the L-PT symmetry. Finally, we discuss future research directions for L-PT phase transitions."

Bursts were detected in both Band 4 (550 - 950 MHz) and Band 5 (1060 - 1460 MHz), with the last Band 5 burst occurring on 24 May, while Band 4 activity persisted until 28 May, indicating a frequency-dependent decline. Consecutive bursts were observed with separations of 16.7 - 291.5 ms, revealing short repetition intervals or potential sub-second quasi-periodicity. The waiting-time and energy distributions are bimodal, suggesting at least two distinct emission timescales and energy modes. Burst fluence ranges from 1.72 - 78.47 Jy ms, and the cumulative fluence distribution follows a broken power law. Multi-frequency analysis further shows closely spaced burst pairs across Band 4 and Band 5, with sub-second offsets of 1.08 - 1.15 s, and no strict simultaneity with contemporaneous FAST detections. These findings demonstrate that FRB 20201124A exhibits closely spaced, patchy, multi-frequency emission with frequency-dependent activity, highlighting the complex and dynamic nature of repeating FRBs."

In this work, we propose a novel framework for DLO manipulation in constrained environments. This framework combines hierarchical deformation planning with neural tracking, ensuring reliable performance in both global deformation synthesis and local deformation tracking. Specifically, the deformation planner begins by generating a spatial path set that inherently satisfies the homotopic constraints associated with DLO keypoint paths. Next, a path-set-guided optimization method is applied to synthesize an optimal temporal deformation sequence for the DLO. In manipulation execution, a neural model predictive control approach, leveraging a data-driven deformation model, is designed to accurately track the planned DLO deformation sequence. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated in extensive constrained DLO manipulation tasks."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) change how consumers acquire information online; their bots also crawl news publishers' websites for training data and to answer consumer queries; and they provide tools that can lower the cost of content creation. These changes lead to predictions of adverse impact on news publishers in the form of lowered consumer demand, reduced demand for newsroom employees, and an increase in news \"slop.\" Consequently, some publishers strategically responded by blocking LLM access to their websites using the robots.txt file standard. Using high-frequency granular data, we document four effects related to the predicted shifts in news publishing following the introduction of generative AI (GenAI). First, we find a consistent and moderate decline in traffic to news publishers occurring after August 2024. Second, using a difference-in-differences approach, we find that blocking GenAI bots can have adverse effects on large publishers by reducing total website traffic by 23% and real consumer traffic by 14% compared to not blocking. Third, on the hiring side, we do not find evidence that LLMs are replacing editorial or content-production jobs yet. The share of new editorial and content-production job listings increases over time. Fourth, regarding content production, we find no evidence that large publishers increased text volume; instead, they significantly increased rich content and use more advertising and targeting technologies. Together, these findings provide early evidence of some unforeseen impacts of the introduction of LLMs on news production and consumption."

We develop a general convergence analysis based on a reformulation of the operators by means of a fixed-point equation, providing a list of hypotheses related to the regularization properties of the equation and the convergence of the chosen approximation techniques on suitable subspaces. This framework unifies the proofs for some methods based on pseudospectral discretization, which we present here in this new form. To exemplify the generality of the framework, we also apply it to a method of weighted residuals found in the literature, which was previously lacking a formal convergence analysis."

    "abstract": "Near-field sensing with extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAAs) in practical 6G systems is expected to operate over broad bandwidths, where delay, Doppler, and spatial effects become tightly coupled across frequency. The purpose of this and the companion paper (Part I) is to develop the unified Cram'er--Rao bounds (CRBs) for sensing systems spanning from far-field to near-field, and narrow-band to wide-band. This paper (Part II) derives fundamental estimation limits for a wide-band near-field sensing systems employing orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing signaling over a coherent processing interval. We establish an exact near-field wide-band signal model that captures frequency-dependent propagation, spherical-wave geometry, and the intrinsic coupling between target location and motion parameters across subcarriers and slow time. Similar as Part I using the Slepian--Bangs formulation, we derive the wide-band Fisher information matrix and the CRBs for joint estimation of target position, velocity, and radar cross-section, and we show how wide-band information aggregates across orthogonal subcarriers. We further develop tractable far-field and near-field approximations which provide design-level insights into the roles of bandwidth, coherent integration length, and array aperture, and clarify when wide-band effects. Simulation results validate the derived CRBs and its approximations, demonstrating close agreement with the analytical scaling laws across representative ranges, bandwidths, and array configurations."

    "abstract": "Many modern AI and ML problems require evaluating partners' contributions through shared yet asymmetric, computationally intensive processes and the simultaneous selection of the most beneficial candidates. Sequential approaches to these problems can be unified under a new framework, Sequential Support Network Learning (SSNL), in which the goal is to select the most beneficial candidate set of partners for all participants using trials; that is, to learn a directed graph that represents the highest-performing contributions. We demonstrate that a new pure-exploration model, the semi-overlapping multi-(multi-armed) bandit (SOMMAB), in which a single evaluation provides distinct feedback to multiple bandits due to structural overlap among their arms, can be used to learn a support network from sparse candidate lists efficiently. We develop a generalized GapE algorithm for SOMMABs and derive new exponential error bounds that improve the best known constant in the exponent for multi-bandit best-arm identification. The bounds scale linearly with the degree of overlap, revealing significant sample-complexity gains arising from shared evaluations. From an application point of view, this work provides a theoretical foundation and improved performance guarantees for sequential learning tools for identifying support networks from sparse candidates in multiple learning problems, such as in multi-task learning (MTL), auxiliary task learning (ATL), federated learning (FL), and in multi-agent systems (MAS)."

Evaluated on CDDMBench, CPJ significantly improves performance: using GPT-5-mini captions, GPT-5-Nano achieves \\textbf{+22.7} pp in disease classification and \\textbf{+19.5} points in QA score over no-caption baselines.

    "abstract": "Biological systems encode function not primarily in steady states, but in the structure of transient responses elicited by time-varying stimuli. Overshoots, biphasic dynamics, adaptation kinetics, fold-change detection, entrainment, and cumulative exposure effects often determine phenotypic outcomes, yet are poorly captured by classical steady-state or dose-response analyses. This paper develops an input-output perspective on such \"dynamic phenotypes,\" emphasizing how qualitative features of transient behavior constrain underlying network architectures independently of detailed parameter values. A central theme is the role of sign structure and interconnection logic, particularly the contrast between monotone systems and architectures containing antagonistic pathways. We show how incoherent feedforward (IFF) motifs provide a simple and recurrent mechanism for generating non-monotonic and adaptive responses across multiple levels of biological organization, from molecular signaling to immune regulation and population dynamics. Conversely, monotonicity imposes sharp impossibility results that can be used to falsify entire classes of models from transient data alone. Beyond step inputs, we highlight how periodic forcing, ramps, and integral-type readouts such as cumulative dose responses offer powerful experimental probes that reveal otherwise hidden structure, separate competing motifs, and expose invariances such as fold-change detection. Throughout, we illustrate how control-theoretic concepts, including monotonicity, equivariance, and input-output analysis, can be used not as engineering metaphors, but as precise mathematical tools for biological model discrimination. Thus we argue for a shift in emphasis from asymptotic behavior to transient and input-driven dynamics as a primary lens for understanding, testing, and reverse-engineering biological networks."

    "abstract": "The interaction of vortical structures with boundaries has been extensively studied in Newtonian fluids, where conditions such as no slip walls, free surfaces, or contaminated surfaces dictate whether vortices rebound, dissipate, or generate secondary structures. In this work, we investigate a related but fundamentally different problem: the interaction of a vortex pair with a finite, non uniform layer of polymeric fluid. Numerical simulations employing the finitely extensible nonlinear elastic Peterlin model are used to examine the effects of polymer concentration, relaxation time, polymer layer thickness, and maximum polymer extension on the evolution of kinetic energy and enstrophy. The results show that, while the polymeric fluid dissipates vortical motion, vortex polymer layer interactions can also generate new coherent structures. In particular, the formation of secondary and tertiary vortices coincides with transient increases in kinetic energy, a behavior absent in the Newtonian case. Unlike classical vortex boundary interactions, where the primary vortex survives, we find that under certain conditions it completely dissipates upon interaction with the polymer layer. These findings emphasize that fluids with non-uniform polymer concentrations, act not only as dissipative agents but also as sources of vorticity, extending the traditional view of polymer induced drag reduction and providing new insight into vortex polymer interactions."

    "abstract": "Large language models are reshaping programming by enabling 'vibe coding': the development of softwares through natural-language interaction with model-driven toolchains. This article argues that vibe coding is best understood as interface flattening, a reconfiguration in which previously distinct modalities (GUI, CLI, and API) appear to converge into a single conversational surface, even as the underlying chain of translation from intention to machinic effect lengthens and thickens. Drawing on Friedrich Kittler's materialist media theory and Alexander Galloway's account of interfaces as sites of protocol control, the paper situates programming as a historically localised interface arrangement rather than an essential relation to computation. Through a materialist reconstruction of the contemporary vibe-coding stack, it shows how remote compute infrastructures, latency and connectivity, structured outputs, function/tool calling, and interoperability standards such as the Model Context Protocol relocate control and meaning-making power to model and protocol providers. The apparent democratisation of technical capability therefore depends on new dependencies and new literacies. By foregrounding the tension between experiential flattening and infrastructural thickening, I demonstrate how LLM-mediated development redistributes symbolic labour/power, obscures responsibility, and privatises competencies previously dispersed across programming communities, contributing a critical lens on the political economy of AI-mediated human-computer interaction."

    "abstract": "Multi-step LLM pipelines invoke large language models multiple times in a structured sequence and can effectively solve complex tasks, but their performance heavily depends on the prompts used at each step. Jointly optimizing these prompts is difficult due to missing step-level supervision and inter-step dependencies. Existing end-to-end prompt optimization methods struggle under these conditions and often yield suboptimal or unstable updates. We propose ADOPT, an Adaptive Dependency-aware Prompt Optimization framework for multi-step LLM pipelines. ADOPT explicitly models the dependency between each LLM step and the final task outcome, enabling precise text-gradient estimation analogous to computing analytical derivatives. It decouples textual gradient estimation from gradient updates, reducing multi-prompt optimization to flexible single-prompt optimization steps, and employs a Shapley-based mechanism to adaptively allocate optimization resources. Experiments on real-world datasets and diverse pipeline structures show that ADOPT is effective and robust, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art prompt optimization baselines."

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is now identifying promising galaxy candidates capable of producing sufficient ionizing photons to drive this transformation. However, the fraction of these photons that escape into intergalactic space--the escape fraction--remains highly uncertain. Stellar feedback is thought to play a critical role in carving low-density channels that allow ionizing radiation to escape, but the dominant mechanisms, their operation, and their connection to observable signatures are not well understood. Local analogs of high-redshift galaxies offer a powerful alternative for studying these processes, since ionizing radiation is unobservable at high redshift due to intergalactic absorption. However, current UV space-based instrumentation lacks the spatial resolution and sensitivity required to fully address this problem. The core challenge lies in the multiscale nature of LyC escape: ionizing photons are generated on scales of 1--100 pc in super star clusters but must traverse the circumgalactic medium which can extend beyond 100 kpc. The proposed Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) will provide a platform for future UV instruments capable of resolving these scales. In this article, we present a science case for understanding how LyC photons escape from star-forming galaxies and define the observational requirements for future instruments aboard HWO, including a UV integral field spectrograph (IFS)."

As systems expand to large one- and two-dimensional arrays, manual recalibration becomes impractical, creating a need for autonomous stabilization frameworks. Here, we introduce a method that uses the full network of charge-transition lines in repeatedly acquired double-quantum-dot charge stability diagrams (CSDs) as a multidimensional probe of the local electrostatic environment. By accurately tracking the motion of selected transitions in time, we detect voltage drifts, identify abrupt charge reconfigurations, and apply compensating updates to maintain stable operating conditions. We demonstrate our approach on a 10-QD device, showing robust stabilization and real-time diagnostic access to dot-specific noise processes. The high acquisition rate of radio-frequency reflectometry CSD measurements also enables time-domain noise spectroscopy, allowing the extraction of noise power spectral densities, the identification of two-level fluctuators, and the analysis of spatial noise correlations across the array. From our analysis, we find that the background noise at 100~$μ$\\si{\\hertz} is dominated by drift with a power law of $1/f^2$, accompanied by a few dominant two-level fluctuators and an average linear correlation length of $(188 \\pm 38)$~\\si{\\nano\\meter} in the device.

The approach formulates a quadratic program that minimizes distortion of the CAF surface subject to linear clutter-suppression constraints, eliminating the need for a separate cancellation stage. Monte Carlo simulations using common communication waveforms demonstrate strong clutter suppression, accurate CFAR calibration, and major detection-rate gains over the classical CAF. The results highlight a scalable, CAF-faithful method for adaptive clutter mitigation in passive radar."

Moreover, the electron energy spectrum exhibits a clear signature of the quantum coherence and sensitivity to the transition frequency of the emitter.

    "abstract": "Recently, studies exemplified by Hyper-Connections (HC) have extended the ubiquitous residual connection paradigm established over the past decade by expanding the residual stream width and diversifying connectivity patterns. While yielding substantial performance gains, this diversification fundamentally compromises the identity mapping property intrinsic to the residual connection, which causes severe training instability and restricted scalability, and additionally incurs notable memory access overhead. To address these challenges, we propose Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC), a general framework that projects the residual connection space of HC onto a specific manifold to restore the identity mapping property, while incorporating rigorous infrastructure optimization to ensure efficiency. Empirical experiments demonstrate that mHC is effective for training at scale, offering tangible performance improvements and superior scalability. We anticipate that mHC, as a flexible and practical extension of HC, will contribute to a deeper understanding of topological architecture design and suggest promising directions for the evolution of foundational models."

    "abstract": "Local markers provide an efficient and powerful characterization of topological features of many systems, especially when the translation symmetry is broken. Recently, a universal topological local marker applicable in different symmetry classes of topological systems is proposed. However, it suffers from irregular behaviors at the boundary and its connection to other topological indexes remains elusive. In this work, we construct regularized universal topological local markers that apply to Dirac systems by utilizing position operators that are compatible with periodic boundary conditions. The regularized local markers eliminate the obstructive boundary irregularities successfully, and give rise to the desired global topological invariants such as the Chern number consistently when integrated over all the lattice sites. Furthermore, the regularized form allows us to establish an explicit connection between the local markers and some other known topological indices in two dimensions. For instance, it turns out to be equivalent to the Bott index in classes A, D, and C, and equivalent to the spin Chern number in classes DIII and AII. We further examine the utility and stability of this new marker in disordered scenarios. We find that its variance shows peaks at the phase boundaries, which promotes it as a useful indicator for detecting disorder-induced topological phase transitions."

However, adapting SAM2 to MIS presents several challenges, including the need for extensive annotated medical data for fine-tuning and high-quality manual prompts, which are both labor-intensive and require intervention from medical experts. To address these challenges, we introduce OFL-SAM2, a prompt-free SAM2 framework for label-efficient MIS. Our core idea is to leverage limited annotated samples to train a lightweight mapping network that captures medical knowledge and transforms generic image features into target features, thereby providing additional discriminative target representations for each frame and eliminating the need for manual prompts. Crucially, the mapping network supports online parameter update during inference, enhancing the model's generalization across test sequences. Technically, we introduce two key components: (1) an online few-shot learner that trains the mapping network to generate target features using limited data, and (2) an adaptive fusion module that dynamically integrates the target features with the memory-attention features generated by frozen SAM2, leading to accurate and robust target representation. Extensive experiments on three diverse MIS datasets demonstrate that OFL-SAM2 achieves state-of-the-art performance with limited training data."

The templates can extract a variety of constraints by changing the number of days and the number of staff members to focus on and changing the extraction focus to patterns or frequency. In addition, unlike existing constraint extraction techniques, this study incorporates mechanisms to exclude exceptional constraints. The extracted constraints can be employed by a constraint programming solver to create care worker schedules. Experiments demonstrated that our proposed method successfully created schedules that satisfied all hard constraints and reduced the number of violations for soft constraints by circumventing the extraction of exceptional constraints."

The original formulation does not specify what 3-critical means, and two non-equivalent notions have appeared in the literature and in later discussions of the problem. In this paper we resolve the question under both interpretations. For the transversal interpretation (criticality with respect to the transversal number), we prove that a 3-uniform hypergraph $H$ with $τ(H)=3$ and $τ(H-e)=2$ for every edge $e$ has at most 10 edges; in particular, $δ(H)\\le 6$, and this bound is sharp, witnessed by the complete 3-graph $K^{(3)}_5$. For the chromatic interpretation (criticality with respect to weak vertex-colourings), we give an explicit 3-uniform hypergraph on 9 vertices with $χ(H)=3$ and minimum degree $δ(H)=7$ such that deleting any single edge or any single vertex makes it 2-colourable. The criticality of the example is certified by explicit witness 2-colourings listed in the appendices, together with a short verification script."

By leveraging the learned spatiotemporal probability distribution of the AOD field as a generative prior, this framework can be flexibly adapted to various reconstruction tasks without requiring task-specific retraining. We first introduce a corruption-aware training strategy to learns a spatiotemporal AOD prior solely from naturally incomplete data. Subsequently, we employ a decoupled annealing posterior sampling strategy that enables the more effective and integration of heterogeneous observations as constraints to guide the generation process. We validate the proposed framework through extensive experiments on Reanalysis data. Results across downscaling and inpainting tasks confirm the efficacy and robustness of AODDiff, specifically demonstrating its advantage in maintaining high spatial spectral fidelity. Furthermore, as a generative model, AODDiff inherently enables uncertainty quantification via multiple sampling, offering critical confidence metrics for downstream applications."

Contemporary trackers in this domain rely on the motion of objects rather than appearance for association. Nevertheless, they struggle to maintain object identities when targets undergo frequent and strong occlusions. The high similarity of object appearances makes integrating appearance-based association nontrivial for agricultural scenarios. To solve this problem we propose CropTrack, a novel MOT framework based on the combination of appearance and motion information. CropTrack integrates a reranking-enhanced appearance association, a one-to-many association with appearance-based conflict resolution strategy, and an exponential moving average prototype feature bank to improve appearance-based association. Evaluated on publicly available agricultural MOT datasets, CropTrack demonstrates consistent identity preservation, outperforming traditional motion-based tracking methods. Compared to the state of the art, CropTrack achieves significant gains in identification F1 and association accuracy scores with a lower number of identity switches."

The position of the event horizon $r_h$ and the critical impact parameter $b_m$ are then probed to gauge the extent of influence magnetic charge $g$ and halo parameters $α$, $β$ have on them. A recurring outcome of our analysis with respect to different BH observables is the nullification of competing effects of charge and halo parameters, leading to observables obtaining values equal to those for a Schwarzschild BH. This is also observed for $r_h$ and $b_m$. We delve into unraveling the impact of NED and DM combined on the strong gravitational lensing (GL) and its related observables, such as the angular separation, relative magnification, and the angular position of the inner, closely packed bright ring. Interestingly, we find combinations of charge and halo parameters that leave the deflection angle unchanged from the Schwarzschild case, thereby leading to a situation where an MHDM BH and a Schwarzschild BH become indistinguishable. Similar results are also observed for lensing observables. Finally, utilizing observations related to the angular diameter of super-massive BHs (SMBHs) $M87^*$ and $SgrA^*$ and employing the $χ^2$ test, we extract bounds on $g$, $α$, and $β$ signifying the viability of our BH model as an SMBH."

The expectation has been extensively verified in the maximally broken phase $G\\to U(1)^r$. Here we address the non-Abelian regime in which $H$ contains a semisimple factor $H^{s}$. Using the stratified description of monopole moduli space, we give a general proof of this matching for any simple gauge group $G$.

We construct non-Abelian magnetic gauge transformation operators implementing the $(H^{\\vee})^{s}$-action on the monopole Hilbert space, which commute with the electric $H^{s}$-transformations and thereby realize the $H^{s}\\times (H^{\\vee})^{s}$ symmetry at the level of monopole quantum mechanics."

Prior solutions rely on offline domain adaptation, which is post-hoc, data-intensive, and slow. We introduce the first test-time adaptation (TTA) framework for generative SLMs that process interleaved audio-text prompts. Our method updates a small, targeted subset of parameters during inference using only the incoming utterance, requiring no source data or labels. This stabilizes token distributions and improves robustness to acoustic variability without degrading core task accuracy. Evaluated on automatic speech recognition, speech translation, and 19 audio understanding tasks from AIR-Bench, our approach yields consistent gains under diverse corruptions. Because adaptation touches only a small fraction of weights, it is both compute- and memory-efficient, supporting deployment on resource-constrained platforms. This work enhances the robustness and adaptability of generative SLMs for real-world speech-driven applications."

To address this issue, we introduce BIOME-Bench, constructed via a rigorous four-stage workflow, to evaluate two core capabilities of LLMs in multi-omics analysis: Biomolecular Interaction Inference and end-to-end Multi-Omics Pathway Mechanism Elucidation.

Theoretical waveform predictions, however, remain uncertain, motivating robust searches that avoid specific echo modeling. We present a model-independent search framework targeting long-lived quasinormal modes (QNMs) expected from strong interior reflection. By employing a generalized phase-marginalized likelihood that coherently combines data for each QNM across a detector network, our method enhances sensitivity to the signals. To handle real detector noise, we implement an optimized notching procedure to suppress instrumental spectral lines and refine the Bayesian parameter settings. We validate the performance of this framework using injection studies on O1 background data, demonstrating reliable signal recovery in realistic noise conditions. We then apply this method to three binary black hole merger events with high ringdown signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) from observing runs O1 to O4: GW150914, GW231226, and the recently detected GW250114. No statistically significant evidence for postmerger echoes is found. Consequently, we derive 90% upper limits on the network SNR and the average amplitude of the long-lived QNMs, setting the first model-independent constraints on late-time echo signatures from LVK data."

We demonstrate that the non-perturbative treatment is essential, at least at lowest order, in the SU(3) sector of $KN$ scattering. Our NLO study achieves a good description of the empirical $s$-wave phase shifts in the isospin $I=1$ channel. An analysis of the effective range expansion yields a negative effective range, consistent with some partial wave analyses but opposite in sign to earlier phenomenological summaries. For the $I=0$ counterpart, the $KN$ interaction is found to be rather weak and exhibits large uncertainties. Further low-energy $KN$ scattering experiments and lattice QCD simulations are needed to better constrain both $s$-wave channels."

    "abstract": "Federated recommendations (FRs) provide personalized services while preserving user privacy by keeping user data on local clients, which has attracted significant attention in recent years. However, due to the strict privacy constraints inherent in FRs, access to user-item interaction data and user profiles across clients is highly restricted, making it difficult to learn globally effective representations for new (cold-start) items. Consequently, the item cold-start problem becomes even more challenging in FRs. Existing solutions typically predict embeddings for new items through the attribute-to-embedding mapping paradigm, which establishes a fixed one-to-one correspondence between item attributes and their embeddings. However, this one-to-one mapping paradigm often fails to model varying data distributions and tends to cause embedding misalignment, as verified by our empirical studies. To this end, we propose MDiffFR, a novel generation-based modality-guided diffusion method for cold-start items in FRs. In this framework, we employ a tailored diffusion model on the server to generate embeddings for new items, which are then distributed to clients for cold-start inference. To align item semantics, we deploy a pre-trained modality encoder to extract modality features as conditional signals to guide the reverse denoising process. Furthermore, our theoretical analysis verifies that the proposed method achieves stronger privacy guarantees compared to existing mapping-based approaches. Extensive experiments on four real datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms all baselines in FRs."

    "abstract": "Reasoning Segmentation requires models to interpret complex, context-dependent linguistic queries to achieve pixel-level localization. Current dominant approaches rely heavily on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, SFT suffers from catastrophic forgetting and domain dependency, while RL is often hindered by training instability and rigid reliance on predefined reward functions. Although recent training-free methods circumvent these training burdens, they are fundamentally limited by a static inference paradigm. These methods typically rely on a single-pass \"generate-then-segment\" chain, which suffers from insufficient reasoning depth and lacks the capability to self-correct linguistic hallucinations or spatial misinterpretations. In this paper, we challenge these limitations and propose EVOL-SAM3, a novel zero-shot framework that reformulates reasoning segmentation as an inference-time evolutionary search process. Instead of relying on a fixed prompt, EVOL-SAM3 maintains a population of prompt hypotheses and iteratively refines them through a \"Generate-Evaluate-Evolve\" loop. We introduce a Visual Arena to assess prompt fitness via reference-free pairwise tournaments, and a Semantic Mutation operator to inject diversity and correct semantic errors. Furthermore, a Heterogeneous Arena module integrates geometric priors with semantic reasoning to ensure robust final selection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EVOL-SAM3 not only substantially outperforms static baselines but also significantly surpasses fully supervised state-of-the-art methods on the challenging ReasonSeg benchmark in a zero-shot setting.

    "abstract": "Despite the recent progresses, particularly in developing Language Models, there are fundamental challenges and unanswered questions about how such models can continually learn/memorize, self-improve, and find effective solutions. In this paper, we present a new learning paradigm, called Nested Learning (NL), that coherently represents a machine learning model with a set of nested, multi-level, and/or parallel optimization problems, each of which with its own context flow. Through the lenses of NL, existing deep learning methods learns from data through compressing their own context flow, and in-context learning naturally emerges in large models. NL suggests a philosophy to design more expressive learning algorithms with more levels, resulting in higher-order in-context learning and potentially unlocking effective continual learning capabilities. We advocate for NL by presenting three core contributions: (1) Expressive Optimizers: We show that known gradient-based optimizers, such as Adam, SGD with Momentum, etc., are in fact associative memory modules that aim to compress the gradients' information (by gradient descent). Building on this insight, we present other more expressive optimizers with deep memory and/or more powerful learning rules; (2) Self-Modifying Learning Module: Taking advantage of NL's insights on learning algorithms, we present a sequence model that learns how to modify itself by learning its own update algorithm; and (3) Continuum Memory System: We present a new formulation for memory system that generalizes the traditional viewpoint of long/short-term memory. Combining our self-modifying sequence model with the continuum memory system, we present a continual learning module, called Hope, showing promising results in language modeling, knowledge incorporation, and few-shot generalization tasks, continual learning, and long-context reasoning tasks."

    "abstract": "Visual word sense disambiguation focuses on polysemous words, where candidate images can be easily confused. Traditional methods use classical probability to calculate the likelihood of an image matching each gloss of the target word, summing these to form a posterior probability. However, due to the challenge of semantic uncertainty, glosses from different sources inevitably carry semantic biases, which can lead to biased disambiguation results. Inspired by quantum superposition in modeling uncertainty, this paper proposes a Quantum Inference Model for Unsupervised Visual Word Sense Disambiguation (Q-VWSD). It encodes multiple glosses of the target word into a superposition state to mitigate semantic biases. Then, the quantum circuit is executed, and the results are observed. By formalizing our method, we find that Q-VWSD is a quantum generalization of the method based on classical probability. Building on this, we further designed a heuristic version of Q-VWSD that can run more efficiently on classical computing. The experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art classical methods, particularly by effectively leveraging non-specialized glosses from large language models, which further enhances performance. Our approach showcases the potential of quantum machine learning in practical applications and provides a case for leveraging quantum modeling advantages on classical computers while quantum hardware remains immature."

We first develop a novel sigma point-based approximation approach to fast and accurately estimate mutual information reward under non-Gaussian belief distributions, utilizing informative sampling in state and observation spaces to mitigate the computational intractability of integral calculation. To tackle significant uncertainty associated with inadequate prior target information, we propose the hierarchical particle structure in ReSPIRe, which not only extracts critical particles for global route guidance, but also adjusts the particle number adaptively for planning efficiency. Building upon the hierarchical structure, we develop the reusable belief tree search approach to build a policy tree for online trajectory planning under uncertainty, which reuses rollout evaluation to improve planning efficiency. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that ReSPIRe outperforms representative benchmark methods with smaller MI approximation error, higher search efficiency, and more stable tracking performance, while maintaining outstanding computational efficiency."

    "abstract": "Contextual bandits are a central framework for sequential decision-making, with applications ranging from recommendation systems to clinical trials. While nonparametric methods can flexibly model complex reward structures, they suffer from the curse of dimensionality. We address this challenge using a single-index model, which projects high-dimensional covariates onto a one-dimensional subspace while preserving nonparametric flexibility. We first develop a nonasymptotic theory for offline single-index regression for each arm, combining maximum rank correlation for index estimation with local polynomial regression. Building on this foundation, we propose a single-index bandit algorithm and establish its convergence rate. We further derive a matching lower bound, showing that the algorithm achieves minimax-optimal regret independent of the ambient dimension $d$, thereby overcoming the curse of dimensionality. We also establish an impossibility result for adaptation: without additional assumptions, no policy can adapt to unknown smoothness levels. Under a standard self-similarity condition, however, we construct a policy that remains minimax-optimal while automatically adapting to the unknown smoothness. Finally, as the dimension $d$ increases, our algorithm continues to achieve minimax-optimal regret, revealing a phase transition that characterizes the fundamental limits of single-index bandit learning."

Using exterior calculus, we extend this framework to the full family of convection-diffusion problems posed on $H(\\textbf{grad})$, $H(\\textbf{curl})$, and $H(\\text{div})$. The resulting formulation is based on a 4D Hodge-Laplacian operator with a spatiotemporal diffusion tensor and convection field, augmented by a small temporal perturbation to ensure nondegeneracy. This formulation naturally incorporates fundamental physical constraints, including divergence-free and curl-free conditions. We further introduce an exponentially-fitted 4D spatiotemporal flux operator that symmetrizes the convection-diffusion operator and enables a well-posed variational formulation. Finally, we prove that the temporally-perturbed formulation converges to the original time-dependent convection-diffusion model as the perturbation parameter tends to zero."

    "source": "arXiv",
    "abstract": "Single-walled carbon nanotubes are one-dimensional $sp^2$ carbon materials whose electronic and optical properties are governed by their chirality. Catalytic chemical vapor deposition often uses transition-metal nanoparticles that liquefy at elevated temperature, and vapor-liquid-solid growth is commonly associated with broad chirality distributions. Improved selectivity has been reported for high-melting-point catalysts that remain solid, suggesting vapor-solid-solid growth, but the underlying kinetics and interface structure remain poorly resolved. The mechanisms that control carbon delivery and determine edge structure on solid catalysts are therefore unclear. Here it is shown, using microsecond-scale molecular dynamics driven by a neuroevolution machine-learning interatomic potential, that rhenium nanoparticles remain solid above 1123.15 K and that surface carbon at 5.0 to 6.0 nm$^{-2}$ does not appreciably depress melting. Carbon transport is dominated by facet-dependent surface diffusion, bounding sustainable supply on a 2.0 nm particle to $\\sim 44$ carbon atoms per $μ$s on the slow $(10\\bar{1}1)$ facet. Consistently, growth at 50 carbon atoms per $μ$s occurs only within a narrow window: multiple nucleation or encapsulation is promoted at 1300 K, tubular elongation is obtained at 1400 K, and low-curvature graphitic structures dominate at 1500 K and above. Non-hexagonal rings persist over 12 $μ$s, while zigzag-rich, strongly Klein-decorated edges are stabilized and deviate from configurational-entropy expectations for liquid catalysts. These results place catalyst reconstruction by surface carbon adsorption, facet-controlled diffusion, and crystalline interfacial thermodynamics at the center of vapor-solid-solid growth control, motivating experimental tuning of temperature and feedstock partial pressure to balance diffusion-limited supply against encapsulation pathways."

The visuomotor policy must correctly extract the appropriate types and levels of information from the history to identify the current task phase. However, naively extending the history window is computationally expensive and may cause severe overfitting. Inspired by the continuous nature of human reasoning and the recoding of working memory, we introduce PAM, a novel visuomotor Policy equipped with Adaptive working Memory. With minimal additional training cost in a two-stage manner, PAM supports a 300-frame history window while maintaining high inference speed. Specifically, a hierarchical frame feature extractor yields two distinct representations for motion primitives and temporal disambiguation. For compact representation, a context router with range-specific queries is employed to produce compact context features across multiple history lengths. And an auxiliary objective of reconstructing historical information is introduced to ensure that the context router acts as an effective bottleneck. We meticulously design 7 tasks and verify that PAM can handle multiple scenarios of state ambiguity simultaneously. With a history window of approximately 10 seconds, PAM still supports stable training and maintains inference speeds above 20Hz. Project website: https://tinda24.github.io/pam/"

Informed by ten formative interviews, the system was evaluated in a mixed method study across three conditions: deeper reflection, regular reflection, and a control condition with unstructured reflection. Participants in the control condition demonstrated less deliberate thought and weaker collaboration, which led to stress and misalignment during team meetings. In contrast, structured reflection supported greater organization and steadier progress. The deeper reflection condition further facilitated confidence, teamwork, and idea generation, although it imposed a higher cognitive load. We conclude by discussing design implications for AI agents that facilitate reflection to enhance collaboration and broader considerations for AI assisted systems aimed at sustaining collaborative goals."

We present a reinforcement learning-augmented LLM agent framework that formulates cooperation as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP) and adopts centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE). We introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to jointly optimize agent policies with access to global signals during training, together with a simplified joint reward that balances task quality, speed, and coordination cost. On collaborative writing and coding benchmarks, our framework delivers a 3x increase in task processing speed over single-agent baselines, 98.7% structural/style consistency in writing, and a 74.6% test pass rate in coding. The approach consistently outperforms strong multi-agent LLM baselines and provides a practical path toward reliable collaboration in complex workflows."

    "abstract": "Motivated by the notion of intermediate dimensions introduced by Falconer et al., we introduce a continuum of topological entropies that are intermediate between the (Bowen) topological entropy and the lower and upper capacity topological entropies. This is achieved by restricting the families of allowable covers in the definition of topological entropy by requiring that the lengths of all strings used in a particular cover satisfy \\( N \\le n < N/θ+ 1 \\), where \\( θ\\in [0,1] \\) is a parameter. When \\( θ= 1 \\), only covers using strings of the same length are allowed, and we recover the lower and upper capacity topological entropies; when \\( θ= 0 \\), there are no restrictions, and the definition coincides with the topological entropy. We first establish a quantitative inequality for the upper and lower intermediate topological entropies, which mirrors the corresponding result for intermediate dimensions. As a consequence, the intermediate topological entropies are continuous on $(0,1]$, though discontinuity may arise at $0$; an illustrative example is provided to demonstrate this phenomenon. We then investigate several fundamental properties of the intermediate topological entropies for nonautonomous dynamical systems, including the power rule, monotonicity and product formulas. Finally, we derive an inequality relating intermediate entropies with respect to factor maps."

    "abstract": "Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is widely used as a feature extraction technique for matrices with non-negative entries, such as image data, purchase histories, and other types of count data. In NMF, a non-negative matrix is decomposed into the product of two non-negative matrices, and the approximation accuracy is evaluated by a loss function. If the Kullback-Leibler divergence is chosen as the loss function, the estimation coincides with maximum likelihood under the assumption that the data entries are distributed according to a Poisson distribution. To address overdispersion, negative binomial matrix factorization has recently been proposed as an extension of the Poisson-based model. However, the negative binomial distribution often generates an excessive number of zeros, which limits its expressive capacity. In this study, we propose a non-negative matrix factorization based on the generalized Poisson distribution, which can flexibly accommodate overdispersion, and we introduce a maximum likelihood approach for parameter estimation. This methodology provides a more versatile framework than existing models, thereby extending the applicability of NMF to a broader class of count data."

    "abstract": "Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has achieved remarkable success in fine-tuning pre-trained vision transformers for various downstream tasks. Existing studies mainly focus on exploring more parameter-efficient strategies or more effective representation learning schemes. However, these methods either sacrifice fine-tuning performance or introduce excessive trainable parameters, failing to strike a balance between learning performance and parameter efficiency. To address this problem, we propose a novel tuning method named collaborative low-rank adaptation (CLoRA) in this paper. CLoRA consists of base-space sharing and sample-agnostic diversity enhancement (SADE) components. To maintain parameter efficiency while expanding the learning capacity of low-rank modules (LRMs), base-space sharing allows all LRMs to share a set of down/up-projection spaces. In CLoRA, the low-rank matrices obtained from the shared spaces collaboratively construct each LRM. Since the representations extracted by these matrices may contain redundant information, SADE is employed to regularize the similarities among them to encourage diverse representations in the training process. We conduct extensive experiments on widely used image and point cloud datasets to evaluate the performance of CLoRA. Experimental results demonstrate that CLoRA strikes a better balance between learning performance and parameter efficiency, while requiring the fewest GFLOPs for point cloud analysis, compared with the state-of-the-art methods."

    "abstract": "This paper addresses a fundamental physical layer conflict in hybrid Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) between high-throughput primary communication and the stringent power envelope requirements of passive backscatter sensors. We propose a Backscatter-Constrained Transmit Antenna Selection (BC-TAS) framework, a per-subcarrier selection strategy for multi-antenna illuminators operating within a Multi-Dimensional Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (MD-OFDM) architecture. Unlike conventional signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) centric selection schemes, BC-TAS employs a multi-objective cost function that jointly maximizes desired link reliability, stabilizes the incident RF energy envelope at passive Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) sensors, and suppresses interference toward coexisting victim receivers. By exploiting the inherent sparsity of MD-OFDM, the proposed framework enables dual-envelope regulation, simultaneously reducing the transmitter Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) and the Backscatter Crest Factor (BCF) observed at the tag. To enhance robustness under imperfect Channel State Information (CSI), a Kalman-based channel smoothing mechanism is incorporated to maintain selection stability in low-SNR regimes. Numerical results using IEEE 802.11be dispersive channel models and a nonlinear Rapp power amplifier demonstrate that BC-TAS achieves orders-of-magnitude improvement in outage probability and significant gains in energy efficiency compared to conventional MU-MIMO baselines, while ensuring spectral mask compliance under reduced power amplifier back-off. These results establish BC-TAS as an effective illuminator-side control mechanism for enabling reliable and energy-stable sensing and communication coexistence in dense, power-constrained wireless environments."

Security Operations Center (SOC) analysts are tasked with monitoring and analyzing this vast data to identify potential threats and take preventive actions to protect enterprise assets. However, the diversity among SIEM platforms, such as Palo Alto Networks Qradar, Google SecOps, Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel and the Elastic Stack, poses significant challenges. As these systems differ in attributes, architecture, and query languages, making it difficult for analysts to effectively monitor multiple platforms without undergoing extensive training or forcing enterprises to expand their workforce. To address this issue, we introduce SynRAG, a unified framework that automatically generates threat detection or incident investigation queries for multiple SIEM platforms from a platform-agnostic specification. SynRAG can generate platformspecific queries from a single high-level specification written by analysts. Without SynRAG, analysts would need to manually write separate queries for each SIEM platform, since query languages vary significantly across systems. This framework enables seamless threat detection and incident investigation across heterogeneous SIEM environments, reducing the need for specialized training and manual query translation. We evaluate SynRAG against state-of-the-art language models, including GPT, Llama, DeepSeek, Gemma, and Claude, using Qradar and SecOps as representative SIEM systems. Our results demonstrate that SynRAG generates significantly better queries for crossSIEM threat detection and incident investigation compared to the state-of-the-art base models."

    "abstract": "GRB 161117A is a long-duration GRB with three main overlapping peaks. By analyzing the time-resolved spectra of its data observed with the Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on board the Fermi mission, we find that the spectral evolution shows a transition from thermal (single BB) to hybrid (PL$+$BB), and finally to non-thermal (Band and CPL) emissions. Such a transition suggests that the jet composition of GRB 161117A should be changed from a fireball to a Poynting-flux-dominated jet. The bulk Lorentz factor ($Γ_{\\rm ph}$), radii ($R_{\\rm ph}$ and $R_{0}$), magnetization factor at the central engine ($σ_0$), and dimensionless entropy ($η$) of the outflow can be inferred by invoking the observed quasi-thermal component within two models (e.g., pure fireball and hybrid). It is found that $Γ_{\\rm ph}$ seems to be tracking with the light curve, and $R_{0}$ remains a constant at $\\sim$ $10^{8}$ cm. The low magnetization ($1+σ_0 \\sim$ 1) and high dimensionless entropy ($η\\gg$ 1) during the first seven time-intervals suggest to be a pure fireball outflow. Moreover, we also estimate the lower limit of magnetization parameter at the photosphere radius ($σ_{\\rm ph}\\sim 1.4$ and 0.75) for late phase via the non-thermal spectra, and it indicates that the particle acceleration mechanism is dominated by internal shocks rather than magnetic dissipation processes. Finally, the $ν\\barν$ annihilation mechanism of NDAF model to explain the thermal emission of GRB 161117A is also discussed."

For the two-dimensional transverse-field Ising model at criticality, we obtain accurate ground-state energies for lattices up to 80 $\\times$ 80 (6400 spins) using a custom multi-FPGA cluster. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-sampling algorithm to train deep Boltzmann machines, replacing intractable marginalization with conditional sampling over auxiliary layers. This enables the training of sparse deep models and improves parameter efficiency relative to shallow networks. Using this algorithm, we train deep Boltzmann machines for a system with 35 $\\times$ 35 (1225 spins). Together, these results demonstrate that probabilistic hardware can overcome the sampling bottleneck in variational simulation of quantum many-body systems, opening a path to larger system sizes and deeper variational architectures."

This study presents a systematic audit of three state of the art models (GPT-5.1, Gemini 3 Pro, and Claude 4.5 Opus) using HausaSafety, a novel adversarial dataset grounded in West African threat scenarios (e.g., Yahoo-Yahoo fraud, Dane gun manufacturing). Employing a 2 x 4 factorial design across 1,440 evaluations, we tested the non-linear interaction between language (English vs. Hausa) and temporal framing. Our results challenge the prevailing multilingual safety gap narrative. Instead of a simple degradation in low-resource settings, we identified a mechanism of Complex Interference where safety is determined by the intersection of variables. While models exhibited a Reverse Linguistic with Claude 4.5 Opus proving significantly safer in Hausa (45.0%) than in English (36.7%) due to uncertainty-driven refusal they suffered catastrophic failures in temporal reasoning. We report a profound Temporal Asymmetry, where past-tense framing bypassed defenses (15.6% safe) while future-tense scenarios triggered hyper-conservative refusals (57.2% safe). The magnitude of this volatility is illustrated by a 9.2x disparity between the safest and most vulnerable configurations, proving that safety is not a fixed property but a context-dependent state. We conclude that current models rely on superficial heuristics rather than robust semantic understanding, creating Safety Pockets that leave Global South users exposed to localized harms.

A worldline action is an effective theory, and as such the tree-level matching needs to be corrected by loop effects, including UV counter terms, renormalization, and higher-order matching to general relativity. However, we anticipate that many features of the Wilson coefficients of the proposed tree-level action will remain unchanged even after a loop-level matching. While the worldline action is given in closed form, it contains an infinite number of quadratic-in-Riemann operators $R^2$, even for the same-helicity sector. We argue that in the same-helicity sector the $R^2$ operators have no intrinsic meaning, as they merely remove unwanted terms produced by the linear-in-Riemann operators, which are well-established in the literature. The opposite-helicity sector is somewhat more complicated, it contains both $R^2$ operators that removes unwanted terms, and $R^2$ operators that add new needed terms to the Compton amplitude. We discuss and classify all independent $R^2$ operators that can feature in the worldline action."

We propose Multi-envelope DBF (MDBF), which retains a shared pair of 1-bit sign bases but replaces the single envelope with a rank-$l$ envelope. By sharing sign matrices among envelope components, MDBF effectively maintains a binary carrier and utilizes the limited memory budget for magnitude expressiveness. We also introduce a closed-form initialization and an alternating refinement method to optimize MDBF. Across the LLaMA and Qwen families, MDBF enhances perplexity and zero-shot accuracy over previous binary formats at matched bits per weight while preserving the same deployment-friendly inference primitive."

We find that if seafloor weathering has a stronger feedback than continental weathering and accounts for a large portion of global silicate weathering, then the remaining lifespan of the terrestrial biosphere can be shortened, but a lifespan of more than 1 billion yr (Gyr) remains likely. Similarly, stochastic fluctuations in outgassing rates can have a significant impact if the size of the fluctuations exceed those observed over the last 1 billion yr. The impact of weak seafloor weathering and lower variability stochasticity are minor. Our work provisionally supports a lengthened lifespan of Earth's terrestrial biosphere, suggests robustness of this lengthened lifespan to planetary parameters that may vary among exoplanets, and identifies seafloor weathering as a key process that requires further study and constraint."

    "abstract": "The Kadar--Yu algebras are a physically motivated sequence of towers of algebras interpolating between the Brauer algebras and Temperley--Lieb algebras. The complex representation theory of the Brauer and Temperley--Lieb algebras is now fairly well understood, with each connecting in a different way to Kazhdan--Lusztig theory. The semisimple representation theory of the KY algebras is also understood, and thus interpolates, for example, between the double-factorial and Catalan combinatorial realms. However the non-semisimple representation theory has remained largely open, being harder overall than the (already challenging) Brauer case. In this paper we determine generalised Chebyshev-like forms for the determinants of gram matrices of contravariant forms for standard modules. This generalises the root-of-unity paradigm for Temperley--Lieb algebras (and many related algebras); interpolating in various ways between this and the `integral paradigm' for Brauer algebras. The standard module gram determinants give a huge amount of information about morphisms between standard modules, making thorough use of the powerful homological machinery of towers of recollement (ToR), with appropriate gram determinants providing the ToR `bootstrap'. As for the Brauer and TL cases the representation theory has a strongly alcove-geometric flavour, but the KY cases guide an intriguing generalisation of the overall geometric framework."

Existing deep learning methods perform well in low-dimensional or linear RTEs, but still face many challenges with high-dimensional or nonlinear RTEs. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Basis Function Asymptotically Preserving Neural Network (BF-APNN), a framework that inherits the advantages of Radiative Transfer Asymptotically Preserving Neural Network (RT-APNN) and accelerates the solution process. By employing basis function expansion on the microscopic component, derived from micro-macro decomposition, BF-APNN effectively mitigates the computational burden associated with evaluating high-dimensional integrals during training. Numerical experiments, which involve challenging RTE scenarios featuring, nonlinearity, discontinuities, and multiscale behavior, demonstrate that BF-APNN substantially reduces training time compared to RT-APNN while preserving high solution accuracy. Moreover, BF-APNN exhibits superior performance in addressing complex, high-dimensional RTE problems, underscoring its potential as a robust tool for radiative transfer computations."

    "abstract": "Spatial reasoning in large language models (LLMs) has gained increasing attention due to applications in navigation and planning. Despite strong general language capabilities, LLMs still struggle with spatial transformations and multi-step planning in structured environments. We propose a two-stage approach that decomposes spatial reasoning into atomic building blocks and their composition. First, we apply supervised fine-tuning on elementary spatial transformations, such as rotation, translation, and scaling, to equip the model with basic spatial physics. We then freeze this physics-aware model and train lightweight LoRA adapters within the GRPO framework to learn policies that compose these building blocks for multi-step planning in puzzle-based environments, in a closed-loop manner. To support this pipeline, we synthesize an ASCII-art dataset and construct a corresponding ASCII-based reinforcement learning environment. Our method consistently outperforms baselines, including the generic backbone, physics-aware model, and end-to-end RL models, under both Dynamic environments with explicit state updates and Static environments where the model must rely on its internal state across steps. In addition, the proposed approach converges faster and exhibits more stable training compared to end-to-end reinforcement learning from scratch. Finally, we analyze attention patterns to assess whether fine-tuning induces meaningful improvements in spatial understanding."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates how Large Language Models (LLMs) from leading providers (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, DeepSeek, and xAI) can be applied to quantitative sector-based portfolio construction. We use LLMs to identify investable universes of stocks within S&P 500 sector indices and evaluate how their selections perform when combined with classical portfolio optimization methods. Each model was prompted to select and weight 20 stocks per sector, and the resulting portfolios were compared with their respective sector indices across two distinct out-of-sample periods: a stable market phase (January-March 2025) and a volatile phase (April-June 2025). Our results reveal a strong temporal dependence in LLM portfolio performance. During stable market conditions, LLM-weighted portfolios frequently outperformed sector indices on both cumulative return and risk-adjusted (Sharpe ratio) measures. However, during the volatile period, many LLM portfolios underperformed, suggesting that current models may struggle to adapt to regime shifts or high-volatility environments underrepresented in their training data. Importantly, when LLM-based stock selection is combined with traditional optimization techniques, portfolio outcomes improve in both performance and consistency. This study contributes one of the first multi-model, cross-provider evaluations of generative AI algorithms in investment management. It highlights that while LLMs can effectively complement quantitative finance by enhancing stock selection and interpretability, their reliability remains market-dependent. The findings underscore the potential of hybrid AI-quantitative frameworks, integrating LLM reasoning with established optimization techniques, to produce more robust and adaptive investment strategies."

    "abstract": "Index structures are fundamental for efficient query processing on large-scale datasets. Learned indexes model the indexing process as a prediction problem to overcome the inherent trade-offs of traditional indexes. However, most existing learned indexes optimize only for limited objectives like query latency or space usage, neglecting other practical evaluation dimensions such as update efficiency and stability. Moreover, many learned indexes rely on assumptions about data distributions or workloads, lacking theoretical guarantees when facing unknown or evolving scenarios, which limits their generality in real-world systems. In this paper, we propose LMIndex, a robust framework for learned indexing that leverages a efficient query/update top-layer structure (theoretically $O(1)$ when the key type is fixed) and a efficient optimal error threshold training algorithm (approach $O(1)$ in practice). Building upon this, we develop LMG (LMIndex with gaps), a variant employing a novel gap allocation strategy to enhance update performance and maintain stability under dynamic workloads. Extensive evaluations show that LMG achieves competitive or leading performance, including bulk loading (up to 8.25$\\times$ faster), point queries (up to 1.49$\\times$ faster), range queries (up to 4.02$\\times$ faster than B+Tree), update (up to 1.5$\\times$ faster on read-write workloads), stability (up to 82.59$\\times$ lower coefficient of variation), and space usage (up to 1.38$\\times$ smaller). These results demonstrate that LMG effectively breaks the multi-dimensional performance trade-offs inherent in state-of-the-art approaches, offering a balanced and versatile framework."

Moreover, the eigenfunctions admit an expansion with universal coefficients so that the dependence on the twist $a$ is hidden only in these ground state eigenfunctions, and we suggest a general formula that allows one to construct these eigenfunctions from non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials. This gives a new twist in theory of integrable systems, which usually puts an accent on symmetric polynomials, and provides a new dimension to the {\\it triad} made from the symmetric Macdonald polynomials, untwisted Baker-Akhiezer functions and Noumi-Shiraishi series."

This has fueled the use of quantum computers for generative modeling to create samples following the probability distribution underlying a given dataset. In particular, the potential to build generative models on classically hard distributions would immediately preclude classical simulability, due to theoretical separations. In this work, we study quantum generative models from the perspective of output distributions, showing that models that anticoncentrate are not trainable on average, including those exhibiting quantum advantage. In contrast, models outputting data from sparse distributions can be trained. We consider special cases to enhance trainability, and observe that this opens the path for classical algorithms for surrogate sampling. This observed trade-off is linked to verification of quantum processes. We conclude that quantum advantage can still be found in generative models, although its source must be distinct from anticoncentration."

Since then, the global classical solutions for arbitrary large initial data of the multi-dimensional viscous Saint-Venant system have remained a well-known open problem. It was only recently that [Huang-Meng-Zhang, http:arXiv:2512.15029, 2025], under the assumption of radial symmetry, first proved the existence of global classical solutions for arbitrary large initial data to the initial-boundary value problem of the two-dimensional viscous shallow water equations. At the same time, [Chen-Zhang-Zhu, http:arXiv:2512.18545, 2025] also independently proved the existence of global large solutions to the Cauchy problem of this system. Notably, in the work of Huang-Meng-Zhang, they also established the existence of global classical solutions for arbitrary large initial data to the isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations satisfying the BD entropy equality in both two and three dimensions, and the viscous shallow water equations are precisely a specific class of isentropic compressible fluids subject to the BD entropy equality. In this paper, we prove a new BD entropy inequality for a class of non-isentropic compressible fluids, which can be regarded as a generalization of the shallow water equations with transported entropy. Employing new estimates on the lower bound of density different from that of Huang-Meng-Zhang's work, we show the \"viscous shallow water system with transport entropy\" will admit global classical solutions for arbitrary large initial data to the spherically symmetric initial-boundary value problem in both two and three dimensions. Our results also relax the restrictions on the dimension and adiabatic index imposed in Huang-Meng-Zhang's work on the shallow water equations, extending the range from $N=2,\\ γ\\ge \\frac{3}{2}$ to $N=2,\\ γ> 1$ and $N=3,\\ 1<γ<3$."

The first part focuses on novel algebraic and geometric approaches to the classification problem of coboundary Lie bialgebras up to Lie algebra automorphisms. More specifically, Grassmann, graded algebra and algebraic invariant techniques are discussed. Using these algebraic methods, equivalence classes of r-matrices for three-dimensional coboundary Lie bialgebras are studied. Moreover, particular higher-dimensional cases, e.g. $\\mathfrak{so}(2,2)$ and $\\mathfrak{so}(3,2)$, are partially analysed. From the geometric perspective, the main role is played by the newly introduced notion: the Darboux family. This powerful tool allows an efficient and thorough study of equivalence classes of r-matrices for four-dimensional indecomposable coboundary Lie bialgebras. In order to showcase its ability to tackle decomposable examples, $\\mathfrak{gl}_2$ is additionally studied. The second part of the Thesis sketches interesting directions for applications of r-matrices. Firstly, it is illustrated how r-matrices might be useful to describe foliated Lie-Hamilton systems. Secondly, the role of r-matrices in deformations of certain cases of Lie systems is discussed. In particular, based on the general procedure for deformations of Lie-Hamilton systems, its extension to Jacobi-Lie systems is suggested and supported by the detailed computation of the deformed Schwarz equation."

The training of the latter module and evaluation for each module utilize a light curve dataset of 7413 spectroscopically classified transients from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). The \\texttt{Mgformer}-based module is superior in performance and flexibility. Its representative recall and precision values are 0.79 and 0.76, respectively, and can be modified by adjusting the threshold. It can also efficiently find TDE candidates within 30 days from the first detection. For comparison, the parametric fitting module yields values of 0.72 and 0.40, respectively, while it is $>$10 times faster in average speed. Hence, the setup of modules allows a trade-off between performance and time, as well as precision and recall. \\texttt{TTC} has successfully picked out all spectroscopically identified TDEs among ZTF transients in a real-time classification test, and selected $\\sim$20 TDE candidates in the deep field survey data of WFST.

The compound Ba$_2$DyRuO$_6$ is reported to exhibit a single magnetic transition, in sharp contrast to most of the other rare-earth (R) members in this family, A$_2$RRuO$_6$ (A = Ca/Sr/Ba), which typically show magnetic ordering of the Ru ions, followed by R-ion ordering. Our neutron diffraction results confirm that long-range antiferromagnetic order emerges at $T_\\mathrm{N} \\approx 47$~K, primarily driven by 4d--4f Ru$^{5+}$--Dy$^{3+}$ exchange interactions, where both Dy and Ru moments start to order simultaneously. The ordered ground state is a collinear antiferromagnet with Ising character, carrying ordered moments of $μ_{\\mathrm{Ru}} = 1.6(1)~μ_\\mathrm{B}$ and $μ_{\\mathrm{Dy}} = 5.1(1)~μ_\\mathrm{B}$ at 1.5~K. Low-temperature INS reveals well-defined magnon excitations below 10~meV. SpinW modelling of the INS spectra evidences complex exchange interactions and the presence of magnetic anisotropy, which governs the Ising ground state and accounts for the observed magnon spectrum. Combined INS and Raman spectroscopy reveal crystal-electric-field (CEF) excitations of Dy$^{3+}$ at 46.5 and 71.8~meV in the paramagnetic region. The observed CEF levels are reproduced by point-charge calculations consistent with the $O_h$ symmetry of Dy$^{3+}$. A complementary machine-learning approach is used to analyse the phonon spectrum and compare with INS data.

However, their performance is sensitive to UAV jitter and cascaded channel uncertainty. This paper investigates a downlink multiple-input single-output UAV-mounted RIS system in which a ground multiple-antenna base station (BS) serves multiple single-antenna users under practical impairments. Our goal is to maximize the expected throughput under stochastic three-dimensional UAV jitter and imperfect cascaded channel state information (CSI) based only on the available channel estimates. This leads to a stochastic nonconvex optimization problem subject to a BS transmit power constraint and strict unit-modulus constraints on all RIS elements. To address this problem, we design a model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework with a contextual bandit formulation. A differentiable feasibility layer is utilized to map continuous actions to feasible solutions, while the reward is a Monte Carlo estimate of the expected throughput. We instantiate this framework with constrained variants of deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) that do not use target networks. Simulations show that the proposed algorithms yield higher throughput than conventional alternating optimization-based weighted minimum mean-square error (AO-WMMSE) baselines under severe jitter and low CSI quality. Across different scenarios, the proposed methods achieve performance that is either comparable to or slightly below the AO-WMMSE benchmark, based on sample average approximation (SAA) with a relative gap ranging from 0-12%. Moreover, the proposed DRL controllers achieve online inference times of 0.6 ms per decision versus roughly 370-550 ms for AO-WMMSE solvers."

Furthermore, the usual scheme of mass diffusion is extended to comprehend also the anomalous phenomena of superdiffusion or subdiffusion. Such phenomena are modelled via a time-dependent mass diffusivity which yields a significant change in the formulation of the stability eigenvalue problem. In particular, the ordinary differential equations governing the time evolution of the perturbations acting on the base throughflow become non-autonomous. This makes a significant difference in the discussion of the conditions leading to instability, with a marked effect of the anomaly in the mass diffusion process. The transition from convective to absolute instability for subdiffusion processes is also addressed."

By separating the state changes from the actuators that realize those changes, Dream2Flow overcomes the embodiment gap and enables zero-shot guidance from pre-trained video models to manipulate objects of diverse categories-including rigid, articulated, deformable, and granular. Through trajectory optimization or reinforcement learning, Dream2Flow converts reconstructed 3D object flow into executable low-level commands without task-specific demonstrations. Simulation and real-world experiments highlight 3D object flow as a general and scalable interface for adapting video generation models to open-world robotic manipulation. Videos and visualizations are available at https://dream2flow.github.io/."

    "abstract": "While the OneRec series has successfully unified the fragmented recommendation pipeline into an end-to-end generative framework, a significant gap remains between recommendation systems and general intelligence. Constrained by isolated data, they operate as domain specialists-proficient in pattern matching but lacking world knowledge, reasoning capabilities, and instruction following. This limitation is further compounded by the lack of a holistic benchmark to evaluate such integrated capabilities. To address this, our contributions are: 1) RecIF Bench & Open Data: We propose RecIF-Bench, a holistic benchmark covering 8 diverse tasks that thoroughly evaluate capabilities from fundamental prediction to complex reasoning. Concurrently, we release a massive training dataset comprising 96 million interactions from 160,000 users to facilitate reproducible research. 2) Framework & Scaling: To ensure full reproducibility, we open-source our comprehensive training pipeline, encompassing data processing, co-pretraining, and post-training. Leveraging this framework, we demonstrate that recommendation capabilities can scale predictably while mitigating catastrophic forgetting of general knowledge. 3) OneRec-Foundation: We release OneRec Foundation (1.7B and 8B), a family of models establishing new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across all tasks in RecIF-Bench. Furthermore, when transferred to the Amazon benchmark, our models surpass the strongest baselines with an average 26.8% improvement in Recall@10 across 10 diverse datasets (Figure 1). This work marks a step towards building truly intelligent recommender systems. Nonetheless, realizing this vision presents significant technical and theoretical challenges, highlighting the need for broader research engagement in this promising direction."

    "abstract": "The adaptive derivative-assembled problem-tailored variational quantum eigensolver (ADAPT-VQE) provides a promising approach for simulating highly correlated quantum systems on quantum devices, as it strikes a balance between hardware efficiency, trainability, and accuracy. Although ADAPT-VQE avoids many of the shortcomings of other VQEs, it is sometimes hindered by a phenomenon known as gradient troughs. This refers to a non-monotonic convergence of the gradients, which may become very small even though the minimum energy has not been reached. This results in difficulties finding the right operators to add to the ansatz, due to the limited number of shots and statistical uncertainties, leading to stagnation in the circuit structure optimization. In this paper, we propose ways to detect and mitigate this phenomenon. Leveraging the non-commutative algebra of the ansatz, we develop heuristics for determining where to insert new operators into the circuit. We find that gradient troughs are more likely to arise when the same locations are used repeatedly for new operator insertions. Our novel protocols, which add new operators in different ansatz positions, allow us to escape gradient troughs and thereby lower the measurement cost of the algorithm. This approach achieves an effective balance between cost and efficiency, leading to faster convergence without compromising the low circuit depth and gate count of ADAPT-VQE."

    "abstract": "The transition of the Divertor Tokamak Test (DTT) facility from its initial commissioning phase (Day-0, plasma current $I_{p}=2$ MA) to the full power scenario ($I_{p}=5.5$ MA) introduces a critical shift in the dynamics of runaway electrons (REs) generation. While previous predictive studies of the low-current scenario indicated a robust safety margin against RE beam formation, this work reveals that the exponential scaling of the RE avalanche gain with plasma current severely narrows the safe operational window in the full power scenario. Using the non-linear magnetohydrodynamic code JOREK, we perform comprehensive 2D simulations of the current quench (CQ) phase of several disruption scenarios, systematically scanning initial RE seed currents and injected impurity levels. The results demonstrate that in the full power scenario, the avalanche multiplication factor is sufficiently high ($G_\\text{av} \\approx 1.3 \\cdot 10^5$) to convert a mere 5.5 A seed current into macroscopic RE beams of $\\approx 0.7$ MA when large amounts of impurities are present. For even higher RE seeds, the RE current can peak at $ \\approx 3.2$ MA, constituting up to $\\approx$ 80% of the total plasma current during the CQ. These findings suggest that, unlike the Day-0 phase, the disruption mitigation strategy for the full power scenario involves a careful balance between thermal load mitigation and RE avoidance, necessitating a well-chosen quantity of injected impurities. This work provides the baseline needed for future estimations of RE loads on the plasma-facing components of DTT, which will be essential for designing and positioning mitigation components like sacrificial limiters."

Although multimodal fusion of sensor time-series and thermal imagery shows promise, we demonstrate that naive fusion strategies can paradoxically degrade performance. This paper introduces a Cascaded Anomaly Detection framework that decouples detection and localization. Stage 1 employs an LSTM-based sensor encoder with temporal attention for high-accuracy detection, while Stage 2 activates a CNN-based thermal encoder for post-detection fault localization. Our results reveal that sensor-only detection outperforms full fusion by 8.3 percentage points (93.08% vs. 84.79% F1-score), challenging the assumption that additional modalities invariably improve performance. We further contribute an explainability pipeline integrating SHAP, temporal/spatial attention, and gate weight analysis. This analysis uncovers a \"modality bias\" where fusion models assign 65-87% weight to the weaker thermal modality. Validated on a real-world bearing dataset (78,397 samples), our cascaded approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while providing actionable diagnostics for maintenance decision-making."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of language processing tasks. However, this success comes at the cost of substantial computation and memory requirements, which significantly impedes their deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address this challenge, this work introduces an automation framework that leverages weight pruning and low-bit quantization, and presents a hardware-software co-design method that generates accelerators on the Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platform. In particular, we implement a unified pipeline that applies N:M structured pruning and 4-bit integer quantization to reduce the memory footprint, followed by optimized dequantization and matrix multiplication to enhance LLM inference on several hardware platforms, including CPUs, NVIDIA GPUs with Dense and 2:4 Sparse Tensor Cores, and a custom systolic-array-based FPGA accelerator. Utilizing 2:4 sparsity combined with quantization on $4096 \\times 4096$ matrices, our approach achieves a reduction of up to $4\\times$ in weight storage and a $1.71\\times$ speedup in matrix multiplication, yielding a $1.29\\times$ end-to-end latency reduction compared to dense GPU baselines. Scaling analysis on the LLaMA-7B model further shows that structured sparsity enhances the throughput per token by $1.36\\times$. These results demonstrate the synergy of fine-grained N:M sparsity and quantization for enabling efficient and deployable LLM inference, while the proposed FPGA accelerator offers a flexible architectural path for supporting a broader class of sparsity patterns beyond the fixed 2:4 hardware constraints."

The method integrates Push-Pull (surplus) consensus dynamics with a dynamic quantization framing scheme combining zooming and midpoint shifting, enabling agents to preserve the true global average while progressively refining their quantization precision. We establish a rigorous convergence theory showing that PP-ACDC achieves asymptotic (exact) average consensus on any strongly connected digraph under appropriately chosen quantization parameters. Moreover, we develop a fully distributed and synchronized finite-time termination mechanism, and we provide a formal proof on the detection of $ε$-convergence to the average within a finite number of iterations. Numerical simulations corroborate the theoretical results and demonstrate that PP-ACDC achieves reliable, communication-efficient, and precise average consensus even under very tight bit budgets, underscoring its suitability for large-scale and resource-constrained multi-agent systems operating over directed networks."

    "abstract": "Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) has emerged as a privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm that enables collaborative training among users without relying on a central server. However, its performance often degrades significantly due to limited connectivity and data heterogeneity. As we move toward the next generation of wireless networks, mobility is increasingly embedded in many real-world applications. The user mobility, either natural or induced, enables clients to act as relays or bridges, thus enhancing information flow in sparse networks; however, its impact on DFL has been largely overlooked despite its potential. In this work, we systematically investigate the role of mobility in improving DFL performance. We first establish the convergence of DFL in sparse networks under user mobility and theoretically demonstrate that even random movement of a fraction of users can significantly boost performance. Building upon this insight, we propose a DFL framework that utilizes mobile users with induced mobility patterns, allowing them to exploit the knowledge of data distribution to determine their trajectories to enhance information propagation through the network. Through extensive experiments, we empirically confirm our theoretical findings, validate the superiority of our approach over baselines, and provide a comprehensive analysis of how various network parameters influence DFL performance in mobile networks."

We first study quarks in gluon backgrounds and show that quark back-reaction can break the isotropy of the condensate for certain initial conditions. We then compute the one-loop finite-temperature effective action using the background-field method and heat-kernel expansion. The resulting thermodynamic pressure increases with temperature but exhibits an approximately logarithmic dependence. This is expected, as this is the de-confined phase of QGP; it is not exactly an ideal gas due to self-interaction. We also perform lattice calculations for the system to contrast continuum and lattice perspectives. We then add the GW to the thermodynamic QGP model and show that certain frequencies of the GW can induce instabilities in the QGP. Our analysis explores the limitations and role of non-perturbative, time-dependent backgrounds in semi-classical description of Yang-Mills dynamics."

While existing deep learning methods exhibit superior detection accuracy, their \"black-box\" nature hinders interpretability. Furthermore, restricted by binary classification paradigms, they struggle to provide root cause analysis and maintenance recommendations. To address these limitations, this paper proposes BatteryAgent, a hierarchical framework that integrates physical knowledge features with the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework comprises three core modules: (1) A Physical Perception Layer that utilizes 10 mechanism-based features derived from electrochemical principles, balancing dimensionality reduction with physical fidelity; (2) A Detection and Attribution Layer that employs Gradient Boosting Decision Trees and SHAP to quantify feature contributions; and (3) A Reasoning and Diagnosis Layer that leverages an LLM as the agent core. This layer constructs a \"numerical-semantic\" bridge, combining SHAP attributions with a mechanism knowledge base to generate comprehensive reports containing fault types, root cause analysis, and maintenance suggestions. Experimental results demonstrate that BatteryAgent effectively corrects misclassifications on hard boundary samples, achieving an AUROC of 0.986, which significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the framework extends traditional binary detection to multi-type interpretable diagnosis, offering a new paradigm shift from \"passive detection\" to \"intelligent diagnosis\" for battery safety management."

We evaluate on standardized ORCHID debates, constructing a 1,000-item retrieval corpus and a held-out set of 32 debates across seven domains. Two tasks are evaluated: next-utterance generation, assessed by InspireScore (subjective, logical, and factual), and adversarial multi-turn simulations, judged by Debatrix (argument, source, language, and overall). Compared with strong LLM baselines, R-Debater achieves higher single-turn and multi-turn scores.

CellSecInspector extracts structured state-condition-action (SCA) representations, models mobile network procedures with comprehensive function chains, systematically validates them against 9 foundational security properties under 4 adversarial scenarios, and automatically generates test cases. This end-to-end pipeline enables the automated discovery of vulnerabilities without relying on manually predefined security requirements or rules.

    "abstract": "Intelligent fault diagnosis has become an indispensable technique for ensuring machinery reliability. However, existing methods suffer significant performance decline in real-world scenarios where models are tested under unseen working conditions, while domain adaptation approaches are limited to their reliance on target domain samples. Moreover, most existing studies rely on single-modal sensing signals, overlooking the complementary nature of multi-modal information for improving model generalization. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a multi-modal cross-domain mixed fusion model with dual disentanglement for fault diagnosis. A dual disentanglement framework is developed to decouple modality-invariant and modality-specific features, as well as domain-invariant and domain-specific representations, enabling both comprehensive multi-modal representation learning and robust domain generalization. A cross-domain mixed fusion strategy is designed to randomly mix modality information across domains for modality and domain diversity augmentation. Furthermore, a triple-modal fusion mechanism is introduced to adaptively integrate multi-modal heterogeneous information. Extensive experiments are conducted on induction motor fault diagnosis under both unseen constant and time-varying working conditions. The results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms advanced methods and comprehensive ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of each proposed component and multi-modal fusion.

However, in artificial molecular systems, broadening the absorption spectrum is often accompanied by fundamental challenges, including bandgap narrowing, poor energy-level alignment, and limited charge-transfer kinetics, indicating that pursuing broadband absorption alone is insufficient to guarantee high photovoltaic performance. This article examines the relationship between design strategies and performance of panchromatic absorbing materials from the perspectives of molecular engineering and photovoltaic devices, with particular emphasis on the delicate balance among molecular electronic structure, charge-transfer characteristics, interfacial energy-level alignment, as well as electron injection, regeneration efficiency, and energy losses. Ultimately, the molecular design of panchromatic photovoltaic materials should move beyond molecular-level optimization toward synergistic tuning among molecules, semiconductors, and electrolytes or active-layer materials, thereby providing concrete conceptual guidance for achieving efficiency optimization rather than simple spectral maximization."

    "abstract": "Destruction of the interstellar dust proceeds primary behind supernova shocks. The previous estimates of the mass of the interstellar dust destroyed in the SN remnant do not take into account the physical properties of the ambient medium. Here we consider how some parameters, i.e. gas density and metallicity, can influence the destruction of the interstellar dust. We show that there are two regimes of the interstellar dust grains destruction in SN remnants: rapid and almost complete in compact low-mass SN remnants expanding in dense medium, and gradual and weak destruction in massive remnants evolving in the low-dense environment. When time for thermal sputtering is close to the dynamical one, i.e. to the SN remnant age, the mass of the interstellar dust destroyed in the SN remnant reaches its maximum value. We find that change of the ambient gas density results in the reduction of the dust mass logarithmically. We argue that dust cooling suppresses the interstellar dust destruction up to a factor of 1.6 by mass. This factor decreases for higher density of the ambient medium. We found that the dust mass depends linearly on gas metallicity as ${\\rm log}~M_d \\sim {\\rm [Z/H]}$ or, in other words, on the dust-to-gas ratio as $M_d \\sim ζ_d$. In turn, the destruction efficiency is higher in low-metallicity environments due to relatively longer adiabatic phase. We point out that the mass of the interstellar dust destroyed per one SN in a high density environment of the high star formation regions like in local ultraluminous infrared and high-redshift massive galaxies is about several times smaller than that in the Milky Way diffuse medium."

    "abstract": "We develop an effective theory for biased tracers formulated at the level of the Boltzmann equation, providing a unified description of density and velocity bias. We introduce a general effective collision term in the tracer Boltzmann equation to encode tracer dynamics that are intrinsically different from those of dark matter. This collision operator leads to modified continuity and Euler equations, with source terms reflecting the collision-term physics. At linear order, this framework predicts time- and scale-dependent bias parameters in a self-consistent manner, encompassing peak bias as a special case while clarifying how velocity bias and higher-derivative effects arise. Applying the resulting bias model to redshift-space distortions, we show that the Boltzmann-equation approach reproduces the power spectrum of biased tracers obtained in the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure up to $k^4$ terms with fewer independent parameters."

    "abstract": "With the development of large-scale models, traditional distributed bilevel optimization algorithms cannot be applied directly in low-resource clients. The key reason lies in the excessive computation involved in optimizing both the lower- and upper-level functions. Thus, we present the first resource-adaptive distributed bilevel optimization framework with a second-order free hypergradient estimator, which allows each client to optimize the submodels adapted to the available resources. Due to the coupled influence of partial outer parameters x and inner parameters y, it's challenging to theoretically analyze the upper bound regarding the globally averaged hypergradient for full model parameters. The error bound of inner parameter also needs to be reformulated since the local partial training. The provable theorems show that both RABO and RAFBO can achieve an asymptotically optimal convergence rate of $O(1/\\sqrt{C_x^{\\ast}Q})$, which is dominated by the minimum coverage of the outer parameter $C_x^{\\ast}$. Extensive experiments on two different tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and computation efficiency of our proposed methods."

For momentum, linking variance-level fluctuations to the average quantum potential. The decomposition fails to provide a physical interpretation for spin, reinforcing the Bohmian tenet that only position is fundamental.

First, we give a few characterizations of when the angle bisectors between two lines with direction vectors in $k^n$ have direction vectors in $k^n.$ To find solutions to the problem in the case when $k = \\mathbb Q,$ we also give a formula for the integral solutions of $x_1{}^2+\\dots +x_n{}^2 = dx_{n+1}{}^2,$ which is a generalization of the negative Pell's equation $x^2-dy^2 = -1,$ where $d$ is a square-free positive integer. Second, by applying the above characterizations, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the incenter of a given $n$-simplex with $k$-rational vertices to be $k$-rational. On the coordinate plane, we prove that every triangle with $k$-rational vertices and incenter can be obtained by scaling a triangle with $k$-rational side lengths and area, which is a generalization of a Heronian triangle.

This study presents the first ecosystem-scale longitudinal analysis of software defects across 123 open source quantum repositories from 2012 to 2024, spanning eight functional categories, including full-stack libraries, simulators, annealing, algorithms, compilers, assembly, cryptography, and experimental computing. Using a mixed method approach combining repository mining, static code analysis, issue metadata extraction, and a validated rule-based classification framework, we analyze 32,296 verified bug reports. Results show that full-stack libraries and compilers are the most defect-prone categories due to circuit, gate, and transpilation-related issues, while simulators are mainly affected by measurement and noise modeling errors. Classical bugs primarily impact usability and interoperability, whereas quantum-specific bugs disproportionately degrade performance, maintainability, and reliability. Longitudinal analysis indicates ecosystem maturation, with defect densities peaking between 2017 and 2021 and declining thereafter. High-severity defects cluster in cryptography, experimental computing, and compiler toolchains. Repositories employing automated testing detect more defects and resolve issues faster. A negative binomial regression further shows that automated testing is associated with an approximate 60 percent reduction in expected defect incidence. Overall, this work provides the first large-scale data-driven characterization of quantum software defects and offers empirical guidance for improving testing, documentation, and maintainability practices in QSE."

Traditional graph-based planners excel at long-range pathfinding but lack reactivity, while Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods demonstrate strong collision avoidance but often fail to reach distant goals due to a lack of global context. We propose Hybrid Motion Planning with Deep Reinforcement Learning (HMP-DRL), a hybrid framework that bridges this gap. Our approach utilizes a graph-based global planner to generate a path, which is integrated into a local DRL policy via a sequence of checkpoints encoded in both the state space and reward function. To ensure social compliance, the local planner employs an entity-aware reward structure that dynamically adjusts safety margins and penalties based on the semantic type of surrounding agents. We validate the proposed method through extensive testing in a realistic simulation environment derived from real-world map data. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that HMP-DRL consistently outperforms other methods, including state-of-the-art approaches, in terms of key metrics of robot navigation: success rate, collision rate, and time to reach the goal. Overall, these findings confirm that integrating long-term path guidance with semantically-aware local control significantly enhances both the safety and reliability of autonomous navigation in complex human-centric settings."

    "abstract": "Automated Program Repair (APR) aims to automatically generate correct patches for buggy programs. Recent approaches leveraging large language models (LLMs) have shown promise but face limitations. Most rely solely on static analysis, ignoring runtime behaviors. Some attempt to incorporate dynamic signals, but these are often restricted to training or fine-tuning, or injected only once into the repair prompt, without iterative use. This fails to fully capture program execution. Current iterative repair frameworks typically rely on coarse-grained feedback, such as pass/fail results or exception types, and do not leverage fine-grained execution-level information effectively. As a result, models struggle to simulate human stepwise debugging, limiting their effectiveness in multi-step reasoning and complex bug repair. To address these challenges, we propose DynaFix, an execution-level dynamic information-driven APR method that iteratively leverages runtime information to refine the repair process. In each repair round, DynaFix captures execution-level dynamic information such as variable states, control-flow paths, and call stacks, transforming them into structured prompts to guide LLMs in generating candidate patches. If a patch fails validation, DynaFix re-executes the modified program to collect new execution information for the next attempt. This iterative loop incrementally improves patches based on updated feedback, similar to the stepwise debugging practices of human developers. We evaluate DynaFix on the Defects4J v1.2 and v2.0 benchmarks. DynaFix repairs 186 single-function bugs, a 10% improvement over state-of-the-art baselines, including 38 bugs previously unrepaired. It achieves correct patches within at most 35 attempts, reducing the patch search space by 70% compared with existing methods, thereby demonstrating both effectiveness and efficiency in repairing complex bugs."

We confirm that classical approaches retain high-order accuracy and strong computational efficiency for single-instance problems in the one-dimensional setting. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are also able to reproduce qualitative solutions but are generally less accurate and less efficient in low dimensions than classical solvers due to expensive training and slow convergence. We also investigate the operator-learning methods, which, although computationally intensive during training, can be reused across many parameter instances, providing rapid inference after pretraining, making them attractive for applications involving repeated simulations or real-time predictions. For single-instance computations, however, the accuracy of operator-learning methods remains lower than that of classical methods or PINNs, in general."

It is very critical for roadside infrastructure system to interpret natural languages and localize relevant target objects in complex traffic environments. However, most existing datasets and approaches for 3D visual grounding focus on the indoor and outdoor driving scenes, outdoor monitoring scenarios remain unexplored due to scarcity of paired point cloud-text data captured by roadside infrastructure sensors. In this paper, we introduce a novel task of 3D Visual Grounding for Outdoor Monitoring Scenarios, which enables infrastructure-level understanding of traffic scenes beyond the ego-vehicle perspective. To support this task, we construct MoniRefer, the first real-world large-scale multi-modal dataset for roadside-level 3D visual grounding. The dataset consists of about 136,018 objects with 411,128 natural language expressions collected from multiple complex traffic intersections in the real-world environments. To ensure the quality and accuracy of the dataset, we manually verified all linguistic descriptions and 3D labels for objects. Additionally, we also propose a new end-to-end method, named Moni3DVG, which utilizes the rich appearance information provided by images and geometry and optical information from point cloud for multi-modal feature learning and 3D object localization. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on the proposed benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our method. Our dataset and code will be released."

One- and two-dimensional arrays are shown to be inherently radiative, exhibiting band gaps and decay rates that oscillate between superradiant and subradiant regimes, as a function of lattice spacing. In contrast, three-dimensional lattices are found to be fundamentally non-radiative due to the inhibition of spontaneous emission, with decay only at discrete Bragg resonances. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this structural difference dictates the system dynamics, which crosses over from dissipative decay in lower dimensions to coherent transport in three dimensions. Our results provide insight into cooperative effects in atomic arrays at the single-photon level."

    "abstract": "We study a large-scale one-sided multiple testing problem in which test statistics follow normal distributions with unit variance, and the goal is to identify signals with positive mean effects. A common approach is to compute $p$-values under the assumption that all null means are exactly zero and then apply standard multiple testing procedures such as the Benjamini--Hochberg (BH) or Storey--BH method. However, because the null hypothesis is composite, some null means may be strictly negative. In this case, the resulting $p$-values are conservative, leading to a substantial loss of power. Existing methods address this issue by modifying the multiple testing procedure itself, for example through conditioning strategies or discarding rules. In contrast, we focus on correcting the $p$-values so that they are exact under the null. Specifically, we estimate the marginal null distribution of the test statistics within an empirical Bayes framework and construct refined $p$-values based on this estimated distribution. These refined $p$-values can then be directly used in standard multiple testing procedures without modification. Extensive simulation studies show that the proposed method substantially improves power when $p$-values are conservative, while achieving comparable performance to existing methods when $p$-values are exact. An application to phosphorylation data further demonstrates the practical effectiveness of our approach."

Our approach reveals both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic MR as consequences of temperature- and field-dependent spin decoherence, encompassing spin relaxation and dephasing. In particular, the resistance associated with spin decoherence is governed by the order parameters of magnetic materials, such as the magnetization in ferromagnets and the Néel vector in antiferromagnets. This theory deepens the fundamental understanding of MR and offers guidance for interpreting and designing experiments on magnetic materials."

There are various universal predictions for the BTRS state when it is associated with a multicomponent superconducting order parameter. In particular, in the BTRS superconducting state, spontaneous fields appear around crystalline defects, impurities, superconducting domain walls and sample surfaces. However, this phenomenon has not yet been experimentally demonstrated for any BTRS superconductor. Here, we aimed to verify these predictions for Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ by performing muon spin relaxation ($μ$SR) measurements on Sr$_{2-y}$La$_{y}$RuO$_4$ single crystals at ambient pressure and stoichiometric Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ under hydrostatic pressure. The study allowed us to conclude that spontaneous fields in the BTRS superconducting state of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ appear around non-magnetic inhomogeneities and, at the same time, decrease with the suppression of $T_{\\rm c}$. The observed behaviour is consistent with the prediction for multicomponent BTRS superconductivity in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. The results of the work are relevant to understanding BTRS superconductivity in general, as they demonstrate, for the first time, the relationship among the superconducting order parameter, the BTRS transition, and crystal-structure inhomogeneities."

The structure of our transform is governed by a Cayley--Hamilton-type theory valid in commutative rings of characteristic zero, together with a novel polynomial-matrix identity specific to convolution. Beyond these analytic aspects, we uncover an intrinsic connection between convolution and the Bruhat order on the symmetric group, illuminating the combinatorial aspect of this functional operation.

To further improve data quality, numerous training data optimization techniques have been proposed; however, their overall effectiveness has not been systematically evaluated. To bridge this gap, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study, examining five widely-used training data optimization techniques and their pairwise combinations for LLM-based code generation across three benchmarks and four LLMs. Our results show that data synthesis is the most effective technique for improving functional correctness and reducing code smells, although it performs relatively worse on code maintainability compared to data refactoring, cleaning, and selection. Regarding combinations, we find that most combinations do not further improve functional correctness but can effectively enhance code quality (code smells and maintainability). Among all combinations, data synthesis combined with data refactoring achieves the strongest overall performance. Furthermore, our fine-grained analysis reinforces these findings and provides deeper insights into how individual techniques and their combinations influence code generation effectiveness. Overall, this work represents a first step toward a systematic understanding of training data optimization and combination strategies, offering practical guidance for future research and deployment in LLM-based code generation."

To address these limitations, we present RGBT-Ground, the first large-scale visual grounding benchmark built for complex real-world scenarios. It consists of spatially aligned RGB and Thermal infrared (TIR) image pairs with high-quality referring expressions, corresponding object bounding boxes, and fine-grained annotations at the scene, environment, and object levels. This benchmark enables comprehensive evaluation and facilitates the study of robust grounding under diverse and challenging conditions. Furthermore, we establish a unified visual grounding framework that supports both uni-modal (RGB or TIR) and multi-modal (RGB-TIR) visual inputs.

    "abstract": "We theoretically study the collective excitations in a spin-1 $XY$ model with a quadratic Zeeman term and a long-range interaction that decays algebraically with the distance. Using the quantum-field theory based on the finite-temperature Green's function formalism, we analyze properties of the Nambu-Goldstone (NG) and Higgs modes in order to analytically evaluate the damping rate of the Higgs mode in the $XY$ ferromagnetic ordered phase near the quantum phase transition to the disordered phase. When the power of the algebraic decay is 3 as in the case of dipole-dipole interactions in Rydberg-atom systems, we show that at two dimensions the excitation energy of the Higgs mode exhibits a linear dispersion whereas the dispersion of the NG mode becomes proportional to the square root of the momentum. We find that the damping of the Higgs mode is significantly suppressed by the long-range interaction. We also propose how to excite and probe the Higgs mode in Rydberg-atom experiments."

    "abstract": "We present experimental evidence of a thermally-driven amplitude-frequency nonlinearity in a thin-film quartz phononic crystal resonator at millikelvin temperatures. The nonlinear response arises from the coupling of the mechanical mode to an ensemble of microscopic two-level system defects driven out of equilibrium by a microwave drive. In contrast to the conventional Duffing oscillator, the observed nonlinearity exhibits a mixed reactive-dissipative character. Notably, the reactive effect can manifest as either a softening or hardening of the mechanical resonance, depending on the ratio of thermal to phonon energy. By combining the standard TLS theory with a thermal conductance model, the measured power-dependent response is quantitatively reproduced and readout-enhanced relaxation damping from off-resonant TLSs is identified as the primary mechanism limiting mechanical coherence. Within this framework, we delineate the conditions under which similar systems will realize this nonlinearity."

    "abstract": "Heterogeneous-ISA processor designs have attracted considerable research interest. However, unlike their homogeneous-ISA counterparts, explicit software support for bridging ISA heterogeneity is required. The lack of a compilation toolchain ready to support heterogeneous-ISA targets has been a major factor hindering research in this exciting emerging area. For any such compiler, \"getting right\" the mechanics involved in state transformation upon migration and doing this efficiently is of critical importance. In particular, any runtime conversion of the current program stack from one architecture to another would be prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we design and develop Unifico, a new multi-ISA compiler that generates binaries that maintain the same stack layout during their execution on either architecture. Unifico avoids the need for runtime stack transformation, thus eliminating overheads associated with ISA migration. Additional responsibilities of the Unifico compiler backend include maintenance of a uniform ABI and virtual address space across ISAs. Unifico is implemented using the LLVM compiler infrastructure, and we are currently targeting the x86-64 and ARMv8 ISAs. We have evaluated Unifico across a range of compute-intensive NAS benchmarks and show its minimal impact on overall execution time, where less than 6% (10%) overhead is introduced on average for high-end (low-end) processors. We also analyze the performance impact of Unifico's key design features and demonstrate that they can be further optimized to mitigate this impact. When compared against the state-of-the-art Popcorn compiler, Unifico reduces binary size overhead from ~200% to ~10%, whilst eliminating the stack transformation overhead during ISA migration."

We propose a constructive approximation scheme that combines a division-free polynomial iteration for fractional powers with an outer layer for the analytic polynomial fitting. Our main result shows that this composite structure achieves exponential convergence in the the number of scalar coefficients in the inner and outer polynomial layers. Specifically, the $L^p([-1,1])$ approximation error, decays exponentially with respect to the parameter budget, in contrast to the algebraic rates obtained by classical single-layer polynomial approximation for cusp-type functions. Numerical experiments for both single and multiple cusp configurations confirm the theoretical rates and demonstrate the parameter efficiency of deep composite polynomial constructions."

Given a monocular video, SpaceTimePilot can independently alter the camera viewpoint and the motion sequence within the generative process, re-rendering the scene for continuous and arbitrary exploration across space and time. To achieve this, we introduce an effective animation time-embedding mechanism in the diffusion process, allowing explicit control of the output video's motion sequence with respect to that of the source video. As no datasets provide paired videos of the same dynamic scene with continuous temporal variations, we propose a simple yet effective temporal-warping training scheme that repurposes existing multi-view datasets to mimic temporal differences. This strategy effectively supervises the model to learn temporal control and achieve robust space-time disentanglement. To further enhance the precision of dual control, we introduce two additional components: an improved camera-conditioning mechanism that allows altering the camera from the first frame, and CamxTime, the first synthetic space-and-time full-coverage rendering dataset that provides fully free space-time video trajectories within a scene. Joint training on the temporal-warping scheme and the CamxTime dataset yields more precise temporal control. We evaluate SpaceTimePilot on both real-world and synthetic data, demonstrating clear space-time disentanglement and strong results compared to prior work.

We incorporate a spectroscopic UV data sample from HST, including 67 UV spectra from 18 nearby SNe Ia. Unlike previous training spectra, the HST spectra have sufficiently precise calibration that they do not require additional warping to match coincident photometric data. Additionally, while including this new SN Ia sample necessitates incorporating auxiliary photometric data from ZTF and ATLAS that have insufficient calibration for cosmological analyses, the improvements in the calibration of these data is anticipated in the near future. Compared to the previous SALT3-K21 model, the SALT3-UV model shows a significant improvement in the UV down to $2000\\mathring{\\text{A}}$, with over a threefold improvement in model uncertainty and a more physically accurate continuum and line features. We further evaluate potential redshift evolution in the UV template by separating the UV training sample into low- and high-$z$ subsamples.

These generative classifiers are simple to train, avoiding the need for specialized augmentations, strong regularization, extra hyperparameters, or knowledge of the specific spurious correlations to avoid. We find that diffusion-based and autoregressive generative classifiers achieve state-of-the-art performance on five standard image and text distribution shift benchmarks and reduce the impact of spurious correlations in realistic applications, such as medical or satellite datasets. Finally, we carefully analyze a Gaussian toy setting to understand the inductive biases of generative classifiers, as well as the data properties that determine when generative classifiers outperform discriminative ones."

From a classical sampling perspective, it is well-known that monotonicity is untestable. By contrast, we show from the design-based perspective -- in which the units in the population are fixed and only treatment assignment is stochastic -- that the distribution of treatment effects in the finite population (and hence whether monotonicity holds) is formally identified. We argue, however, that the usual definition of identification is unnatural in the design-based setting because it imagines knowing the distribution of outcomes over different treatment assignments for the same units. We thus evaluate the informativeness of the data by the extent to which it enables frequentist testing and Bayesian updating. We show that frequentist tests can have nontrivial power against some alternatives, but power is generically limited. Likewise, we show that there exist (non-degenerate) Bayesian priors that never update about whether monotonicity holds. We conclude that, despite the formal identification result, the ability to learn about monotonicity from data in practice is severely limited."

Parity symmetry is spontaneously broken in the model, which helps in solving the strong CP problem without the axion. The Higgs sector of the model is very simple, consisting of a single pair of $H_L(2,1,4)+ H_R(1,2,4)$ fields. Fermion masses arise through mixing of the chiral fermions with vector-like quarks and leptons contained in $(1,1,15)$ as well as $(1,1,10)_L+(1,1,10)_R$ multiplets via a universal seesaw mechanism. Consistency of such a spectrum with the observed quark and lepton masses is established. The parity solution to the strong CP problem is shown to be effective in this framework, although there are new loop contributions to $\\overlineθ$, compared to the analogous left-right symmetric model, arising from color sextet and octet fermions, as well as from diagrams mediated by leptoquark bosons. We also find that, in this setup, although lepton number is broken, neutrino masses remain zero at the tree-level. Small and finite Majorana neutrino masses are induced via one-loop diagrams, which we analyze and show to be compatible with oscillation experiments."

We then demonstrate that the most general such inertial transformation which further preserves the speed of light in all directions is, however, still affine linear. Physically, this paper may be viewed as a reduction of the number of postulates needed to uniquely specify special relativity by one, as well as a proof that inertial transformations automatically imbue spacetime with a vector space structure, albeit in one higher dimension than might be expected.

A person may choose apples over oranges and bananas over grapes, but which preference is stronger? Strength is crucial for decision-making under uncertainty and generalization of preference models, but hard to measure reliably. Metadata such as response times and inter-annotator agreement can serve as proxies for strength, but are often noisy and confounded. We propose ResponseRank to address the challenge of learning from noisy strength signals. Our method uses relative differences in proxy signals to rank responses to pairwise comparisons by their inferred preference strength. To control for systemic variation, we compare signals only locally within carefully constructed strata. This enables robust learning of utility differences consistent with strength-derived rankings while making minimal assumptions about the strength signal. Our contributions are threefold: (1) ResponseRank, a novel method that robustly learns preference strength by leveraging locally valid relative strength signals; (2) empirical evidence of improved sample efficiency and robustness across diverse tasks: synthetic preference learning (with simulated response times), language modeling (with annotator agreement), and RL control tasks (with simulated episode returns); and (3) the Pearson Distance Correlation (PDC), a novel metric that isolates cardinal utility learning from ordinal accuracy."

Using the previously estimated marginal probability densities of eccentricity and semimajor axis, and assuming an isotropic orientation of binary systems, the sample distribution of mass was adjusted using a concordance metric of the observed and synthetic distributions of orbital momenta and an ad hoc functional model. The best-fitting mass density model is found to faithfully reproduce the observed dependence of orbital momenta on apparent separation, although the absolute luminosity distributions indicate a tendency of the widest systems to more frequently include solar-type primaries. The anticipated manifestation of MOND is computed in the investigated parameter space \\{separation, momentum\\}. This effect is absent in the given data.

Despite these advantages, implementing the technique in real-world scenarios where the observed system is subject to environmental noise and dynamic variations remains challenging. The primary limitation lies in the inability of quantum imaging systems to retrieve object information in real time under high-noise conditions. Here, we experimentally demonstrate real-time amplitude and phase imaging in noisy environments, building upon our previous implementation of quantum off-axis holography.

    "abstract": "A common challenge in superconducting quantum circuits is the trade-off between strong coupling and computational subspace integrity. We present Mathieu control, which uses a non-resonant two-photon drive to create a selective nonlinear frequency shift. This shift modifies interactions while preserving qubit states, enabling continuous tuning of the ZZ coupling, including full suppression, and integrating single- and two-qubit gates with low leakage. For a qubit-coupler-qubit device, it allows independent ZZ control, facilitating a programmable Heisenberg (XXZ) Hamiltonian. Extended to a five-qubit chain, the system can be reconfigured to simulate dynamics of quantum magnetic phases. Mathieu control thus provides a framework for high-fidelity quantum logic and programmable simulation."

    "abstract": "We give a proof of Fourier extension conjecture on the paraboloid in all dimensions bigger than 2 that begins with a decomposition suggested in Sawyer [Saw8] of writing a smooth Alpert projection as a sum of pieces whose Fourier extensions are localized. This is then used in the case d=3 to establish the trilinear equivalence of the Fourier extension conjecture given in C. Rios and E. Sawyer [RiSa1] and [RiSa3]. A key aspect of the proof is that the trilinear equivalence only requires an averaging over grids, which converts a difficult exponential sum into an oscillatory integral with periodic amplitude, that is then used to prove the localization on the Fourier side. Finally, we extend this argument to all dimensions bigger than 2 using bilinear analogues of the smooth Alpert trilinear inequalities, which generalize those in Tao, Vargas and Vega [TaVaVe]."

    "abstract": "Materials in which electrons occupy interstitial sites as anions are called electrides and exhibit unusual dimensionality-dependent electronic behavior. These properties make electrides attractive for catalysis, transparent conductors, and emergent quantum phenomena, yet their theoretical treatment remains challenging. In conventional materials, the ground-state atomic structure dictates the electronic configuration, whereas in electrides the electronic structure can instead govern the atomic arrangement. Here, the performance of commonly used exchange-correlation functionals is evaluated for representative one-, two-, and three-dimensional electrides. The results show that higher-cost approaches do not necessarily perform better across all cases, while standard methods capture the qualitative electride character and many key energetic and structural trends with surprising reliability. This behavior, likely arising from fortuitous error cancellation, supports the reliability of legacy studies in the field and the viability of efficient high-throughput exploration using low-cost methods. Overall, the findings support a tiered computational strategy for electride modelling, integrating system-specific heuristics with efficient first-principles screening. This approach balances computational feasibility with physical fidelity and underscores the continuing leadership of theory in the predictive discovery of electride materials across dimensionalities."

We show that the Toffoli count can be reduced to at most n. The Toffoli depth can also be reduced to O(1), at the cost of 2n Toffoli gates, even without using any ancilla or measurement. In fact, using a measurement-based uncomputation, the Toffoli depth can be further reduced to 1. From this, we give two corollaries: any controlled Clifford circuit can be implemented with O(1) T-depth, and any Clifford+T circuit with T-depth D can be controlled with T-depth O(D), even without ancillas.

    "abstract": "The recently reported Cosmic Himalayas (CH) -- an extreme quasar overdensity at z~2 -- poses an apparent challenge to the Lambda CDM framework, with a reported significance of 16.9-sigma under Gaussian assumptions. Such an event appears improbably rare, with a formal probability of P ~ 10^-68. In this work, we investigate whether CH-like structures can naturally arise in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. Using the CROCODILE simulation, which self-consistently models galaxy-black hole coevolution, we examine quasar clustering through two complementary approaches: the count-in-cells (CIC) statistic, which probes large-scale overdensities, and the nearest-neighbor distribution (NND), sensitive to small-scale environments. CIC analysis reveals that the underlying distribution is heavy-tailed and non-Gaussian, and that conventional Gaussian-based evaluation substantially overestimates the significance of extreme events. When modeled with an asymmetric generalized normal distribution (AGND), the inferred rarity of the CH is substantially reduced and reconciled with standard Lambda CDM; for instance, regions appearing as 12-sigma outliers under Gaussian assumptions (P ~ 10^-33) are found to occur in the AGND regime with a probability of P ~ 10^-4. NND analysis further demonstrates that extreme overdense regions within the simulation can naturally sustain two-point correlation function values similar to those observed in the CH (r0 ~ 30 Mpc/h), suggesting that the strong clustering stems from sample selection biases and local environmental variations. These two analyses conclusively highlight the importance of adopting non-Gaussian statistics when quantifying extreme overdensities of quasars and establish that the CH is not an anomaly, but a natural outcome of structure formation in the Lambda CDM universe."

However, existing GUI agents rely on discrete click predictions (x,y), which prohibits free-form, closed-loop trajectories (e.g. dragging a progress bar) that require continuous, on-the-fly perception and adjustment. In this work, we develop ShowUI-$π$, the first flow-based generative model as GUI dexterous hand, featuring the following designs: (i) Unified Discrete-Continuous Actions, integrating discrete clicks and continuous drags within a shared model, enabling flexible adaptation across diverse interaction modes; (ii) Flow-based Action Generation for drag modeling, which predicts incremental cursor adjustments from continuous visual observations via a lightweight action expert, ensuring smooth and stable trajectories; (iii) Drag Training data and Benchmark, where we manually collect and synthesize 20K drag trajectories across five domains (e.g. PowerPoint, Adobe Premiere Pro), and introduce ScreenDrag, a benchmark with comprehensive online and offline evaluation protocols for assessing GUI agents' drag capabilities. Our experiments show that proprietary GUI agents still struggle on ScreenDrag (e.g. Operator scores 13.27, and the best Gemini-2.5-CUA reaches 22.18). In contrast, ShowUI-$π$ achieves 26.98 with only 450M parameters, underscoring both the difficulty of the task and the effectiveness of our approach. We hope this work advances GUI agents toward human-like dexterous control in digital world. The code is available at https://github.com/showlab/showui-pi."

To address this issue, we construct the pseudo-resolvent operator using the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury identity whose norm serves as a spectral indicator, and pseudoeigenfunctions are extracted as directions of maximal amplification. We establish convergence of the approximate spectrum to the true spectrum in the Hausdorff metric for isolated eigenvalues, with preservation of algebraic multiplicities, and derive error bounds for eigenvalue approximation. Numerical experiments on pendulum, Lorenz, and coupled oscillator systems demonstrate that the method effectively suppresses spectral pollution and resolves closely spaced spectral components."

We test this formalism with two- and three-particle quantum mechanical systems, with both long range Coulomb-like interactions between the particles and external fields acting separately on the particles, in various spatial dimensionality. We extract accurate estimations of the ground state energy of these systems using the late-time behaviour of the propagator, validating our approach with numerically exact solutions obtained via straightforward diagonalisation of the Hamiltonian. Systematic benchmarking of the new approach, presented here for the first time, shows that the computational complexity of Wordline Monte Carlo scales more favourably with respect to standard numerical alternatives. The method, which is general, numerically exact, and computationally not intensive, can easily be generalised to relativistic systems."

We then provide theoretical analysis showing that iterative deployment effectively implements reinforcement learning (RL) training in the outer-loop (i.e. not as part of intentional model training), with an implicit reward function. The connection to RL has two important implications: first, for the field of AI safety, as the reward function entailed by repeated deployment is not defined explicitly, and could have unexpected implications to the properties of future model deployments. Second, the mechanism highlighted here can be viewed as an alternative training regime to explicit RL, relying on data curation rather than explicit rewards."

While these detectors achieve remarkable performance on standard autonomous driving benchmarks, they often struggle to generalize across different domains - for instance, a model trained in the U.S. may perform poorly in regions like Asia or Europe. This paper presents a novel lidar domain adaptation method based on neuron activation patterns, demonstrating that state-of-the-art performance can be achieved by annotating only a small, representative, and diverse subset of samples from the target domain if they are correctly selected. The proposed approach requires very small annotation budget and, when combined with post-training techniques inspired by continual learning prevent weight drift from the original model. Empirical evaluation shows that the proposed domain adaptation approach outperforms both linear probing and state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques."

Extending previous formulations, a non-relativistic matter component is included explicitly, which allows a self consistent description of cosmological dynamics from the radiation-dominated era to late-time acceleration. Analytical expressions for the background expansion are derived and characterized using kinematic diagnostics. We constrain the model using observational Hubble data, Type Ia Supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations (including DESI DR2), and compressed cosmic microwave background distance information, performing a Bayesian MCMC analysis. The interaction parameter is found to be consistent with zero, though small deviations from standard radiation scaling are allowed. These deviations can partially alleviate the Hubble tension by modifying the sound horizon, but this is accompanied by correlated shifts in the matter density. The reconstructed expansion history remains close to LCDM at late times. Model comparison suggest that the interacting scenario is statistically competitive but not decisively preferred by current background data."

At the root of the tree, a global representation captures coarse trends in the signal, while recursive splits reveal increasingly localized views of the signal. At each level of the tree, data are projected onto a time-frequency basis (e.g., wavelets or exponential moving averages) to extract scale-specific features, which are then aggregated across the hierarchy. This design allows the model to jointly capture global structure and local dynamics of the signal, enabling accurate forecasting. Experiments across benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for forecasting. Overall, these results demonstrate that our hierarchical approach provides a lightweight and flexible framework for forecasting multivariate time series.

We demonstrate that ULC microgels act as fragile glass formers whose dynamics are governed solely by $φ$. In contrast, the microscopic structure depends on the specific combination of microgel number density and swelling state that define $φ$. We identify an anomalous glassy regime where relaxation times are orders of magnitude faster than predicted by supercooled extrapolations, and show that in this regime dynamics are partly accelerated by laser light absorption. Finally, we show that the microscopic relaxation time measured for different $φ$'s and at various scattering vectors may be rationalized by a ``time-length scale superposition principle'' analogous to the time-temperature superposition used to scale onto a master curve rheology or dielectric relaxation data of molecular systems. Remarkably, we find that the resulting master curve also applies to a different microgel system [V.

Notably, our fitting to the physical spectra yields consistent values for both mesons and baryons, $T_{\\rm H} \\simeq 0.34\\,\\text{GeV}$, which contrasts with previous phenomenological analyses that suggested different values. This obtained value aligns well with typical string tension derived from lattice-QCD calculations and the Regge slope.

    "abstract": "Benchmarks play a crucial role in tracking the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and identifying their capability boundaries. However, existing benchmarks predominantly curate questions at the question level, suffering from three fundamental limitations: vulnerability to data contamination, restriction to single-knowledge-point assessment, and reliance on costly domain expert annotation. We propose Encyclo-K, a statement-based benchmark that rethinks benchmark construction from the ground up. Our key insight is that knowledge statements, not questions, can serve as the unit of curation, and questions can then be constructed from them. We extract standalone knowledge statements from authoritative textbooks and dynamically compose them into evaluation questions through random sampling at test time. This design directly addresses all three limitations: the combinatorial space is too vast to memorize, and model rankings remain stable across dynamically generated question sets, enabling reliable periodic dataset refresh; each question aggregates 8-10 statements for comprehensive multi-knowledge assessment; annotators only verify formatting compliance without requiring domain expertise, substantially reducing annotation costs. Experiments on over 50 LLMs demonstrate that Encyclo-K poses substantial challenges with strong discriminative power. Even the top-performing OpenAI-GPT-5.1 achieves only 62.07% accuracy, and model performance displays a clear gradient distribution--reasoning models span from 16.04% to 62.07%, while chat models range from 9.71% to 50.40%. These results validate the challenges introduced by dynamic evaluation and multi-statement comprehensive understanding. These findings establish Encyclo-K as a scalable framework for dynamic evaluation of LLMs' comprehensive understanding over multiple fine-grained disciplinary knowledge statements."

    "abstract": "Consumer regret is a widespread post-purchase emotion that significantly impacts satisfaction, product returns, complaint behavior, and customer loyalty. Despite its prevalence, there is a limited understanding of why certain consumers experience regret more frequently as a chronic aspect of their engagement in the marketplace. This study explores the antecedents of consumer regret frequency by integrating decision agency, status signaling motivations, and online shopping preferences into a cohesive framework. By analyzing survey data (n=338), we assess whether consumers' perceived agency and decision-making orientation correlate with the frequency of regret, and whether tendencies towards status-related consumption and preferences for online shopping environments exacerbate regret through mechanisms such as increased social comparison, expanded choice sets, and continuous exposure to alternative offers. The findings reveal that regret frequency is significantly linked to individual differences in decision-related orientations and status signaling, with a preference for online shopping further contributing to regret-prone consumption behaviors. These results extend the scope of regret and cognitive dissonance research beyond isolated decision episodes by emphasizing regret frequency as a persistent consumer outcome. From a managerial standpoint, the findings suggest that retailers can alleviate regret-driven dissatisfaction by enhancing decision support, minimizing choice overload, and developing post-purchase reassurance strategies tailored to segments prone to regret.."

We show that the entanglement entropy naturally emerges from the normalization condition of the Husimi distribution within this framework. In addition, the Wehrl entropy contains a contribution associated with transverse degrees of freedom. Numerical results for the proton Wehrl entropy are presented for different values of the virtuality."

However, their performance as embodied agents, which requires multi-round dialogue spatial reasoning and sequential action prediction, needs further exploration. Our work investigates this potential in the context of Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) by introducing a unified and extensible evaluation framework to probe MLLMs as zero-shot agents by bridging traditional navigation datasets into a standardized benchmark, named VLN-MME. We simplify the evaluation with a highly modular and accessible design. This flexibility streamlines experiments, enabling structured comparisons and component-level ablations across diverse MLLM architectures, agent designs, and navigation tasks. Crucially, enabled by our framework, we observe that enhancing our baseline agent with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and self-reflection leads to an unexpected performance decrease. This suggests MLLMs exhibit poor context awareness in embodied navigation tasks; although they can follow instructions and structure their output, their 3D spatial reasoning fidelity is low. VLN-MME lays the groundwork for systematic evaluation of general-purpose MLLMs in embodied navigation settings and reveals limitations in their sequential decision-making capabilities. We believe these findings offer crucial guidance for MLLM post-training as embodied agents."

The system consists of a TPC with two-dimensional-strip readout Micromegas and an anti-coincidence detector with readout pads for cosmic ray veto. The detector system utilize an AGET-based waveform sampling system for data acquisition. The beta detection capability of the system was verified through experimental test using $^{90}$Sr beta source. Additionally, a dedicated simulation program based on Geant4 was developed to model the entire detection process, including responses to both the beta source and background radiation. Simulation results were compared with experimental data for both beta and background samples, showing good agreements. The simulation samples were utilized to optimize and train classification models for beta and background discrimination. By applying the selected model into test data, the system achieved a background rate of 0.49 $\\rm cpm/cm^2$ while retaining more than 55% of $^{90}$Sr beta signals within a 7 cm diameter detection region. Further analysis revealed that approximately 70% of the background originates from environmental gamma radiation, while the remaining contribution mainly comes from intrinsic radioactivity of detector materials, particularly the FR-4 based field cage and readout plane. Based on the knowledge gained from the experiments and simulations, an optimization of the TPC system has been proposed, with simulation predicting a potential reduction of the background rate to 0.0012 $\\rm cpm/cm^2$."

By solving gap equations at zero temperature, we identify a transition from normal $s++/s\\pm$-wave pairing to time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking pairing with a variation of inter-pocket interactions or density of states. This TRS breaking pairing originates from the superconducting phase frustration of different Fermi pockets and can account for experimental TRS breaking signal in kagome superconductors. Moreover, we investigate collective modes, including the Higgs, Leggett, and Bogoloubov-Anderson-Goldstone modes, arising from fluctuations of the amplitude, relative phase, and overall phase of the superconducting order parameters, respectively. Remarkably, due to the presence of multibands, one branch of the Leggett modes becomes nearly massless near the TRS breaking transition, providing a compelling smoking-gun signature of TRS-breaking superconductivity, in clear contrast to TRS-breaking charge orders. Our results elucidate the rich superconducting physics and its associated collective modes in kagome metals, and suggest feasible experimental detection of TRS breaking pairing."

Here, we investigate the fracture patterns that emerge when a localized surface-tension perturbation is applied to a sumi film supported on a water-glycerol subphase. Sumi is a traditional Japanese carbon black ink, and this process, referred to as sumi-wari, produces aesthetically pleasing, star-shaped crack patterns with multiple spikes radiating from the perturbation site. The number of crack spikes increases with the viscosity of the subphase, controlled here by the addition of glycerol. Atomic force microscopy measurements reveal that the effective stiffness of the sumi f ilm decreases as glycerol concentration increases. This suggests a strong coupling between the subphase properties and the mechanics of the sumi film. To capture the dynamics of sumi-wari, a phenomenological model is outlined, based on an overdamped equation of motion for particles connected by breakable springs. Numerical simulations reproduce both the morphology and the experimental trends of sumi-wari: the number of cracks and their temporal evolution depend on the spring stiffness, mirroring the behavior observed for subphases with different viscosities. These findings demonstrate how the interplay between surface-tension gradients, subphase properties, and film mechanics governs local fracture and pattern formation in fluid-supported thin films"

While effective at prediction, these models offer limited insight into the interpretable factors that guide human decisions. We introduce an explicit formulation of object arrangement preferences along four interpretable constructs: spatial practicality (putting items where they naturally fit best in the space), habitual convenience (making frequently used items easy to reach), semantic coherence (placing items together if they are used for the same task or are contextually related), and commonsense appropriateness (putting things where people would usually expect to find them). To capture these constructs, we designed and validated a self-report questionnaire through a 63-participant online study. Results confirm the psychological distinctiveness of these constructs and their explanatory power across two scenarios (kitchen and living room). We demonstrate the utility of these constructs by integrating them into a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planner and show that when guided by participant-derived preferences, our planner can generate reasonable arrangements that closely align with those generated by participants. This work contributes a compact, interpretable formulation of object arrangement preferences and a demonstration of how it can be operationalized for robot planning."

We propose a novel unsupervised machine learning framework that employs a kernel defined in momentum-time ($\\boldsymbol{k},t$) space, constructed directly from Floquet-Bloch eigenstates. This approach is intrinsically data-driven and requires no prior knowledge of the underlying topological invariants, providing a fundamental advantage over prior methods that rely on abstract concepts like the micromotion operator or homotopic transformations. Crucially, this work successfully reveals the intrinsic topological characteristics encoded within the Floquet eigenstates themselves. We demonstrate that our method robustly and simultaneously identifies the topological invariants associated with both the $0$-gap and the $π$-gap across various symmetry classes (1D AIII, 1D D, and 2D A), establishing a robust methodology for the systematic classification and discovery of complex non-equilibrium topological matter."

We lay out a criterion for when the continuum of collisions affects the convergence of the hydrodynamic derivative expansion. Finally, the radius of convergence of hydrodynamic dispersion relations in anisotropic systems is bounded from above on the basis of compatibility with microscopic causality."

Applied to sodium manganese hexacyanoferrate, a promising cathode material for grid-scale sodium-ion batteries, our methodology employs an active-learning strategy to train a Moment Tensor Potential through iterative hybrid grand-canonical Monte Carlo--molecular dynamics sampling, robustly capturing configuration spaces at all sodiation levels. The resulting machine learning interatomic potential accurately reproduces experimental properties including volume expansion, operating voltage, and sodium concentration-dependent structural transformations, while revealing a four-order-of-magnitude difference in sodium diffusivity between the rhombohedral (sodium-rich) and tetragonal (sodium-poor) phases at 300 K. We directly compute all critical parameters -- temperature- and concentration-dependent diffusivities, interfacial and strain energies, and complete free-energy landscapes -- to feed them into pseudo-2D phase-field simulations that predict phase-boundary propagation and rate-dependent performances across electrode length scales. This multiscale workflow establishes a blueprint for rational computational design of next-generation insertion-type materials, such as battery electrode materials, demonstrating how atomistic insights can be systematically translated into continuum-scale predictions."

This paper investigates a wireless powered ISAC system with target localization requirements, where users harvest energy from wireless power transfer (WPT) and then conduct ISAC transmissions in a time-division manner. In addition to energy supply, the WPT signal also contributes to target sensing, and the localization accuracy is characterized by Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) constraints. Under this setting, we formulate a max-min throughput maximization problem by jointly allocating the WPT duration, ISAC transmission time allocation, and transmit power. Due to the nonconvexity of the resulting problem, a suitable reformulation is developed by exploiting variable substitutions and the monotonicity of logarithmic functions, based on which an efficient successive convex approximation (SCA)-based iterative algorithm is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate convergence and significant performance gains over benchmark schemes, highlighting the importance of coordinated time-power optimization in balancing sensing accuracy and communication performance in wireless powered ISAC systems."

    "abstract": "The dark sector may possess a rich structure yet to be uncovered, and a QCD-like dark sector with GeV-scale dark hadrons can yield novel signatures at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In this work, we focus on a light singlet pseudoscalar mediator that connects the QCD-like dark sector to the Standard Model (SM) sector via the Higgs portal. Notably, when the lightest unstable dark meson has a mass of approximately $3$ GeV, it predominantly decays into a pair of gluons and behaves as a long-lived particle, a scenario that has received relatively little attention. We consider various Higgs production channels at the LHC and investigate two processes for generating dark mesons: (1) the cascade decay of the Higgs boson into a pair of light pseudoscalar mediators, which subsequently decay into four dark mesons; and (2) the dark shower and hadronization process whereby the Higgs boson decays into a pair of dark quarks that subsequently evolve into dark mesons. These processes give rise to novel gluon-rich dark jets composed of long-lived dark mesons. Notably, we find that appropriate trigger selection constitutes a crucial factor for detecting these signal signatures in both tracker system and CMS muon system. At the high-luminosity LHC, the exotic Higgs branching ratio to cascade decays (dark showers) can be constrained below $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-5}-10^{-1})$ [$\\mathcal{O}(10^{-5}-10^{-2})$] for dark meson proper lifetimes $cτ$ ranging from $1$ mm to $100$ m."

Although the deformation is invisible on a single qubit, it resurfaces in the two-qubit sector through the non-cocommutative coproduct, yielding a family of intrinsically nonlocal unitaries. We compute their operator entanglement in closed form and show that, for Haar-uniform product inputs, their entangling power is fully determined by the latter. This provides a concrete mechanism by which non-commutative symmetries enforce a baseline of entanglement at the algebraic level, with implications for information dynamics in quantum-spacetime settings and quantum information processing."

However, in wet active systems, attractive hydrodynamic interactions mediated by active particles stalled at a boundary can introduce complementary mechanisms for aggregation. In the work of Caciagli et al. (PRL 125, 068001, 2020), it was shown that the attractive hydrodynamic interactions due to active particles stalled at a boundary can be described in terms of an effective potential. In this paper, we present a model of active Brownian particles, where a fraction of active particles are stalled, and thus, mediate inter-particle interactions through the effective potential. Our investigation of the model reveals that a small fraction of stalled particles in the system allows for the formation of dynamical clusters at significantly lower densities than predicted by standard MIPS. We provide a comprehensive phase diagram in terms of weighted average cluster sizes that is mapped in the plane of the fraction of stalled particles ($α$) and the Peclet number. Our findings demonstrate that even a marginal value of $α$ is sufficient to drive phase separation at low global densities, bridging the gap between theoretical models and experimental observations of dilute active systems."

By exploiting a wider spectrum, multiple antennas and flexible architectures, cellular positioning achieves ever-increasing positioning accuracy. Still, it faces fundamental performance degradation when the distance between user equipment (UE) and the base station (BS) is large or in non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios. To this end, the 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) Rel-18 proposes to standardize sidelink (SL) positioning, which provides unique opportunities to extend the positioning coverage via direct positioning signaling between UEs. Despite the standardization advancements, the capability of SL positioning is controversial, especially how much spectrum is required to achieve the positioning accuracy defined in 3GPP. To this end, this article summarizes the latest standardization advancements of 3GPP on SL positioning comprehensively, covering a) network architecture; b) positioning types; and c) performance requirements. The capability of SL positioning using various positioning methods under different imperfect factors is evaluated and discussed in-depth. Finally, according to the evolution of SL in 3GPP Rel-19, we discuss the possible research directions and challenges of SL positioning."

Specifically, quantized discrete values are encoded into binary sequences using the two's complement and transmitted over multiple subcarriers. At the receiver, we design a decoder that constructs a functional mapping between the superimposed digital modulation signals and the target of computational results, theoretically ensuring asymptotic error free computation with the minimal codeword length. To further mitigate the adverse effects of channel fading, we adopt a truncated inversion strategy for pre-processing. Benefiting from the unified symbol distribution after the proposed encoding, we derive the optimal linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) detector in closed form and propose a low complexity algorithm seeking for the optimal truncation selection. Furthermore, the inherent importance differences among the coded outputs motivate an uneven power allocation strategy across subcarriers to improve computational accuracy. Numerical results validate the superiority of the proposed scheme over existing digital AirComp approaches, especially at low signal to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes."

    "abstract": "This study presents the design, simulation, and experimental validation of a dual-tuned concentric multimodal surface coil for 7T 1H/31P magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI), developed to significantly enhance 31P B1 efficiency while improving 1H performance. The coil architecture utilizes two interleaved sets of three concentric loop resonators. Intra-nucleus electromagnetic coupling within each three-loop set generates a spectrum of eigenmodes; the operational modes for 1H and 31P were specifically selected because their co-directed current distributions reinforce the magnetic field at the center, yielding B1 patterns that resemble those of conventional single-loop surface coils but with superior efficiency. Full-wave electromagnetic simulations and bench measurements on a fabricated prototype were conducted to characterize the multimodal resonance behavior, scattering parameters, B1 distribution, and 10-g local SAR, using size-matched conventional single-tuned loops as references. The results confirmed that the design reproducibly generated the predicted eigenmode ordering with sufficient spectral separation to prevent interference from parasitic or undesired modes. Notably, the multimodal design achieved an 83% boost in 31P B1 efficiency and a 21% boost in 1H B1 efficiency at the coil center compared to same-sized single-tuned references. Sufficient inter-nuclear decoupling was achieved to prevent signal leakage between channels, and simulations with a human head model confirmed that the peak 10-g local SAR remained comparable to conventional designs. These findings demonstrate that this multimodal concentric design offers a robust and highly efficient solution for multinuclear MRSI at ultrahigh fields, effectively mitigating the sensitivity limitations of X-nuclei without compromising proton-based imaging capabilities."

However, current literature often overlooks the significant computational burden associated with generating long reasoning sequences. For industrial applications, model selection depends not only on raw accuracy but also on resource constraints and inference costs. In this work, we conduct a test-time-compute aware evaluation of both contemporary and older open-source LLMs, mapping their Pareto frontiers across math- and reasoning-intensive benchmarks. Our findings identify the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture as a strong candidate to balance performance and efficiency in our evaluation setting. Furthermore, we trace the trajectory of Pareto efficiency over time to derive an emergent trend regarding accuracy gain per unit of compute. Finally, we demonstrate that there is a saturation point for inference-time compute. Beyond a certain threshold, accuracy gains diminish, indicating that while extended reasoning capabilities are beneficial, they cannot overcome intrinsic model limitations regarding specific complexities."

First, we develop a solid geometric framework for the theory by creating isochrons, which are the level sets of the asymptotic phase, using the Graph Transform theorem. We show that isochrons form an invariant, continuous structure of the basin of attraction of a stable limit cycle, helping to clarify the concept of the asymptotic phase. Second, we systematically explain how to derive the first-order phase reduction for weakly perturbed and coupled systems. In the end, we discuss the limitations of the first-order approach, particularly its restriction to very small perturbations and the issue of vanishing coupling terms in certain networks. We finish by outlining the framework and importance of higher-order phase reductions. This establishes a clear link from classical theory to modern developments and sets the stage for a more in-depth discussion in a future publication."

While one basis yields a zero current, another produces the standard nonzero value. We then consider a potential that is rapidly switched on, recovering the standard current in the asymptotic future. This result is generalized to potentials that interpolate between different constant values at spatial infinity.

Its dual-scale architecture fuses long- and short-scale temporal evolution adaptively. Evaluated on 15 years of Fermi/GBM triggers, the optimal model achieves 97.23% accuracy when trained on complete energy spectra. A lightweight version using only three broad energy bands retains 95.07% accuracy, demonstrating that coarse spectral information fused with temporal context enables robust discrimination. The system significantly outperforms the GBM in-flight classifier on three months of independent test data. Feature visualization reveals well-separated class clusters, confirming physical interpretability. LUNCH combines high accuracy, low computational cost, and instrument-agnostic inputs, offering a practical solution for real-time in-flight processing that enables timely triggers for immediate multi-wavelength and multi-messenger follow-up observations in future time-domain missions."

The analysis of structural properties, such as the radial distribution functions and the hexatic order parameter, shows that the high-density coexisting state in the binary case is spatially disordered, unlike the solid-like state observed for the monocomponent system. Characterization of the mean-square displacement of the active particles shows that both the low- and high-density coexisting states have diffusive behavior for long times. Thus, the high-density coexisting states are liquid-like in the binary cases. Moreover, diffusive behavior is also observed in the high-density solid-like state for the monocomponent system, which is driven by the presence of active topological defects."

A corollary is that there are small but significant correlations between characters at these separations, as we show from the data independent of models. The distribution of code lengths reveals an emergent certainty about an increasing fraction of characters at large $N$. Over the course of model training, we observe different dynamics at long and short context lengths, suggesting that long-ranged structure is learned only gradually. Our results constrain efforts to build statistical physics models of LLMs or language itself."

This paper challenges this belief and revisits acceleration from a complementary angle: beyond solver order, the placement of DPM evaluations along the reverse-time dynamics can substantially affect sampling accuracy in the low-neural function evaluation (NFE) regime. We propose a novel training-free, first-order sampler whose leading discretization error has the opposite sign to that of DDIM. Algorithmically, the method approximates the forward-value evaluation via a cheap one-step lookahead predictor. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that the resulting sampler provably approximates the ideal forward-value trajectory while retaining first-order convergence. Empirically, across standard image generation benchmarks (CIFAR-10, ImageNet, FFHQ, and LSUN), the proposed sampler consistently improves sample quality under the same NFE budget and can be competitive with, and sometimes outperform, state-of-the-art higher-order samplers. Overall, the results suggest that the placement of DPM evaluations provides an additional and largely independent design angle for accelerating diffusion sampling."

At the critical point, we demonstrate conformal multiplet structure together with the hallmark of emergent spacetime supersymmetry through characteristic relations between fermionic and bosonic operators. Moreover, by tuning the Yukawa coupling, we explicitly track the evolution of operator spectra from the decoupled Ising-Majorana fixed point to the interacting superconformal fixed point, revealing renormalization-group flow at the operator level.

    "abstract": "We introduce a new approach for analyzing ancient solutions and singularities of mean curvature flow that are locally modeled on a cylinder. Its key ingredient is a general mechanism, called the \\emph{PDE--ODI principle}, which converts a broad class of parabolic differential equations into systems of ordinary differential inequalities. This principle bypasses many delicate analytic estimates used in previous work, and yields asymptotic expansions to arbitrarily high order. As an application, we establish the uniqueness of the bowl soliton times a Euclidean factor among ancient, cylindrical flows with dominant linear mode. This extends previous results on this problem to the most general setting and is made possible by the stronger asymptotic control provided by our analysis. In the other case, when the quadratic mode dominates, we obtain a complete asymptotic expansion to arbitrary polynomial order, which will form the basis for a subsequent paper. Our framework also recovers and unifies several classical results. In particular, we give new proofs of the uniqueness of tangent flows (due to Colding-Minicozzi) and the rigidity of cylinders among shrinkers (due to Colding-Ilmanen-Minicozzi) by reducing both problems to a single ordinary differential inequality, without using the Łojasiewicz-Simon inequality. Our approach is independent of prior work and the paper is largely self-contained."

Moreover, we establish a canonical neighborhood theorem near such points, which characterizes the flow via local models. We also obtain a more uniform version of the Mean Convex Neighborhood Conjecture, which only requires closeness to a cylinder at some initial time and yields a quantitative version of this structural description. Our proof relies on a complete classification of ancient, asymptotically cylindrical flows. We prove that any such flow is non-collapsed, convex, rotationally symmetric, and belongs to one of three canonical families: ancient ovals, the bowl soliton, or the flying wing translating solitons. Central to our method is a refined asymptotic analysis and a novel \\emph{leading mode condition,} together with a new ``induction over thresholds'' argument. In addition, our approach provides a full parameterization of the space of asymptotically cylindrical flows and gives a new proof of the existence of flying wing solitons.

Our analysis focuses on both traffic patterns and communication overhead. Specifically, we investigate predictable traffic patterns in typical LLMs and evaluate how various factors influence GPU utilization and effective bandwidth (two critical variables affecting communication overhead). Furthermore, we develop an analytical formulation to estimate communication overhead in LLM training, which is validated with high accuracy against empirical data. Leveraging this formulation, we propose a configuration tuning tool, ConfigTuner, to optimize training performance.

To address this, we propose a novel multi-objective optimization framework that jointly optimizes all four criteria via the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), generating a diverse Pareto front of trade-off solutions. We use a specific selection mechanism to extract a premium on this front. Our results show that XGBoost outperforms GLM in accuracy but amplifies fairness disparities; the Orthogonal model excels in group fairness, while Synthetic Control leads in individual and counterfactual fairness.

The energy dispersion of the SSH model is dominated by a gap around zero energy, which suppresses the transmission. This exponential suppression of the transmission with system length is determined by the Lyapounov exponent. Here we find an analytical expression of the Lyapounov as a function of energy in the presence of both diagonal and off-diagonal disorder. We obtain this result by finding a recurrence relation for the local density, which can be averaged over different disorder configurations. There is excellent agreement between our analytical expression and the numerical results over a wide range of disorder strengths and disorder types.

    "abstract": "Brownian circuits implement computation through stochastic transitions driven by thermal fluctuations. While the energetic costs of such fluctuation-driven computation have been extensively studied within stochastic thermodynamics, much less is known about its computational complexity, in particular how computation time scales with circuit size. Here, the computation time of explicitly designed Brownian circuits is investigated numerically via the first-passage time to a completed state. For arithmetic circuits such as adders, varying the forward transition rate induces a sharp change in the scaling behavior of the mean computation time, from linear to exponential in circuit size. This change can be interpreted as an easy-hard transition in computational time complexity. The transition suggests that, for meaningful computational tasks, achieving efficient polynomial-time computation generically requires a finite forward bias, corresponding to a nonzero energy input. As a counterexample, it is shown that arbitrary logical operations can be reduced to an effectively one-dimensional stochastic process, for which the zero-bias limit lines within the computationally efficient (easy) regime. However, realizing such a one-dimensional normal form unavoidably leads to an exponential increase in circuit size. These results reveal a fundamental trade-off between computation time, circuit size, and energy input in Brownian circuits, and demonstrate that phase transitions in time complexity provide a natural framework for characterizing the cost of fluctuation-driven computation."

A charged body moving through a dusty plasma medium can generate diverse nonlinear waves, such as precursors and pinned solitons.

We have examined the role of the driver in shaping and evolving these wave excitations. In particular we studied the effect of primarily three source parameters, namely, amplitude, width, and flow speed, on the evolution of nonlinear structures. The driver generates a perturbation in the stable system configuration, which couples with medium characteristics and eventually evolves into propagating excitations. Our finding shows that the excitation of nonlinear structure by a moving body in a plasma medium is not just dictated by the mach number but also the features of the source such as amplitude and width. As a novel finding apart from pinned and precursor solitons, we observe another nonlinear structure that lags behind the source term, maintaining its shape and speed as it propagates. These features are the first ever theoretical depiction of such lagging structures."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider a class of constrained multiobjective optimization problems, where each objective function can be expressed by adding a possibly nonsmooth nonconvex function and a differentiable function with Lipschitz continuous gradient, then subtracting a weakly convex function. This encompasses multiobjective optimization problems involving difference-of-convex (DC) functions, which are prevalent in various applications due to their ability to model nonconvex problems. We first establish necessary and sufficient optimality conditions for these problems, providing a theoretical foundation for algorithm development. Building on these conditions, we propose a proximal subgradient algorithm tailored to the structure of the objectives. Under mild assumptions, the sequence generated by the proposed algorithm is bounded and each of its cluster points is a stationary solution."

A focus is on nonlocally interacting spin systems realized by coupling many atoms to a delocalized mode of light. We will build up from the fundamentals: understanding how a cavity enables light to coherently imprint information on atoms and atoms to imprint information on the light, enabling quantum non-demolition measurements that constitute a powerful means of engineering nonclassical states. By extension, letting the intracavity light act back on the atoms enables coherent photon-mediated interactions. I start by discussing collective spin models, emphasizing applications in entanglement-enhanced metrology, before proceeding to richer many-body physics enabled by incorporating spatiotemporal control or employing multiple cavity modes. I will highlight opportunities for leveraging these tools for quantum simulations inspired by problems in condensed matter and quantum gravity. Along the way, I provide a pedagogical introduction to criteria for strong atom-light coupling, illustrate how the corresponding figure of merit -- the cooperativity -- sets fundamental limits on the coherence of atom-light interactions, and discuss prospects for harnessing high-cooperativity cavity QED in quantum simulation and computation."

    "abstract": "Generating dynamic motions for legged robots remains a challenging problem. While reinforcement learning has achieved notable success in various legged locomotion tasks, producing highly dynamic behaviors often requires extensive reward tuning or high-quality demonstrations. Leveraging reduced-order models can help mitigate these challenges. However, the model discrepancy poses a significant challenge when transferring policies to full-body dynamics environments. In this work, we introduce a continuation-based learning framework that combines simplified model pretraining and model homotopy transfer to efficiently generate and refine complex dynamic behaviors. First, we pretrain the policy using a single rigid body model to capture core motion patterns in a simplified environment. Next, we employ a continuation strategy to progressively transfer the policy to the full-body environment, minimizing performance loss. To define the continuation path, we introduce a model homotopy from the single rigid body model to the full-body model by gradually redistributing mass and inertia between the trunk and legs. The proposed method not only achieves faster convergence but also demonstrates superior stability during the transfer process compared to baseline methods. Our framework is validated on a range of dynamic tasks, including flips and wall-assisted maneuvers, and is successfully deployed on a real quadrupedal robot."

We propose and evaluate an integrated Waste-to-Energy-AI Data Center configuration that treats cooling as a first-class energy service rather than an unavoidable electricity burden. The coupled system is modeled as an input-output 'black box' with transparent boundaries and a standalone benchmark in which mechanical chilling is powered by grid electricity. The central mechanism is energy-grade matching: low-grade WtE thermal output drives absorption cooling to deliver chilled service, thereby displacing baseline cooling electricity. We show that thermoeconomic superiority is governed by three first-order determinants, (i) cooling coverage of IT heat load, (ii) parasitic electricity for transport and auxiliaries, and (iii) distance-driven delivery decay, yielding a break-even corridor beyond which net benefits vanish. Comparative statics characterize sensitivity to IT utilization, feedstock quality (waste LHV and throughput), climate parameterization, and corridor distance. We translate these accounting gains into decision language through a computable prototype for Levelized Cost of Computing (LCOC) and an ESG valuation channel grounded in measurable mechanisms, without re-deriving full lifecycle inventories. The framework provides siting-ready feasibility conditions for WtE-AIDC coupling in urban AI corridors under grid stress."

    "abstract": "Magnetic impurities in strongly correlated electronic systems serve as sensitive probes to a wide range of many-body quantum phenomena. Broken symmetries in such a system can lead to inequivalent lattice sites, and magnetic impurities may interact selectively with particular orbitals or sublattices. However, the microscopic mechanisms behind such site-specific interactions have been poorly understood. Here, we explore the behavior of individual Fe adatoms on a cluster-Mott charge-density-wave (CDW) system of 1T-TaS2 utilizing scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) and density functional theory (DFT). Our measurements uncover pronounced site-dependent electronic states of CDW clusters with Fe adatoms, indicating distinct local coupling to cluster-Mott states. DFT calculations identify three distinct types of interactions; hybridization with localized correlated electrons, distorting the CDW cluster, and charge transfer. In particular, the hybridization of Fe 3d and half-filled Ta 5dz2 orbitals suppresses the Mott insulating state for an adatom at the center of a CDW cluster. While the results underscore a crucial role of the direct orbital hybridization and the limitation of the prevailing single-site Kondo impurity model, they suggest the possibility of controlling entangled interactions separately in a cluster Mott insulator."

Based on this architecture, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) to minimize the task completion delay and energy consumption by jointly optimizing task offloading, UAV trajectory control, IRS phase-shift configuration, and computation resource allocation. The considered problem is NP-hard, and thus we propose a hierarchical online optimization approach (HOOA) to efficiently solve the problem. Specifically, we reformulate the MOOP as a Stackelberg game, where MEC servers collectively act as the leader to determine the system-level decisions, while the vehicles act as followers to make individual decisions. At the follower level, we present a many-to-one matching mechanism to generate feasible discrete decisions. At the leader level, we propose a generative diffusion model-enhanced twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (GDMTD3) algorithm integrated with a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)-based method, which is a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach, to determine the continuous decisions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed HOOA achieves significant improvements, which reduces average task completion delay by 2.5% and average energy consumption by 3.1% compared with the best-performing benchmark approach and state-of-the-art DRL algorithm, respectively. Moreover, the proposed HOOA exhibits superior convergence stability while maintaining strong robustness and scalability in dynamic environments."

Meeting these conflicting requirements remains challenging, as satisfying this combination typically necessitates heavier actuators and bulkier transmission systems, significantly restricting the payload capacity of robot arms. In this letter, we present a lightweight anthropomorphic hand actuated by Bowden cables, which uniquely combines rolling-contact joint optimization with antagonistic cable actuation, enabling single-motor-per-joint control with negligible cable-length deviation. By relocating the actuator module to the torso, the design substantially reduces distal mass while maintaining anthropomorphic scale and dexterity. Additionally, this antagonistic cable actuation eliminates the need for synchronization between motors. Using the proposed methods, the hand assembly with a distal mass of 236g (excluding remote actuators and Bowden sheaths) demonstrated reliable execution of dexterous tasks, exceeding 18N fingertip force and lifting payloads over one hundred times its own mass. Furthermore, robustness was validated through Cutkosky taxonomy grasps and trajectory consistency under perturbed actuator-hand transformations."

These ingredients define an \"information volume\" for each observational cell. By incorporating the logarithm of this volume as an additional constraint in a minimum-relative-entropy inference scheme, temperature, chemical potential, and pressure arise as conjugate variables of a single information-theoretic functional. This leads to a Legendre-type structure and a first-law-like relation in which pressure corresponds to information volume rather than geometric volume. For nonequilibrium dynamics, entropy production is characterized through the relative-entropy asymmetry between forward and time-reversed stochastic evolutions. A decomposition using observational entropy then separates total dissipation into system and environment contributions. Heat is defined as the part of dissipation not accounted for by the system-entropy change, yielding a representation that does not rely on local detailed balance or a specific bath model. We further show that the difference between joint and partially observed dissipation equals the average of conditional relative entropies, providing a unified interpretation of hidden dissipation and information-flow terms as projection-induced gaps."

We identified 216 energy-explicit PRs and conducted a thematic analysis, deriving a taxonomy of energy-aware work. Our further analysis of the applied optimization techniques shows that most align with established research recommendations.

By setting the matrix size to one, we analyze a convergent non-perturbative partition function expressed as a two-dimensional integral, and show that it satisfies a third-order linear differential equation. In contrast, in the absence of coupling to the critical Ising model, the continuum partition function of pure BPs with loops is known to satisfy the Airy equation. From the viewpoint of two-dimensional quantum gravity, we introduce a non-perturbative loop amplitude that serves as a solution to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation incorporating contributions from all genera. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the same Wheeler-DeWitt equation can also be derived through the stochastic quantization."

We introduce a clinically inspired hierarchical machine learning framework for automated classification of eight benign voice disorders alongside healthy controls, using acoustic features extracted from short, sustained vowel phonations. Experiments utilized 15,132 recordings from 1,261 speakers in the Saarbruecken Voice Database, covering vowels /a/, /i/, and /u/ at neutral, high, low, and gliding pitches. Mirroring clinical triage workflows, the framework operates in three sequential stages: Stage 1 performs binary screening of pathological versus non-pathological voices by integrating convolutional neural network-derived mel-spectrogram features with 21 interpretable acoustic biomarkers; Stage 2 stratifies voices into Healthy, Functional or Psychogenic, and Structural or Inflammatory groups using a cubic support vector machine; Stage 3 achieves fine-grained classification by incorporating probabilistic outputs from prior stages, improving discrimination of structural and inflammatory disorders relative to functional conditions. The proposed system consistently outperformed flat multi-class classifiers and pre-trained self-supervised models, including META HuBERT and Google HeAR, whose generic objectives are not optimized for sustained clinical phonation. By combining deep spectral representations with interpretable acoustic features, the framework enhances transparency and clinical alignment. These results highlight the potential of quantitative voice biomarkers as scalable, non-invasive tools for early screening, diagnostic triage, and longitudinal monitoring of vocal health."

    "abstract": "Accurate traffic prediction is essential for Intelligent Transportation Systems, including ride-hailing, urban road planning, and vehicle fleet management. However, due to significant privacy concerns surrounding traffic data, most existing methods rely on local training, resulting in data silos and limited knowledge sharing. Federated Learning (FL) offers an efficient solution through privacy-preserving collaborative training; however, standard FL struggles with the non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) problem among clients. This challenge has led to the emergence of Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) as a promising paradigm. Nevertheless, current PFL frameworks require further adaptation for traffic prediction tasks, such as specialized graph feature engineering, data processing, and network architecture design. A notable limitation of many prior studies is their reliance on hyper-parameter optimization across datasets-information that is often unavailable in real-world scenarios-thus impeding practical deployment. To address this challenge, we propose AutoFed, a novel PFL framework for traffic prediction that eliminates the need for manual hyper-parameter tuning. Inspired by prompt learning, AutoFed introduces a federated representor that employs a client-aligned adapter to distill local data into a compact, globally shared prompt matrix. This prompt then conditions a personalized predictor, allowing each client to benefit from cross-client knowledge while maintaining local specificity. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that AutoFed consistently achieves superior performance across diverse scenarios.

    "abstract": "The orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) signal is considered a promising solution for high-mobility wireless environments. It manages Doppler effects by utilizing delay-Doppler (DD) domain processing. However, the relatively long OTFS frame duration could introduce considerable sensing or communication latency when radar and communication are performed separately. By operating in a dual-functional radar and communication (DFRC) mode, the OTFS system performs sensing and data transmission simultaneously, thereby reducing the resulting latency. Nevertheless, the optimal OTFS DFRC signal strategy remains insufficiently explored. This paper investigates the optimal signal design for OTFS DFRC systems, focusing on pilot symbol design and data symbol power allocation. Specifically, we derive a channel capacity lower bound metric for communication that considers channel estimation errors in OTFS. For sensing, we derive an integrated sidelobe level (ISL), accounting for the randomness of the data symbols alongside the deterministic pilot symbols. Leveraging the above metrics, we formulate an optimization problem that balances radar and communication performance, and then solve it using an alternating optimization framework. We validate the proposed signal through numerical analysis and Monte Carlo simulations. Our analysis shows that OTFS DFRC enforces a deterministic pilot signal that is characterized by a concentrated peak in the DD domain, which furnishes a common structure in the DD domain facilitating sensing and channel estimation, with data multiplexed in other DD grids, thereby unifying sensing and communication within a single OTFS signal. Compared with conventional OTFS signals, the proposed OTFS DFRC signal expands the achievable sensing-communication performance region, delivering at least a 9.45 dB ISL suppression for sensing and a 4.82 dB SINR ratio gain for communication."

    "abstract": "Object detection in fire rescue scenarios is importance for command and decision-making in firefighting operations. However, existing research still suffers from two main limitations. First, current work predominantly focuses on environments such as mountainous or forest areas, while paying insufficient attention to urban rescue scenes, which are more frequent and structurally complex. Second, existing detection systems include a limited number of classes, such as flames and smoke, and lack a comprehensive system covering key targets crucial for command decisions, such as fire trucks and firefighters. To address the above issues, this paper first constructs a new dataset named \"FireRescue\" for rescue command, which covers multiple rescue scenarios, including urban, mountainous, forest, and water areas, and contains eight key categories such as fire trucks and firefighters, with a total of 15,980 images and 32,000 bounding boxes. Secondly, to tackle the problems of inter-class confusion and missed detection of small targets caused by chaotic scenes, diverse targets, and long-distance shooting, this paper proposes an improved model named FRS-YOLO. On the one hand, the model introduces a plug-and-play multidi-mensional collaborative enhancement attention module, which enhances the discriminative representation of easily confused categories (e.g., fire trucks vs. ordinary trucks) through cross-dimensional feature interaction. On the other hand, it integrates a dynamic feature sampler to strengthen high-response foreground features, thereby mitigating the effects of smoke occlusion and background interference. Experimental results demonstrate that object detection in fire rescue scenarios is highly challenging, and the proposed method effectively improves the detection performance of YOLO series models in this context."

To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel method called Layer-by-Layer Hierarchical Attention Network, which enhances the precision of feature point matching in computer vision by addressing the issue of outliers. Our method incorporates stage fusion, hierarchical extraction, and an attention mechanism to improve the network's representation capability by emphasizing the rich semantic information of feature points. Specifically, we introduce a layer-by-layer channel fusion module, which preserves the feature semantic information from each stage and achieves overall fusion, thereby enhancing the representation capability of the feature points. Additionally, we design a hierarchical attention module that adaptively captures and fuses global perception and structural semantic information using an attention mechanism. Finally, we propose two architectures to extract and integrate features, thereby improving the adaptability of our network. We conduct experiments on two public datasets, namely YFCC100M and SUN3D, and the results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art techniques in both outlier removal and camera pose estimation.

Conventional intent-based networking (IBN) methods depend on statistical language models to interpret user intent but cannot guarantee the feasibility of generated configurations. To overcome this, we develop a two-stage framework consisting of an Interpreter, which extracts intent from natural language prompts using NLP, and an Optimizer, which computes feasible virtual machine (VM) placement and routing via an integer linear programming. In particular, the Interpreter translates user chats into update directions, i.e., whether to increase, decrease, or maintain parameters such as CPU demand and latency bounds, thereby enabling iterative refinement of the network configuration. In this paper, two intent extractors, which are a Sentence-BERT model with support vector machine (SVM) classifiers and a large language model (LLM), are introduced. Experiments in single-user and multi-user settings show that the framework dynamically updates VM placement and routing while preserving feasibility. The LLM-based extractor achieves higher accuracy with fewer labeled samples, whereas the Sentence-BERT with SVM classifiers provides significantly lower latency suitable for real-time operation. These results underscore the effectiveness of combining NLP-driven intent extraction with optimization-based allocation for safe, interpretable, and user-friendly virtual network management."

ExoAtom is designed for detailed astrophysical, planetary, and laboratory applications. ExoAtom currently includes atomic data for 80 neutral atoms and 74 singly charged ions. These data are extracted from both the NIST and Kurucz databases, with 79/71 atoms/ions sourced from NIST and 38/37 atoms/ions sourced from Kurucz. ExoAtom uses the file types .all, .def, .states, .trans and .pf as fundamental components for structuring atomic data in a consistent hierarchy. The .states file contains quantum numbers, uncertainties, lifetimes, etc. The .trans file specifies Einstein A coefficients and their associated wavenumbers. The .pf file provides partition functions over a wide grid of temperatures. Post-processing of the ExoAtom data is provided by the program PyExoCross. Future development of ExoAtom will include additional ionization stages."

    "abstract": "Semantic communication (SemCom) has emerged as a promising paradigm for future wireless networks by prioritizing task-relevant meaning over raw data delivery, thereby reducing communication overhead and improving efficiency. However, shifting from bit-accurate transmission to task-oriented delivery introduces new security and privacy risks. These include semantic leakage, semantic manipulation, knowledge base vulnerabilities, model-related attacks, and threats to authenticity and availability. Most existing secure SemCom studies focus on analog SemCom, where semantic features are mapped to continuous channel inputs. In contrast, digital SemCom transmits semantic information through discrete bits or symbols within practical transceiver pipelines, offering stronger compatibility with realworld systems while exposing a distinct and underexplored attack surface. In particular, digital SemCom typically represents semantic information over a finite alphabet through explicit digital modulation, following two main routes: probabilistic modulation and deterministic modulation. These discrete mechanisms and practical transmission procedures introduce additional vulnerabilities affecting bit- or symbol-level semantic information, the modulation stage, and packet-based delivery and protocol operations. Motivated by these challenges and the lack of a systematic analysis of secure digital SemCom, this paper reviews SemCom fundamentals, clarifies the architectural differences between analog and digital SemCom and their security implications, organizes the threat landscape for digital SemCom, and discusses potential defenses. Finally, we outline open research directions toward secure and deployable digital SemCom systems."

    "abstract": "This work investigates dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) in a one-dimensional Ising model subjected to a periodically modulated transverse field. In contrast to sudden quenches, we demonstrate that DQPTs can be induced in two distinct ways. First, when the system remains within a given phase--ferromagnetic (FM) or paramagnetic (PM), a resonant periodic drive can trigger a DQPT when its frequency matches the energy-level transition of the system. The timescale for the transition is governed by the perturbation strength $λ'$, the critical mode $k_c$, and its energy gap $Δ_{k_c}$, following the scaling relation $τ\\propto \\sin^{-1}k_c Δ_{k_c}λ'^{-1}$. Second, for drives across the critical point between the FM and PM phases, low frequencies can always induce DQPTs, regardless of resonance. This behavior stems from the degeneracy of the energy-level at the critical point, which ensures that any drive with a frequency lower than the system's intrinsic transition frequency will inevitably excite the system. However, in the high-frequency regime, such excitation will be strongly suppressed, thereby inhibiting the occurrence of DQPTs. This study provides deeper insight into the nonequilibrium dynamics of quantum spin chains."

    "abstract": "Fully automated verification of large-scale software and hardware systems is arguably the holy grail of formal methods. Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated their potential for enhancing the degree of automation in formal verification by, e.g., generating formal specifications as essential to deductive verification, yet exhibit poor scalability due to long-context reasoning limitations and, more importantly, the difficulty of inferring complex, interprocedural specifications. This paper presents Preguss -- a modular, fine-grained framework for automating the generation and refinement of formal specifications. Preguss synergizes between static analysis and deductive verification by steering two components in a divide-and-conquer fashion: (i) potential runtime error-guided construction and prioritization of verification units, and (ii) LLM-aided synthesis of interprocedural specifications at the unit level. We show that Preguss substantially outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based approaches and, in particular, it enables highly automated RTE-freeness verification for real-world programs with over a thousand LoC, with a reduction of 80.6%~88.9% human verification effort."

    "abstract": "The QAOA has been the subject of intense study over recent years, yet the corresponding Dynamical Lie Algebra (DLA)--a key indicator of the expressivity and trainability of VQAs--remains poorly understood beyond highly symmetric instances. An exponentially scaling DLA dimension is associated with the presence of so-called barren plateaus (BP) in the optimization landscape, which renders training intractable. In this work, we investigate the DLA of QAOA applied to the canonical MaxCut, for both weighted and unweighted graphs. For weighted graphs, we show that when the weights are drawn from a continuous distribution, the DLA dimension grows as $Θ(4^n)$ almost surely for all connected graphs except paths and cycles. In the more common unweighted setting, we show that asymptotically all but an exponentially vanishing fraction of graphs have $Θ(4^n)$ large DLA dimension. The entire simple Lie algebra decomposition of the corresponding DLAs is also identified, from which we prove that the variance of the loss function is $O(1/2^n)$, implying that QAOA on these weighted and unweighted graphs all suffers from BP. Moreover, we give explicit constructions for families of graphs whose DLAs have exponential dimension, including cases whose MaxCut is in $\\mathsf P$. Our proof of the unweighted case is based on a number of splitting lemmas and DLA-freeness conditions that allow one to convert prohibitively complicated Lie algebraic problems into amenable graph theoretic problems. These form the basis for a new algorithm that computes such DLAs orders of magnitude faster than previous methods, reducing runtimes from days to seconds on standard hardware. We apply this algorithm to MQLib, a classical MaxCut benchmark suite covering over 3,500 instances with up to 53,130 vertices, and find that, ignoring edge weights, at least 75% of the instances possess a DLA of dimension at least $2^{128}$."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to solve complex tasks. While effective, these trajectories are frequently inefficient, leading to high latency from excessive token generation, or unstable reasoning that alternates between underthinking (shallow, inconsistent steps) and overthinking (repetitive, verbose reasoning). In this work, we study the structure of reasoning trajectories and uncover specialized attention heads that correlate with distinct cognitive behaviors such as verification and backtracking. By lightly intervening on these heads at inference time, we can steer the model away from inefficient modes. Building on this insight, we propose CREST, a training-free method for Cognitive REasoning Steering at Test-time. CREST has two components: (1) an offline calibration step that identifies cognitive heads and derives head-specific steering vectors, and (2) an inference-time procedure that rotates hidden representations to suppress components along those vectors. CREST adaptively suppresses unproductive reasoning behaviors, yielding both higher accuracy and lower computational cost. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks and models, CREST improves accuracy by up to 17.5% while reducing token usage by 37.6%, offering a simple and effective pathway to faster, more reliable LLM reasoning."

    "abstract": "Deep learning models for Electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnosis have achieved remarkable accuracy but exhibit fragility against adversarial perturbations, particularly Smooth Adversarial Perturbations (SAP) that mimic biological morphology. Existing defenses face a critical dilemma: Adversarial Training (AT) provides robustness but incurs a prohibitive computational burden, while certified methods like Randomized Smoothing (RS) introduce significant inference latency, rendering them impractical for real-time clinical monitoring. We posit that this vulnerability stems from the models' reliance on non-robust spurious correlations rather than invariant pathological features. To address this, we propose Causal Physiological Representation Learning (CPR). Unlike standard denoising approaches that operate without semantic constraints, CPR incorporates a Physiological Structural Prior within a causal disentanglement framework. By modeling ECG generation via a Structural Causal Model (SCM), CPR enforces a structural intervention that strictly separates invariant pathological morphology (P-QRS-T complex) from non-causal artifacts. Empirical results on PTB-XL demonstrate that CPR significantly outperforms standard clinical preprocessing methods. Specifically, under SAP attacks, CPR achieves an F1 score of 0.632, surpassing Median Smoothing (0.541 F1) by 9.1%. Crucially, CPR matches the certified robustness of Randomized Smoothing while maintaining single-pass inference efficiency, offering a superior trade-off between robustness, efficiency, and clinical interpretability."

    "abstract": "In this study we obtain interior solutions and investigate structural properties of isotropic compact stars in the framework of four-dimensional regularized Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (4DEGB) gravity. For stellar matter content, we adopt a widely used quark-matter model that approximates a realistic equation of state (EoS). By numerically integrating the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations, we obtain interior solutions for static, spherically symmetric fluid spheres. The resulting sequences are compared directly with the predictions of General Relativity (GR). Our analysis focuses on three diagnostic indicators: (i) the mass-radius profiles under GR and three representative choices of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling; (ii) the stellar compactness factor, $C \\equiv M/R$; and (iii) the relation between stellar mass and central energy density. Recent observational studies suggest that the maximum masses inferred from the mass-radius relation may be larger than previously expected. To address this, we include a comparative set of constraints from multi-messenger astrophysical observations, including gravitational-wave event GW190814, as well as X-ray measurements from NICER for PSR~J0740+6620 and PSR~J0030+0451. These data provide stringent, astrophysically grounded tests of the viability of the models discussed here. Our results indicate that compact stars within 4DEGB gravity are systematically less compact and achieve moderately higher maximum masses compared to the GR case. This trend is consistent with recent theoretical analyses of compact stars in higher-curvature gravity theories and with constraints from multi-messenger astrophysics. Together, these findings suggest that regularized Gauss-Bonnet corrections constitute a plausible extension of GR in the strong-field regime."

    "abstract": "There is currently no agreed-upon methodology for characterizing a stellarator magnetic field geometry, and yet modern stellarator designs routinely attain high levels of magnetic-field quasi-symmetry through careful flux-surface shaping. Here, we introduce a general method for computing the shape of an ideal-MHD equilibrium that can be used in both axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric configurations. This framework uses a Fourier mode analysis to define the shaping modes (e.g. elongation, triangularity, squareness, etc.) of cross-sections that can be non-planar. Relative to an axisymmetric equilibrium, the additional degree of freedom in a non-axisymmetric equilibrium manifests as a rotation of each shaping mode about the magnetic axis. Using this method, a shaping analysis is performed on non-axisymmetric configurations with precise quasi-symmetry and select cases from the QUASR database spanning a range of quasi-symmetry quality. Empirically, we find that quasi-symmetry results from a spatial resonance between shape complexity and shape rotation about the magnetic axis. The quantitative features of this resonance correlate closely with a configuration's rotational transform and number of field periods. Based on these observations, it is conjectured that this shaping paradigm can facilitate systematic investigations into the relationship between general flux-surface geometries and other figures of merit."

To do this, we employ the complex scaling method, where resonance poles of the S-matrix are realized as discrete eigenvalues of the non-Hermitian dilated Hamiltonian, to construct situations in which resonant and scattering states coalesce into an EP in the complex energy plane, that is, the resonance pole is embedded into the continuum spectrum. We analyze the self-orthogonality in the vicinity of an EP and the Berry phase. Our results provide a bridge between non-Hermitian spectral theory and the traditional theory of quantum resonances."

As a result, weather users in these countries are not being given sufficient information about weather risk that is needed to make reliable decisions about taking preventative action. Consequently, society in many parts of the world is not as resilient to weather events as they could be. In this paper we test the performance of our forecast system, cGAN, which is the only high-resolution (10 km) ensemble rainfall product that does real-time, probabilistic correction of global forecasts for East Africa. Compared to existing state-of-the-art AI models, our system offers higher spatial resolution. It is cheap to train/run and requires no additional post-processing.

The Bunch-Davies state is the most straightforward initial quantum vacuum that may be used for computing purposes. Two observers are introduced, one in an open chart of de Sitter space and the other in a global chart. The observers calculate the quantum discord generated by each detecting a mode. The relationship between an observer in one of the two Rindler charts in flat space and another in a Minkowski chart is comparable to this circumstance.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel framework for analysing equilibrium in structured production systems incorporating a static social division of labour by distinguishing between consumption goods traded in competitive markets and intermediate goods exchanged through bilateral relationships. We develop the concept of viability -- the requirement that all producers earn positive incomes -- as a foundational equilibrium prerequisite. Our main theoretical contribution establishes that acyclic production systems -- those without circular conversion processes among goods -- are always viable, a condition that implies coherence. We characterise completely viable systems through input restrictions demonstrating that prohibiting consumption goods as inputs for other consumption goods is necessary for ensuring viable prices exist for all consumption good price vectors. The analysis reveals fundamental relationships between production system architectural design and economic sustainability. The introduced framework bridges Leontief-Sraffa production theory with modern network economics while capturing institutional realities of contemporary production systems. This also results in a contribution of the literature on the existence of a positive output price system and the Hawkins-Simon condition."

    "abstract": "Autonomous taxi services represent a transformative advancement in urban mobility, offering safety, efficiency, and round-the-clock operations. While existing literature has explored user acceptance of autonomous taxis through stated preference experiments and hypothetical scenarios, few studies have investigated actual user behavior based on operational AV services. This study addresses that gap by leveraging survey data from Wuhan, China, where Baidu's Apollo Robotaxi service operates at scale. We design a realistic survey incorporating actual service attributes and collect 336 valid responses from actual users. Using Structural Equation Modeling, we identify six latent psychological constructs, namely Trust \\& Policy Support, Cost Sensitivity, Performance, Behavioral Intention, Lifestyle, and Education. Their influences on adoption behavior, measured by the selection frequency of autonomous taxis in ten scenarios, are examined and interpreted. Results show that Cost Sensitivity and Behavioral Intention are the strongest positive predictors of adoption, while other latent constructs play more nuanced roles. The model demonstrates strong goodness-of-fit across multiple indices. Our findings offer empirical evidence to support policymaking, fare design, and public outreach strategies for scaling autonomous taxis deployments in real-world urban settings."

    "abstract": "We present Edit3r, a feed-forward framework that reconstructs and edits 3D scenes in a single pass from unposed, view-inconsistent, instruction-edited images. Unlike prior methods requiring per-scene optimization, Edit3r directly predicts instruction-aligned 3D edits, enabling fast and photorealistic rendering without optimization or pose estimation. A key challenge in training such a model lies in the absence of multi-view consistent edited images for supervision. We address this with (i) a SAM2-based recoloring strategy that generates reliable, cross-view-consistent supervision, and (ii) an asymmetric input strategy that pairs a recolored reference view with raw auxiliary views, encouraging the network to fuse and align disparate observations. At inference, our model effectively handles images edited by 2D methods such as InstructPix2Pix, despite not being exposed to such edits during training. For large-scale quantitative evaluation, we introduce DL3DV-Edit-Bench, a benchmark built on the DL3DV test split, featuring 20 diverse scenes, 4 edit types and 100 edits in total. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative results show that Edit3r achieves superior semantic alignment and enhanced 3D consistency compared to recent baselines, while operating at significantly higher inference speed, making it promising for real-time 3D editing applications."

Our framework allows any tomographic data - including archival datasets -- to be reinterpreted in terms of fundamental nonlocality tests. We introduce a generic, constructive method to generate tailored Bell inequalities and showcase their applicability to certify the non-locality of states in realistic experimental scenarios. Recognizing the stabilizer nature of the considered operators, we analyze our inequalities in the context of witnessing quantum magic - a crucial resource for quantum computing. Our approach requires Pauli measurements only and tests the quantum magic solely through the resources present in the state. Our results establish a universal standard that unifies state tomography with nonlocality certification and its application to quantum magic witnessing, thereby streamlining both fundamental studies and practical applications."

    "abstract": "Online joint estimation of unknown parameters and states in a dynamical system with uncertainty quantification is crucial in many applications. For example, digital twins dynamically update their knowledge of model parameters and states to support prediction and decision-making. Reliability and computational speed are vital for DTs. Online parameter-state estimation ensures computational efficiency, while uncertainty quantification is essential for making reliable predictions and decisions. In parameter-state estimation, the joint distribution of the state and model parameters conditioned on the data, termed the joint posterior, provides accurate uncertainty quantification. Because the joint posterior is generally intractable to compute, this paper presents an online variational inference framework to compute its approximation at each time step. The approximation is factorized into a marginal distribution over the model parameters and a state distribution conditioned on the parameters. This factorization enables recursive updates through a two-stage procedure: first, the parameter posterior is approximated via variational inference; second, the state distribution conditioned on the parameters is computed using Gaussian filtering based on the estimated parameter posterior. The algorithmic design is supported by a theorem establishing upper bounds on the joint posterior approximation error. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method (i) matches the performance of the joint particle filter in low-dimensional problems, accurately inferring both unobserved states and unknown parameters of dynamical and observation models; (ii) remains robust under noisy, partial observations and model discrepancies in a chaotic Lorenz 96 system; and (iii) scales effectively to a high-dimensional convection-diffusion system, where it outperforms the joint ensemble Kalman filter."

In this work we study PBH production within Horndeski gravity, accounting for compatibility with the GW170817 constraint on the gravitational-wave speed and imposing a constant coupling to the Ricci scalar. Under these conditions, and assuming an inflaton field characterised by a canonical kinetic term and a smooth potential, the inflationary dynamics is controlled by the cubic Horndeski interaction. We show that a suitable kinetic dependence of the latter enhances the effective friction acting on the inflaton, inducing a transient ultra-slow-roll phase embedded in an otherwise standard slow-roll evolution. Interestingly, this mechanism amplifies the curvature power spectrum on small scales without introducing any feature in the potential. For representative parameter choices we find that pronounced peaks in the scalar power spectrum are generated, leading to the formation of asteroid-mass PBHs with masses of order $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-16})\\,M_\\odot$, which can account for a substantial fraction of the dark matter abundance, reaching $f_{\\rm PBH}\\simeq 0.9$, while satisfying current observational constraints. The resulting sharp features in the scalar power spectrum also imply potentially observable scalar-induced gravitational-wave signatures."

In this model, vertices represent agents and undirected edges represent goods; edges have to be oriented towards one of their endpoints, i.e., allocated to one of their adjacent agents. Although EFX orientations (envy-free up to any good) have been extensively studied in this setting, EF orientations (envy-free) remain unexplored. In this work, we initiate their study, mostly under the lens of parameterized complexity, presenting various tractable cases, hardness results, and parameterizations. Our results concern both simple graphs and multigraphs. Interestingly, many of our results transfer to EFX orientations, thus complementing and improving upon previous work; notably, we answer an open question regarding the structural parameterized complexity of the latter problem on graphs of polynomially-bounded valuations. We also show that EF orientations are tractable in cases in which EFX orientations are not, particularly for binary valuations. Lastly, we consider charity in the orientation setting, establishing algorithms for finding the minimum amount of edges that have to be removed from a graph in order for EF(X) orientations to exist."

In MAFM, each observation decomposes into a row-factor component, a column-factor component, and noise, allowing distinct sources of variation along different modes to be modeled separately. We develop a computationally efficient two-stage estimation procedure: Modewise Inner-product Eigendecomposition (MINE) for initialization, followed by Complement-Projected Alternating Subspace Estimation (COMPAS) for iterative refinement. The key methodological innovation is that orthogonal complement projections completely eliminate cross-modal interference when estimating each loading space. We establish convergence rates for the estimated factor loading matrices under proper conditions. We further derive asymptotic distributions for the loading matrix estimators and develop consistent covariance estimators, yielding a data-driven inference framework that enables confidence interval construction and hypothesis testing. As a technical contribution of independent interest, we establish matrix Bernstein inequalities for quadratic forms of dependent matrix time series. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method over existing approaches."

Central to our approach is the construction of a symplectic homology basis adapted to the discrete involution.

However, large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of BMH systems are often limited by computation, communication, and memory costs. We recently proposed the random batch sum-of-Gaussians (RBSOG) method, which accelerates Coulomb calculations by using a sum-of-Gaussians (SOG) decomposition to split the potential into short- and long-range parts and by applying importance sampling in Fourier space for the long-range part. In this work, we extend the RBSOG to BMH systems and incorporate a random batch list (RBL) scheme to further accelerate the short-range part, yielding a unified framework for efficient simulations with the BMH potential. The combination of the SOG decomposition and the RBL enables an efficient and scalable treatment of both long- and short-range interactions in BMH system, particularly the RBL well handles the medium-range exponential repulsion and dispersion by the random batch neighbor list. Error estimate is provided to show the theoretical convergence of the RBL force. We evaluate the framework on molten NaCl and mixed alkali halide with up to $5\\times10^6$ atoms on $2048$ CPU cores.

The purpose of this and the companion paper (Part II) is to develop the theory of fundamental limits for near-field sensing systems in detail. In this paper (Part I), we develop a unified narrow-band near-field signal model for joint parameter sensing of moving targets using the ELAAs. Leveraging the Slepian--Bangs formulation, we derive closed-form Cram'er--Rao bounds (CRBs) for joint estimation of target position, velocity, and radar cross-section (RCS) under the slow-time sampling model. To obtain interpretable insights, we further establish explicit far-field and near-field approximations that reveal how the bounds scale with array aperture, target range, carrier wavelength, and coherent integration length. The resulting expressions expose the roles of self-information terms and their cross terms, clarifying when Fresnel corrections become non-negligible and providing beamformer and algorithm design guidelines for near-field sensing with ELAAs. Simulation results validate the derived CRBs and their far-field and near-field approximations, demonstrating accurate agreement with the analytical scaling laws across representative array sizes and target ranges."

This article introduces MSACL, a framework that integrates exponential stability theory with maximum entropy RL through multi-step Lyapunov certificate learning. Unlike methods relying on complex reward engineering, MSACL utilizes off-policy multi-step data to learn Lyapunov certificates satisfying theoretical stability conditions. By introducing Exponential Stability Labels (ESL) and a $λ$-weighted aggregation mechanism, the framework effectively balances the bias-variance trade-off in multi-step learning. Policy optimization is guided by a stability-aware advantage function, ensuring the learned policy promotes rapid Lyapunov descent. We evaluate MSACL across six benchmarks, including stabilization and nonlinear tracking tasks, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art Lyapunov-based RL algorithms. MSACL achieves exponential stability and rapid convergence under simple rewards, while exhibiting significant robustness to uncertainties and generalization to unseen trajectories. Sensitivity analysis establishes the multi-step horizon $n=20$ as a robust default across diverse systems. By linking Lyapunov theory with off-policy actor-critic frameworks, MSACL provides a foundation for verifiably safe learning-based control.

Repeating this process by randomly sampling step length and turning angle defines a two-dimensional random walk in what we call comoving frame coordinates. This is precisely how Ross and Pearson proposed to model the movements of organisms more than a century ago. Decades later their concept was generalised by including persistence leading to a correlated random walk, which became a popular model in Movement Ecology. In contrast, Langevin equations describing cell migration and used in active matter theory are typically formulated by position and velocity in a fixed Cartesian frame. In this article, we explore the transformation of stochastic Langevin dynamics from the Cartesian into the comoving frame. We show that the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process for the Cartesian velocity of a walker can be transformed exactly into a stochastic process that is defined self-consistently in the comoving frame, thereby profoundly generalising correlated random walk models. This approach yields a general conceptual framework how to transform stochastic processes from the Cartesian into the comoving frame. Our theory paves the way to derive, invent and explore novel stochastic processes in the comoving frame for modelling the movements of organisms. It can also be applied to design novel stochastic dynamics for autonomously moving robots and drones."

    "abstract": "FRB 20240114A is extraordinarily active, and therefore presents an opportunity to search for the periodicity predicted by magnetar models of Fast Radio Bursts (FRB). Zhang, et al. (2025) observed 11,553 bursts, including 3196 on MJD 60381 (March 12, 2024). We find no significant peak in the periodogram of those bursts, which occur within 15628 s, short enough that even with a characteristic slowing age of 1 year a signal with period $\\ge 0.1\\,$s it would not significantly dephase within the observation. Introducing modulation artificially shows that an amplitude of 0.15 would have been detected robustly. Implications for magnetar models of FRB are briefly considered."

The filtration is preserved by the interior Euler operator, which is not a module homomorphism with respect to the ring of smooth functions on the jet space. However, the induced maps on the graded components of this filtration are. Furthermore, the space of functional forms in the image of the interior Euler operator inherits a filtration. Though the filtered subspaces are not submodules either, the graded components are isomorphic to linear spaces which do have module structures. This works for any fixed degree of the functional forms. In this way, the condition that a functional form vanishes can be stated concisely with a module basis. We work out explicitly two examples: one for functional forms of degree two in relation to the Helmholtz conditions and the other of arbitrary degree but with jet order one."

We primarily focus on the in-medium electromagnetic form factor, distribution amplitude, and the parton distribution function of the pion. The parton distribution functions are also evolved from the model scale to a perturbative scale using next to leading order Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi evolution equations. Furthermore, our calculated form factors are compared with available experimental measurements and lattice quantum chromodynamics studies. We also examine the Mellin moments derived from our parton distribution functions in comparison with existing extractions and theoretical model predictions."

    "abstract": "Persistent homology (PH) has recently emerged as a powerful tool for extracting topological features. Integrating PH into machine learning and deep learning models enhances topology awareness and interpretability. However, most PH methods on graphs rely on a limited set of filtrations, such as degree-based or weight-based filtrations, which overlook richer features like recurring information across the dataset and thus restrict expressive power. In this work, we propose a novel graph filtration called Frequent Subgraph Filtration (FSF), which is derived from frequent subgraphs and produces stable and information-rich frequency-based persistent homology (FPH) features. We study the theoretical properties of FSF and provide both proofs and experimental validation. Beyond persistent homology itself, we introduce two approaches for graph classification: an FPH-based machine learning model (FPH-ML) and a hybrid framework that integrates FPH with graph neural networks (FPH-GNNs) to enhance topology-aware graph representation learning. Our frameworks bridge frequent subgraph mining and topological data analysis, offering a new perspective on topology-aware feature extraction. Experimental results show that FPH-ML achieves competitive or superior accuracy compared with kernel-based and degree-based filtration methods. When integrated into graph neural networks, FPH yields relative performance gains ranging from 0.4 to 21 percent, with improvements of up to 8.2 percentage points over GCN and GIN backbones across benchmarks."

    "abstract": "We study a continuous time stochastic optimal control problem under partial observations that are available only at discrete time instants. This hybrid setting, with continuous dynamics and intermittent noisy measurements, arises in applications ranging from robotic exploration and target tracking to epidemic control. We formulate the problem on the space of beliefs (information states), treating the controller's posterior distribution of the state as the state variable for decision making. On this belief space we derive a Pontryagin maximum principle that provides necessary conditions for optimality. The analysis carefully tracks both the continuous evolution of the state between observation times and the Bayesian jump updates of the belief at observation instants. A key insight is a relationship between the adjoint process in our maximum principle and the gradient of the value functional on the belief space, which links the optimality conditions to the dynamic programming approach on the space of probability measures. The resulting optimality system has a prediction and update structure that is closely related to the unnormalised Zakai equation and the normalised Kushner-Stratonovich equation in nonlinear filtering. Building on this analysis, we design a particle based numerical scheme to approximate the coupled forward (filter) and backward (adjoint) system. The scheme uses particle filtering to represent the evolving belief and regression techniques to approximate the adjoint, which yields a practical algorithm for computing near optimal controls under partial information. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated on both linear and nonlinear examples and highlights in particular the benefits of actively controlling the observation process."

Existing methods require specialized hardware, extensive calibration, or firmware modifications that are inaccessible to most users. This work presents a practical, end-to-end optimization framework that enhances high-speed printing using only standard 3D printers and a phone camera, without requiring additional complex setup. The method employs a one-shot calibration approach in which two simple printed patterns, captured by a phone camera, enable identification of extrusion dynamics and cornering behavior. The identified systems enable a model-based constrained optimal control strategy that generates optimized G-code, synchronizing motion and extrusion. Experiments show reduced width tracking error, mitigated corner defects, and lower surface roughness, achieving surface quality at 3600 mm/min comparable to conventional printing at 1600 mm/min, effectively doubling production speed while maintaining print quality. This accessible, hardware-minimal approach enables a wide range of fused filament fabrication users to achieve high-quality, high-speed additive manufacturing."

ModEn-Hub centralizes entanglement sources and shared quantum memory to deliver on-demand, high-fidelity Bell pairs across heterogeneous QPUs, while the control plane schedules teleportation-based non-local gates, launches parallel entanglement attempts, and maintains a small ebit cache. To quantify benefits, we implement a lightweight, reproducible Monte Carlo study under realistic loss and tight round budgets, comparing a naive sequential baseline to an orchestrated policy with logarithmically scaled parallelism and opportunistic caching. Across 1-128 QPUs and 2,500 trials per point, ModEn-Hub-style orchestration sustains about 90% teleportation success while the baseline degrades toward about 30%, at the cost of higher average entanglement attempts (about 10-12 versus about 3).

While prior work often estimates beliefs accurately, it lacks a principled mechanism to use those beliefs during generation. We bridge this gap by first formalizing two core acts Adversarial and Alignment, and by operationalizing them via probabilistic constraints on what an agent may generate. We instantiate this idea in BEDA, a framework that consists of the world set, the belief estimator for belief estimation, and the conditional generator that selects acts and realizes utterances consistent with the inferred beliefs. Across three settings, Conditional Keeper Burglar (CKBG, adversarial), Mutual Friends (MF, cooperative), and CaSiNo (negotiation), BEDA consistently outperforms strong baselines: on CKBG it improves success rate by at least 5.0 points across backbones and by 20.6 points with GPT-4.1-nano; on Mutual Friends it achieves an average improvement of 9.3 points; and on CaSiNo it achieves the optimal deal relative to all baselines. These results indicate that casting belief estimation as constraints provides a simple, general mechanism for reliable strategic dialogue."

The model, developed in a one-dimensional setting, builds upon the Auricchio-Petrini constitutive formulation for SMAs and couples damage evolution with phase transformation. We study analytically and numerically the homogeneous and localization responses of a bar under both monotonic and cyclic loading, and we investigate various macroscopic behaviors by tuning the constitutive parameters. A key feature of the model is the introduction of a transformation strain limit, beyond which the material is fully martensitic and behaves elastically. This leads to a distinctive behavior in which the region of localized damage widens, yielding a delay of fracture. The capability of the model to predict the fatigue performance is demonstrated by simulating the uniaxial response of Ni-Ti multi-wire samples under different loading conditions. The results show promising agreement with experimental fatigue life data, enabling the discrimination between safe and critical loading scenarios."

In the two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM) with $m_H\\gg m_h$, where $h$ is the Higgs boson of mass 125 GeV observed at the LHC, we show that a direct correlation between Br$(H\\to hh)$ and Br$(H\\to VV)$, with $V=Z,W$, emerges that depends only on $m_H$ (and $m_V$). In particular, for heavy scalar masses between 500\\,GeV and 1\\,TeV, we find that Br($H\\to hh$)/ Br($H\\to ZZ)\\approx 9.5$. The origin of this prediction is most transparent in the Higgs basis, where the term in the scalar potential proportional to $\\mathcal H_1^\\dagger \\mathcal H_1 \\mathcal H_1^\\dagger \\mathcal H_2$ (and its hermitian conjugate) generates the leading contributions to the $Hhh$ and $Hhhh$ couplings in the decoupling limit of the 2HDM.

To capture this phenomenon, we quantitatively model transfer effects using multi-task learning curves approximating the inductive performance over varying sample sizes. We describe an efficient method to approximate multi-task learning curves analogous to the Task Affinity Grouping method applied during training. We compare the statistical and computational approaches to transfer, which indicates considerably higher compute costs for the previous but better power and broader applicability. Evaluations are performed using a benchmark drug-target interaction data set. Our results show that learning curves can better capture the effects of multi-task learning and their multi-task extensions can delineate pairwise and contextual transfer effects in foundation models."

We build up a general framework for systematically classifying 3D interacting TSCs protected by crystalline symmetries together with discrete internal symmetries. We first establish a complete classification for fermionic symmetry protected topological phases (FSPT) with purely discrete internal symmetries, which determines the crystalline case via the crystalline equivalence principle. Using domain wall decoration, we obtain classification data and formulas for generic FSPTs, what are suitable for systematic computation. The four layers of decoration data $(n_1, n_2, n_3, ν_4)$ characterize a 3D FSPT with symmetry $G_b\\times_{ω_2}Z_2^f$, corresponding to $p+ip$, Kitaev chain, complex fermion, and bosonic SPT layers. Inspired by previous works, a crucial aspect is the $p+ip$ layer, where classification involves two possibilities: anti-unitary and infinite-order symmetries (e.g., translation). We show the former maps to some mirror FSPT classification with the mirror plane decorated by a $p+ip$ superconductor, while the latter is determined by the free part of $H^1(G_b, Z_T)$, corresponding to weak TSCs. Another key point is the Kitaev chain decoration for the anti-unitary symmetries, which differs essentially from unitary ones. We explicitly obtain formulas for all three layers of decoration $(n_2, n_3, ν_4)$, which are amenable to automatic computation. As an application, we classify the 230 space-group topological crystalline superconductors in interacting electronic systems."

    "abstract": "Optimal control provides a principled framework for transforming dynamical system models into intelligent decision-making, yet classical computational approaches are often too expensive for real-time deployment in dynamic or uncertain environments. In this work, we propose a method based on self-supervised neural operators for open-loop optimal control problems. It offers a new paradigm by directly approximating the mapping from system conditions to optimal control strategies, enabling instantaneous inference across diverse scenarios once trained. We further extend this framework to more complex settings, including dynamic or partially observed environments, by integrating the learned solution operator with Model Predictive Control (MPC). This yields a solution-operator learning method for closed-loop control, in which the learned operator supplies rapid predictions that replace the potentially time-consuming optimization step in conventional MPC. This acceleration comes with a quantifiable price to pay. Theoretically, we derive scaling laws that relate generalization error and sample/model complexity to the intrinsic dimension of the problem and the regularity of the optimal control function. Numerically, case studies show efficient, accurate real-time performance in low-intrinsic-dimension regimes, while accuracy degrades as problem complexity increases. Together, these results provide a balanced perspective: neural operators are a powerful novel tool for high-performance control when hidden low-dimensional structure can be exploited, yet they remain fundamentally constrained by the intrinsic dimensional complexity in more challenging settings."

    "abstract": "The spatiotemporal evolution of pulsating turbulent pipe flow was predicted by deep learning. A convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) were employed for long-term prediction by recursively predicting the local temporal evolution. To enhance prediction, physical components such as wall shear stress were informed into the training process. The datasets were obtained from direct numerical simulation (DNS). The model was trained exclusively on a limited set of sinusoidal pulsating flows driven by pressure gradients defined by their period and amplitude. Subsequently, 36 pulsating flows with arbitrary non-sinusoidal acceleration and deceleration were predicted to evaluate the generalization capability, defined as the predictive performance on unseen data during training. The model successfully predicted drag reduction rates ranging from $-1\\%$ to $86\\%$, with a mean absolute error of 9.2. This predictive performance for unseen pulsations indicates that local temporal prediction plays a central role, rather than learning the global profile of the pulsating waveforms. This implication was quantitatively verified by analyzing the differences in periodic $C_f$--$Re_b$ trajectories between the training and test datasets, demonstrating that flows exhibiting local similarity to the training data are more predictable. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that flows exhibiting intermittent laminar--turbulent transition and relaminarization become predictable when such regimes are incorporated into the training data. The results indicate that accurate prediction is achievable provided that the training data sufficiently cover the local flow-state space, highlighting the importance of appropriate training data selection for generalized flow prediction."

    "abstract": "Accurate benchmarking of quantum gates is crucial for understanding and enhancing the performance of quantum hardware. A standard method for this is interleaved benchmarking, a technique which estimates the error on an interleaved target gate by comparing cumulative error rates of randomized sequences implemented with the interleaved gate and without it. In this work, we show both numerically and experimentally that the standard approach of interleaved randomized benchmarking (IRB), which uses the multi-qubit Clifford group for randomization, can produce highly inaccurate and even physically impossible estimates for the error on the interleaved gate in the presence of coherent errors. Fortunately we also show that interleaved benchmarking performed with cycle benchmarking, which randomizes with single qubit Pauli gates, provides dramatically reduced systematic uncertainty relative to standard IRB, and further provides as host of additional benefits including data reusability. We support our conclusions with a theoretical framework for bounding systematic errors, extensive numerical results comparing a range of interleaved protocols under fixed resource costs, and experimental demonstrations on three quantum computing platforms."

We identify three notions of topographic significance for ends in such graphs and show that the number of nonvanishing ends governs both amenability and smoothness. More precisely, we extend the Adams dichotomy from the pmp to the mcp setting, replacing the number of ends with the number of nonvanishing ends: an acyclic mcp graph is amenable if and only if a.e. component has at most two nonvanishing ends, while it is nowhere amenable exactly when a.e. component has a nonempty perfect (closed) set of nonvanishing ends. We also characterize smoothness: an acyclic mcp graph is essentially smooth if and only if a.e. component has no nonvanishing ends. Furthermore, we show that the notion of nonvanishing ends depends only on the measure class and not on the specific measure. At the heart of our analysis lies the study of acyclic countable-to-one Borel functions. Our critical result is that, outside of the essentially two-ended setting, all back ends in a.e. orbit are vanishing and admit cocycle-finite geodesics. We also show that the number of barytropic ends controls the essential number of ends for such functions. This leads to a surprising topographic characterization of when such functions are essentially one-ended. Our proofs utilize mass transport, end selection, and the notion of the Radon--Nikodym core for acyclic mcp graphs, a new concept that serves as a guiding framework for our topographic analysis."

This class encompasses many classical models, including absorbed, reflected, elastic, and sticky Brownian motions, and further allows boundary jumps from $0$ governed by the measure $p_4$.

Despite recent advancement in video-text-to-audio (VT2A), the current formulation faces three key limitations: First, an imbalance between visual and textual conditioning that leads to visual dominance; Second, the absence of a concrete definition for fine-grained controllable generation; Third, weak instruction understanding and following, as existing datasets rely on brief categorical tags. To address these limitations, we introduce EchoFoley, a new task designed for video-grounded sound generation with both event level local control and hierarchical semantic control. Our symbolic representation for sounding events specifies when, what, and how each sound is produced within a video or instruction, enabling fine-grained controls like sound generation, insertion, and editing. To support this task, we construct EchoFoley-6k, a large-scale, expert-curated benchmark containing over 6,000 video-instruction-annotation triplets. Building upon this foundation, we propose EchoVidia a sounding-event-centric agentic generation framework with slow-fast thinking strategy. Experiments show that EchoVidia surpasses recent VT2A models by 40.7% in controllability and 12.5% in perceptual quality."

We have constructed three distinct classes of an ensemble of agnostic equation of state by speed of sound parametrisation. Bayesian inference is then employed to constrain the EoS construction parameters-namely, the squared speed of sound and chemical potential at each interpolation segment-using the observational data. Both the NICER and GW constraints hint towards a smoother EoS where PT occurs late, significantly reducing the maximum mass of NS. Also, the maximum-mass and maximum-compact sequences are distinctly different, as the former allows for the maximally stiff EoS to maximise the star mass. In contrast, the latter prefers a softer low-density and stiffer high-density EoS to maximise the compactness. The Bayesian analysis demonstrates that the observational bounds are effective in significantly constraining the low-density region of the equation of state. It is also seen that the astrophysical bound prefers the phase transition in the intermediate-density range and also prefers a small density jump for a discontinuous equation of state."

This study demonstrates that the laser with shorter pulse duration allows for a two-step dechirping process of the accelerated electron beam with charge of nanocoulomb level. The electron beams with an energy spread of 1% can be generated with the energy transfer efficiency of 10% to 30% in a large parameter space. For example, one electron beam with the energy of 420MeV, the charge of 5.5nC and the RMS energy spread of 2% can be produced using an 8.3J laser pulse with 7.2fs duration."

    "abstract": "The exponential growth of data transmission and processing speeds in modern digital infrastructure requires entropy sources capable of producing large volumes of true randomness for information security. Chaotic emissions from semiconductor lasers are attractive in this context because of their fast dynamics and nonrepetitive behavior. Their spectral bandwidth, however, is typically limited to several tens of gigahertz, which constrains the achievable entropy rate and makes ultrafast random bit generation difficult without substantial post-processing. Here, we demonstrate a chaos-based entropy source that employs optical heterodyning between the chaotic emission from a semiconductor laser and an optical frequency comb, yielding a bandwidth exceeding 100 GHz and an experimentally verified single-channel entropy rate of 1.86 Tb/s. By directly extracting multiple bits from the digitized output of the entropy source, we achieve a single-channel random bit generation rate of 1.536 Tb/s, while four-channel parallelization reaches 6.144 Tb/s with no observable interchannel correlation. This linear scalability suggests that aggregate throughput could reach hundreds of terabits per second with additional parallel channels. The broadband, low-overhead photonic architecture presented here provides a viable route to real-time, ultrafast random bit generation with broad implications for secure communications, high-performance AI computing, and large-scale data analytics."

    "abstract": "We study causal discovery from observational data in linear Gaussian systems affected by \\emph{mixed latent confounding}, where some unobserved factors act broadly across many variables while others influence only small subsets. This setting is common in practice and poses a challenge for existing methods: differentiable and score-based DAG learners can misinterpret global latent effects as causal edges, while latent-variable graphical models recover only undirected structure. We propose \\textsc{DCL-DECOR}, a modular, precision-led pipeline that separates these roles. The method first isolates pervasive latent effects by decomposing the observed precision matrix into a structured component and a low-rank component. The structured component corresponds to the conditional distribution after accounting for pervasive confounders and retains only local dependence induced by the causal graph and localized confounding. A correlated-noise DAG learner is then applied to this deconfounded representation to recover directed edges while modeling remaining structured error correlations, followed by a simple reconciliation step to enforce bow-freeness. We provide identifiability results that characterize the recoverable causal target under mixed confounding and show how the overall problem reduces to well-studied subproblems with modular guarantees. Synthetic experiments that vary the strength and dimensionality of pervasive confounding demonstrate consistent improvements in directed edge recovery over applying correlated-noise DAG learning directly to the confounded data."

We propose MP-Jacobi (Message Passing-Jacobi), a graph-compliant decentralized framework that couples min-sum message passing with Jacobi block updates. The (hyper)graph is partitioned into tree clusters. At each iteration, agents update in parallel by solving a cluster subproblem whose objective decomposes into (i) an intra-cluster term evaluated by a single min-sum sweep on the cluster tree (cost-to-go messages) and (ii) inter-cluster couplings handled via a Jacobi correction using neighbors' latest iterates. This design uses only single-hop communication and yields a convergent message-passing method on loopy graphs. For strongly convex objectives we establish global linear convergence and explicit rates that quantify how curvature, coupling strength, and the chosen partition affect scalability and provide guidance for clustering. To mitigate the computation and communication cost of exact message updates, we develop graph-compliant surrogates that preserve convergence while reducing per-iteration complexity. We further extend MP-Jacobi to hypergraphs; in heavily overlapping regimes, a surrogate-based hyperedge-splitting scheme restores finite-time intra-cluster message updates and maintains convergence. Experiments validate the theory and show consistent improvements over decentralized gradient baselines."

    "abstract": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in robotics, with the action chunk playing a dominant role in these advances. Given the real-time and continuous nature of robotic motion control, the strategies for fusing a queue of successive action chunks have a profound impact on the overall performance of VLA models. Existing methods suffer from jitter, stalling, or even pauses in robotic action execution, which not only limits the achievable execution speed but also reduces the overall success rate of task completion. This paper introduces VLA-RAIL (A Real-Time Asynchronous Inference Linker), a novel framework designed to address these issues by conducting model inference and robot motion control asynchronously and guaranteeing smooth, continuous, and high-speed action execution. The core contributions of the paper are two fold: a Trajectory Smoother that effectively filters out the noise and jitter in the trajectory of one action chunk using polynomial fitting and a Chunk Fuser that seamlessly align the current executing trajectory and the newly arrived chunk, ensuring position, velocity, and acceleration continuity between two successive action chunks. We validate the effectiveness of VLA-RAIL on a benchmark of dynamic simulation tasks and several real-world manipulation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that VLA-RAIL significantly reduces motion jitter, enhances execution speed, and improves task success rates, which will become a key infrastructure for the large-scale deployment of VLA models."

    "abstract": "Dust lifetime derived from an isolated supernova (SN) evolution in the interstellar medium is known to be an order of magnitude shorter than the time needed to replenish dust mass by its production in various Galactic sources. We show, using 3-D numerical hydrodynamical simulations, that destruction of dust in the case of multiple SNe in a star cluster is markedly different from that in an isolated SN. We find that the mass of dust destroyed in the bubble does not grow for a considerable time, while SNe continue to explode. This regime is attained at saturation timescale, which is proportional to SNe rate in cluster. We show that the mass of dust destroyed in bubble per SN decreases for higher SN rate. Thus, the destruction efficiency -- defined as the ratio of the the total mass of dust destroyed by clustered SNe to that destroyed by the same number of isolated SNe -- in bubbles evolved in a homogeneous medium drops for massive clusters, e.g. around clusters with $M_\\ast > 4\\times 10^4 M_\\odot$ it is less $0.4$\\%. For lower mass clusters, the efficiency is proportional to the average time delay between SNe. We found that each cluster with $M_\\ast < 4\\times 10^4 M_\\odot$ destroys the same mass of dust as a single isolated SN. In a clumpy medium in bubbles formed around clusters with $M_\\ast \\sim 4\\times 10^4 M_\\odot$ and up to 4 times around $M_\\ast \\sim 8\\times 10^5 M_\\odot$. We argue that the interstellar dust swept up by multiple SNe almost completely survives in the shells of bubbles around such massive clusters. Therefore, the destruction of the interstellar dust is controlled by SNe in low-mass clusters. We point out that the interstellar dust lifetime for a given SN rate is at least a factor $\\sim 10$ longer as compared to the estimates derived from an isolated SN. (abridged)"

We consider backdoor attacks for heterogeneous node classification, where an adversary injects a small set of trigger nodes and connections during training to force specific victim nodes to be misclassified into an attacker-chosen label at test time while preserving clean performance. We propose HeteroHBA, a generative backdoor framework that selects influential auxiliary neighbors for trigger attachment via saliency-based screening and synthesizes diverse trigger features and connection patterns to better match the local heterogeneous context. To improve stealthiness, we combine Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) with a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) loss to align the trigger feature distribution with benign statistics, thereby reducing detectability, and we optimize the attack with a bilevel objective that jointly promotes attack success and maintains clean accuracy. Experiments on multiple real-world heterogeneous graphs with representative HGNN architectures show that HeteroHBA consistently achieves higher attack success than prior backdoor baselines with comparable or smaller impact on clean accuracy; moreover, the attack remains effective under our heterogeneity-aware structural defense, CSD. These results highlight practical backdoor risks in heterogeneous graph learning and motivate the development of stronger defenses."

We propose RGTN (Renormalization Group guided Tensor Network search), a physics-inspired framework transforming TN-SS via multi-scale renormalization group flows. Unlike fixed-scale discrete search methods, RGTN uses dynamic scale-transformation for continuous structure evolution across resolutions. Its core innovation includes learnable edge gates for optimization-stage topology modification and intelligent proposals based on physical quantities like node tension measuring local stress and edge information flow quantifying connectivity importance. Starting from low-complexity coarse scales and refining to finer ones, RGTN finds compact structures while escaping local minima via scale-induced perturbations.

All LLMs we tested are overconfident, but most predict their success with better-than-random discriminatory power. We find that newer and larger LLMs generally do not have greater discriminatory power, though Claude models do show such a trend. On multi-step agentic tasks, the overconfidence of several frontier LLMs worsens as they progress through the tasks, and reasoning LLMs perform comparably to or worse than non-reasoning LLMs. With in-context experiences of failure, some but not all LLMs reduce their overconfidence leading to significantly improved decision making, while others do not. Interestingly, all LLMs' decisions are approximately rational given their estimated probabilities of success, yet their overly-optimistic estimates result in poor decision making. These results suggest that current LLM agents are hindered by their lack of awareness of their own capabilities. We discuss the implications of LLMs' awareness of their capabilities for AI misuse and misalignment risks."

In recent years, muscle synergy analysis based on surface electromyography (sEMG) has become an important approach in this area. This review focuses on muscle synergies during running, outlining core neural control theories and biomechanical optimization hypotheses, summarizing commonly used decomposition methods (e.g., PCA, ICA, FA, NMF) and emerging autoencoder-based approaches. We synthesize findings on the development and evolution of running-related synergies across the lifespan, examine how running surface, speed, foot-strike pattern, fatigue, and performance level modulate synergy patterns, and describe characteristic alterations in populations with knee osteoarthritis, patellofemoral pain, and stroke. Current evidence suggests that the number and basic structure of lower-limb synergies during running are relatively stable, whereas spatial muscle weightings and motor primitives are highly plastic and sensitive to task demands, fatigue, and pathology. However, substantial methodological variability remains in EMG channel selection, preprocessing pipelines, and decomposition algorithms, and direct neurophysiological validation and translational application are still limited. Future work should prioritize standardized processing protocols, integration of multi-source neuromusculoskeletal data, nonlinear modeling, and longitudinal intervention studies to better exploit muscle synergy analysis in sports biomechanics, athletic training, and rehabilitation medicine."

    "abstract": "In this work, we propose dilepton emission rate (DER) as a sensitive probe of QCD critical point based on the extended Polyakov-quark-meson model. The model could successfully capture two main mechanisms for dilepton production, $π^\\pm$ and quark-antiquark annihilations on one hand, and self-consistently account for chiral transition and (de-)confinement on the other hand. Along the chemical freezeout lines, all the moments of the DER peak show similar extremal features as those of light quark mass, thus the DER can well reflect the change of chiral symmetry and criticality. More importantly, the DER can be directly measured in heavy ion collisions: Compared to the baryon number fluctuations, the DER fluctuations are found to be more drastic in the critical region and more sensitive to the relative location of the critical point. However, recent statistics of DER in heavy ion collision is not large enough to perform event-by-event measurement, instead we propose to study the baseline subtracted DER: For a given dilepton center of mass, the largest deviation shows up around the point where the light quark mass fluctuation is the strongest."

Existing audio agent frameworks often suffer from complex environment configurations and inefficient tool collaboration. To address these limitations, we introduce AudioFab, an open-source agent framework aimed at establishing an open and intelligent audio-processing ecosystem. Compared to existing solutions, AudioFab's modular design resolves dependency conflicts, simplifying tool integration and extension. It also optimizes tool learning through intelligent selection and few-shot learning, improving efficiency and accuracy in complex audio tasks.

We developed a novel computational infrastructure to address the data integration challenge, reducing processing time from a projected over 100 days to 3.2 hours through byte-offset indexing architecture, a 740-fold improvement. Our comprehensive analysis revealed critical insights into the multivariate nature of lipophilicity: while molecular weight exhibited weak bivariate correlation with logP, SHAP analysis on ensemble models identified it as the single most important predictor globally. We systematically evaluated multiple modeling approaches, discovering that linear models suffered from inherent heteroskedasticity that classical remediation strategies, including weighted least squares and Box-Cox transformation, failed to address. Tree-based ensemble methods, including Random Forest and XGBoost, proved inherently robust to this violation, achieving an R-squared of 0.765 and RMSE of 0.731 logP units on the test set. Furthermore, a stratified modeling strategy, employing specialized models for drug-like molecules (91 percent of dataset) and extreme cases (nine percent), achieved optimal performance: an RMSE of 0.838 for the drug-like subset and an R-squared of 0.767 for extreme molecules, the highest of all evaluated approaches. These findings provide actionable guidance for molecular design, establish robust baselines for lipophilicity prediction using only 2D descriptors, and demonstrate that well-curated, descriptor-based ensemble models remain competitive with state-of-the-art graph neural network architectures."

    "abstract": "Inspired by the remarkable success of autoregressive models in language modeling, this paradigm has been widely adopted in visual generation. However, the sequential token-by-token decoding mechanism inherent in traditional autoregressive models leads to low inference efficiency.In this paper, we propose RadAR, an efficient and parallelizable framework designed to accelerate autoregressive visual generation while preserving its representational capacity. Our approach is motivated by the observation that visual tokens exhibit strong local dependencies and spatial correlations with their neighbors--a property not fully exploited in standard raster-scan decoding orders. Specifically, we organize the generation process around a radial topology: an initial token is selected as the starting point, and all other tokens are systematically grouped into multiple concentric rings according to their spatial distances from this center. Generation then proceeds in a ring-wise manner, from inner to outer regions, enabling the parallel prediction of all tokens within the same ring. This design not only preserves the structural locality and spatial coherence of visual scenes but also substantially increases parallelization. Furthermore, to address the risk of inconsistent predictions arising from simultaneous token generation with limited context, we introduce a nested attention mechanism. This mechanism dynamically refines implausible outputs during the forward pass, thereby mitigating error accumulation and preventing model collapse. By integrating radial parallel prediction with dynamic output correction, RadAR significantly improves generation efficiency."

    "abstract": "Automotive FMCW radars are indispensable to modern ADAS and autonomous-driving systems, but their increasing density has intensified the risk of mutual interference. Existing mitigation techniques, including reactive receiver-side suppression, proactive waveform design, and cooperative scheduling, often face limitations in scalability, reliance on side-channel communication, or degradation of range-Doppler resolution. Building on our earlier work on decentralized Frequency-Domain No-Regret hopping, this paper introduces a unified time-frequency game-theoretic framework that enables radars to adapt across both spectral and temporal resources. We formulate the interference-avoidance problem as a repeated anti-coordination game, in which each radar autonomously updates a mixed strategy over frequency subbands and chirp-level time offsets using regret-minimization dynamics. We show that the proposed Time-Frequency No-Regret Hopping algorithm achieves vanishing external and swap regret, and that the induced empirical play converges to an $\\varepsilon$-coarse correlated equilibrium or a correlated equilibrium. Theoretical analysis provides regret bounds in the joint domain, revealing how temporal adaptation implicitly regularizes frequency selection and enhances robustness against asynchronous interference. Numerical experiments with multi-radar scenarios demonstrate substantial improvements in SINR, collision rate, and range-Doppler quality compared with time-frequency random hopping and centralized Nash-based benchmarks."

Most existing empirical Bayes methods for this setting are developed under restrictive assumptions, such as the scaled inverse-chi-squared prior for variances and unimodality for the non-null mean distribution. However, when either of these assumptions is violated, these methods often fail to control the false discovery rate (FDR) at the target level or suffer from a substantial loss of power. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new empirical Bayes method, gg-Mix, which assumes only independence between the normal means and variances, without imposing any structural restrictions on their distributions. We thoroughly evaluate the FDR control and power of gg-Mix through extensive numerical studies and demonstrate its superior performance compared to existing methods. Finally, we apply gg-Mix to three real data examples to further illustrate the practical advantages of our approach."

Existing slice discovery methods are primarily developed for image classification, limiting their applicability to multi-instance tasks such as detection, segmentation, and pose estimation. In real-world scenarios, error slices often arise from corner cases involving complex visual relationships, where existing instance-level approaches lacking fine-grained reasoning struggle to yield meaningful insights. Moreover, current benchmarks are typically tailored to specific algorithms or biased toward image classification, with artificial ground truth that fails to reflect real model failures. To address these limitations, we propose SliceLens, a hypothesis-driven framework that leverages LLMs and VLMs to generate and verify diverse failure hypotheses through grounded visual reasoning, enabling reliable identification of fine-grained and interpretable error slices. We further introduce FeSD (Fine-grained Slice Discovery), the first benchmark specifically designed for evaluating fine-grained error slice discovery across instance-level vision tasks, featuring expert-annotated and carefully refined ground-truth slices with precise grounding to local error regions. Extensive experiments on both existing benchmarks and FeSD demonstrate that SliceLens achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving Precision@10 by 0.42 (0.73 vs. 0.31) on FeSD, and identifies interpretable slices that facilitate actionable model improvements, as validated through model repair experiments."

    "abstract": "Change detection visual question answering (CDVQA) requires answering text queries by reasoning about semantic changes in bi-temporal remote sensing images. A straightforward approach is to boost CDVQA performance with generic vision-language models via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Despite recent progress, we observe that a significant portion of failures do not stem from clearly incorrect predictions, but from decision ambiguity, where the model assigns similar confidence to the correct answer and strong distractors. To formalize this challenge, we define Decision-Ambiguous Samples (DAS) as instances with a small probability margin between the ground-truth answer and the most competitive alternative. We argue that explicitly optimizing DAS is crucial for improving the discriminability and robustness of CDVQA models. To this end, we propose DARFT, a Decision-Ambiguity-guided Reinforcement Fine-Tuning framework that first mines DAS using an SFT-trained reference policy and then applies group-relative policy optimization on the mined subset. By leveraging multi-sample decoding and intra-group relative advantages, DARFT suppresses strong distractors and sharpens decision boundaries without additional supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent gains over SFT baselines, particularly under few-shot settings."

We focus on test-time filtering: a lightweight mechanism for behavior control that compares performance scores to estimated thresholds, and modifies outputs when these bounds are violated. We formalize the problem of enforcing multiple risk constraints with user-defined priorities, and introduce two efficient dynamic programming algorithms that leverage this sequential structure. The first, MULTIRISK-BASE, provides a direct finite-sample procedure for selecting thresholds, while the second, MULTIRISK, leverages data exchangeability to guarantee simultaneous control of the risks. Under mild assumptions, we show that MULTIRISK achieves nearly tight control of all constraint risks. The analysis requires an intricate iterative argument, upper bounding the risks by introducing several forms of intermediate symmetrized risk functions, and carefully lower bounding the risks by recursively counting jumps in symmetrized risk functions between appropriate risk levels. We evaluate our framework on a three-constraint Large Language Model alignment task using the PKU-SafeRLHF dataset, where the goal is to maximize helpfulness subject to multiple safety constraints, and where scores are generated by a Large Language Model judge and a perplexity filter. Our experimental results show that our algorithm can control each individual risk at close to the target level."

Both are enabled by specific symmetries and induced by certain physical interactions. Using the underlying approach of condensed matter theory of real materials (rather than schematic model Hamiltonians), we discuss apparent and hidden physics in real materials focusing on the properties of spin splitting and spin polarization. Depending on the enabling symmetries and underlying physical interactions, we classify spin effects into four categories with each having two subtypes; representative materials are pointed out. We then discuss the electric tunability and switch of apparent and hidden spin splitting and polarization in antiferromagnets. Finally, we extend \"hidden effects\" to views that are farsighted in the sense of resolving the correct atomistic and reciprocal symmetry and replaced by the incorrect higher symmetry. This framework could guide and enable systematic discovery of such intriguing effects."

These unique datasets will improve redshift estimation and provide a rich redshift catalog for the community. In this study, we forecast the performance of widely-used photometric redshift estimation methods using simulated SPHEREx and 7DS data. Four template-fitting approaches and two machine-learning (ML) methods are used to derive photometric redshifts from low-resolution spectrophotometric data. We measure redshifts using mock catalogs based on the GAMA and COSMOS galaxy samples and achieve high precision for bright (13 < i < 18) galaxies, with $σ_{NMAD}\\lesssim 0.005$, bias $\\lesssim 0.005$, and a catastrophic failure rate $\\lesssim 0.005$ for all methods employed. We find that the combined SPHEREx + 7DS dataset significantly improves redshift estimation compared to using either the SPHEREx or 7DS datasets alone, highlighting the synergy between the two surveys. Moreover, we compare the redshift estimation performance across magnitude ranges for the different methods and examine the probability distribution functions (PDFs) produced by the template-fitting approaches. As a result, we identify some factors that can affect the redshift measurements, like treatments on dust extinction or inclusion of flux uncertainty in the ML model. We also show that the PDFs are relatively well calibrated, although the confidence intervals are generally underestimated, particularly for bright galaxies in the template-fitting methods. This study demonstrates the strong potential of SPHEREx and 7DS to deliver improved redshift measurements from low-resolution spectrophotometric data, underscoring the scientific value of jointly utilizing both datasets."

    "abstract": "The Noise2Noise method allows for training machine learning-based denoisers with pairs of input and target images where both the input and target can be noisy. This removes the need for training with clean target images, which can be difficult to obtain. However, Noise2Noise training has a major limitation: nonlinear functions applied to the noisy targets will skew the results. This bias occurs because the nonlinearity makes the expected value of the noisy targets different from the clean target image. Since nonlinear functions are common in image processing, avoiding them limits the types of preprocessing that can be performed on the noisy targets. Our main insight is that certain nonlinear functions can be applied to the noisy targets without adding significant bias to the results. We develop a theoretical framework for analyzing the effects of these nonlinearities, and describe a class of nonlinear functions with minimal bias. We demonstrate our method on the denoising of high dynamic range (HDR) images produced by Monte Carlo rendering. Noise2Noise training can have trouble with HDR images, where the training process is overwhelmed by outliers and performs poorly. We consider a commonly used method of addressing these training issues: applying a nonlinear tone mapping function to the model output and target images to reduce their dynamic range. This method was previously thought to be incompatible with Noise2Noise training because of the nonlinearities involved. We show that certain combinations of loss functions and tone mapping functions can reduce the effect of outliers while introducing minimal bias. We apply our method to an existing machine learning-based Monte Carlo denoiser, where the original implementation was trained with high-sample count reference images. Our results approach those of the original implementation, but are produced using only noisy training data."

    "abstract": "Slate recommendation, where users are presented with a ranked list of items simultaneously, is widely adopted in online platforms. Recent advances in generative models have shown promise in slate recommendation by modeling sequences of discrete semantic IDs autoregressively. However, existing autoregressive approaches suffer from semantically entangled item tokenization and inefficient sequential decoding that lacks holistic slate planning. To address these limitations, we propose HiGR, an efficient generative slate recommendation framework that integrates hierarchical planning with listwise preference alignment. First, we propose an auto-encoder utilizing residual quantization and contrastive constraints to tokenize items into semantically structured IDs for controllable generation. Second, HiGR decouples generation into a list-level planning stage for global slate intent, followed by an item-level decoding stage for specific item selection. Third, we introduce a listwise preference alignment objective to directly optimize slate quality using implicit user feedback. Experiments on our large-scale commercial media platform demonstrate that HiGR delivers consistent improvements in both offline evaluations and online deployment. Specifically, it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 10% in offline recommendation quality with a 5x inference speedup, while further achieving a 1.22% and 1.73% increase in Average Watch Time and Average Video Views in online A/B tests."

In this paper, we study several coarse-geometric aspects of extended admissible groups. We show that changing the gluing edge isomorphisms does not affect the quasi-isometry type of these groups. We also prove that, under mild conditions on the vertex groups, extended admissible groups exhibit large-scale nonpositive curvature, thereby answering a question posed by Nguyen-Yang. As an application, our results enlarge the class of extended admissible groups known to admit well-defined quasi-redirecting boundaries, a notion recently introduced by Qing-Rafi. In addition, we compute the divergence of extended admissible groups, generalizing a result of Gersten from non-geometric 3-manifold groups to this broader setting. Finally, we study several aspects of subgroup structure in extended admissible groups."

This critical exponent parameter equals 2.4 for Ni2MnGa, 2.7 for nickel and cobalt, and 3.0 for iron. Because reduced magnetization and reduced temperature enter the equation symmetrically, the Ms(T) dependence can be measured experimentally only in the low-temperature range, from 0 to 0.5TC. The magnetization curve from 0.5TC to TC can then be obtained by interchanging reduced magnetization and temperature in the superellipse equation. In this way, the experimentally challenging task of measuring spontaneous magnetization near Tc is avoided, as the behavior near Tc is effectively determined from measurements performed near T = 0."

In the forward process, numerical simulations exhibit a staircase-like growth of global synchrony, reflecting temporal oscillations induced by secondary synchronized clusters of whirling oscillators. While this behavior has been observed previously, its governing conditions have not been quantitatively determined in terms of analytical criteria. Here, we develop a self-consistent theoretical framework that explicitly characterizes the secondary synchronized clusters. This analysis identifies an onset crossover mass $\\tilde{m}^* \\simeq 3.865$ for the emergence of secondary clusters and yields quantitative criteria for predicting both the crossover mass and the termination coupling strength at which they vanish. As a result, we determine the oscillatory regimes of coupling strengths over which global synchrony shows temporal oscillations, providing practical guidance for controlling and avoiding undesirable oscillatory behavior in inertial synchronization systems, such as power grids."

Recent methods extend multi-view 2D segmentation to 3D, enabling instance/semantic segmentation for better scene understanding. A key challenge is the inconsistency of 2D instance labels across views, leading to poor 3D predictions. Existing methods use a two-stage approach in which some rely on contrastive learning with hyperparameter-sensitive clustering, while others preprocess labels for consistency. We propose a unified framework that merges these steps, reducing training time and improving performance by introducing a learnable feature embedding for segmentation in Gaussian primitives. This embedding is then efficiently decoded into instance labels through a novel \"Embedding-to-Label\" process, effectively integrating the optimization. While this unified framework offers substantial benefits, we observed artifacts at the object boundaries. To address the object boundary issues, we propose hard-mining samples along these boundaries. However, directly applying hard mining to the feature embeddings proved unstable. Therefore, we apply a linear layer to the rasterized feature embeddings before calculating the triplet loss, which stabilizes training and significantly improves performance. Our method outperforms baselines qualitatively and quantitatively on the ScanNet, Replica3D, and Messy-Rooms datasets."

    "abstract": "Randomness generation through quantum-chaotic evolution underpins foundational questions in statistical mechanics and applications across quantum information science, including benchmarking, tomography, metrology, and demonstrations of quantum computational advantage. While statistical mechanics successfully captures the temporal averages of local observables, understanding randomness at the level of higher statistical moments remains a daunting challenge, with analytic progress largely confined to random quantum circuit models or fine-tuned systems exhibiting space-time duality. Here we study how much randomness can be dynamically generated by generic quantum-chaotic evolution under physical, non-random Hamiltonians. Combining theoretical insights with numerical simulations, we show that for broad classes of initially unentangled states, the dynamics become effectively Haar-random well before the system can ergodically explore the physically accessible Hilbert space. Both local and highly nonlocal observables, including entanglement measures, equilibrate to their Haar expectation values and fluctuations on polynomial timescales with remarkably high numerical precision, and with the fastest randomization occurring in regions of parameter space previously identified as maximally chaotic. Interestingly, this effective randomization can occur on timescales linear in system size, suggesting that the sub-ballistic growth of Renyi entropies typically observed in systems with conservation laws can be bypassed in non-random Hamiltonians with an appropriate choice of initial conditions."

Designing performant heuristics is an expensive, time-consuming process that we are forced to continuously go through due to the constant flux of hardware, workloads and environments. We propose a new alternative: synthesizing instance-optimal heuristics -- specialized for the exact workloads and hardware where they will be deployed -- using code-generating large language models (LLMs). To make this synthesis tractable, Vulcan separates policy and mechanism through LLM-friendly, task-agnostic interfaces. With these interfaces, users specify the inputs and objectives of their desired policy, while Vulcan searches for performant policies via evolutionary search over LLM-generated code. This interface is expressive enough to capture a wide range of system policies, yet sufficiently constrained to allow even small, inexpensive LLMs to generate correct and executable code. We use Vulcan to synthesize performant heuristics for cache eviction and memory tiering, and find that these heuristics outperform all human-designed state-of-the-art algorithms by upto 69% and 7.9% in performance for each of these tasks respectively."

Our methodology goes beyond the interpretation of individual neurons and weights. Instead, we identify all of the neurons corresponding to each learned representation and then study the collective group of neurons as one entity. This method reveals that each learned representation is a manifold that we can study utilizing tools from topology. Based on this insight, we can statistically analyze the learned representations across hundreds of circuits to demonstrate the similarity between learned modular addition circuits that arise naturally from common deep learning paradigms."

By leveraging the autonomous data analytics capabilities of LLMs, the BEMS AI agent seeks to offer context-aware insights into energy consumption, cost prediction, and device scheduling, thereby addressing limitations in existing energy management systems. The prototype's performance was evaluated using 120 user queries across four distinct real-world residential energy datasets and different evaluation metrics, including latency, functionality, capability, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness. The generalizability of the framework was demonstrated using ANOVA tests. The results revealed promising performance, measured by response accuracy in device control (86%), memory-related tasks (97%), scheduling and automation (74%), and energy analysis (77%), while more complex cost estimation tasks highlighted areas for improvement with an accuracy of 49%.

Azopolymers provide an alternative route by converting structured optical fields into surface reliefs via light-induced mass migration, but existing approaches have been limited to smooth, shallow, and engraving-like topographies produced from a flat film. Here we introduce an all-optical, maskless, fully digital lithography platform that exploits engineered darkness within computer-generated holograms to spatially localize inward mass transport and directly produce positive, protruding microreliefs. We show that isolated and array of micro-bumps can be generated from pristine flat azopolymer films in a single writing step, and we introduce spatiotemporal control through sequential tailored illumination to reshape microrelief profiles, enabling flattened-top micropillars, programmable array shapes and arrangements, and free-form continuous microrelief designs. Hierarchical microarchitectures are also demonstrated by extending the concept of multi-step illumination sequences. As functional demonstrations, we realize multi-focus microlenses and quasi-square diffraction gratings with enhanced 1st-order efficiencies. Finally, we leverage azopolymer reconfigurability to implement write-erase-rewrite cycles that reset and repurpose the same surface region for distinct micropatterns, enabling rewritable surfaces and reprogrammable master templates for replication. Overall, this work establishes a scalable spatiotemporal strategy for on-demand, all-optical microfabrication and reprogramming of structured surfaces, where spatial and temporal degrees of freedom of holographic patterns intermix to produce advanced patterning capabilities."

Our goal here is to find simple UV-complete models that can realize potentially large neutrino-DM interactions, while being consistent with all existing theoretical and experimental constraints. We first construct the leading non-derivative operator basis for neutrino-DM scattering in a low-energy effective theory with neutrinos and DM (DM-LEFT), together with its gauge-invariant embedding in the Standard Model EFT (DM-SMEFT). We then construct all renormalizable tree-level UV completions that generate the relevant DM-SMEFT operators up to dimension-8 using a topology-based classification. Using this framework, we present minimal UV-complete models for different DM types that can yield effective neutrino-DM couplings up to several orders of magnitude larger than the Fermi coupling, while satisfying all constraints, most notably from neutrino mass and from the charged-lepton sector. This includes a pseudo-Dirac fermion DM realization in the scotogenic neutrino mass model and models of Majorana DM inspired by type-II and inverse seesaw-based neutrino mass models. Phenomenological implications for DM thermal relic abundance and direct detection prospects, as well as various cosmological and laboratory constraints on the model parameter space, are also analyzed."

We provide a rigorous foundation for this advantage by formalizing a model of parallel sampling and showing that DLMs augmented with polynomial-length chain-of-thought (CoT) can simulate any parallel sampling algorithm using an optimal number of sequential steps. Consequently, whenever a target distribution can be generated using a small number of sequential steps, a DLM can be used to generate the distribution using the same number of optimal sequential steps. However, without the ability to modify previously revealed tokens, DLMs with CoT can still incur large intermediate footprints. We prove that enabling remasking (converting unmasked tokens to masks) or revision (converting unmasked tokens to other unmasked tokens) together with CoT further allows DLMs to simulate any parallel sampling algorithm with optimal space complexity. We further justify the advantage of revision by establishing a strict expressivity gap: DLMs with revision or remasking are strictly more expressive than those without. Our results not only provide a theoretical justification for the promise of DLMs as the most efficient parallel sampler, but also advocate for enabling revision in DLMs."

Based on the principles of generalized unitarity, they are given by products of elementary three-point amplitudes where the kinematics of internal on-shell legs are determined by cut conditions. In the ${\\cal N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills (SYM) theory, the dual formulation for on-shell diagrams produces the same quantities as canonical forms on the Grassmannian $G(k,n)$. Most of the work in this direction has been devoted to the planar diagrams, which dominate in the large $N$ limit of gauge theories. On the mathematical side, planar on-shell diagrams correspond to cells of the positive Grassmannian $G_+(k,n)$ which have been very extensively studied in the literature in the past 20 years. In this paper, we focus on the non-planar on-shell diagrams which are relevant at finite $N$. In particular, we use the triplet formulation of Maximal-Helicity-Violating (MHV) on-shell diagrams to obtain certain regions in the Grassmannian $G(2,n)$. These regions are unions of positive Grassmannians with different orderings (referred to as oriented regions). We explore the features of these unions, and show that they are pseudo-positive geometries, in contrast to positive geometry of a single oriented region. For all non-planar diagrams which are \\emph{internally planar} there always exists a strongly connected geometry, and for those that are \\emph{irreducible}, there exists a geometry with no spurious facets. We also prove that the already known identity moves, square and sphere moves, form the complete set of identity moves for all MHV on-shell diagrams."

    "abstract": "Lifelong person Re-IDentification (L-ReID) exploits sequentially collected data to continuously train and update a ReID model, focusing on the overall performance of all data. Its main challenge is to avoid the catastrophic forgetting problem of old knowledge while training on new data. Existing L-ReID methods typically re-extract new features for all historical gallery images for inference after each update, known as \"re-indexing\". However, historical gallery data typically suffers from direct saving due to the data privacy issue and the high re-indexing costs for large-scale gallery images. As a result, it inevitably leads to incompatible retrieval between query features extracted by the updated model and gallery features extracted by those before the update, greatly impairing the re-identification performance. To tackle the above issue, this paper focuses on a new task called Re-index Free Lifelong person Re-IDentification (RFL-ReID), which requires performing lifelong person re-identification without re-indexing historical gallery images. Therefore, RFL-ReID is more challenging than L-ReID, requiring continuous learning and balancing new and old knowledge in diverse streaming data, and making the features output by the new and old models compatible with each other. To this end, we propose a Bidirectional Continuous Compatible Representation (Bi-C2R) framework to continuously update the gallery features extracted by the old model to perform efficient L-ReID in a compatible manner. We verify our proposed Bi-C2R method through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, which demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve leading performance on both the introduced RFL-ReID task and the traditional L-ReID task."

Given a first-order iterative algorithm initialized at $θ_0$ with current iterate $θ_T$, the basic inequality upper bounds $f(θ_T)-f(z)$ for any reference point $z$ in terms of the accumulated step sizes and the distances between $θ_0$, $θ_T$, and $z$. The bound translates the number of iterations into an effective regularization coefficient in the loss function. We demonstrate this framework through analyses of training dynamics and prediction risk bounds. In addition to revisiting and refining known results on gradient descent, we provide new results for mirror descent with Bregman divergence projection, for generalized linear models trained by gradient descent and exponentiated gradient descent, and for randomized predictors.

This work is largely foundational in conception and character, recording both a framework for general study and Borel complexity computations for some of the most fundamental classes of manifolds. We show, for example, that for all $n\\geq 0$, the homeomorphism problem for compact topological $n$-manifolds is Borel equivalent to the relation $=_{\\mathbb{N}}$ of equality on the natural numbers, while the homeomorphism problem for noncompact topological $2$-manifolds is of maximal complexity among equivalence relations classifiable by countable structures. A nontrivial step in the latter consists of proving Borel measurable formulations of the Jordan--Schoenflies and surface triangulation theorems. Turning our attention to groups and geometric structures, we show, strengthening results of Stuck--Zimmer and Andretta--Camerlo--Hjorth, that the conjugacy relation on discrete subgroups of any noncompact semisimple Lie group is essentially countable universal. So too, as a corollary, is the isometry relation for complete hyperbolic $n$-manifolds for any $n\\geq 2$, generalizing a result of Hjorth--Kechris. We then show that the isometry relation for complete hyperbolic $n$-manifolds with finitely generated fundamental group is, in contrast, Borel equivalent to the equality relation $=_{\\mathbb{R}}$ on the real numbers when $n=2$, but that it is not concretely classifiable when $n=3$; thus there exists no Borel assignment of numerical complete invariants to finitely generated Kleinian groups up to conjugacy. We close with a survey of the most immediate open questions."

    "abstract": "We present an \\emph{ab initio} calculation within quantum statistical field theory and linear response theory, of the dissipative correction to the momentum spectrum of scalar particles emitted at decoupling (freeze-out) from a relativistic fluid assuming the initial state to be in local thermodynamic equilibrium. We obtain an expansion of the Wigner function of the interacting quantum field in terms of the gradients of the classical thermo-hydrodynamic fields - four-temperature vector and reduced chemical potential - evaluated on the initial local-equilibrium hypersurface, rather than on the decoupling (freeze-out) hypersurface as usual in kinetic theory. The gradient expansion includes an unexpected zeroth order term depending on the differences between thermo-hydrodynamic fields at the decoupling and the initial hypersurface. This term encodes a memory of the initial state which is related to the long-distance persistence of the correlation function between Wigner operator and stress-energy tensor and charged current that is discussed in detail. We address the phenomenological implications of these corrections for the momentum spectra measured in relativistic nuclear collisions."

The syntax of the logic includes two types of weighted modal operators corresponding to classical necessity ($\\Box$) and sufficiency ($\\boxminus$) modalities and its formulas are interpreted in fuzzy formal contexts based on possibility theory. We present its axiomatization that is \\emph{sound} with respect to the class of all fuzzy context models. In addition, both the necessity and sufficiency fragments of the logic are also individually complete with respect to the class of all fuzzy context models. We highlight the expressive power of the logic with some illustrative examples. As a formal context is the basic construct of formal concept analysis (FCA), we generalize three main notions in FCA, i.e., formal concepts, object oriented concepts, and property oriented concepts, to their corresponding $c$-cut concepts in fuzzy formal contexts. Then, we show that our logical language can represent all three of these generalized notions. Finally, we demonstrate the possibility of extending our logic to reasoning with multi-relational fuzzy contexts, in which the Boolean combinations of different fuzzy relations are allowed."

In this work, we study the graphicality of degree sequences distributed as a power-law with a size-dependent cutoff and as a double power-law with a size-dependent crossover. We combine the application of exact sufficient conditions for graphicality with heuristic conditions for nongraphicality which allow us to elucidate the physical reasons why some sequences are not graphical. For single power-laws we recover the known phase-diagram, we highlight the subtle interplay of distinct mechanisms violating graphicality and we explain why the infinite-size limit behavior is in some cases very far from being observed for finite sequences. For double power-laws we derive the graphicality of infinite sequences for all possible values of the degree exponents $γ_1$ and $γ_2$, uncovering a rich phase-diagram and pointing out the existence of five qualitatively distinct ways graphicality can be violated. The validity of theoretical arguments is supported by extensive numerical analysis."

However, model compression may affect robustness, especially under natural corruption. Therefore, it is important to consider robustness evaluation while validating computer vision systems. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of compression techniques - quantization, pruning, and weight clustering applied individually and in combination to convolutional neural networks (ResNet-50, VGG-19, and MobileNetV2). Using the CIFAR-10-C and CIFAR 100-C datasets, we analyze the trade-offs between robustness, accuracy, and compression ratio. Our results show that certain compression strategies not only preserve but can also improve robustness, particularly on networks with more complex architectures. Utilizing multiobjective assessment, we determine the best configurations, showing that customized technique combinations produce beneficial multi-objective results. This study provides insights into selecting compression methods for robust and efficient deployment of models in corrupted real-world environments."

Here, we present a comprehensive first-principles investigation of monolayer tin telluride (SnTe2) in its 1T (CdI2-type, P3m1) structure. Our calculations establish its energetic and dynamical stability, confirmed by large cohesive (10.9 eV/atom) and formation (-4.06 eV/atom) energies and a phonon spectrum free of imaginary modes. The electronic band structure reveals metallicity arising from strong Sn-Te p orbital hybridization. Most importantly, phonon dispersion analysis uncovers a microscopic origin for the ultralow lattice thermal conductivity: the heavy mass of Te atoms, weak Sn-Te bonding, and flat acoustic branches that yield exceptionally low and anisotropic group velocities (~5.0 x 10^3 m/s), together with the absence of a phonon bandgap that enhances Umklapp scattering. These features converge to suppress phonon-mediated heat transport. Complementary calculations of the optical dielectric response and joint density of states reveal pronounced interband transitions and a plasmonic resonance near 4.84 eV, suggesting additional optoelectronic opportunities. These findings establish monolayer SnTe2 as a 2D material whose vibrational softness naturally enforces ultralow lattice thermal conductivity, underscoring its potential for thermoelectric applications."

    "abstract": "The perfect phylogeny mixture (PPM) model is useful due to its simplicity and applicability in scenarios where mutations can be assumed to accumulate monotonically over time. It is the underlying model in many tools that have been used, for example, to infer phylogenetic trees for tumor evolution and reconstruction. Unfortunately, the PPM model gives rise to substantial ambiguity -- in that many different phylogenetic trees can explain the same observed data -- even in the idealized setting where data are observed perfectly, i.e. fully and without noise. This ambiguity has been studied in this perfect setting by Pradhan et al. 2018, which proposed a procedure to bound the number of solutions given a fixed instance of observation data. Beyond this, studies have been primarily empirical. Recent work (Myers et al. 2019) proposed adding extra constraints to the PPM model to tackle ambiguity. In this paper, we first show that the extra constraints of Myers et al. 2019, called longitudinal constraints (LC), often fail to reduce the number of distinct trees that explain the observations. We then propose novel alternative constraints to limit solution ambiguity and study their impact when the data are observed perfectly. Unlike the analysis in Pradhan et al. 2018, our theoretical results regarding both the inefficacy of the LC and the extent to which our new constrains reduce ambiguity are not tied to a single observation instance. Rather, our theorems hold over large ensembles of possible inference problems. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study degeneracy in the PPM model in this ensemble-based theoretical framework."

    "abstract": "Modern cloud-native systems increasingly rely on multi-cluster deployments to support scalability, resilience, and geographic distribution. However, existing resource management approaches remain largely reactive and cluster-centric, limiting their ability to optimize system-wide behavior under dynamic workloads. These limitations result in inefficient resource utilization, delayed adaptation, and increased operational overhead across distributed environments. This paper presents an AI-driven framework for adaptive resource optimization in multi-cluster cloud systems. The proposed approach integrates predictive learning, policy-aware decision-making, and continuous feedback to enable proactive and coordinated resource management across clusters. By analyzing cross-cluster telemetry and historical execution patterns, the framework dynamically adjusts resource allocation to balance performance, cost, and reliability objectives. A prototype implementation demonstrates improved resource efficiency, faster stabilization during workload fluctuations, and reduced performance variability compared to conventional reactive approaches. The results highlight the effectiveness of intelligent, self-adaptive infrastructure management as a key enabler for scalable and resilient cloud platforms."

    "abstract": "The proliferation of streaming data analytics in data-driven applications raises critical privacy concerns, as directly collecting user data may compromise personal privacy. Although existing $w$-event local differential privacy (LDP) mechanisms provide formal guarantees without relying on trusted third parties, their practical deployment is hindered by two key limitations. First, these methods are designed primarily for publishing simple statistics at each timestamp, making them inherently unsuitable for complex queries. Second, they handle data at each timestamp independently, failing to capture temporal correlations and consequently degrading the overall utility. To address these issues, we propose MTSP-LDP, a novel framework for \\textbf{M}ulti-\\textbf{T}ask \\textbf{S}treaming data \\textbf{P}ublication under $w$-event LDP. MTSP-LDP adopts an \\emph{Optimal Privacy Budget Allocation} algorithm to dynamically allocate privacy budgets by analyzing temporal correlations within each window. It then constructs a \\emph{data-adaptive private binary tree structure} to support complex queries, which is further refined by cross-timestamp grouping and smoothing operations to enhance estimation accuracy. Furthermore, a unified \\emph{Budget-Free Multi-Task Processing} mechanism is introduced to support a variety of streaming queries without consuming additional privacy budget. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that MTSP-LDP consistently achieves high utility across various streaming tasks, significantly outperforming existing methods."

This mapping elevates information theory to a thermodynamic calculus: the chain rule yields a canonical, nonnegative split into self and interaction EP, and leads to a tighter bound on learning rate with interaction EP as the necessary cost. As a proof of concept, applying the estimator to red-blood-cell flickering shows that interaction EP robustly exposes active signatures that conventional summaries can miss."

    "abstract": "Improving hydrogen storage density is essential for reducing the extreme conditions required in applications such as nuclear fusion. However, the recognition of metallic hydrogen as the \"Holy Grail\" of high-pressure science highlights the difficulty of high-density hydrogen aggregation. Here, we report a solid-state crystal H9@C20 formed by embedding hydrogen atoms into C20 fullerene cages and utilizing chemical precompression, which remains stable under ambient pressure and temperature conditions and exhibits metallic properties. This precompression effect is reflected in the formation of C-H bonds within the cage and C-C bonds between cages, resulting in the transformation of all C atoms from sp2 to sp3 hybridization with inward and outward distortions, while promoting delocalized multicenter bonding within the H9 aggregate. In particular, the hydrogen density inside the C20 cage exceeds that of solid hydrogen, achieving a uniform discrete distribution with H9 as monomers. Further study reveals that filling hydrogen molecules into voids between H9@C20 primitive cells can increase hydrogen content while maintaining structural stability, forming a solid-gas mixed hydrogen storage crystal. Our findings provide a basis for developing high-density hydrogen storage materials under ambient conditions."

We introduce a framework where \"computation\" is viewed as the efficient simulation of a target statistical experiment within a bounded risk distortion (Le Cam deficiency). We formally define computational deficiency ($δ_{\\text{poly}}$) and use it to construct the complexity class LeCam-P (Decision-Robust Polynomial Time), characterizing problems that may be syntactically hard but semantically easy to approximate. We show that classical Karp reductions can be viewed as zero-deficiency simulations, and that approximate reductions correspond to bounded deficiency. Furthermore, we establish the No-Free-Transfer Inequality, showing that strictly invariant representations inevitably destroy decision-relevant information. This framework offers a statistical perspective on approximation theory, bridging the gap between algorithmic complexity and decision theory."

Feature slices are extracted from both the buggy query and the targets to represent the semantic feature of (potential) bug logics. In particular, MATUS guides the target slicing with the prior knowledge from the buggy code, in an end-to-end way to pinpoint the slicing criterion in the targets. All feature slices are embedded and compared based on the vector similarity. Buggy candidates are audited to confirm unknown bugs in the targets. Experiments show that MATUS holds advantages in bug detection for real-world projects with acceptable efficiency. In total, MATUS has spotted 31 unknown bugs in the Linux kernel.

In this work, we integrate machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) with the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation (SSCHA) to enable evolutionary CSP on the quantum anharmonic free-energy landscape. Using LaH$_{10}$ at 150 GPa and 300 K as a test case, we compare two approaches for SSCHA-based CSP: using light-weight active-learning MLIPs (AL-MLIPs) trained on-the-fly from scratch, and foundation models or universal MLIPs (uMLIPs) from the Matbench project. We demonstrate that AL-MLIPs allow to correctly predict the experimentally known cubic Fm$\\bar{3}$m phase as the most stable polymorph at 150 GPa but require corrections within the thermodynamic perturbation theory to get consistent results. The uMLIP Mattersim-5m allow to conduct SSCHA-based CSP without requiring per-structure training and even get correct structure ranking near the global minimum, though fine-tuning may be needed for higher accuracy. Our results show that including quantum anharmonicity simplifies the free-energy landscape and is essential for correct stability rankings, that is especially important for high-temperature phases that could be missed in classical 0 K CSP. The proposed approach extends the reach of CSP to systems where quantum nuclear motion and anharmonicity dominate."

Rather than a direct code translation, this framework refactors LASP with two complementary modules: LASP-CurveFit, a new implementation of the LASP fitting procedure that runs on a CPU, preserving legacy logic while improving data I/O and multithreaded execution efficiency; and LASP-Adam-GPU, a GPU-accelerated method that introduces grouped optimization by constructing a joint residual function over multiple observed and model spectra, enabling high-throughput parameter inference across tens of millions of spectra. Applied to 10 million LAMOST spectra, the framework reduces runtime from 84 to 48 hr on the same CPU platform and to 7 hr on an NVIDIA A100 GPU, while producing results consistent with those from the original pipeline. The inferred errors agree well with the parameter variations from repeat observations of the same target (excluding radial velocities), while the official empirical errors used in LASP are more conservative. When applied to DESI DR1, our effective temperatures and surface gravities agree better with APOGEE than those from the DESI pipeline, particularly for cool giants, while the latter performs slightly better in radial velocity and metallicity. These results suggest that the framework delivers reliable accuracy, efficiency, and transferability, offering a practical approach to parameter inference in large spectroscopic surveys.

Using the fermion-bag Monte Carlo method on large cubical lattices, we find evidence for traditional second-order critical points separating the first two and the latter two phases. Remarkably, these critical points appear to merge at a multicritical point with enhanced symmetry when the symmetry breaking parameter is tuned to zero, giving rise to the recently discovered direct second-order transition between the massless and symmetric massive fermion phases."

Using density matrix renormalization group simulations, we identify two distinct topological phases absent in the purely dimerized model: an SPT phase at half filling stabilized by positive parity coupling, and a topological phase at unit filling stabilized by negative coupling that can be adiabatically connected to a trivial phase without breaking any symmetry. Our results establish parity order as a new organizing principle for correlation-driven bosonic topology."

This extends the framework developed recently for conservative self-similar Markov processes on the upper half-space to a broader geometric setting. Examples of Markov processes that fall into our general framework include traces of isotropic $α$-stable processes in $C^{1,\\rm Dini}$ sets, processes in Lipschitz sets arising in connection with the nonlocal Neumann problem, and a large class of resurrected self-similar processes in the closed upper half-space. We establish sharp two-sided heat kernel estimates for these Markov processes. A fundamental difficulty in accomplishing this task is that, in contrast to the existing literature on heat kernels for jump processes, the tails of the associated jump measures in our setting are not uniformly bounded. Thus, standard techniques in the existing literature used to study heat kernels are not applicable. To overcome this obstacle, we employ recently developed weighted functional inequalities specifically designed for jump kernels blowing up at the boundary."

We introduce Quadratic Continuous Quantum Optimization (QCQO), an anytime algorithm that approximates solutions to unconstrained quadratic programs via a sequence of QUBO instances. Rather than encoding real variables as binary vectors, QCQO implicitly represents them using continuous QUBO weights and iteratively refines the solution by summing sampled vectors. This allows flexible control over the number of binary variables and adapts well to hardware constraints. We prove convergence properties, introduce a step size adaptation scheme, and validate the method on linear regression. Experiments with simulated and real quantum annealers show that QCQO achieves accurate results with fewer qubits, though convergence slows on noisy hardware. Our approach enables quantum annealing to address a wider class of continuous problems."

The magnetotransport response is governed by Landau quantization and the emergence of multiple chiral Landau levels associated with higher-order Weyl nodes. These anomaly-active modes have unidirectional dispersion fixed by the node's monopole charge and dominate charge transport. As the magnetic field increases, individual chiral branches successively cross the Fermi energy, producing discrete slope changes in the longitudinal conductivity and a step-like negative magnetoresistance. This quantized evolution provides a direct experimental signature of multi-Weyl topology. Bulk Landau levels contribute only at very low fields due to strong disorder scattering and do not affect the anomaly-driven regime. Our results establish a unified, fully quantum-mechanical framework in which negative magnetoresistance arises from the discrete Landau-quantized spectrum and microscopic impurity scattering, beyond semiclassical anomaly descriptions."

The relationship between the coronal shock waves, solar energetic particles and different types of radio emission is a subject of long-lasting research activity. In this work, we perform a case study of 31 December 2023 eruption that occurred near eastern limb of the Sun. It produced a X5.0 class X-ray flare, a global EUV wave, a fast $\\sim3000$ km/s Coronal Mass Ejection, strong radio emissions (including several type III and type II bursts), solar energetic particles in-situ, and long duration high-energy gamma-ray emission. We employ a technique that combines the reconstructed coronal shock from observations with background coronal MHD simulations to produce shock-mediated synthetic radio spectrum, assuming local emission at plasma frequency. We show that transient high Mach number and quasi-perpendicular coronal shock region explains both a ``hot flux tube'' precursor seen in EUV observations and reverse drifting radio spectral features observed by ground-based facilities. The occurrence of this evanescent strong shock patch was observed when it propagated across pseudo-streamer's cusp where the magnetic field was particularly low. We also find evidence that, at higher coronal altitudes, the low-frequency type II radio burst detected by several spacecraft, is triggered by the interaction of the shock with the heliospheric current sheet. This study provides additional evidence that high-$M_A$ regions of coronal shock surface are instrumental in energetic particle phenomenology."

Based on the asymptotic bias expression, we propose a bias-corrected estimator that is asymptotically unbiased and normally distributed under appropriate regularity conditions. Monte Carlo experiments examine the finite sample performance of the bias-corrected estimator across different criteria, including bias, RMSE, coverage probability, and the normality of the estimator. The empirical application to Airbnb listings from New Zealand and New York City reveals region-specific patterns in spatial and temporal price transmission, illustrating the importance of modeling genuine unbalancedness in dynamic network settings."

The device is described by an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, whose complex eigenvalues encode the energy (real part) and the broadening (imaginary part) of the Andreev quasi-bound states. When extending the Andreev current formula to the non-Hermitian case, a novel contribution arises that is proportional to the phase derivative of the levels broadening. This term becomes particularly relevant in the presence of exceptional points (EPs) in the spectrum, but its experimental detection is not straightforward. We identify optimal Andreev spectrum configurations where this novel current contribution can be clearly highlighted, and we outline an experimental protocol for its detection. We point out that the phase dependence in the levels imaginary part originates from the breaking of a time-reversal-like symmetry. In particular, spectral configurations in the broken phase of the symmetry and without EPs can be obtained, where this novel contribution can be easily resolved. The proposed protocol would allow to probe for the first time a fingerprint of non-Hermiticity in open junctions that is not strictly related to the presence of EPs."

The presence of such delays prevents the instantaneous delivery of information from neighboring nodes, thereby severely degrading the performance of standard distributed control schemes. To overcome this, we propose a prediction-based framework for exact delay compensation. Specifically, we introduce predictors combined with a mechanism of distributed predictors, which enables the recursive reconstruction of future state information across the communication network. Building upon these predictors, we construct prediction-based distributed observers and formulate both prediction-based distributed state-feedback and dynamic output-feedback controllers. Theoretical analysis confirms that the proposed strategy eliminates the impact of delays after a finite number of steps, ensuring output synchronization. The effectiveness of the methods is validated through a numerical example and a Koopman operator-based linear Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemic model. Notably, for a population of 4 million, the proposed delay compensation strategy achieves a reduction of over 200,000 infected individuals at the peak, underscoring its potential significance in epidemic mitigation."

Leveraging the beam-squint effect inherent in wideband orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, the proposed framework enables efficient two-dimensional angle estimation through a structured multi-stage sensing process. Specifically, the sensing procedure first searches over the elevation angle domain, followed by a dedicated search over the azimuth angle domain given the estimated elevation angles. In each stage, true-time-delay lines and phase shifters of the UPA are jointly configured to cover multiple grid points simultaneously across OFDM subcarriers. To enable accurate and efficient target localization, we formulate the angle estimation problem as a sparse signal recovery problem and develop a modified matching pursuit algorithm tailored to the hierarchical sensing architecture. Additionally, we design power allocation strategies that minimize total transmit power while meeting performance requirements for both sensing and communication. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior performance over conventional sensing methods with reduced sensing power."

Many of these semantic constraints, such as yielding to emergency vehicles, complying with traffic officers' gestures, or stopping for school buses, are intuitive for humans yet difficult to encode explicitly. Although large vision-language models (VLMs) can interpret such semantics, their inference cost makes them impractical for real-time deployment.This work proposes LSRE, a Latent Semantic Rule Encoding framework that converts sparsely sampled VLM judgments into decision boundaries within the latent space of a recurrent world model. By encoding language-defined safety semantics into a lightweight latent classifier, LSRE enables real-time semantic risk assessment at 10 Hz without per-frame VLM queries. Experiments on six semantic-failure scenarios in CARLA demonstrate that LSRE attains semantic risk detection accuracy comparable to a large VLM baseline, while providing substantially earlier hazard anticipation and maintaining low computational latency. LSRE further generalizes to rarely seen semantic-similar test cases, indicating that language-guided latent classification offers an effective and deployable mechanism for semantic safety monitoring in autonomous driving."

Arguing then that any topological order must be reflected in the adiabatic monodromy of gapped quantum ground states over the covariantized space of these band topologies, we compute the latter in examples where this group is non-abelian, showing that any potential FQAH anyons must be localized in momentum space.

    "abstract": "The challenge of effectively transferring knowledge across multiple tasks is of critical importance and is also present in downstream tasks with foundation models. However, the nature of transfer, its transitive-intransitive nature, is still an open problem, and negative transfer remains a significant obstacle. Selection of beneficial auxiliary task sets in multi-task learning is frequently hindered by the high computational cost of their evaluation, the high number of plausible candidate auxiliary sets, and the varying complexity of selection across target tasks. To address these constraints, we introduce BandiK, a novel three-stage multi-task auxiliary task subset selection method using multi-bandits, where each arm pull evaluates candidate auxiliary sets by training and testing a multiple output neural network on a single random train-test dataset split. Firstly, BandiK estimates the pairwise transfers between tasks, which helps in identifying which tasks are likely to benefit from joint learning. In the second stage, it constructs a linear number of candidate sets of auxiliary tasks (in the number of all tasks) for each target task based on the initial estimations, significantly reducing the exponential number of potential auxiliary task sets. Thirdly, it employs a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework for each task, where the arms correspond to the performance of candidate auxiliary sets realized as multiple output neural networks over train-test data set splits. To enhance efficiency, BandiK integrates these individual task-specific MABs into a multi-bandit structure. The proposed multi-bandit solution exploits that the same neural network realizes multiple arms of different individual bandits corresponding to a given candidate set. This semi-overlapping arm property defines a novel multi-bandit cost/reward structure utilized in BandiK."

This difference has an impact on dynamical tide, which is the lowest-order effect we know of that can distinguish quark stars and neutron stars from the gravitational wave during the inspiral phase.

    "abstract": "Evaluating the quality of multi-turn conversations is crucial for developing capable Large Language Models (LLMs), yet remains a significant challenge, often requiring costly human evaluation. Multi-turn reward models (RMs) offer a scalable alternative and can provide valuable signals for guiding LLM training. While recent work has advanced multi-turn \\textit{training} techniques, effective automated \\textit{evaluation} specifically for multi-turn interactions lags behind. We observe that standard preference datasets, typically contrasting responses based only on the final conversational turn, provide insufficient signal to capture the nuances of multi-turn interactions. Instead, we find that incorporating contrasts spanning \\textit{multiple} turns is critical for building robust multi-turn RMs. Motivated by this finding, we propose \\textbf{MU}lti-\\textbf{S}tep \\textbf{I}nstruction \\textbf{C}ontrast (MUSIC), an unsupervised data augmentation strategy that synthesizes contrastive conversation pairs exhibiting differences across multiple turns. Leveraging MUSIC on the Skywork preference dataset, we train a multi-turn RM based on the Gemma-2-9B-Instruct model. Empirical results demonstrate that our MUSIC-augmented RM outperforms baseline methods, achieving higher alignment with judgments from advanced proprietary LLM judges on multi-turn conversations, crucially, without compromising performance on standard single-turn RM benchmarks."

The minimum size of such sets is of interest for numerous reasons; however, even the minimum size of nontrivial blocking sets (i.e. $1$-fold blocking sets not containing a line) in \\(\\mathrm{PG}(2,p^n)\\) is an open question when $n\\geq 5$ is odd. For $n>1$ the conjectured lower bound for this size is $(p^n+p^{n(s-1)/s}+1)$, where $p^{n/s}$ is the size of the largest proper subfield of $\\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$. Since the union of $t$ pairwise disjoint nontrivial blocking sets is a $t$-fold blocking set, it is conjectured that when $p^{n/s}$ is large enough w.r.t. $t$, then the minimum size of a $t$-fold blocking set in $\\mathrm{PG}(2,p^n)$ is $t(p^n+p^{n(s-1)/s}+1)$. If $n$ is even, then the decomposition of the plane into disjoint Baer subplanes gives a $t$-fold blocking set of this size. However, for odd $n$, the existence of such sets is an unsolved problem in most cases. In this paper, we construct $3$-fold blocking sets of conjectured size. These blocking sets are obtained as the disjoint union of three linear blocking sets of Rédei type, and they lie on the same orbit of the projectivity $(x:y:z)\\mapsto (z:x:y)$."

Existing approaches either rely on shared environmental features or inertial assumptions or suffer from non-line-of-sight degradation and outliers in complex environments. Robust and efficient fusion of inter-robot measurements such as bearings, distances, and inertials for tens of robots remains challenging. We present CREPES-X (Cooperative RElative Pose Estimation System with multiple eXtended features), a hierarchical relative localization framework that enhances speed, accuracy, and robustness under challenging conditions, without requiring any global information. CREPES-X starts with a compact hardware design: InfraRed (IR) LEDs, an IR camera, an ultra-wideband module, and an IMU housed in a cube no larger than 6cm on each side. Then CREPES-X implements a two-stage hierarchical estimator to meet different requirements, considering speed, accuracy, and robustness. First, we propose a single-frame relative estimator that provides instant relative poses for multi-robot setups through a closed-form solution and robust bearing outlier rejection. Then a multi-frame relative estimator is designed to offer accurate and robust relative states by exploring IMU pre-integration via robocentric relative kinematics with loosely- and tightly-coupled optimization. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of CREPES-X, showing robustness to up to 90% bearing outliers, proving resilience in challenging conditions, and achieving RMSE of 0.073m and 1.817° in real-world datasets."

    "abstract": "Quantum advantage is widely understood to rely on key quantum resources beyond entanglement, among which nonstabilizerness (quantum ``magic'') plays a central role in enabling universal quantum computation. However, a direct brute-force enumeration of all Pauli strings and the corresponding expectation values from a length-$2^N$ state vector, where $N$ is the system size, yields an overall computational cost scaling as $O(8^N)$, which quickly becomes infeasible as the system size grows. Here we reformulate the second-order stabilizer Rényi entropy in a bitstring language, expose an underlying XOR-convolution structure on $\\mathbb Z_2^N$, and reduce the computation to $2^N$ fast Walsh-Hadamard transforms of length, together with pointwise operations, yielding a deterministic and exact XOR fast Walsh-Hadamard transforms algorithm with runtime scaling $O(N4^N)$ and natural parallelism. This algorithm enables high-precision, medium-scale exact calculations for generic state vectors. It provides a practical tool for probing the scaling, phase diagnostics, and dynamical fine structure of quantum magic in many-body systems."

Our method builds on a novel, learned feature-based image representation that disentangles different types of features, such as geometry and contrast, into distinct low-dimensional latent spaces, enabling better exploitation of feature correlations in multidimensional images and incorporation of pre-learned priors specific to different feature types for reconstruction. More specifically, the disentanglement was achieved via an encoderdecoder network and image transfer training using large public data, enhanced by a style-based decoder design. A latent diffusion model was introduced to impose stronger constraints on distinct feature spaces. New reconstruction formulations and algorithms were developed to integrate the learned representation with a zero-shot selfsupervised learning adaptation and subspace modeling. The proposed method has been evaluated on accelerated T1 and T2 parameter mapping, achieving improved performance over state-of-the-art reconstruction methods, without task-specific supervised training or fine-tuning. This work offers a new strategy for learning-based multidimensional image reconstruction where only limited data are available for problem-specific or task-specific training."

A long-standing approach is to study the temperature dependence of the London penetration depth $λ$ for evidence of nodal points where the superconducting gap vanishes. However, experimental reports can be ambiguous due to the requisite low-temperature resolution, and the similarity in signatures of nodal quasiparticles and impurity states. Here we study the pairing symmetry of Weyl semimetal $T_d$-MoTe$_2$, where previous measurements of $λ$ have yielded conflicting results. We utilize a novel technique based on a microwave resontor to measure the kinetic inductance of MoTe$_2$, which is directly related to $λ$. The high precision of this technique allows us to observe power-law temperature dependence of $λ$, and to measure the anomalous nonlinear Meissner effect -- the current dependence of $λ$ arising from nodal quasiparticles. Together, these measurements provide smoking gun signatures of nodal superconductivity."

In scenarios where each participant is responsible for its dataset, e.g., digital forensics, MP-PSI with threshold should disclose both intersection elements and corresponding holders such that elements are traceable and the reliability of intersection is guaranteed. We refer to MP-PSI with threshold supporting traceability as Traceable Over-Threshold MP-PSI (T-OT-MP-PSI). However, research on such protocols remains limited, and existing work tolerates at most $t-2$ semi-honest participants at considerable computational cost. We propose two novel Traceable OT-MP-PSI protocols. The first, Efficient Traceable OT-MP-PSI (ET-OT-MP-PSI), combines Shamir's secret sharing with an oblivious programmable pseudorandom function, achieving significantly improved efficiency with resistance to at most $t-2$ semi-honest participants. The second, Security-enhanced Traceable OT-MP-PSI (ST-OT-MP-PSI), achieves security against up to $n-1$ semi-honest participants by further leveraging the oblivious linear evaluation protocol. Compared to Mahdavi et al.'s protocol, ours eliminate the assumption that certain special parties do not collude. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements: for $n=5$, $t=3$, and sets of size $2^{14}$, ET-OT-MP-PSI achieves $15056\\times$ speedup and ST-OT-MP-PSI achieves $505\\times$ speedup over Mahdavi et al.'s protocol."

Focusing on the $L^2$-Tikhonov regularization method, we analyze its convergence under two different noise models, using noisy discrete spatial observations. By exploiting the spectral decomposition of the forward operator and introducing a noise separation technique into the variational framework, we establish error bounds for the reconstructed solution $u$ and the source term $f$ without requiring classical source conditions. Moreover, an expected convergence rate for the source error is derived in a weaker topology. We also extend the analysis to the fully discrete case with finite element discretization, showing that the overall error depends only on the noise level, regularization parameter, time step size, and spatial mesh size. These estimates provide a basis for selecting the optimal regularization parameter in a data-driven manner, without a priori information. Numerical experiments validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm."

We demonstrate a mechanism for such transient dynamics and present an inverse-designed multilayer cavity incorporating an ultrathin TCO layer that supports the oscillatory behavior. This approach yields transmittance oscillations with a period of ~20 fs, which corresponds to three optical cycles of the probe beam. To achieve a similar oscillatory modulation in the refractive index, we incorporate a TCO electron-acceptor layer on top of the inverse-designed cavity, enabling thermionic carrier injection at the TCO heterojunction. The resulting acceptor layer achieves a striking Δn response time as short as 9 fs, approaching a single optical cycle, and is further tunable to sub-cycle timescales. The findings not only clarify the elusive transient physics in TCOs but also demonstrate, for the first time, the critical role of electron temperatures in driving oscillatory dynamic responses. More broadly, we establish TCO-based thermionic carrier injection as a practical route to novel time-varying photonic media operating on the timescale of an optical cycle, enabling time-reflection, time-refraction, and related dynamic phenomena from the visible to the infrared."

While demand paging extends capacity via host DRAM, it incurs up to 78x slowdown due to the massive working sets and poor locality of GPU workloads. We observe, however, that GPU memory access patterns are inherently predictable via kernel launch arguments and their asynchronous execution nature. Leveraging this, we propose MSched, an OS-level scheduler that extends GPU context switching to include proactive working set preparation, thereby coalescing fragmented, eventual, and expensive page faults into a single efficient migration. MSched employs a template-based approach to predict working sets with near-perfect accuracy and proposes a co-design between task scheduler and memory manager to enforce a globally optimal page placement policy. Evaluation demonstrates that MSched outperforms demand paging by up to 11.05x for scientific and deep learning workloads, and 57.88x for LLM under memory oversubscription."

Unlike typical small models that rely on distillation, Youtu-LLM (1.96B) is pre-trained from scratch to systematically cultivate reasoning and planning capabilities. The key technical advancements are as follows: (1) Compact Architecture with Long-Context Support: Built on a dense Multi-Latent Attention (MLA) architecture with a novel STEM-oriented vocabulary, Youtu-LLM supports a 128k context window. This design enables robust long-context reasoning and state tracking within a minimal memory footprint, making it ideal for long-horizon agent and reasoning tasks. (2) Principled \"Commonsense-STEM-Agent\" Curriculum: We curated a massive corpus of approximately 11T tokens and implemented a multi-stage training strategy. By progressively shifting the pre-training data distribution from general commonsense to complex STEM and agentic tasks, we ensure the model acquires deep cognitive abilities rather than superficial alignment. (3) Scalable Agentic Mid-training: Specifically for the agentic mid-training, we employ diverse data construction schemes to synthesize rich and varied trajectories across math, coding, and tool-use domains. This high-quality data enables the model to internalize planning and reflection behaviors effectively. Extensive evaluations show that Youtu-LLM sets a new state-of-the-art for sub-2B LLMs. On general benchmarks, it achieves competitive performance against larger models, while on agent-specific tasks, it significantly surpasses existing SOTA baselines, demonstrating that lightweight models can possess strong intrinsic agentic capabilities."

    "abstract": "In this work, we investigate the five-dimensional Proca star under gravity with the infinite tower of higher curvature corrections. We find that when the coupling constant exceeds a critical value, solutions with a frequency approaching zero appear. In the finite-order corrections case $n=2$ (Gauss-Bonnet gravity), the matter field and energy density diverge near the origin as $ω\\to 0$. In contrast, for $n\\geq 3$, the divergence is efficiently suppressed, both the field and the energy density remain finite everywhere, and both the matter field and energy density remain finite everywhere. In the limit $ω\\to 0$, a class of horizonless frozen star solutions emerges, which are referred to ``frozen stars\". Importantly, frozen stars contain neither curvature singularities nor event horizons. These frozen stars develop a critical horizon at a finite radius $r_c$, where $-g_{tt}$ and $1/g_{rr}$ approach zero. The frozen star is indistinguishable from that of an extremal black hole outside $r_c$, and its compactness can reach the extremal black hole value."

    "abstract": "We propose a novel framework for risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RSRL) that incorporates robustness against transition uncertainty. We define two distinct yet coupled risk measures: an inner risk measure addressing state and cost randomness and an outer risk measure capturing transition dynamics uncertainty. Our framework unifies and generalizes most existing RL frameworks by permitting general coherent risk measures for both inner and outer risk measures. Within this framework, we construct a risk-sensitive robust Markov decision process (RSRMDP), derive its Bellman equation, and provide error analysis under a given posterior distribution. We further develop a Bayesian Dynamic Programming (Bayesian DP) algorithm that alternates between posterior updates and value iteration. The approach employs an estimator for the risk-based Bellman operator that combines Monte Carlo sampling with convex optimization, for which we prove strong consistency guarantees. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the algorithm converges to a near-optimal policy in the training environment and analyze both the sample complexity and the computational complexity under the Dirichlet posterior and CVaR. Finally, we validate our approach through two numerical experiments. The results exhibit excellent convergence properties while providing intuitive demonstrations of its advantages in both risk-sensitivity and robustness. Empirically, we further demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithm through an application on option hedging."

    "abstract": "Timesteppers constitute a powerful tool in modern computational science and engineering. Although they are typically used to advance the system forward in time, they can also be viewed as nonlinear mappings that implicitly encode steady states and stability information. In this work, we present an extension of the matrix-free framework for calculating, via timesteppers, steady states of deterministic systems to stochastic particle simulations, where intrinsic randomness prevents direct steady state extraction. By formulating stochastic timesteppers in the language of optimal transport, we reinterpret them as operators acting on probability measures rather than on individual particle trajectories. This perspective enables the construction of smooth cumulative- and inverse-cumulative-distribution-function ((I)CDF) timesteppers that evolve distributions rather than particles. Combined with matrix-free Newton-Krylov solvers, these smooth timesteppers allow efficient computation of steady-state distributions even under high stochastic noise. We perform an error analysis quantifying how noise affects finite-difference Jacobian action approximations, and demonstrate that convergence can be obtained even in high noise regimes. Finally, we introduce higher-dimensional generalizations based on smooth CDF-related representations of particles and validate their performance on a non-trivial two-dimensional distribution. Together, these developments establish a unified variational framework for computing meaningful steady states of both deterministic and stochastic timesteppers."

However, LLMs can generate output that deviates from what the user wants, requiring supervision and editing. To support this process, we offer techniques to localize where generations might be misaligned from user intent. We first create a dataset of \"Minimal Intent Aligning Patches\" of repaired LLM generated programs. Each program uses test cases to verify correctness. After creating a dataset of programs, we measure how well various techniques can assign a well-calibrated probability to indicate which parts of code will be edited in a minimal patch (i.e., give a probability that corresponds with empirical odds it is edited). We compare white-box probing (where we propose a technique for efficient arbitrary-span querying), against black-box reflective and self-consistency based approaches. We find probes with a small supervisor model can achieve low calibration error and Brier Skill Score of approx 0.2 estimating edited lines on code generated by models many orders of magnitude larger. We discuss the generalizability of the techniques, and the connections to AI oversight and control, finding a probe trained only on code shows some signs of generalizing to natural language errors if new probability scaling is allowed."

    "abstract": "Generating humorous memes is a challenging multimodal task that moves beyond direct image-to-caption supervision. It requires a nuanced reasoning over visual content, contextual cues, and subjective humor. To bridge this gap between visual perception and humorous punchline creation, we propose HUMOR}, a novel framework that guides VLMs through hierarchical reasoning and aligns them with group-wise human preferences. First, HUMOR employs a hierarchical, multi-path Chain-of-Thought (CoT): the model begins by identifying a template-level intent, then explores diverse reasoning paths under different contexts, and finally anchors onto a high-quality, context-specific path. This CoT supervision, which traces back from ground-truth captions, enhances reasoning diversity. We further analyze that this multi-path exploration with anchoring maintains a high expected humor quality, under the practical condition that high-quality paths retain significant probability mass. Second, to capture subjective humor, we train a pairwise reward model that operates within groups of memes sharing the same template. Following established theory, this approach ensures a consistent and robust proxy for human preference, even with subjective and noisy labels. The reward model then enables a group-wise reinforcement learning optimization, guaranteeing providing a theoretical guarantee for monotonic improvement within the trust region. Extensive experiments show that HUMOR empowers various VLMs with superior reasoning diversity, more reliable preference alignment, and higher overall meme quality. Beyond memes, our work presents a general training paradigm for open-ended, human-aligned multimodal generation, where success is guided by comparative judgment within coherent output group."

Here, we briefly review the recent progress in direct experimental access to the QGT in real crystalline solids using the polarization- and spin-resolved angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). The extraction of the QGT in momentum space was successfully addressed by two different approaches: One is by introducing quasi-QGT that faithfully represents the QGT and is directly measurable by ARPES. The other is through pseudospin tomography in a material with simple low energy band structure, which successfully retrieved all matrix components of the quantum metric. We discuss the physical meaning of these two recent progresses, their implication/limitation, and open directions."

    "abstract": "In this work, we address the limitation of surface fitting-based grasp planning algorithm, which primarily focuses on geometric alignment between the gripper and object surface while overlooking the stability of contact point distribution, often resulting in unstable grasps due to inadequate contact configurations. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel surface fitting algorithm that integrates contact stability while preserving geometric compatibility. Inspired by human grasping behavior, our method disentangles the grasp pose optimization into three sequential steps: (1) rotation optimization to align contact normals, (2) translation refinement to improve the alignment between the gripper frame origin and the object Center of Mass (CoM), and (3) gripper aperture adjustment to optimize contact point distribution. We validate our approach in simulation across 15 objects under both Known-shape (with clean CAD-derived dataset) and Observed-shape (with YCB object dataset) settings, including cross-platform grasp execution on three robot--gripper platforms. We further validate the method in real-world grasp experiments on a UR3e robot. Overall, DISF reduces CoM misalignment while maintaining geometric compatibility, translating into higher grasp success in both simulation and real-world execution compared to baselines.

Our notion of primitivity is defined modulo a certain integral domain, it is weaker than the classical definition of primitivity. We obtain also a generalization of the complete Poincaré duality over a certain integral domain to hypersurfaces obtained by patchworkings which are primitive modulo this integral domain. In particular, our corollary is that any tropical hypersurface obtained by patchworking from a triangulation of a simple lattice polytope satisfies complete Poincaré duality over the field of rationals, which is a converse of a theorem of Aksnes."

    "abstract": "The exponential growth of video traffic has placed increasing demands on bandwidth and storage infrastructure, particularly for content delivery networks (CDNs) and edge devices. While traditional video codecs like H.264 and HEVC achieve high compression ratios, they are designed primarily for pixel-domain reconstruction and lack native support for machine learning-centric latent representations, limiting their integration into deep learning pipelines. In this work, we present a Multi-Scale Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (MS-VQ-VAE) designed to generate compact, high-fidelity latent representations of low-resolution video, suitable for efficient storage, transmission, and client-side decoding. Our architecture extends the VQ-VAE-2 framework to a spatiotemporal setting, introducing a two-level hierarchical latent structure built with 3D residual convolutions. The model is lightweight (approximately 18.5M parameters) and optimized for 64x64 resolution video clips, making it appropriate for deployment on edge devices with constrained compute and memory resources. To improve perceptual reconstruction quality, we incorporate a perceptual loss derived from a pre-trained VGG16 network. Trained on the UCF101 dataset using 2-second video clips (32 frames at 16 FPS), on the test set we achieve 25.96 dB PSNR and 0.8375 SSIM. On validation, our model improves over the single-scale baseline by 1.41 dB PSNR and 0.0248 SSIM. The proposed framework is well-suited for scalable video compression in bandwidth-sensitive scenarios, including real-time streaming, mobile video analytics, and CDN-level storage optimization."

Here, we introduce photomodulated electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) in an optically coupled scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) to map photocarrier localization. Using rhodium-doped strontium titanate (SrTiO3:Rh) solar water-splitting nanoparticles, we directly image the carrier densities concentrated at oxygen-vacancy surface trap states. This is achieved by separating photothermal heating from photocarrier populations through experimental and computational analyses of low-loss spectra. Photomodulated STEM-EELS enables angstrom-scale imaging of defect-induced photocarrier traps and their impact on photocatalytic efficiency."

    "abstract": "In wide-area measurement systems (WAMS), phasor measurement unit (PMU) measurement is prone to data missingness due to hardware failures, communication delays, and cyber-attacks. Existing data-driven methods are limited by inadaptability to concept drift in power systems, poor robustness under high missing rates, and reliance on the unrealistic assumption of full system observability. Thus, this paper proposes an auxiliary task learning (ATL) method for reconstructing missing PMU data. First, a K-hop graph neural network (GNN) is proposed to enable direct learning on the subgraph consisting of PMU nodes, overcoming the limitation of the incompletely observable system. Then, an auxiliary learning framework consisting of two complementary graph networks is designed for accurate reconstruction: a spatial-temporal GNN extracts spatial-temporal dependencies from PMU data to reconstruct missing values, and another auxiliary GNN utilizes the low-rank property of PMU data to achieve unsupervised online learning. In this way, the low-rank properties of the PMU data are dynamically leveraged across the architecture to ensure robustness and self-adaptation. Numerical results demonstrate the superior offline and online performance of the proposed method under high missing rates and incomplete observability."

    "abstract": "The scaling of entanglement with subsystem size encodes key information about phases and criticality, but the von Neumann entropy is costly to access in experiments and simulations, often requiring full state tomography. The second Rényi entropy is readily measured using two-copy protocols and is often used as a proxy for the von Neumann entanglement entropy, where it is assumed to track its asymptotic scaling. However, Sugino and Korepiny (Int. J. Mod. Phys. B 32, 1850306 (2018)) revealed that in the ground state of some spin models, the scaling of the von Neumann and second Rényi entropies varies from power law to logarithmic scaling as a function of the Rényi index. By constructing a number-conserving many-body state with only two local degrees of freedom, we obtain a Rényi-index-dependent change in the leading entanglement scaling: the second Rényi entropy remains logarithmic while the von Neumann entropy is parametrically larger. We then introduce a symmetry-aware lower bound on the von Neumann entropy built from charge-resolved second Rényi entropies and the subsystem charge distribution. Comparing this bound to the total second Rényi entropy provides a practical diagnostic for anomalous entanglement scaling from experimentally accessible data."

Standard-dose computed tomography (CT) screening using the Lung Imaging Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) standardizes pulmonary nodule assessment but is limited by inter-reader variability and reliance on qualitative descriptors, while radiomics offers quantitative biomarkers that often lack clinical interpretability. To bridge this gap, we propose a radiological-biological dictionary that aligns radiomic features (RFs) with Lung-RADS semantic categories. A clinically informed dictionary translating ten Lung-RADS descriptors into radiomic proxies was developed through literature curation and validated by eight expert reviewers. As a proof of concept, imaging and clinical data from 977 patients across 12 collections in The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) were analyzed; following preprocessing and manual segmentation, 110 RFs per nodule were extracted using PyRadiomics in compliance with the Image Biomarker Standardization Initiative (IBSI). A semi-supervised learning framework incorporating 499 labeled and 478 unlabeled cases was applied to improve generalizability, evaluating seven feature selection methods and ten interpretable classifiers. The optimal pipeline (ANOVA feature selection with a support vector machine) achieved a mean validation accuracy of 0.79. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis identified key RFs corresponding to Lung-RADS semantics such as attenuation, margin irregularity, and spiculation, supporting the validity of the proposed mapping. Overall, this dictionary provides an interpretable framework linking radiomics and Lung-RADS semantics, advancing explainable artificial intelligence for CT-based lung cancer screening."

These codes arise from the known sharp codes embedded in the even unimodular extremal lattices $E_8$ and $Λ_{24}$ (Leech lattice). This embedding allows us to use the lattices' properties to find new universal polar dual pairs.

These geometric properties influence electronic transport and result in the anomalous and nonlinear Hall effects, and are typically controlled using static electric fields or strain. However, the possibility of modulating quantum geometric quantities in real-time remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate the dynamic modulation of Berry curvature and its moments, as well as the generation of a pseudo-electric field using time-dependent strain. By placing heterostructures on a membrane, we introduce oscillatory strain together with an in-plane AC electric field and measure Hall signals that are modulated at linear combinations of the frequencies of strain and electric field. Our measurements reveal modulation of Berry curvature and its first moment. Notably, we provide direct experimental evidence of pseudo-electric field that results in an unusual dynamic strain-induced Hall response. This approach opens up a new pathway for controlling quantum geometry on demand, moving beyond conventional static perturbations. The pseudo-electric field provides a framework for external electric field-free anomalous Hall response and opens new avenues for probing the topological properties."

    "abstract": "Audio-driven visual dubbing aims to synchronize a video's lip movements with new speech, but is fundamentally challenged by the lack of ideal training data: paired videos where only a subject's lip movements differ while all other visual conditions are identical. Existing methods circumvent this with a mask-based inpainting paradigm, where an incomplete visual conditioning forces models to simultaneously hallucinate missing content and sync lips, leading to visual artifacts, identity drift, and poor synchronization. In this work, we propose a novel self-bootstrapping framework that reframes visual dubbing from an ill-posed inpainting task into a well-conditioned video-to-video editing problem. Our approach employs a Diffusion Transformer, first as a data generator, to synthesize ideal training data: a lip-altered companion video for each real sample, forming visually aligned video pairs. A DiT-based audio-driven editor is then trained on these pairs end-to-end, leveraging the complete and aligned input video frames to focus solely on precise, audio-driven lip modifications. This complete, frame-aligned input conditioning forms a rich visual context for the editor, providing it with complete identity cues, scene interactions, and continuous spatiotemporal dynamics. Leveraging this rich context fundamentally enables our method to achieve highly accurate lip sync, faithful identity preservation, and exceptional robustness against challenging in-the-wild scenarios. We further introduce a timestep-adaptive multi-phase learning strategy as a necessary component to disentangle conflicting editing objectives across diffusion timesteps, thereby facilitating stable training and yielding enhanced lip synchronization and visual fidelity. Additionally, we propose ContextDubBench, a comprehensive benchmark dataset for robust evaluation in diverse and challenging practical application scenarios."

Motivated by the idea that intelligence emerge from many minds, we propose Population Bayesian Transformers (B-Trans), which transform a standard Large Language Model into a Bayesian Transformer model to supports sampling diverse yet coherent model instances from a single set of pre-trained weights. B-Trans introduces a Bayesian-motivated posterior proxy by treating the bias-like offsets in normalization layers as stochastic variables with a Gaussian variational approximation, inducing a distribution over model behavior without the cost of training full Bayesian neural networks. Sampling from this proxy yields a set of model instances with diverse behaviors while maintaining general competence. To preserve coherence within each generation, we freeze the sampled noise at the sequence level, enforcing temporal consistency across tokens. B-Trans allows for population-level decision-making, where aggregating predictions across sampled individuals significantly enhances exploration. Experiments across zero-shot generation, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), and RL without explicit labels demonstrate that B-Trans effectively leverage the wisdom of crowds, yielding superior semantic diversity while achieving better task performance compared to deterministic baselines."

In contrast, the Empirical Bayes (EB) methods are able to boost the average accuracy by borrowing information across tasks. Nevertheless, the EB methods require a Bayesian model where the parameters are sampled from a prior distribution which, unlike the commonly-studied Gaussian case, is unidentified due to discreteness of binomial measurements. Even if the prior distribution is known, the computation is difficult when the sample sizes are heterogeneous as there is no simple joint conjugate prior for the sample size and mean parameter. In this paper, we consider the compound decision framework which treats the sample size and mean parameters as fixed quantities. We develop an approximate Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimator (SURE) for the average mean squared error given any class of estimators. For a class of machine learning-assisted linear shrinkage estimators, we establish asymptotic optimality, regret bounds, and valid inference. Unlike existing work, we work with the binomials directly without resorting to Gaussian approximations. This allows us to work with small sample sizes and/or mean parameters in both one-sample and two-sample settings. We demonstrate our approach using three datasets on firm discrimination, education outcomes, and innovation rates."

    "abstract": "We construct and validate a set of multi-purpose mock galaxy catalogs designed to capture, to different degrees of accuracy, the main characteristics of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope survey. These catalogs provide a foundation for void statistics and various CMB cross-correlation analyses. Our approach differs from traditional halo occupation or abundance matching methods by directly translating a reference mock catalog -- containing basic properties of the host halos -- into a new simulation (in our case Agora). This technique, which we call analog matching, assigns a halo counterpart in the new simulation to each reference galaxy through a nearest-neighbor search in a multi-dimensional parameter space. This space can include halo mass, environmental measures and other galaxy-specific attributes. By varying the composition of this parameter vector, we can generate catalogs of differing complexity and conduct systematic tests to examine the influence of modelling choices on LSS statistics. We find that analog matching based on halo mass alone, or halo mass and galaxy-type indicators, successfully reproduces the expected Roman emission-line galaxy statistics. We also show that reproducing two-dimensional galaxy clustering does not guarantee consistent void properties. Our results highlight the importance of matching void statistics for improved mock accuracy, and demonstrate that measuring voids provides independent and sensitive constraints on galaxy-halo connections beyond the matter power spectrum. An important by-product of our setup is that it is fully general and can be applied to any combination of simulation and reference catalog, provided that the desired parameter space for both is specified. The resulting Roman-Agora mock catalogs offer a versatile resource for LSS x CMB studies and a benchmark for assessing the impact of mock accuracy on cosmological observables."

Ensemble-averaged velocity autocorrelation functions rapidly decorrelate and do not resolve the pronounced dynamic heterogeneity of the system, whereas single-ion analysis reveals short-lived episodes of nearly collinear motion. By mapping active-site clusters over increasing time windows, we show that ion-conducting pathways are quasi one-dimensional at short times and evolve into larger, branched structures characterized by a robust fractal dimension $d_f\\simeq1.7$. This geometry persists while the silicate backbone remains structurally arrested, whereas near the glass-transition temperature the loss of structural memory leads to the reappearance of small clusters. These results provide a real-space structural interpretation of ionic transport in non-crystalline solids and support fractal pathway models of high-frequency ionic response."

In this study, we developed and calibrated multi-scale, patient-specific cardiovascular models for four pediatric PAH patients using longitudinal MRI and catheterization data collected approximately two years apart. Using the CRIMSON simulation framework, we coupled three-dimensional fluid-structure interaction (FSI) models of the pulmonary arteries with zero-dimensional (0D) lumped-parameter heart and Windkessel models to simulate patient hemodynamics. An automated Python-based optimizer was developed to calibrate boundary conditions by minimizing discrepancies between simulated and clinical metrics, reducing calibration time from weeks to days. Model-derived metrics such as arterial stiffness, pulse wave velocity, resistance, and compliance were found to align with clinical indicators of disease severity and progression. Our findings demonstrate that computational modeling can non-invasively capture patient-specific hemodynamic adaptation over time, offering a promising tool for monitoring pediatric PAH and informing future treatment strategies."

    "abstract": "Transformer language models can generate strikingly natural text by modeling language as a sequence of tokens. Yet, by relying primarily on surface-level co-occurrence statistics, they fail to form globally consistent latent representations of entities and events, lack of which contributes to brittleness in relational direction (e.g., reversal curse), contextualization errors, and data inefficiency. On the other hand, cognitive science shows that human comprehension involves converting the input linguistic stream into compact, event-like representations that persist in memory while verbatim form is short-lived. Motivated by this view, we introduce Thought Gestalt (TG) model, a recurrent Transformer that models language at two levels of abstraction - tokens and sentence-level \"thought\" states. TG generates the tokens of one sentence at a time while cross-attending to a memory of prior sentence representations. In TG, token and sentence representations are generated using the same set of model parameters and trained with a single objective, the next-token cross-entropy: by retaining the computation graph of sentence representations written to memory, gradients from future token losses flow backward through cross-attention to optimize the parameters generating earlier sentence vectors. In scaling experiments, TG consistently improves efficiency over matched GPT-2 runs, among other baselines, with scaling fits indicating GPT-2 requires ~5-8% more data and ~33-42% more parameters to match TG's loss. TG also reduces errors on relational direction generalization on a father-son reversal curse probe."

The goal is to determine a job processing permutation for each day, aiming to minimize the maximum total completion time experienced by any client. This problem is known to be NP-hard for quite restrictive settings, with previous work offering exact solution methods for highly-structured special cases. In this paper, we focus on the design of approximation algorithms with provable performance guarantees. Our main contributions can be briefly summarized as follows: (i) When job processing times are day-dependent, we devise a polynomial-time LP-based $2$-approximation, as well as a polynomial-time approximation scheme for a constant number of days. (ii) With day-invariant processing times, we obtain a surprisingly simple $(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{2}}{2}+ε)$-approximation in polynomial time. This setting is also shown to admit a quasi-polynomial-time approximation scheme for an arbitrary number of days. The key technical component driving our approximation schemes is a novel batching technique, where jobs are conceptually grouped into batches, subsequently leading either to a low-dimensional dynamic program or to a compact configuration LP. Concurrently, while developing our constant-factor approximations, we propose a host of lower-bounding mechanisms that may be of broader interest."

For gravity, however, the algorithm can become notoriously arduous to implement. We present a simple computer algebra package for efficiently computing Poisson brackets and reconstructing constraint algebras. The tools are stress-tested against pure general relativity and modified gravity, including the order reduction of general relativity at two loops."

Our motivation comes from studying an interpolation $\\{\\mathsf{WST}^β(G)\\}_{β\\in [0, \\infty)}$ between UST(G) and MST(G) by WST's on a one-parameter family of random environments. This model has recently been introduced in [MSS24, Kús24], and the phases of several properties have been determined on the complete graphs. We show a phase transition of $\\mathsf{WST}^{β_n}(G_n)$ regarding the local limit and expected edge overlaps for high degree almost balanced graph sequences $G_n$, without any structural assumptions on the graphs; while the expected total length is sensitive to the global structure of the graphs.

Open-vocabulary visual effects generation from text inputs emerges as a promising solution that can unlock immense creative potential.

In contrast, PhysTalk takes a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scene as input and translates arbitrary user prompts into real time, physics based, interactive 4D animations. A large language model (LLM) generates executable code that directly modifies 3DGS parameters through lightweight proxies and particle dynamics. Notably, PhysTalk is the first framework to couple 3DGS directly with a physics simulator without relying on time consuming mesh extraction. While remaining open vocabulary, this design enables interactive 3D Gaussian animation via collision aware, physics based manipulation of arbitrary, multi material objects. Finally, PhysTalk is train-free and computationally lightweight: this makes 4D animation broadly accessible and shifts these workflows from a \"render and wait\" paradigm toward an interactive dialogue with a modern, physics-informed pipeline."

However, implementing nonlinear activation, essential for machine learning, remains challenging in low-power optical systems dominated by linear wave physics. Here, we introduce an optical spiking neural network that uses optical rogue-wave statistics as a programmable firing mechanism. By establishing a homomorphism between free-space diffraction and neuronal integration, we demonstrate that phase-engineered caustics enable robust, passive thresholding: sparse spatial spikes emerge when the local intensity exceeds a significant-intensity rogue-wave criterion. Using a physics-informed digital twin, we optimize granular phase masks to deterministically concentrate energy into targeted detector regions, enabling end-to-end co-design of the optical transformation and a lightweight electronic readout. We experimentally validate the approach on BreastMNIST and Olivetti Faces, achieving accuracies of 82.45\\% and 95.00\\%, respectively, competitive with standard digital baselines.

To address this need, we introduce two complementary software tools: SymSeq, designed to rigorously generate and analyze structured symbolic sequences, and SeqBench, a comprehensive benchmark suite of rule-based sequence processing tasks to evaluate the performance of artificial learning systems in cognitively relevant domains. In combination, SymSeqBench offers versatility in investigating sequential structure across diverse knowledge domains, including experimental psycholinguistics, cognitive psychology, behavioral analysis, neuromorphic computing and artificial intelligence. Due to its basis in Formal Language Theory (FLT), SymSeqBench provides researchers in multiple domains with a convenient and practical way to apply the concepts of FLT to conceptualize and standardize their experiments, thus advancing our understanding of cognition and behavior through shared computational frameworks and formalisms.

We introduce Distilled Matryoshka Sparse Autoencoders (DMSAEs), a training pipeline that distills a compact core of consistently useful features and reuses it to train new SAEs. DMSAEs run an iterative distillation cycle: train a Matryoshka SAE with a shared core, use gradient X activation to measure each feature's contribution to next-token loss in the most nested reconstruction, and keep only the smallest subset that explains a fixed fraction of the attribution. Only the core encoder weight vectors are transferred across cycles; the core decoder and all non-core latents are reinitialized each time. On Gemma-2-2B layer 12 residual stream activations, seven cycles of distillation (500M tokens, 65k width) yielded a distilled core of 197 features that were repeatedly selected. Training using this distilled core improves several SAEBench metrics and demonstrates that consistent sets of latent features can be transferred across sparsity levels"

    "abstract": "The absence of Birkhoff's theorem in effective quantum gravity models leads to a fundamental ambiguity in the vacuum sector, where a priori no unique vacuum solution exists. As a result, phenomenological investigations of the physical implications of these models have been made more difficult. We address this challenge by establishing a constructive framework which allows to formulate 4D covariant actions from the physical nature of the systems's degrees of freedom, which are dust and gravity, together with two guiding principles. We take advantage of the non-propagating nature of a relational dust clock and the suppression of gravitational waves in spherical symmetry. This structural ultralocality allows for a decomposition of the dynamics into independent LTB shells. We further impose spatial diffeomorphism invariance and a geometric guiding principle, where the latter ensures that a unique and static vacuum solution exists. These assumptions allow to strictly constrain the LTB shell Hamiltonian to a factorised form as well as the static vacuum metric function to a universal form. This constructive framework produces a fully 4D-covariant action that belongs to the class of generalised extended mimetic gravity models. This provides the necessary consistent basis for a perturbation theory in the context of quasi-normal modes or cosmological perturbations beyond the static sector in which quantum gravity effects are also included in linear and higher order perturbations. Furthermore, for this class of models our results resolve the long-standing `curvature polymerisation ambiguity' in loop quantum cosmology by unambiguously determining how flat space modifications are extended to non-flat geometries, thus unifying the description of black holes and cosmology in a single effective framework."

Notably, STAgent effectively preserves its general capabilities. We empower STAgent with these capabilities through three key contributions: (1) a stable tool environment that supports over ten domain-specific tools, enabling asynchronous rollout and training; (2) a hierarchical data curation framework that identifies high-quality data like a needle in a haystack, curating high-quality queries with a filter ratio of 1:10,000, emphasizing both diversity and difficulty; and (3) a cascaded training recipe that starts with a seed SFT stage acting as a guardian to measure query difficulty, followed by a second SFT stage fine-tuned on queries with high certainty, and an ultimate RL stage that leverages data of low certainty.

Using an electrically driven, edge-emitting diode laser that operates self-sustainably, we show that LICAM enables highly sensitive magnetometers operating under ambient conditions. Near the lasing threshold, we achieve a 475-fold enhancement in optical contrast and a 180-fold improvement in magnetic sensitivity compared with a conventional single-pass geometry. The experimental results are accurately described by a rate-equation model for single-mode diode lasers. From our measurements, we determine a projected shot-noise-limited sensitivity in the $\\mathrm{pT}\\,\\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ range and show that, with realistic device improvements, sensitivities down to the $\\mathrm{fT}\\,\\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ scale are attainable."

Such a result is intimately to the properties of Pauli operators. In this work, using the technique in matrix theory, we give an alternative proof for the case of three observables, and generalize the result to the case of four measurements. Comparing with the original proof, such a derivation is simplified. Moreover, the discussions can deal with the summation form of uncertainty relation for two, three and four observables in a unified way."

The time evolution of the interface between two immiscible fluids and the effects of surface tension on the growth of the amplitude and asymmetry of the perturbed interface are examined for the initial wavelength 1 cm and the Atwood number A=0.29. The important features of RTI flows such as interface profiles, bubble/spike penetration and velocities show good agreement between experiments and simulations of immiscible fluids with surface tension. The velocity vector fields for the bubble and spike in the linear and nonlinear regimes are consistent with the theory for the single wavelength perturbation."

    "abstract": "Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring from chest CT is a well-established tool to stratify and refine clinical cardiovascular disease risk estimation. CAC quantification relies on the accurate delineation of calcified lesions, but is oftentimes affected by artifacts introduced by cardiac and respiratory motion. ECG-gated cardiac CTs substantially reduce motion artifacts, but their use in population screening and routine imaging remains limited due to gating requirements and lack of insurance coverage. Although identification of incidental CAC from non-gated chest CT is increasingly considered for it offers an accessible and widely available alternative, this modality is limited by more severe motion artifacts. We present ProDM (Property-aware Progressive Correction Diffusion Model), a generative diffusion framework that restores motion-free calcified lesions from non-gated CTs. ProDM introduces three key components: (1) a CAC motion simulation data engine that synthesizes realistic non-gated acquisitions with diverse motion trajectories directly from cardiac-gated CTs, enabling supervised training without paired data; (2) a property-aware learning strategy incorporating calcium-specific priors through a differentiable calcium consistency loss to preserve lesion integrity; and (3) a progressive correction scheme that reduces artifacts gradually across diffusion steps to enhance stability and calcium fidelity. Experiments on real patient datasets show that ProDM significantly improves CAC scoring accuracy, spatial lesion fidelity, and risk stratification performance compared with several baselines. A reader study on real non-gated scans further confirms that ProDM suppresses motion artifacts and improves clinical usability. These findings highlight the potential of progressive, property-aware frameworks for reliable CAC quantification from routine chest CT imaging."

    "abstract": "The railway ticketing system is one of the most important public service infrastructure. In peak periods such as holidays, it is often faced with the challenge of high concurrency scenarios because of a large number of users accessing at the same time. The traditional aggregation architecture can not meet the peak user requirements because of its insufficient fault tolerance and low ability. Therefore, the system needs to use microservice architecture for development, and add multiple security methods to ensure that the system can have good stability and data consistency under high concurrency scenarios, and can respond quickly to user requests. This paper introduces the use of B/S architecture and Spring Cloud to design and develop a railway ticket purchase system that can maintain stability and reliability under high concurrency scenarios, and formulate multiple security design methods for the system. This system integrates a range of functions, such as real-time train inquiries, dynamic seat updates, online seat selection, and ticket purchasing, effectively addressing common problems associated with offline ticket purchasing, such as long queues and delayed information. It enables a complete online process from inquiry and booking to payment and refunds. Furthermore, the \"add passenger\" function allows users to purchase tickets for others, extending the convenience of online ticketing to people with limited internet access. The system design prioritizes security and stability, while also focusing on high performance, and achieves these goals through a carefully designed architecture and the integration of multiple middleware components. After the completion of the system development, the core interface of the system is tested, and then the results are analyzed. The test data proves that the system has good ability and stability under high concurrency."

    "abstract": "We study the problem of fair $k$-committee selection under an egalitarian objective. Given $n$ agents partitioned into $m$ groups (\\eg, demographic quotas), the goal is to aggregate their preferences to form a committee of size $k$ that guarantees minimum representation from each group while minimizing the maximum \\emph{cost} incurred by any agent. We model this setting as the ordinal fair $k$-center problem, where agents are embedded in an unknown metric space, and each agent reports a complete preference ranking (i.e., ordinal information) over all agents, consistent with the underlying distance metric (i.e., cardinal information). The cost incurred by an agent with respect to a committee is defined as its distance to the closest committee member. The quality of an algorithm is evaluated using the notion of distortion, which measures the worst-case ratio between the cost of the committee produced by the algorithm and the cost of an optimal committee, when given complete access to the underlying metric space. When cardinal information is not available, no constant distortion is possible for the ordinal $k$-center problem, even without fairness constraints, when $k\\geq 3$ [Burkhardt et.al., AAAI'24]. To overcome this hardness, we allow limited access to cardinal information by querying the metric space. In this setting, our main contribution is a factor-$5$ distortion algorithm that requires only $O(k \\log^2 k)$ queries. Along the way, we present an improved factor-$3$ distortion algorithm using $O(k^2)$ queries."

By employing SNAIL as couplers, we realize inter-modular state transfer in 0.8 μs via a three-wave mixing process. The state transfer fidelity reaches 98.2% for quantum states encoded in the first two energy levels, achieving a Bell state fidelity of 92.5%. Furthermore, we show the capability to transfer high-dimensional states by successfully transmitting binomially encoded logical states. Systematic characterization reveals that performance constraints have shifted from transmission line losses (contributing merely 0.2% infidelity) to module-channel interface effects and local Kerr nonlinearities. Our work advances the realization of quantum interconnects approaching fundamental capacity limits, paving the way for scalable distributed quantum computing and efficient quantum communications."

    "abstract": "Existing research on generative AI security is primarily driven by mutually reinforcing attack and defense methodologies grounded in empirical experience. This dynamic frequently gives rise to previously unknown attacks that can circumvent current detection and prevention. This necessitates the continual updating of security mechanisms. Constructing generative AI with provable security and theoretically controllable risk is therefore necessary. Consensus Sampling (CS) is a promising algorithm toward provably secure AI. It controls risk by leveraging overlap in model output probabilities. However, we find that CS relies on frequent abstention to avoid unsafe outputs, which reduces utility. Moreover, CS becomes highly vulnerable when unsafe models are maliciously manipulated. To address these issues, we propose a new primitive called Reliable Consensus Sampling (RCS), that traces acceptance probability to tolerate extreme adversarial behaviors, improving robustness. RCS also eliminates the need for abstention entirely. We further develop a feedback algorithm to continuously and dynamically enhance the safety of RCS. We provide theoretical guarantees that RCS maintains a controllable risk threshold. Extensive experiments show that RCS significantly improves robustness and utility while maintaining latency comparable to CS. We hope this work contributes to the development of provably secure generative AI."

Recently, FAST J0139+4328 was reported as the first isolated dark galaxy in the nearby universe, based on a neutral hydrogen (HI) detection and a non-detection in the Pan-STARRS1 survey. To verify the nature of this candidate, we obtained deep optical imaging, using the $1.4\\,\\mathrm{m}$ \\textit{Milanković} and $0.6\\,\\mathrm{m}$ \\textit{Nedeljković} telescopes, and spectroscopic follow-up of the field. We report the unambiguous discovery of a low-surface-brightness (LSB) optical counterpart at the location of the HI cloud. Furthermore, the detection of H$α$ emission via the $6\\,\\mathrm{m}$ Big Telescope Alt-Azimuthal (BTA) confirms that the stellar system lies at a redshift consistent with the HI source, establishing their physical association. Through detailed photometry and employing color-dependent mass-to-light scaling relations, we derive a total stellar mass of $M_\\star = (7.2 \\pm 3.7) \\times 10^6\\, M_{\\odot}$, about an order of magnitude higher than the previously estimated upper limit. Using the literature HI mass, this implies a gas-to-stellar mass ratio of $M_{\\mathrm{HI}} / M_{\\star} = 11.5 \\pm 6.4$. Our findings demonstrate that FAST J0139+4328 is not a dark galaxy but an extremely gas-rich LSB dwarf galaxy, whose stellar component was simply below the detection limit of the Pan-STARRS1 survey. This reclassification resolves the status of this prominent dark galaxy candidate and underscores the necessity of deep optical follow-up to classify faint HI-selected systems."

However, current mainstream HPR solutions relying on vision or radio-frequency (RF) (including WiFi, radar) still face various challenges in practical deployment, such as privacy concerns, susceptibility to occlusion, dedicated equipment and functions, and limited sensing resolution and range. 5G-based integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technology, by merging communication and sensing functions, offers a new approach to address these challenges in contactless HPR. We propose a practical 5G-based ISAC system capable of inferring 2D HPR from uplink sounding reference signals (SRS). Specifically, rich features are extracted from multiple domains and employ an encoder to achieve unified alignment and representation in a latent space. Subsequently, low-dimensional features are fused to output the human pose state. Experimental results demonstrate that in typical indoor environments, our proposed 5G-based ISAC HPR system significantly outperforms current mainstream baseline solutions in HPR performance, providing a solid technical foundation for universal human-computer interaction."

To mitigate this well-known phenomenon we study robust growth-optimization in a high-dimensional incomplete market under drift uncertainty of the asset price process $X$, under an additional ergodicity assumption, which constrains but does not fully specify the drift in general. The class of admissible models allows $X$ to depend on a multivariate stochastic factor $Y$ and fixes (a) their joint volatility structure, (b) their long-term joint ergodic density and (c) the dynamics of the stochastic factor process $Y$. A principal motivation of this framework comes from pairs trading, where $X$ is the spread process and models with the above characteristics are commonplace. Our main results determine the robust optimal growth rate, construct a worst-case admissible model and characterize the robust growth-optimal strategy via a solution to a certain partial differential equation (PDE). We demonstrate that utilizing the stochastic factor leads to improvement in robust growth complementing the conclusions of the previous study by Itkin et. al. (arXiv:2211.15628 [q-fin.MF], forthcoming in $\\textit{Finance and Stochastics}$), which additionally robustified the dynamics of the stochastic factor leading to $Y$-independent optimal strategies. Our analysis leads to new financial insights, quantifying the improvement in growth the investor can achieve by optimally incorporating stochastic factors into their trading decisions. We illustrate our theoretical results on several numerical examples including an application to pairs trading."

Importantly, we show that the nonlinear coefficient $λ$ provides accurate control of this periodicity: a positive $λ$ stretches the region, while a negative $λ$ compresses it.

We first introduce a physical model and analyze its Hamiltonian structure, emphasizing the role of hybrid dimensionality and axial symmetry. The effects of decoherence are then examined under two local noise mechanisms, namely dephasing and phase-flip channels, acting on the qubit and qutrit subsystems in both symmetric and asymmetric configurations. Quantum correlations are quantified using negativity to capture entanglement and quantum discord based on linear entropy to characterize more general nonclassical correlations. Our results show that both thermal fluctuations and phase noise lead to a monotonic degradation of quantum correlations, with increasing temperature accelerating coherence loss and inducing entanglement sudden death at finite temperatures. While negativity vanishes abruptly under sufficiently strong noise, quantum discord persists beyond the entanglement threshold, revealing residual quantum correlations in mixed states. We further demonstrate that asymmetric noise configurations significantly enhance the robustness of both entanglement and discord by partially shielding coherence in the less affected subsystem. A comparative analysis reveals that phase-flip noise is more destructive than pure dephasing, leading to faster suppression of quantum correlations."

Here, we demonstrate the detection of spatial biphoton joint probability distributions in both the image plane and the pupil plane (also termed \"near-field plane\" and \"far-field plane\" respectively) using a conventional scientific CMOS camera operated in linear mode. We work at mesoscopic intensity levels, corresponding to a photon flux approximately four orders of magnitude higher than typical photon-counting approaches. From the measured image- and pupil plane correlations, we observe position and momentum correlations consistent with an EPR-type entanglement witness. A tailored correlation analysis suited for image plane imaging suppresses detector artifacts and intensity fluctuations, enabling acquisition with significantly fewer frames. Our results demonstrate that spatially entangled-light imaging can be performed efficiently with standard imaging hardware, extending quantum imaging techniques beyond the photon-counting regime."

A lightweight model-consistency correction ensures physically plausible cloud variable reconstructions. The resulting framework demonstrates potential for retrievals of atmospheric, cloud and surface variables, providing information that can serve as a prior, initial guess, or surrogate for computationally expensive full-physics inversion methods.

To address this challenge, we report an experimentally accessible protocol for directly measuring the mixed-state topological invariant. By engineering controlled nonunitary dynamics in a photonic quantum walk, we prepare topologically nontrivial mixed states from a trivial initial state. Furthermore, by machine-learning the full density matrix in momentum space, we directly extract the quantized geometric phase of the nontrivial mixed states. These results highlight a geometric phase framework that naturally extends to open quantum systems both in and out of thermal equilibrium."

    "abstract": "3D scene graphs have empowered robots with semantic understanding for navigation and planning, yet they often lack the functional information required for physical manipulation, particularly regarding articulated objects. Existing approaches for inferring articulation mechanisms from static observations are prone to visual ambiguity, while methods that estimate parameters from state changes typically rely on constrained settings such as fixed cameras and unobstructed views. Furthermore, fine-grained functional elements like small handles are frequently missed by general object detectors. To bridge this gap, we present ArtiSG, a framework that constructs functional 3D scene graphs by encoding human demonstrations into structured robotic memory. Our approach leverages a robust articulation data collection pipeline utilizing a portable setup to accurately estimate 6-DoF articulation trajectories and axes even under camera ego-motion. We integrate these kinematic priors into a hierarchical and open-vocabulary graph while utilizing interaction data to discover inconspicuous functional elements missed by visual perception. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that ArtiSG significantly outperforms baselines in functional element recall and articulation estimation precision. Moreover, we show that the constructed graph serves as a reliable functional memory that effectively guides robots to perform language-directed manipulation tasks in real-world environments containing diverse articulated objects."

Identifying these interactions is challenging due to background connections. Furthermore, data heterogeneity across sources precludes universal identification criteria. To address this challenge, we introduce \\textsf{friends.test}, a method for identifying specificity by detecting structural breaks in entity interactions. Rank-based representation of the interaction matrix ensures invariance to heterogeneous data and allows for integrating data from diverse sources. To automatically locate the boundary between specific interactions and background activity, we employ model fitting.

The silhouette score offers an intuitive, model-free criterion that balances within-cluster cohesion and between-cluster separation. Albeit its widespread use in clustering analysis, its performance in network-based community detection remains insufficiently characterized. In this study, we comprehensively evaluate the performance of the silhouette score across unweighted, weighted, and fully connected networks, examining how network size, separation strength, and community size imbalance influence its performance. Simulation studies show that the silhouette score accurately identifies the true number of communities when clusters are well separated and balanced, but it tends to underestimate under strong imbalance or weak separation and to overestimate in sparse networks. Extending the evaluation to a real airline reachability network, we demonstrate that the silhouette-based clustering can recover geographically interpretable and market-oriented clusters. These findings provide empirical guidance for applying the silhouette score in network clustering and clarify the conditions under which its use is most reliable."

    "abstract": "We present GenZ, a hybrid model that bridges foundational models and statistical modeling through interpretable semantic features. While large language models possess broad domain knowledge, they often fail to capture dataset-specific patterns critical for prediction tasks. Our approach addresses this by discovering semantic feature descriptions through an iterative process that contrasts groups of items identified via statistical modeling errors, rather than relying solely on the foundational model's domain understanding. We formulate this as a generalized EM algorithm that jointly optimizes semantic feature descriptors and statistical model parameters. The method prompts a frozen foundational model to classify items based on discovered features, treating these judgments as noisy observations of latent binary features that predict real-valued targets through learned statistical relationships. We demonstrate the approach on two domains: house price prediction (hedonic regression) and cold-start collaborative filtering for movie recommendations. On house prices, our model achieves 12\\% median relative error using discovered semantic features from multimodal listing data, substantially outperforming a GPT-5 baseline (38\\% error) that relies on the LLM's general domain knowledge. For Netflix movie embeddings, our model predicts collaborative filtering representations with 0.59 cosine similarity purely from semantic descriptions -- matching the performance that would require approximately 4000 user ratings through traditional collaborative filtering. The discovered features reveal dataset-specific patterns (e.g., architectural details predicting local housing markets, franchise membership predicting user preferences) that diverge from the model's domain knowledge alone."

Its intention is to put together several basic tools of classical integrability and contrast them with those available in the formulation of asymptotic symmetries and the definition of canonical charges in gauge theories. We consider as a working example the Chern-Simons theory in 3D dimensions, motivated by its various applications in condensed matter physics, gravity, and black hole physics. We review basic aspects of the canonical formulation, symplectic geometry, Liouville integrability, and Lax Pairs. We define the Hamiltonian formulation of the Chern-Simons action and the canonical generators of the gauge symmetries, which are surface integrals that subject to non-trivial boundary conditions, realize transformations that do change the physical state, namely large (or improper gauge transformations). We propose asymptotic conditions that realize an infinite set of abelian conserved charges associated with integral models. We review two different cases: the Korteweg-de Vries equation for its connection with the Virasoro algebra and fluid dynamics, and the Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur (AKNS) hierarchy, as it embeds an infinite class of non-linear notable integrable evolution equations. We propose a concrete example for gravity in 3D with $Λ<0$, where we find a near-horizon asymptotic dynamics. We finalize offering some insights on the initial value problem, its connection with integrable systems and flat connections. We study some properties of the Monodromy matrix and recover the infinite KdV charges from the trace invariants extracted from the Monodromy evolution equation that can be written in a Lax form."

In the Euclidean plane, the maximum comes from a spiral construction of the tiling of the plane with equilateral triangles (Harborth 1974), with a similar result in the hyperbolic plane for the values of $d$ corresponding to the order-$k$ triangular tilings (Bowen 2000). We present various upper and lower bounds for $e_d(n)$ for all values of $d > 0$. In particular, we prove that if $d > 0.66114\\dots$ except for $d=0.76217\\dots$, then the number of touching pairs is less than the one coming from a spiral construction in the order-$7$ triangular tiling, which we conjecture to be extremal.

    "abstract": "Temporally extended actions improve the ability to explore and plan in single-agent settings. In multi-agent settings, the exponential growth of the joint state space with the number of agents makes coordinated behaviours even more valuable. Yet, this same exponential growth renders the design of multi-agent options particularly challenging. Existing multi-agent option discovery methods often sacrifice coordination by producing loosely coupled or fully independent behaviours. Toward addressing these limitations, we describe a novel approach for multi-agent option discovery. Specifically, we propose a joint-state abstraction that compresses the state space while preserving the information necessary to discover strongly coordinated behaviours. Our approach builds on the inductive bias that synchronisation over agent states provides a natural foundation for coordination in the absence of explicit objectives. We first approximate a fictitious state of maximal alignment with the team, the \\textit{Fermat} state, and use it to define a measure of \\textit{spreadness}, capturing team-level misalignment on each individual state dimension. Building on this representation, we then employ a neural graph Laplacian estimator to derive options that capture state synchronisation patterns between agents. We evaluate the resulting options across multiple scenarios in two multi-agent domains, showing that they yield stronger downstream coordination capabilities compared to alternative option discovery methods."

Nanoparticles larger than 5 nm cannot be readily phagocytosed inside the cell like animal cells. It is here that we realise that Tradescantia zebrina plant cells have prismatic forms of calcium oxalate crystals present inside them naturally. These crystals make a ready choice to study properties of the inner cell surface with the application of optical tweezers. Moreover, out-of-plane rotations in optical tweezers have begun to be explored only recently. The pitch rotation has been detected with high resolution and several applications are explored. In this work, we first study the stable configuration while trapped in linearly polarized optical tweezers and then explore the other out-of-plane configurations to detect the roll rotation at high resolution. Then a micro-rheological analysis is performed to obtain the frictional properties of the inner surface of the plasma membrane of the leaf cell. The size of the particle is about 5 $μ$m along the diagonal, so that the contact length with the surface is about 200 nm. We measure a frictional force of 18.5 pN at a sensitivity of about 200 fN without averaging."

Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF) addresses this by framing non-transitive preferences as a two-player zero-sum game, where alignment reduces to finding the Nash equilibrium (NE). However, existing algorithms typically rely on regularization, incurring unavoidable bias when computing the duality gap in the original game. In this work, we provide the first convergence guarantee for Optimistic Multiplicative Weights Update ($\\mathtt{OMWU}$) in NLHF, showing that it achieves last-iterate linear convergence after a burn-in phase whenever an NE with full support exists, with an instance-dependent linear convergence rate to the original NE, measured by duality gaps. Compared to prior results in Wei et al. (2020), we do not require the assumption of NE uniqueness. Our analysis identifies a novel marginal convergence behavior, where the probability of rarely played actions grows exponentially from exponentially small values, enabling exponentially better dependence on instance-dependent constants than prior results. Experiments corroborate the theoretical strengths of $\\mathtt{OMWU}$ in both tabular and neural policy classes, demonstrating its potential for LLM applications."

While an extensive existence theory of weak solutions to the thin-film equation was established more than two decades ago, even boundedness of weak solutions in $d=2$ has remained a major unsolved problem in the theory of the thin-film equation. Due the fourth-order structure of the thin-film equation, De Giorgi-Nash-Moser theory is not applicable.

We establish that the large central charge of the boundary conformal field theory corresponds to classical gravity, while a small central charge corresponds to quantum gravity described by Loop Quantum Gravity. In addition, we study the thermodynamic behavior of AdS-Schwarzschild black holes for both large and small central charges. For large central charge, the classical AdS-Schwarzschild black holes have two phases: unstable small black holes and stable large black holes. Conversely, for small central charge, black holes are stable, and their entropy is smaller than that of classical black holes. To explore the influence of the boundary central charge on the information loss paradox, we use the island formula to recover the Page curve. We find that before the Page time, the entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation increases with time, and its slope is determined by the central charge of the boundary theory. After the Page time, the island inside black holes emerges, and the unitarity of black hole evaporation is restored, yielding a constant entropy consistent with the Page curve. This entanglement entropy, i.e. after the Page time, depends on the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and includes a logarithmic correction related to the central charge."

These phenomena appear across architectures -- in attention mechanisms, classification heads, and energy-based models -- yet existing explanations rely on loose analogies to mixture models or post-hoc architectural interpretation. We provide a direct derivation. For any objective with log-sum-exp structure over distances or energies, the gradient with respect to each distance is exactly the negative posterior responsibility of the corresponding component: $\\partial L / \\partial d_j = -r_j$. This is an algebraic identity, not an approximation. The immediate consequence is that gradient descent on such objectives performs expectation-maximization implicitly -- responsibilities are not auxiliary variables to be computed but gradients to be applied. No explicit inference algorithm is required because inference is embedded in optimization. This result unifies three regimes of learning under a single mechanism: unsupervised mixture modeling, where responsibilities are fully latent; attention, where responsibilities are conditioned on queries; and cross-entropy classification, where supervision clamps responsibilities to targets. The Bayesian structure recently observed in trained transformers is not an emergent property but a necessary consequence of the objective geometry. Optimization and inference are the same process."

To tackle these issues, we propose, Semi-SMDNet, a strong Semi-Supervised Multilingual Depression detection Network. It combines teacher-student pseudo-labelling, ensemble learning, and augmentation of data. Our framework uses a group of teacher models. Their predictions come together through soft voting. An uncertainty-based threshold filters out low-confidence pseudo-labels to reduce noise and improve learning stability. We also use a confidence-weighted training method that focuses on reliable pseudo-labelled samples. This greatly boosts robustness across languages. Tests on Arabic, Bangla, English, and Spanish datasets show that our approach consistently beats strong baselines. It significantly reduces the performance gap between settings that have plenty of resources and those that do not. Detailed experiments and studies confirm that our framework is effective and can be used in various situations. This shows that it is suitable for scalable, cross-language mental health monitoring where labelled resources are limited."

In our setting, an adversary may arbitrarily perturb a fraction of the collected trajectories from a high-dimensional but sparse Markov decision process, and our goal is to estimate a near optimal policy. The main challenge is that, in the high-dimensional regime where the number of samples $N$ is smaller than the feature dimension $d$, exploiting sparsity is essential for obtaining non-vacuous guarantees but has not been systematically studied in offline RL. We analyse the problem under uniform coverage and sparse single-concentrability assumptions. While Least Square Value Iteration (LSVI), a standard approach for robust offline RL, performs well under uniform coverage, we show that integrating sparsity into LSVI is unnatural, and its analysis may break down due to overly pessimistic bonuses. To overcome this, we propose actor-critic methods with sparse robust estimator oracles, which avoid the use of pointwise pessimistic bonuses and provide the first non-vacuous guarantees for sparse offline RL under single-policy concentrability coverage. Moreover, we extend our results to the contaminated setting and show that our algorithm remains robust under strong contamination. Our results provide the first non-vacuous guarantees in high-dimensional sparse MDPs with single-policy concentrability coverage and corruption, showing that learning a near-optimal policy remains possible in regimes where traditional robust offline RL techniques may fail."

Rather than encrypting the entire state matrix of a given controller, the state matrix is transformed into its rational canonical form, whose sparse and circulant structure enables that encryption and computation are required only on its nontrivial columns. Furthermore, we propose a novel method to ``pack'' each of the input and the output matrices into a single polynomial, thereby reducing the number of homomorphic operations. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed design enables a remarkably fast implementation of encrypted controllers."

    "abstract": "The healthcare Internet of Things (IoT), which relies on wearable devices to collect patient health data and aggregate it on cloud server, plays a key role in modern healthcare system. How to achieve bidirectional access control while ensuring secure information transmission is a significant challenge facing the healthcare industry. Identity-based matchmaking encryption (IB-ME) and attribute-based matchmaking encryption (AB-ME) show great research potential in achieving these functions. However, IB-ME schemes are typically limited to one-to-one scenarios. While AB-ME enables flexible many-to-many communication, its high communication overhead made it difficult for direct application in resource-constrained environments. Therefore, striking a balance between functionality and efficiency is crucial. Moreover, in healthcare IoT system, user deletion or revocation of decryption permission may be necessary due to the possibility of malicious behavior, organization changes, or discontinuing subscription services. To address these issues, this paper proposes an efficient revocable attribute-based matchmaking encryption (RAB-ME) scheme for healthcare IoT systems. This scheme not only supports bilateral access control but also enables user permission revocation while maintaining high efficiency. We analyzed the privacy and authenticity of this scheme based on the random oracle model. Through extensive comparisons and experimental simulations, our scheme outperforms existing approaches."

This significantly increases network spectral efficiency and transmission robustness. The semantic codecs among various users and modalities, based on ML, however, inevitably experience semantic drift and necessitate collaborative updating to preserve transmission quality. The various heterogeneous characteristics of most networks, in turn, introduce emerging but unique challenges for semantic codec updating that are different from other general ML model updating. In this article, we propose a heterogeneity-aware semantic codec updating scheme to achieve efficient and reliable updating in heterogeneous networks. We begin with the introduction of the core components of SemCom and then highlight key issues in semantic codec updating under network heterogeneity, discussing several potential methods. Furthermore, the scheme is provided with performance metrics. Future research directions for advancing SemCom in complex, multi-modal environments are also discussed."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the discrete-time sliding mode (DTSM) trajectory tracking control problem for fully actuated autonomous surface vehicles with stochastic network communication delays, based on a self-triggered mechanism. By integrating the Poisson distribution, Thiran approximation, and DTSM control methods, the adverse impact of stochastic network delays on trajectory tracking control is mitigated. To reduce data transmission load and the wear and energy consumption associated with frequent sensor sampling, this study explores enhancing the adaptability of the controller over a larger range of sampling periods. A novel adaptive DTSM power reaching law is proposed, facilitating the development of a DTSM controller that eliminates the need for repeated parameter adjustments across different sampling periods. This innovation enables effective trajectory tracking control over a broader range of sampling periods. Based on this, an uncommon non-predictive DTSM-based self-triggered control strategy is designed within the discrete-time domain. Unlike conventional prediction-based and non-predictive linear state feedback-based discrete-time self-triggered strategies, this method effectively balances computational complexity with the demands for robustness and rapid response. It eliminates the reliance on real-time system state monitoring required by event-triggered mechanisms. This is the first self-triggered strategy proposed to accommodate large sampling periods, thereby further reducing data transmission frequency while ensuring satisfactory trajectory tracking performance. Stability analysis demonstrates that all tracking errors converge to a small region near zero. Simulation results validate the efficacy of the proposed control strategy."

The sensor fabrication involved heat-assisted deformation of single-mode fiber to form a waterdrop structure, followed by electrostatic spray coating of graphene oxide and low-current-density electroplating of nickel. The unique geometry enhances evanescent field interaction and sensing surface area, while the Ni-GO composite coating improves thermal conductivity and mechanical stability. Thermal expansion mismatch between the Ni coating and silica substrate induces thermo-mechanical stress, resulting in measurable resonance wavelength shifts that correlate linearly with temperature changes. Experimental characterization demonstrated an average temperature sensitivity of 0.0179 nm/°C with an average linearity of 0.9935 over the range of 30–150 °C with excellent stability and repeatability across multiple heating and cooling cycles. These results validate the sensor's potential for precise, durable, and rapid temperature monitoring applicable in industrial and environmental conditions."

    "abstract": "With the increasing demands of high-performance electronic devices on the dimensional stability and reliability of large-area package substrates, conventional organic substrates are prone to warpage and solder joint failure under thermo-mechanical loading, which has become a critical bottleneck for advanced packaging technologies. To address this issue, this study proposes a structural design strategy that locally embeds a glass core within large-area package substrates to enhance their thermo-mechanical performance and improve solder joint reliability. A three-dimensional finite element model was established, incorporating the chip, microbumps, underfill, glass core, and organic substrate, with the viscoplastic constitutive behavior of the solder included to characterize its time-dependent mechanical response under temperature cycling from $-55^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ to $125^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. The substrate warpage and solder joint stress-strain distributions were systematically evaluated, and the Engelmaier-modified Coffin-Manson model was employed to predict the thermal fatigue life of the solder joints. The results indicate that the local glass core significantly reduces substrate warpage, with maximum deformation much smaller than that of conventional fully organic substrates. Meanwhile, the stress and strain distributions of the solder joints become more uniform, effectively mitigating high stress concentrations in critical regions, thereby substantially extending the predicted solder joint lifetime, particularly in high-risk areas such as package corners. Overall, the study demonstrates that local glass core embedding effectively suppresses substrate warpage and enhances solder joint durability, providing a feasible strategy and engineering reference for the structural optimization and reliability design of large-area highperformance package substrates."

This study explores application-level approximate communication techniques for lossy high-performance interconnection networks prone to bit flips. We focus on the lossy compression of floating-point data, as this data type is frequently exchanged between compute nodes in parallel applications. Existing compression techniques typically do not account for lossy interconnection networks. Therefore, the core challenge in our approximate communication approach is the co-design of a lossy floating-point compression algorithm and a critical bit-flip recovery scheme, optimized for a specific bit error rate within a target lossy inter-connection network. Our objective is to maximize the transfer of approximate data while minimizing compression overhead and bit-flip recovery time. To prevent bit-flip errors in compressed data during transmission, we employ several application-level bitflip check and correction techniques, including CRC and Hamming code. Our scheme is implemented in several representative communication-intensive MPI applications, demonstrating that our approximate communication approach effectively protects from bit flips with minimal impact on execution performance."

In proposed driver, the number of power SiC MOS used is significantly reduced, the conduction loss is decreased, and the control complexity and associated costs are greatly reduced, the ZVS can be achieved by all power SiC MOS and the conversion efficiency is improved.

Timely and accurate finding through medical imaging especially ultrasound is crucial for suitable treatment planning and prognosis. However, manual ultrasound image evaluation is prone to variability and diagnostic errors. This research implements an automatic deep learning-based method for categorizing ultrasound images of breast into benign, malignant, and normal classes. This research paper used a public dataset with over 1500 ultrasound images in three diagnostic classes. The CNN abstracts the spatial structures, the LSTM seizures the temporal dependencies and this implementation built an optimized hybrid CNN-LSTM model. The model was trained by employing data augmentation and transfer learning with the deep learning neural-net architecture to increase robustness and accuracy. Training accuracy 93.6% and validation accuracy 86.7% was obtained. The validation loss is low and thus well developed. High classification accuracy was corroborated using visualization techniques such as confusion matrices and prediction overlays particularly for malignant cases. Augmentation was further applied to correct a class imbalance issue that allowed the model to perform well. The optimized fusion of CNN - LSTM model is promising its performance to support radiologists in cancer recognition by considering the ultrasound images and can serve as an effective and scalable clinical decision-support solution."

    "abstract": "In recent years, annealing processors (APs), which can efficiently solve combinatorial optimization problems (COPs), have attracted attention. APs indirectly solve COPs by mapping combinations of spin states (±1) in the Ising model to candidate solutions. APs that have fully-coupled spin coupling can be used for a wide range of COPs. However, since a single spin is updated by referring to the states of all other spins, sequential spin updates are necessary. This makes it difficult to achieve both high computational speed and stable solution quality. In this paper, we propose transition-based multi-state pseudo annealing (TMSPA), which is an annealing method that allows discrete spin states between ±1 and maps the conventional two spin states to different transition directions. By using TMSPA, we solved the Max-Cut problem and the traveling salesman problem (TSP). We found that TMSPA enables all-parallel annealing for both COPs. In terms of solution quality, TMSPA performed comparably to or better than simulated annealing and pseudo annealing. In particular, for the TSP, TMSPA reached better minimum values with less than one-third the number of Monte Carlo steps than previous all-parallel annealing methods."

Its inference latency is shaped not only by compute but also by parameter streaming over a constrained and potentially contended I/O channel. Prior work has largely relied on profiling with modified SRAM capacities, which provides only isolated insights and fails to capture runtime behavior when weights exceed on-chip memory or when multiple devices contend for USB bandwidth. In this paper, we present a streaming-aware latency model for the USB Edge TPU. In evaluation, we validate the model using several practical DNNs. Experimental results show that the predicted upper and lower bounds can effectively bound the measured latencies. Our work offers a foundation for future work on a predictive framework that generalizes to multi-device environments that require real-time guarantees, for which USB contention introduces nondeterminism."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) play a crucial role in natural language conversations. While they perform well on general tasks that do not require Domain-Specific Knowledge (DSK), conventional LLMs often generate incorrect responses for tasks that demand such expertise. To address this challenge, researchers have proposed fine-tuning approaches such as Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) and instruction tuning. Although effective, these methods require substantial computational resources. To overcome this limitation, OpenAI introduced the custom-GPT framework, which enables the integration of DSK without the high computational cost of traditional finetuning. Building on this framework, we present Pattern MiningGPT (PAMI-GPT), a domain-specialized LLM that combines a structured Domain Knowledge Base (DKB) of pattern mining with the GPT-5 architecture. Pattern mining, a fundamental technique in big data analytics that extracts various types of interesting patterns from large-scale data, has long remained restricted to experts due to its implementation complexity. PAMIGPT addresses this barrier by providing precise algorithm definitions, valid parameter configurations, and reproducible code. Experimental evaluations under zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting demonstrate superior accuracy, reliability, and domain consistency compared to leading LLMs. A case study further highlights its capability to generate executable pattern mining workflows, making advanced techniques more accessible to non-specialists."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the distributed operational optimization of interconnected distribution networks featuring reconfigurable topologies and soft open points (SOPs). A unified modeling framework is established that integrates the operational characteristics of distributed generation (DG), energy storage systems (ESS), and topology reconfiguration constraints, while capturing inter-area coupling via SOPs. To ensure network connectivity and radiality, a virtual power flow (VPF)-based modeling method is adopted. Furthermore, a distributed optimization algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is proposed to support distributed coordination among multiple areas, ensuring data privacy and computational scalability. Simulation studies on interconnected IEEE 33-bus systems demonstrate the proposed model's effectiveness in reducing operation costs, enhancing voltage regulation, and enabling inter-regional energy sharing. The results validate the synergy between SOP-based interaction and topology flexibility in future smart distribution networks."

The methodology integrates Mask R-CNN for precise segmentation of lung regions, followed by a fine-tuned RestNet50 model for binary classification. B y e ffectively is olating lung areas, Mask R-CNN enhances the relevance of extracted features, thereby improving diagnostic performance. On the original imbalanced dataset, the framework achieved a classification accuracy of 90.71%. Upon the incorporation of data augmentation techniques to address class imbalance, the performance significantly improved, reaching an accuracy of 95.26%. These results underscore the critical role of data balancing in enhanced model generalization and reliability. This research highlights the synergistic benefit of combining of instance segmentation with deep classification networks for superior pneumonia detection in chest radiographs. The integration of segmentation enables the model to focus on diagnostically relevant regions, thus boosting the efficacy of fe ature ex traction an d classification. Future research will investigate the inclusion of clinical metadata (e.g.: age, symptoms, comorbidities) to further personalize and refine diagnostics accuracy. This advancement holds potential for facilitating the deployment of AI-assisted diagnostic tools in the real world clinical settings, ultimately contributing to timely and reliable medical decision making."

In this article, we propose a novel methodology and a tool based on LLVM for iterative WCET-driven compiler autotuning, which is the first strategy to operate at function-level granularity and to consider not only the selection of optimization passes, but also their ordering. Our findings show that standard optimization levels <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathrm{O} 0, \\mathrm{O} 1, \\mathrm{O} 2$</tex>, and O 3 are suboptimal when targeting the WCET, and that a per-function selection and ordering of the transformations is necessary.

This paper enhances accuracy and credibility by introducing a Smart Health Monitoring System with Machine Learning-based Fall Detection and Severity Assessment using multiple sensors and a hybrid machine learning model. The system employs GPS, GSM modules, accelerometers, heart rate, and Spo2 sensors for real-time health monitoring. The approach enables prioritisation of critical conditions by separating falls from regular activity and evaluating severity based on physiological changes by monitoring multi-sensor data. Live location tracking also enables real-time sending of emergency alerts, which reduces response times and enhances patient safety. Early intervention of the likely health issue is enabled by combining the system with anomaly detection and past health trends. The system allows for a 91.9 % rate of anomaly detection accuracy, reducing false alarms by 30 % compared to available thresholdbased approaches. The emergency response time is also reduced by 40 %, making it an extremely cost-effective and reliable approach for real-time health monitoring."

The island typically experiences high electricity demand, with a peak of approximately 104 MW and a monthly energy consumption of about 60.5 GWh. Currently, this energy is supplied from the mainland via an underwater transmission system. Given that Koh Samui is surrounded by the sea, it presents an opportunity to install FPV systems and wind turbines. Based on local weather data, the potential area for FPV installation is approximately 900 square kilometers, with an estimated annual energy output of 142.02 MWh. This system could reduce <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\text{CO}_{2}$</tex> emissions by about 49.7 tons per year. Economic evaluation using internal rate of return (IRR) equal to 6.98 % and levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) equal to 2.32 THB/kWh indicates that the investment is financially viable.

    "abstract": "Managing clinical data in EHR systems is challenging due to scattered and fragmented information, requiring significant manual effort to compile and extract meaningful insights. In a Question Answering System, complex clinical queries often necessitate multihop reasoning across multiple data tables and contexts to retrieve accurate answers. To enable effective multihop reasoning, the first step is to identify and extract relevant tables that contribute to generating a precise response to a given user query. However, existing approaches lack a dedicated framework for MIMIC-specific table name extraction. Traditional models do not inherently support identifying relevant table names such as \"DIABETES\" and \"PRESCRIPTION\" based on a query, nor do they establish appropriate links between extracted entities and corresponding database tables. To overcome these limitations, we propose three entity extraction workflows leveraging semantic similarity calculations, LLM-boosted mapping, and table-based matching techniques, ensuring improved accuracy in retrieving structured clinical information. Experiments were conducted using the MIMIC-III dataset to evaluate the performance of these workflows. The semantic similarity approach achieved a high recall of 0.93, indicating its effectiveness in retrieving relevant tables, while the LLM-boosted mapping showed a precision of 0.64, demonstrating its accuracy in identifying correct tables. These results highlight the potential of the proposed techniques to enhance clinical question answering systems."

On the basis of the proposed observer, we design a robust consensus control law.

This research presents a novel approach integrating Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with deep learning models to enhance fault classification and location prediction in electrical transmission networks. The proposed framework is evaluated on an IEEE 9-bus system, where various fault scenarios-such as single line-to-ground (LG), line-to-line (LL), double line-to-ground (LLG), and three-phase to ground (LLLG) faults are simulated using MATLAB. The dataset was self-generated by introducing various symmetrical and unsymmetrical faults at different buses. It includes Voltage and current waveforms during fault and normal conditions, and corresponding labels for fault type and fault location (in kilometers), and Synthetic data generated by GANs is used to augment the training dataset, resulting in improved generalization and robustness of the classifier. Comparative analysis shows that the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model augmented with GAN-generated data achieves an accuracy of 94.5%, outperforming Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and CNN models trained on real data alone. Additionally, the location prediction module demonstrates high precision, with errors typically under 1.2 km.

The multimodal model combines ResNet101 and VGG16 for image features and BERT for textual data processing, while the unimodal models are: An image model implemented using ResNet101 and VGG16 to classify images standalone. A text model that uses BERT for text-only classification.

Our findings show how the multimodal model, using ResNet101 and VGG16 for image features and BERT for text data, performs much better compared to the unimodal methods. The highest Macro F1 Score of 0.87 is achieved by the multimodal approach, an indicator of a much better performance compared to the unimodal methods.

Valve stiction is a major nonlinearity in process industries, often causing oscillations and poor control performance. The majority of research focuses on stiction detection in single-input single-output (SISO) systems, although loop interactions present extra difficulties for multivariable processes. In this work, valve stiction in a closedloop, two-input, two-output (TITO) process is examined. Three scenarios are studied: stiction in Loop 1 while Loop 2 remains linear, stiction in Loop 2 while Loop 1 remains linear, and stiction in both loops. For each scenario, the controller output (CO), manipulated variable (MV), and process variable (PV) are recorded for both loops to examine the propagation of nonlinear effects. Performance is evaluated through correlations between COs and MVs. The results show that stiction in one loop not only affects its own performance but also causes oscillations and performance degradation in the interacting loop, emphasizing the need for MIMO aware stiction diagnosis and compensation."

    "abstract": "In the large-scale application of new energy vehicle industry, the performance bottleneck of battery thermal management is becoming more and more prominent - excessive temperature difference will lead to uneven distribution of thermal stress within the battery pack, accelerating structural fatigue and performance degradation, directly affecting the range and service life of the whole vehicle; and excessive pressure drop of the cooling system will significantly increase the energy consumption of the pumping and reduce the overall energy efficiency of the system, and even cause local overheating due to insufficient cooling, threatening the safety of the battery. If the cooling system pressure drop is too high, it will significantly increase the pumping energy consumption and reduce the overall energy efficiency of the system. Therefore, the simultaneous optimization of temperature difference and pressure drop is not only the key to improve the utilization of battery energy density and shorten the fast charging time, but also the core demand to ensure the reliability and economy of the battery system throughout its life cycle. Aiming at the parameter uncertainty problem commonly faced in multivariate multi-objective optimization in the engineering field, this paper focuses on the core requirements of battery thermal management system (BTMS), and innovatively proposes a multi-objective genetic algorithm for the robust optimization of internal and external cycles, which focuses on solving the synergistic balance between the temperature difference control and pressure drop optimization in BTMS. By constructing a Kriging agent model to capture the complex nonlinear relationship between the independent variables and the response, and combining the framework of internal and external double-loop robust optimization: the internal loop is based on random sampling to quantify the influence of parameter fluctuations on temperature difference and pressure drop, and the external loop adopts genetic algorithm to search for the optimal solution globally, ultimately, it achieves the balance optimization with multi-objective under uncertain environment, and provides an efficient and reliable solution for the optimization of multi-response parameters in the engineering practice. efficient and reliable solution for multi-response parameter optimization in engineering practice."

First, the power system data is obtained through timedomain simulation and transformed into graph-structured data. Then, by incorporating the idea of the temporal ensembling algorithm, a semi-supervised graph convolutional network (SGCN) framework is constructed to extract features from the power system data, and the mapping relationship between the graph convolutional network (GCN) and power system transient stability is established. Finally, through the analysis and verification of the IEEE 39-bus system, the outcomes demonstrate that the devised method demonstrates good overall performance when dealing with a small number of labeled samples."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models frequently generate outputs that appear scientifically reasonable yet violate fundamental principles—a phenomenon we characterize as the “plausibility-validity gap.” This challenge proves especially acute in chemistry, where superficial correctness masks deeper errors in molecular structure, reaction mechanisms, and synthetic pathways. We present a systematic approach combining a reasoning-centric model architecture (Magistral Small) with Low-Rank Adaptation fine-tuning on a dual-domain dataset covering molecular properties and chemical transformations. Evaluation reveals substantial improvements: the fine-tuned system achieves 96.3 % format adherence, 97.4 % chemical validity, and 74.4 % synthesis feasibility. Comparative analysis shows our approach outperforms specialized translation models like MolT5 (97.4 % vs 77.2 % validity) while achieving performance comparable to complex tool-augmented systems like ChemCrow (9.0/10 vs 9.24/10 expert rating) through a more transparent, efficient methodology. Results demonstrate a learning hierarchy where syntactic correctness develops before chemical understanding, which precedes synthetic planning capability. This work establishes a reproducible framework for transforming generalist language models into dependable scientific tools while identifying critical areas including stereochemical precision, knowledge currency, and computational accessibility as key challenges for future advancement."

    "abstract": "Fully automated myocardial segmentation from cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is vital for efficient diagnosis and treatment planning. Although numerous automated methods have been proposed, they typically focus on single MRI sequences and therefore have difficulties in generalizing across vendors and across cardiac MRI protocols. Simultaneous analysis of complementary cardiac MRI sequences, such as cine, T1 mapping, and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) MRI, remains challenging due to their distinct image characteristics and scanner-specific variations. To address these issues, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation approach that allows robust myocardial segmentation across multi-vendor cine, T1, and LGE MRI data. In particular, we introduce a class- imbalance self-training framework to transfer information learned from a source domain with labels to any unlabeled target domain, while maintaining consistent performance across different MRI sequences. Our framework iteratively refines segmentation accuracy by generating pseudo-labels for target data using a hardness-aware strategy, thus effectively addressing the problem of class imbalance in cardiac MRI segmentation. To mitigate data scarcity following pseudo-label selection, we employ a variance-guided vicinal feature extrapolation, which expands data points in the feature space into a probabilistic distribution. This, in turn, facilitates joint source–target training by generating a larger intersection in the feature space. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing methods when assessed using the Dice coefficient and Hausdorff distance. Our framework enables cardiac evaluation across MRI protocols without sequence-specific manual annotations."

    "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided mobile edge computing (MEC) with a blockchain consensus algorithm is a promising solution for addressing mobile offloading of computation-intensive or latency-sensitive tasks with extensive service range, while ensuring the authenticity of the offloading. Existing UAV-aided MEC studies focus on task offloading or trajectory planning of single-antenna UAVs, missing multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) UAV systems. In addition, most blockchain-based UAV-aided edge computing studies adopt energy-consuming proof-of-work-based consensus mechanisms, which are unsuitable for energy-limited UAV scenarios. To address the above issues, in this paper, we develop a joint deadline-aware task offloading and UAV trajectory planning scheme, utilizing the effects simulated through an energy-efficient consensus protocol. In order to prevent the exhaustion of UAVs' energy and ensure the authenticity of decision-making, we propose an energy-based Raft (E-Raft) consensus algorithm, enabling dynamic leader selection through a series of decreasing energy thresholds. Subsequently, we present a computational profit maximization problem to jointly optimize deadline-aware task offloading and the UAV swarm's trajectory planning. To address this NP-hard problem, we develop an online priority-based task offloading and trajectory selection algorithm, which is performed by the selected leader of the E-Raft consensus in each round. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme achieves up to 40% performance improvement over other approaches."

Our approach first utilizes Frequency-Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) mmWave radar to extract micro-Doppler time series features characterizing gesture movements. Then, a hybrid CTC/attention architecture baseline method is proposed to achieve end-to-end (E2E) text output without explicit letter segmentation. By introducing a dynamic block training strategy, the model can process contextual data of arbitrary length. During inference, the connectionist temporal classification (CTC) decoder generates n-best hypotheses at the character level in a streaming manner, while the attention decoder subsequently re-scores these hypotheses to update the final result at the text level. We have constructed the first word-level handwriting dataset for mmWave radar, and also conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method on this dataset. The results demonstrate that the method exhibits excellent performance. Furthermore, when deployed on mobile devices, mmScribe maintains its outstanding performance with minimal latency.

To address these challenges, we propose UAB-Sync, a time synchronization algorithm specifically designed for the system. UAB-Sync introduces a novel three-stage architecture that uses dual constraints of time and energy to dynamically optimize the duration of energy signal, achieving adaptive approximation of optimal results. Besides, a closed-form solution for clock parameter estimation that incorporates Doppler factor estimation and accounts for multi-source measurement errors is developed, ensuring effective synchronous correction.

Dual-Functional Radar-Communication (DFRC) is a key 6G enabler for ISAC, which ensures efficient hardware and spectrum utilization. In this paper, we propose a unified framework to tackle the challenges of performance trade-off between radar and communication in DFRC systems. Firstly, we introduce the Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) waveform into DFRC systems, and then establish a unified performance trade-off framework through developing an Integrated Sensing and Communication Trade-off (ISCT) algorithm, where Pareto optimal waveforms can be obtained through balancing beampattern and multi-user interference (MUI) under varying trade-off coefficients. Furthermore, we use the Weighted Fractional Fourier Transform (WFRFT) to extend the OTFS waveform in proposed unified DFRC framework, where an additional degree of freedom with more waveform choices can be achieved in WFRFT-OTFS, and thus more flexible trade-off optimization can be considered for diverse scenarios. Finally, we propose a Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) suppression algorithm under the WFRFT-OTFS based DFRC framework, where flexible PAPR performance can be obtained according to jointly optimizing the trade-off coefficient and WFRFT order. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed unified framework based on WFRFT-OTFS achieves flexible performance adjustments and trade-offs. In addition, PAPR performance can be controlled according to the dual parameter characteristic as well as the proposed PAPR reduction algorithm, which greatly enhances the practicality and scalability of the unified framework for DFRC systems."

Mobile application developers heavily depend on user feedback in the form of reviews, as it helps them identify problems with their apps and ensures they currently meet user expectations. User reviews are inherently informal, disorganized, and unstructured. It is challenging to extract and classify the information on relevant issues due to the vast number of reviews. To expedite the classification of reviews, many researchers implemented machine-learning approaches. This work proposes a deep learning-based framework, MAUSPC, which utilizes RNN-LSTM to classify user reviews of mobile learning applications (apps), assessing usability, security& privacy. This approach leverages deep learning’s ability to extract useful information and automatically create classifications. The proposed framework builds on the latest developments of the GPT-3 Transformer by utilizing a text embedding approach. This method offers a high-quality depiction that can enhance the efficacy of detection. Furthermore, we employed the hybrid approach, which combined RNN-LSTM models into a single model that performed noticeably better than the sum of its components. The dataset of mobile learning applications was divided into two categories—usability and security & privacy—was used to conduct the model’s experimental assessment.

However, the detection accuracy and robustness of current methods are still limited by dataset constraints, including small scale, narrow target size distribution, sparse targets, and high scenario specificity. To address these problems, we integrate publicly available datasets to construct IRShip—a relatively large-scale infrared ship detection dataset comprising 27,138 images, significantly improving data scale and diversity. We further design a copy-poisson blend (CP-PB) offline data augmentation approach and introduce a dense one-to-one (Dense-O2O) online augmentation strategy, which improve adaptability to complex backgrounds and scale variations, mitigate problems from sparse targets, and improve dataset utility and model robustness.

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) power Doppler (PD) imaging enables visualization of volumetric microvasculature networks. However, 3D ultrafast PD imaging with matrix arrays suffers from limited resolution due to the restricted aperture size and the use of unfocused plane waves, while delay-and-sum (DAS) exhibits high sidelobe levels and broad main lobes, hindering high-quality PD imaging. In this study, we aim to improve the 3D null subtraction imaging (NSI) and propose coherence-based NSI beamformers including NSI based on coherence factor (NSI-CF) and NSI based on spatial and angular coherence factor (NSI-SACF). Specifically, NSI-SACF integrates the high-resolution capability of NSI and the high-contrast performance of spatial and angular coherence factor (SACF). The proposed beamformers are validated through simulations, phantom experiments, and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">in vivo</i> experiments. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations confirm the superiority of NSI-SACF. In the simulations, NSI-SACF achieves a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 0.059 mm compared with 0.391 mm for DAS and 0.225 mm for SACF. NSI-SACF also reduces the sidelobe level by 75.5 dB and 33.6 dB compared with DAS and SACF respectively, while effectively suppressing grating lobes. In the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">in vivo</i> experiments, NSI-SACF improves the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of blood flow by 20.03 dB and 8.65 dB over DAS and SACF, respectively. Furthermore, the FWHM of the vessel is reduced to 0.098 mm with NSI-SACF, compared with 0.326 mm for DAS and 0.159 mm for SACF. In summary, the proposed NSI-SACF beamformer effectively enhances the PD imaging by simultaneously improving spatial resolution and contrast, demonstrating the potential for clinical applications."

However, a potential conflict due to inconsistent intentions between human drivers and autonomous driving (AD) systems enormously hinders the progress of intelligent vehicles, especially on curved roads. Even though there have been certain studies on human-like trajectory planning methods, few of them address from the perspective of driving behavior characteristics learning. This paper proposed a collaborative trajectory planning and tracking control scheme for HMcD in curve scenarios. Firstly, the data of skilled human drivers were collected under various curved conditions on a designed driver-in-loop (DiL) real-time simulation platform, and the steering behaviors and trajectory characteristics of human drivers were analyzed in terms of lane, roadside constraint and road curvature. Based on these characteristics, a sliding online human-like trajectory planning (SOHTP) model was proposed, path information, vehicle state, and driving outcome were identified as model input. In addition, a HMcD shared controller was designed on account of Nash equilibrium and optimal control theory. The dynamic disturbance, i.e., future time-varying curvature, was incorporated into the closed loop of human-vehicle-road planning and control. Finally, the performance comparisons and verification tests were designed and carried out. The results show that the constructed HMcD collaborative control system efficiently alleviates human-machine conflict, reduces driving burden, and improves driving satisfaction compared to completely manual driving."

    "abstract": "Under low-to-moderate ambient lighting, screen flicker from display devices can lead to considerable visual discomfort. The industry typically addresses this issue through the implementation of Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) and Direct Current (DC) dimming technologies. Current assessments of flicker risks primarily focus on the quantitative analysis of hardware physical parameters. These measurements indirectly characterize flicker intensity based on the fluctuation properties of light sources. However, this methodology does not take into account the physiological variations in human visual responses and overlooks the persistent deviations from optimal optical conditions during standard device usage. As a result, existing methods are insufficient for adequately evaluating the visual function abnormalities that may arise. Research indicates that screen flicker influences brain function by modulating oscillations in the visual cortex. These neurological effects are expected to result in measurable changes in visual performance. However, existing studies predominantly concentrate on detecting brain function, with a notable absence of direct physiological evidence that establishes a link between flicker and visual impairment.To address these limitations, we conducted human-factor experiments assessing PWM and DC dimming effects on ocular function through three physiological markers: Accommodation Microfluctuations (ACC), Higher-Order Aberrations (HOAs), and Modulation Transfer Function (MTF). Participants engaged in 45-minute visual tasks on PWM and DC-dimmed displays, with ocular measurements taken before and after each session.At a brightness level of 45-55 nits, PWM dimming exhibited a significantly greater impact on ocular imaging quality compared to DC dimming during continuous visual tasks.However, $\\triangle \\mathrm{ACC}$ testing indicated no statistically significant difference in visual fatigue indices between the two technologies. While PWM’s high-frequency brightness oscillations increased wavefront aberrations (spherical and coma aberrations), both technologies demonstrated comparable cumulative effects on retinal neural adaptation fatigue. This study provides empirical guidance for optimizing dimming technology selection in display devices."

    "abstract": "In this work, we propose a new edge computing framework for fault detection of industrial machines based on sound vibration analysis. A low footprint TinyML model has been used and deployed on the Arduino Nano RP2040 microcontroller via TensorFlow Lite. The machines' acoustic signals are evaluated for unusual patterns indicative of damage or wear. Features are extracted by the MelFrequency Energy (MFE), which is introduced to effectively represent spectral properties of the audio signal related to the machine condition monitoring. Conventional fault detection systems are generally based on cloud services, which inevitably rely on continuous data to be transmitted from the edge devices to the remote servers for the purpose of processing and inferencing. This solution comes with the added latency, power usage and network dependency and security risks. In contrast, the proposed edge computing approach enhances extensive work on scene graph generation and detection. online inference on the embedded device. This provides immediate fault finding, low latency, higher data security, and removes the requirement of always-on cloud connection. Local processing of data reduces Operative Costs due to less bandwidth consumption and less dependence on Cloud services. It may save energy, thus making it suitable for use in the industrial area which is far away from the city or lack of energy sources. By reducing the response time any potential for delays, which can often manifest as system failures or downtime, is kept at a minimal. The paper also provides empirical evaluation and comparative studies to show that the edge-based model is more effective than the conventional cloud approach. In summary, this work showcases the promise of TinyML and edge computing for smart, cost-effective, and energy-efficient fault detection in industrial applications."

This design creates multiple stable clock frequencies using efficient counter-based division techniques to produce 5 different signals from a 50 MHz input dual clock.

Both synchronous reset mechanisms and a flexible design ensure smooth operation and the ability to meet various application needs. Precise clock generation is crucial for error-free operation in modern digital systems. Many applications need a precision clock divider to create multiple synchronized timing domains from one input clock source. This solution focuses on low power use and high efficiency, making it perfect for re-source-limited applications like FPGAs and ASICs. The system clocks maintain temporal synchronization and provide accurate timing signals, ensuring compatibility with systems that have strict timing requirements.

This study innovatively combines adaptive converter management with ripple-frequency-dependent energy modeling to assess power loss and fuel inefficiency, building on known methodologies. The converter functions over an extensive frequency range (10-60 kHz) and ripple amplitude spectrum (0-25%), facilitating a more profound understanding of ripple-frequency dynamics. Experimental findings indicate a significant fluctuation in stack voltage and efficiency contingent upon ripple parameters, with efficiency losses reaching 22 % at elevated ripple and low frequency. The proposed model precisely forecasts performance under ripple conditions and facilitates the design of ripple-tolerant converter systems for fuel cell applications."

To make this a faster process, we created a web-based platform that delivers cuttingedge deep learning to clinicians' fingertips. Once you upload an MRI image, users are navigated through an interface powered by Flask: a very well-optimized MobileNetV2 model scans first for any sign of a tumor, and a U-Net segmentation network then sharply defines its edges. In development, we tested various architectures, such as DenseNet-121 and a custom MobileNet-ViT hybrid, and ended up with MobileNetV2 due to its optimal balance between speed and precision. The platform returns tumor detection and segmentation outcomes in seconds, with precise, actionable information to enable confident medical decisions. By encapsulating powerful neural networks within an easy-to-use interface, our solution provides reliable brain tumor diagnosis more affordably and helps enhance patient care."

However, their growing complexity and makes them vulnerable to sophisticated threats such as algorithm substitution attacks (ASAs) and cryptographic subversion. Traditional cryptographic methods are often inadequate in detecting or mitigating such attacks. This paper proposes a tamper-resilient cryptographic framework that combines Certificateless Proxy Re-encryption (CL-PRE) with the concept of a Cryptographic Reverse Firewall (CRF). The TRCP-SSG scheme securely distributes encrypted data from smart meters to users via smart grids and resists data exfiltration and ciphertext forgery, even under system compromise. The analysis shows that the proposed approach is lightweight, scalable, and effective in securing smart grid communications against adversarial models such as CPA and ASA."

    "abstract": "Electromagnetic field prediction is critical for ensuring the safety and reliability of modern power systems. However, conventional numerical solvers are computationally prohibitive, and standard Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) often suffer from training instability in large-scale scenarios. To ad- dress these challenges, we propose an Adaptive Physics-Informed Neural Network (APINN) with a decoupled architecture that separates feature representation from physical constraint enforcement through a soft domain decomposition strategy. This design mitigates gradient conflicts while preserving strict physical consistency. Furthermore, adaptive sampling and dynamic weight scheduling are incorporated to enhance stability and efficiency. In validation across six typical power system scenarios, APINN achieves a 93.8% reduction in mean absolute error (MAE) and converges 36% faster than conventional PINNs. In addition, APINN delivers an inference time of only 42 milliseconds, fully demonstrating its capability for real-time electromagnetic field simulation. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of APINN as a fast and reliable framework for real-time electromagnetic field simulation."

This review provides a comprehensive analysis of recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), for optimizing the operation and management of PV systems within smart grids. The study categorizes and compares AI-based methodologies in energy forecasting, fault detection and diagnosis, intelligent PV system sizing, and optimization of Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) techniques. Through a critical evaluation of recent literature (2020-2025), the review highlights the complementary roles of classical ML models and advanced DL architectures, including Long ShortTerm Memory (LSTM) networks, Transformer models, and hybrid approaches combining physics-based knowledge with datadriven learning. Moreover, heuristic optimization algorithms such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) are discussed for their contribution to enhancing convergence speed and accuracy in MPPT and diagnostic applications. This review not only synthesizes state-of-the-art AI strategies but also identifies key technical gaps related to data availability, computational complexity, and model interpretability. Emerging solutions such as federated learning, edge computing, and Explainable AI (XAI) are discussed as promising pathways toward scalable, trustworthy, and autonomous PV energy systems.

However, prior scheduling algorithms either rely on ideal clock synchronization or resource reservation, sacrificing bandwidth efficiency. In this paper, we present a unified framework for the analysis of stability for queueing process and delay bounds in TAS, in which clock drift, gate-switching jitter, and sync-message loss are modeled as a stochastic service-loss process in TAS scheduling. Then, a Lyapunov-drift analysis is used to derive both deterministic worst-case delay bounds under maximal service loss and probabilistic stability conditions when the average service rate exceeds the arrival rate. Finally, based on the theoretical analysis, the guard-band sizing and slot-provisioning guidelines are proposed for practical TSN deployment under non-ideal synchronization. Extensive simulations have been conducted to validate the tightness of our delay bounds, and the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed configuration rules can guarantee bounded latency and queue stability."

However, their large number of parameters and dependence on large-scale annotated data severely restrict the application of the model in small samples and resource-limited environments. To address this issue, we present a lightweight image classification framework that couples self-supervised teacher pre-training with knowledge distillation to a compact student. The teacher (ResNet-18) is pre-trained with SimCLR and, under the same unlabeled budget, with MoCo v2 and BYOL; the student (LiteNet-DSC) uses depthwise-separable convolutions with batch normalization. Beyond final-logit distillation, we add a lightweight feature-level transfer aligning two intermediate stages, and incorporate consistency regularization with semi-supervised pseudo-labels. On MNIST and CIFAR-10 under a low-label regime (CIFAR-10: 10k labeled / 35k unlabeled), the student reaches up to 93.1% top-1 with ~0.5M parameters and 0.50 ms single-image latency, about 5× faster than the teacher. Ablations show consistent gains from alternative SSL (BYOL ≥ MoCo v2 > SimCLR) and from feature-level transfer. The approach achieves a high-accuracy, low-overhead balance suitable for mobile and embedded deployment."

    "abstract": "In recent years, large-scale power outages in distribution grids caused by natural disasters, human-made accidents, and other factors have occurred frequently, with the damage they inflict on distribution grids growing increasingly severe. Mobile energy storage devices (MESS), however, possess capabilities such as flexible deployment, dynamic regulation, and rapid response, enabling them to play a significant role in restoring power supply to distribution grids. Against this backdrop, this paper establishes a mobile energy storage optimization scheduling model for post-disaster fault recovery based on a power-transportation integrated system, taking into account the response of distribution grids to major disasters. The model uses load reduction as the objective function and implements post-disaster recovery scheduling under the scenario of distributed power source islanding. Finally, the proposed method is applied to improve the N-5 fault under the IEEE 33-node system. The case study demonstrates that the proposed model can obtain the optimal MESS dispatch path, thereby achieving faster and more effective restoration of interrupted loads."

    "abstract": "This paper presents the development of a cost-effective, solar-powered, real-time air quality monitoring and hazard alert system utilizing an Arduino microcontroller integrated with gas and particulate matter sensors. The research addresses the growing need for accessible and sustainable indoor air quality monitoring solutions in residential, commercial, and industrial environments to safeguard human health. The system incorporates MQ-series sensors-MQ-2 for smoke, MQ-3 for alcohol, and MQ-135 for toxic gases including ammonia, nitrogen oxides, benzene, and carbon dioxide-along with the PMS7003 sensor to measure concentrations of PM1.0, PM2.5, and PM10. Sensor data are collected and processed by the Arduino to evaluate pollutant levels. Based on predefined thresholds, the system categorizes air quality into three levels: normal, moderate, and high-risk. In the event of hazardous conditions, an audible alert is triggered via a buzzer, and the pollutant readings are displayed in real time through the serial monitor for data logging and immediate analysis. The entire system is powered by a solar energy setup, enhancing its environmental sustainability and enabling deployment in areas with limited electrical infrastructure. The design is modular and scalable, allowing future integration with wireless communication modules for remote monitoring and control. The results demonstrate that the system reliably detects and differentiates multiple air contaminants, making it a practical and eco-friendly tool for early warning and continuous environmental assessment."

    "abstract": "Power automation operations and maintenance involve complexity and high risk. Existing reinforcement learning methods commonly suffer from insufficient generalization capabilities and limited timeliness in agent decision-making, making them ill-suited for multimodal information environments. Power operation scenarios involve massive amounts of temporal data, textual logs, and monitoring images, placing higher demands on the learning efficiency and decision accuracy of agents. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a multi-modal power operation meta-reinforcement learning method based on a Liquid Neural Network (LNN) reward model. This approach combines the dynamic adaptability of LNNs in temporal modeling with the rapid transfer learning capability of meta-reinforcement learning to achieve efficient optimization in complex operation scenarios. Through multimodal fusion training, the agent rapidly identifies potential failure patterns and delivers precise auxiliary decisions in novel fault scenarios, thereby enhancing the intelligence and automation of power grid operations. Experiments demonstrate that this approach not only effectively reduces human labor but also provides higher-level support for optimizing maintenance strategies and preventing failures in complex environments, showcasing promising application prospects."

Sustained Single-event leakage current (SELC) was observed during irradiation, where the drain-source leakage current $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{ds}}$ increased with both drain bias and LETs. Singleevent burnout (SEB) occurred at a bias of 75 V when the LET reached $75.3 \\mathrm{MeV} /\\left(\\mathrm{mg} / \\mathrm{cm}^{2}\\right)$. Post-irradiation scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis revealed the SEB site to be at the source electrode, showing a complete material void. Experiments with different ion incident angles showed that the SELC rate decreased with increasing angle. Technology computer-aided design (TCAD) simulations were employed to investigate the influence of irradiation angle on the electrical characteristics, and the simulation results are consistent with the experimental data. This results from the oblique ion track angle, which both reduces charge collection efficiency due to misalignment with the dominant electric field and enhances carrier trapping/recombination in the buffer layer."

In addition, a federated learning framework is introduced to identify DDoS attacks in SDN environments, which simultaneously protects privacy while maintaining high detection accuracy. Our proposed solution reduces the risk of data breaches and protects the confidentiality of sensitive data by training models locally. We have used FL to train three classifiers: Deep neural networks (DNN), convolutional neural networks (CNN) and (LSTM) Long Short-term memory to classify two categories of DDoS attacks, namely: UDP Flood, TCP SYN. Achieving 99.99% accuracy and a 99.99% F1-score on TCP SYN floods, alongside 99.94% and 99.97% on UDP floods, our federated CNN not only exceeds the most robust centralized benchmarks but also outperforms our own federated DNN and LSTM models, establishing a new benchmark for SDN DDoS detection while ensuring complete privacy of raw traffic within each domain."

    "abstract": "The integration of transformer architectures in smart grid education offers a promising avenue for predictive maintenance and adaptive content generation. By leveraging advanced deep learning models, educational systems can provide real-time, scenario-based training for grid operators, enhancing understanding of complex energy systems. However, existing approaches often rely on conventional machine learning or standard transformer models that primarily focus on historical sensor data, lacking the ability to incorporate domainspecific knowledge. These methods struggle with contextual understanding of interdependent components and fail to generate explainable educational content. To address these limitations, this study proposes a Knowledge-Enhanced Transformer for Contextual Predictive Maintenance (KE-T-PPM). The framework combines time-series sensor data with a smart grid knowledge graph, capturing both temporal dependencies and component relationships. This hybrid approach enables accurate prediction of equipment failures while producing explainable insights linked to operational knowledge. The KE-T-PPM framework is applied to generate adaptive educational content for smart grid operators, including interactive simulations, case studies, and preventive maintenance guidelines. By contextualizing predictive alerts within real-world scenarios, the system enhances operator comprehension and decision-making skills. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed method improves prediction accuracy, reliability, and clarity of training content compared to traditional models, highlighting its potential for smarter, knowledge-driven educational platforms in power systems."

    "abstract": "The increasing integration of robotics in digital era has created a demand for intuitive programming environments that balance simplicity with computational efficiency. Automation Control Language (ACL), often employed in robotics training platforms, provides students with a structured method for coding robot tasks but suffers from complexity in optimization and error-prone manual interpretation, which hinders learning outcomes. The problem lies in the lack of automated tools that can analyze and refine ACL scripts while ensuring pedagogical clarity and maintaining execution efficiency. To address this gap, the paper propose a Syntax Tree Parsing for Automation Control Language Optimization (STP-ACLO) framework, which employs abstract syntax tree (AST) techniques to systematically parse ACL instructions, identify redundancies, and restructure code for optimized performance. STP-ACLO enhances the readability of student programs, provides automated feedback, and reduces execution overhead by minimizing redundant loops and control flow inefficiencies. Experimental evaluation conducted on robotics digital era simulators demonstrated that STP-ACLO achieved up to 28% reduction in code execution time and improved program comprehension scores among students by 35 %, compared to traditional ACL-based programming approaches. The findings suggest that syntax tree parsing not only improves code efficiency but also strengthens digital eraal outcomes by fostering better conceptual understanding of control structures. In conclusion, the STP-ACLO framework offers a robust and scalable method for optimizing ACL in robotics digital era, bridging the gap between performance and pedagogy while laying the groundwork for future AI-assisted code generation tools in STEM learning environments."

A big challenge of online anomaly detection is how to deal with concept drift, the temporal evolution of intrinsic statistical properties of the data, which induces significant distribution discrepancies between training and testing data. Existing methods failed to adapt to such distribution shifts, leading to low detection accuracy. To address this problem, this paper propose a Global-Local Normalization based Model Pool (GLNMP) framework for accurate online anomaly detection in IIoT. First, a global-local normalization module is designed to simultaneously capture both short-term local anomalies and long-term global pattern changes. Second, we propose an adaptive model pool update module to address both the problem of model adaptation to concept drift and the overfitting problem. Finally, experiments on 10 real-world datasets demonstrate that GLNMP outperforms state-of-the-art approaches."

    "abstract": "As a promising wide-bandgap semiconductor material, silicon carbide (SiC) is widely used in the industry for fabricating planar metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFET). For these devices, carrier concentration and doping range exert a decisive influence on device switching characteristics and breakdown voltage. Traditional carrier characterization methods lack sufficient spatial resolution for analyzing micro-regional carrier distribution in SiC MOSFETs, whereas Scanning Capacitance Microscopy (SCM) offers distinct advantages in such microscale characterization, yet several issues compromise the accuracy of carrier concentration analysis-including surface roughness, stray capacitance, and low signal contrast induced by system parameters. As a predominantly qualitative technique, growing efforts are directed at establishing SCM as a method for quantitative characterization with nanoscale resolution. Herein, we investigate the optimal SCM test conditions for enhancing SCM signals of SiC MOSFET, focusing on optimizing sample preparation processes and debugging key test parameter. The mechanism, by which direct current (DC) voltage affects the SCM phase, is briefly discussed with considering the inversion effect of capacitance. Finally, a semi-quantitative method for analyzing carrier concentration in doped regions of SiC MOSFET is established by comparing the profile of PN junction with Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) techniques. The proposed SCM signal enhancement and analysis methods provide a technical reference for SCM characterization of wide-bandgap semiconductor devices, and fills the gap in nanoscale quantitative characterization of SiC MOSFET. Additionally, this work offers support for failure analysis of SiC MOSFET, rational design of device structures, and improvement of device performance reliability."

S3K provides robust spatial and temporal isolation, time protection, and dynamic resource reconfiguration, enabling flexible adaptation to changing operational requirements while maintaining strong safety and security guarantees. Its capability-based model ensures secure and efficient resource management, while in-kernel data partitioning prevents information leakage and mitigates side-channel attacks. Additionally, S3K's scheduler guarantees deterministic process dispatch, free from microarchitectural interference. Evaluation results demonstrate S3K's effectiveness, showing the absence of scheduling jitter, resistance to intra-core side-channels, and efficient interprocess communication. These results highlight S3K's suitability for safety-critical and security-critical applications in dynamic, resource-constrained environments."

    "abstract": "Statistical Machine Translation (SMT), as part of an overall human-centered machine translation process, provides a significant opportunity for multilingual access to digital content, such as specialized educational content in medical artificial intelligence. As medical knowledge is a continually evolving field of study and is critical for timely and accurate access by global learners and health professionals, providing accurate and accessible learning materials across many languages makes sense. The traditional translation solutions including online machine translation utilize outdated methods of translation that do not account for specific or context-relevant solutions, and domain-specific languages, terminologies, and linguistic affordances or preferences. Rule-based machine and general-purpose machine translation solutions will be limited in reflecting medical terminology and will ultimately adversely affect the translation quality and educational access provided. Therefore, here suggested a new framework called MED-SMT (Medical Educational Domain Statistical Machine Translation) to deal with these problems. MED-SMT is a domain adapted statistical translation model, with an established medical terminology database and a set of contextually grounded alignment processes that will translate medical common language. MED-SMT supports the translation of various medical specific language patterns and provides accurate multi-linguistic rendition of the original medical course content. The MED-SMT framework aims to allow the worldwide access to medical Artificial Intelligence (AI) education through the automatic translation of course materials (e.g. lecture notes, research papers, interactive tutorials) into a variety of languages at a minimal cost in human operator time. This will make it easier for medical students, professionals, and researchers who do not speak English to understand advanced AI content. Experimental results show that MED-SMT provides a notable improvement in translation quality and terminology consistency over the advanced methods achieving better understanding and knowledge transfer of medical concepts in medical AI education."

    "abstract": "Accurate wind power forecasting is essential for maintaining power system stability. This paper proposes a parallel hybrid Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) model to enhance short-term prediction accuracy. Core input features are selected using Grey Relational Analysis combined with Mutual Information Rate (GRA-MIR), which effectively reduces redundancy. The model adopts a dualbranch architecture: a 1D-CNN captures local spatial patterns, while a Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) extracts long-term temporal dependencies. The outputs are fused through a fully connected layer to enable joint spatial-temporal representation learning. An enhanced Sparrow Search Algorithm (SSA) is introduced to optimize hyperparameters based on the validation Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms individual CNN and LSTM models, particularly in winter scenarios, achieving lower error metrics. These results indicate the model's effectiveness in improving forecasting reliability and supporting stable grid operation amid growing wind power integration."

    "abstract": "Convolution is a fundamental operation in digital signal processing and machine learning, and its efficiency strongly depends on the underlying multiplier architecture. This works conducts a detailed evaluation of Braun, Booth and Wallace tree multipliers on FPGA platforms, focusing on their role within convolution operations. The 32×32-bit designs were developed in Verilog HDL and synthesized using Xilinx Vivado, with performance measured in terms of delay, logic resources, and power efficiency. The Booth design exhibited the lowest power consumption (61.418 W) and smallest area (1026 LUTs), but introduced a longer delay (33.969 ns). The Braun structure provided a moderate balance with 21.428 ns delay, 81.587 W power, and 1073 LUTs. In contrast, the Wallace tree was the fastest (21.488 ns), though it consumed the most resources (115.416 W, 1479 LUTs). Within a 3-tap FIR convolution module, the dedicated DSP multiplier proved the most efficient (37.828 W, 15.594 ns, 68 LUTs). Substituting it with a Booth multiplier raised both power (62.979 W) and delay (18.903 ns), while leaving the area nearly unchanged (69 LUTs). Overall, DSP slices remain the most efficient choice for FPGA convolution, though Booth multipliers offer a compact alternative, Braun designs provide modularity, and Wallace trees trade power and area for speed."

    "abstract": "IDK Cascades are a framework used to improve time usage within classification tasks. A cascade is comprised of a series of classification models with increasing levels of complexity. A prediction occurs when a single model's computed confidence is above a certain threshold; otherwise, an IDK classification is made, which leads to the next model in the series considering the input. A recent improvement to this scheme is the idea of skipping a model in the case where the prior model's confidence was extremely low. However, this method has inherent issues when predicting whether to skip. This paper improves on the method of skipping certain models by using a Random Forest model trained on multiple parameters, resulting in smart skipping. Unlike the previous threshold skipping approach, the Random Forest's is able to more accurately predict when a skip should occur, leading to larger time savings. Ultimately, we are able to obtain an IDK Cascade utilizing Random Forest skipping that is more computationally efficient than threshold skipping across three datasets."

    "abstract": "Automated assessment of textual disclosures along the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) pillars demands language models that are at once lightweight and transparent. We deliver the first systematic comparison of two compact transformer families—knowledge-distilled models (Tiny Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers and Distilled BERT) and efficient-attention models (Fourier Network and Longformer)-on three balanced datasets of 2000 documents each, separately targeting the Environmental, Social, and Governance dimensions. All models are fine-tuned on a single 8 gigabyte Graphics Processing Unit and judged on predictive accuracy, inference latency, token-level interpretability obtained with SHapley Additive exPlanations, and concise resource indicators such as per-epoch training time and peak memory consumption. Distilled transformers achieve the best classification performance while offering significant speed-ups and memory savings relative to a BERT-base reference, whereas efficient-attention models become appealing only when inputs exceed four thousand tokens. Attribution analysis reveals that distillation focuses explanatory mass on domain-specific terms such as “diversity” and “emissions”, whereas efficient-attention diffuses importance across generic words. These findings position knowledge distillation as the most practical route for productionready ESG text classification under tight compute and audit constraints, and establish baselines to steer future adaptations of efficient-attention architectures to this domain."

The system features a horizontal-axis micro wind turbine integrated into the vehicle's front to capture kinetic wind energy while moving. Photovoltaic <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(\\text{PV})$</tex> panels on the roof generate power from solar radiation, particularly when the vehicle is idle or parked. Both energy sources are optimized using Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) techniques and regulated by DC-DC converters to supply power directly to the EV battery or auxiliary systems. An energy management control logic dynamically prioritizes input sources based on vehicle speed and solar irradiance. Simulation results from MATLAB/Simulink indicate that this system can supplement battery charge, decrease reliance on external charging, and slightly extend vehicle range, all with minimal impact on aerodynamics and weight.

At present, many scholars have conducted systematic research on leakage flux transformers, including their working principles, the establishment of equivalent circuits and simulation models. However, there are few reports on the systematic simulation modeling of the electromagnetic-thermalfluid fields of leakage flux transformers. This paper first introduces the working principle of the leakage flux transformer, then obtains the core loss and winding loss of the leakage flux transformer through open-circuit and short-circuit experiments, and finally carries out the simulation modeling of the electromagnetic-thermal-fluid fields for the leakage flux transformer, putting forward effective measures to reduce the temperature rise of the leakage flux transformer."

By employing a low thermal conductivity glass substrate in combination with a diaphragm structure, conductive heat loss was effectively suppressed and convective heat transfer was significantly enhanced, resulting in improved sensitivity. Using a multi-physics simulation tool, the effects of key structural parameters—such as diaphragm structure and electrode spacing—on sensor performance were systematically analyzed, leading to an optimized design for maximum sensitivity. Simulation results indicated that within a flow range of 0–5 sccm, the sensor achieved a high normalized sensitivity of 17.52 mV/(m/s)/mW with a low power consumption of only 6.61 mW. This structural design provides technical support for the development and further application of thermal mass flow sensors in high-sensitivity micro-flow detection."

Modalities such as facial expression analysis [1], vocalisation patterns [2], and textual sentiment [3], each offer a unique insight into pain-related behaviour. This research presents a comparative investigation of three modalities - facial expressions, voice, and text - to perform pain detection and classification using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. By identifying the most important landmarks, our proposed CNN-LSTM-Attention-based model achieved an impressive pain intensity classification score of 87.15%. In the audio domain, non-speech vocalisations (e.g., groans, cries) from the ASPVD dataset are converted into mel-spectograms and then fine-tuned using Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) to classify pain-related vocal patterns. This model achieved 80% accuracy in identifying non-speech vocalisation associated with pain. For textual data, pain-related sentiment was analysed using the EmoLit data set. By fine-tuning the RoBERTa transformer model, a sentiment analysis of emotions associated with pain allowed for a more accurate detection with a score of 95%. This comparative analysis highlights the unique strengths of each modality in pain intensity recognition. It also provides valuable information for multimodal fusion systems. The findings of this research aim to contribute to a greater understanding of developing more robust, clinically relevant and accurate pain recognition tools."

However, dynamic current imbalance leads to uneven thermomechanical stress distribution among parallel chips, which may further induce thermal runaway. To address this issue, this paper proposes a 2.5 D hybrid packaging structure that combines a printed circuit board (PCB) and a direct bonded copper (DBC) substrate. By exploiting the mutual inductance cancellation effect between the upper and lower current paths, the proposed structure effectively reduces parasitic inductance imbalance among parallel branches, thereby enhancing dynamic current balance. Simulations show that the proposed structure reduces the parasitic inductance imbalance from $36.4 \\%$ to $5.95 \\%$, while exhibiting excellent thermal performance. Furthermore, a double-pulse test circuit is implemented in LTspice to obtain branch current waveforms consistent with actual operating conditions. The results indicate that the dynamic current imbalance ratio is reduced from $37.26 \\%$ to $3.55 \\%$. Experimental validation confirms that the proposed 2.5 D hybrid packaging structure effectively improves the consistency of dynamic current distribution among parallel branches."

Results demonstrate that AI use is significantly associated with increased study time among junior high students (β = 0.077, SE = 0.020, adjusted p = 0.00028), while no significant effect was observed for senior high students (β = 0.027, SE = 0.025, adjusted p = 0.389). Furthermore, a problematic attitude that \"AI Makes Study Unnecessary\" is significantly related to decreased study time among senior high students (β = -0.101, SE = 0.030, adjusted p = 0.0018), but shows minimal effect among junior high students (β = -0.052, SE = 0.024, adjusted p = 0.041). Smartphone use is negatively associated with study time in senior high students but shows no effect for junior high students.

This paper outlines a comparative study on power and performance efficiency of the Mesh and Spidergon topologies within the NoC framework. It also emphasizes the Spidergon architecture, which is often compared with the more widely used Mesh topology, owing to its circular arrangement of nodes with direct links to nodes that are diametrically opposed. Python has been used as an implementation platform, and various routing algorithms, including well-known XY routing, North-Last routing(NL) and Parameterized Randomized Oblivious Minimal routing(PROM) have been implemented and analyzed for different node configurations. The findings of the study illustrate that the Spidergon topology dominates the efficiency metrics of power consumption and performance when compared to the Mesh topology. Even in the least favorable scenario (XY routing), Spidergon achieved a notable 25.82 % more effecient than Mesh, with the maximum efficiency being 67.91 % over Mesh. This paper puts forward the Spidergon topology as a suitable alternative to other topologies in NoC.A major new feature of this work is using the DSENT(Design Space Exploration for Network Technologies) simulation framework to closely evaluate power and performance. Unlike previous methods that rely on analysis, DSENT allows for precise modeling of both dynamic and static power consumption using real-world factors like buffer size, link traversal, voltage levels, and switching activity. This provides a detailed, hardware-like comparison between Spidergon and Mesh network structures."

In this context, DC collection and transmission system with modular multilevel DC-DC converters (DC-MMCs) have emerged as a promising solution. However, DC faults in such systems propagate rapidly, demanding fast and reliable fault detection. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a single-ended protection scheme based on the transient voltage across the current-limiting reactor. First, the fault equivalent model of the DC-MMC is analyzed. Then, fault characteristics under three scenarios are investigated: internal faults, forward external faults, and reverse external faults. Results reveal that the initial fault voltage across the current-limiting reactor exhibits a large positive value for internal faults, a smaller positive value for forward external faults, and a large negative value for reverse external faults. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed scheme can accurately distinguish internal and external faults within <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{1 ~ m s}$</tex> across various fault types, locations, and resistances."

    "abstract": "Effective waste disposal is a critical challenge for nations worldwide. India alone generates approximately 65 million tons of waste annually, presenting significant difficulties for traditional waste management systems. This study proposes LIXO, an innovative waste management platform that integrates location-based public reporting, machine learning-based waste classification, and optimized collection routing. Through a user-friendly web interface, residents can submit geo-tagged images to report the status of waste bins. These images are processed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify waste types and estimate bin fill levels. While CNNs are powerful for image classification, their performance can be affected by factors such as varying illumination, occlusions, and cluttered backgrounds, as well as challenges in detecting small or detailed features. LIXO addresses these limitations with advanced filtering techniques that prioritize bins requiring urgent collection. Optimized routing algorithms then schedule waste collection efficiently, reducing operational costs and environmental impact. The backend system provides centralized oversight and data management, aligning with smart city objectives for transparent and sustainable waste systems. Pilot studies demonstrate that LIXO improves collection efficiency, fosters community participation, and offers a cost-effective, practical, and low-intervention solution to urban waste management challenges"

    "abstract": "In recent years, non-contact heart rate (HR) estimation methods based on remote photoplethysmogram (rPPG) have attracted much attention. This approach estimates heart rate by detecting subtle changes in skin light absorption caused by blood volume pulsations. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end HR monitoring system based on the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) for remote measurement using low-cost cameras. SAM 2 adaptively tracks the region of interest (ROI) on the face, effectively extracts facial features under varying motion and lighting conditions, and outputs corresponding RGB video streams. The rPPG signal is then derived via the CHROM algorithm, and heart rate is calculated based on inter-beat intervals (IBI). Experimental comparisons with various ROI detection methods and state-of-the-art end-to-end remote HR algorithms demonstrate superior performance. Moreover, a key advantage is that it requires no scenario-specific training, greatly expanding its practical applicability."

Identifying and removing the defective devices prone to SDE before they affect customer workloads is crucial. However, detecting these events is challenging due to their subtle nature and the specific conditions required for them to occur. In this work we investigate the underlying defect mechanisms responsible for SDE and formulate an end-to-end framework for efficient detection, estimation of quality metrics, and use of fault models to capture marginal defects that may cause SDE. Silicon defect characterization, enhancements to manufacturing test and system level test, use of SDE estimation metrics, and use of reinforcement learning are discussed, along with in-field testing for detection of latent defects and wear-out that may manifest as SDE."

    "abstract": "Direct torque control (DTC) has the advantages of rapid dynamic response and strong robustness, but its torque ripple is obvious. In traditional DTC systems, according to the equation of torque variation, the torque variation rate is closely related to the load and speed, resulting in the actual torque deviating from the reference torque in some cases, which degrades torque tracking performance. Moreover, in multiphase permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs), voltage vector (VV) selection in DTC is more complex. To address these challenges, this article proposes an improved DTC strategy for a nine-phase open-end winding (OW) PMSM. The primary contribution is the design of a torque hysteresis regulator that prioritizes virtual VVs that enhance torque, reducing the torque’s steady-state error. Additionally, a fuzzy controller dynamically adjusts the torque hysteresis band based on torque and speed variations, further improving torque tracking and robustness. Experimental results show that compared to optimized DTC, the proposed fuzzy DTC algorithm significantly improves torque tracking performance. Compared to fuzzy MPTC, it retains the advantages of traditional DTC, including fast dynamic response and a simple control structure."

    "abstract": "Sleep stage classification is an effective approach for diagnosing sleep disorders and holds significant importance in sleep research and biomedical studies. In recent years, sleep stage classification models based on machine learning and deep learning have achieved remarkable progress. However, several challenges remain. First, conventional deep learning-based sleep stage classification models struggle to effectively handle noise and artifacts, leading to inaccurate feature extraction. Second, the scarcity of minority class data, such as deep sleep and REM stages, prevents models from learning crucial features of these stages. Additionally, computational resource limitations hinder the deployment of previous models on wearable devices. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Task Reconstruction Transformer (MTRT) for sleep stage classification based on internet of things and wearable devices. MTRT integrates multiple advanced techniques, including masked autoencoders, Transformer networks, Focal Loss, and model pruning, to enhance classification performance and applicability. By introducing a masked autoencoder within a multi-task learning framework, the model effectively removes noise and artifacts from EEG signals, enabling the extraction of high-quality signal representations, thereby improving classification robustness and accuracy. The combination of signal reconstruction and sleep stage classification tasks facilitates feature sharing between the encoder and decoder, enhancing the model’s ability to learn from minority class samples and improving generalization. Moreover, model pruning reduces complexity, minimizing computational and memory requirements, making MTRT more suitable for real-time applications on wearable devices. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed MTRT model."

Game-based programming platforms have been widely adopted to promote learner engagement and skill acquisition. However, without structured guidance, programmers may adopt ineffective strategies, leading to stagnation and wasted effort. This paper investigates the programming skills developed through ELOP, a competitive game-based training platform that has accumulated longitudinal programming data from hundreds of users. A mixed-methods analysis reveals that while ELOP fosters iterative strategy refinement, key skills such as writing well-documented code and refactoring maintainable programs remain difficult for many learners to master. To address these challenges, we present <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">GPST</i> (Game-based Programming Skill Trainer), an extended platform that augments ELOP with instructional features including automated code smell detection, comment quality guidance, and targeted training materials. GPST aims to support learners in developing clean, readable, and maintainable code while preserving the motivational benefits of game-based learning. Preliminary evaluation results from a small-scale pilot study (n=5) demonstrate the feasibility of GPST and suggest positive learning outcomes, while indicating directions for larger future deployments."

    "abstract": "The effectiveness of Transformer-based methods in tabular data processing has been extensively validated. However, most existing models primarily adopt Transformer-based encoder architectures, which overly emphasize feature correlations while neglecting the unique explicit information representation characteristics of tabular data. The significantly higher information density of tabular data compared to textual data introduces noise that degrades performance. Consequently, directly applying language models to tabular data often yields suboptimal results. To address this limitation, we propose the Residual Attention Transformer (RAT), a Transformer-based mechanism specifically designed for tabular data. In subsequent sections, the Residual Attention Transformer will be referred to as RAT. RAT introduces residual connections into the self-attention mechanism, effectively preserving raw information while capturing dependencies with higher-order features, thus enhancing the richness of information representation. Additionally, we design a simplified Transformer output head, termed Light-Transformer, which consists of a lightweight Transformer block specifically dedicated to the output stage. This design not only significantly reduces the model's parameter count, but also greatly improves training and inference efficiency. Extensive experiments were conducted on six public datasets to evaluate our model. The results show that the RAT model consistently outperforms other models in various tasks, confirming its effectiveness and superiority."

    "abstract": "Exoskeletons may enhance mobility, but users require extensive training to receive their full benefit. While augmented feedback can accelerate motor learning, it remains difficult to apply for exoskeleton gait assistance given that desired changes depend on complex multi-joint coordination and user actions are coupled to device control dynamics. We developed a visual biofeedback system to guide novice users of an ankle exoskeleton to modify their ankle joint kinematics and foot placement toward patterns associated with improved energy economy. Biofeedback-based training doubled the energy savings from exoskeleton use. Individuals who trained with biofeedback (N = 13) achieved a 23.5% ± 12.6% (p = 2e-5) reduction in metabolic cost of walking with assistance, compared to a 11.8% ± 20.9% (p = 0.06) reduction for a control group (N = 13). Biofeedback enabled new exoskeleton users to achieve benefits comparable to fully adapted users in one-quarter of the time. Participants had not fully adapted after the hour-long training session with biofeedback, underscoring the task’s difficulty and suggesting that greater benefit from exoskeletons might be unlocked with continued use of this approach. Energy savings were associated with increased exploration and progression toward lower-cost gait parameters in task-relevant dimensions. Our findings demonstrate that biofeedback can accelerate motor adaptation to exoskeletons, potentially enhancing their effectiveness and promoting broader device adoption."

    "abstract": "In this letter, a linearly polarized (LP) fed all-metal dual circularly polarized (CP) planar reflectarray antenna (RA) with independent control of beams is proposed. Since a linearly polarized wave can be decomposed into a right hand circularly polarized (RHCP) wave and a left hand circularly polarized (LHCP) wave, the designed all-metal element can simultaneously adjust its dynamic phase and geometric phase to compensate the phases of RHCP and LHCP waves independently, so as to separate them in the intended directions respectively. For proof of concept, an X-band reflectarray prototype in a circular aperture with a diameter of 380 mm and illuminated by a LP horn is designed, manufactured, and tested. Testing results indicate that with the LHCP wave pointing at -15°, the 3-dB gain bandwidth and 3-dB axial ratio (AR) bandwidth are 17% (9-10.7 GHz) and 27% (8.7-11.4 GHz), respectively; with the RHCP wave pointing at 15°, the 3-dB gain bandwidth and 3-dB AR bandwidth are 17% (9-10.7 GHz) and 29% (8.7-11.6 GHz), respectively. In addition, a total maximum aperture efficiency of 52.7% is also realized. Compared with other similar dual-CP RAs that employ CP feeds and dielectric substrates, the proposed design adopts a simple and less expensive LP feed and also an all-metal configuration, therefore demonstrating its advantageous features such as low-cost and stable behavior."

    "abstract": "Safety-critical embedded systems deployed in modern industries require architectures that are capable of guaranteeing both functional correctness and strict temporal reliability under unpredictable workloads. These systems must also sustain availability and fault tolerance despite the presence of transient and permanent failures that arise in real-world operating conditions. In particular, embedded platforms in automotive electronic control units, unmanned aerial vehicles, and medical devices depend on maintaining deterministic timing constraints and resilient communication even under stress. This paper introduces a hybrid framework that integrates Earliest Deadline First scheduling enhanced with Priority Inheritance (EDF-PI) together with Time Division Multiple Access overlays applied to Controller Area Network (TDMA-CAN). The integration addresses two of the most critical weaknesses in conventional architectures: uncontrolled priority inversion at the task scheduling level and nondeterministic arbitration delays at the communication level. The design was implemented on STM32 microcontrollers running FreeRTOS and validated with both hardware experiments and large-scale simulations under aggressive fault injection. The experimental evaluation demonstrated that the proposed EDFPI scheduler reduced deadline misses by up to 42% compared to plain EDF, while the TDMA layer reduced latency variance by 73% compared with arbitration-based CAN. Availability remained above 98.6% across extended fault scenarios. The results demonstrate the feasibility of unifying dynamic task scheduling, priority inversion protection, deterministic communication, and fault recovery into a single coherent framework for distributed embedded systems."

This paper explores how cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies can fundamentally transform the MCDM process. Building on a novel “divide-and-inject” framework, the study systematically decomposes decision problems into modular subproblems and injects tailored AI solutions at each step. This approach enables dynamic formation of criteria, objective weighting, automated alternative generation, and intelligent method selection, while ensuring transparency and scalability through step-local explainability and governance. Case studies from diverse domains such as healthcare, public policy, and education demonstrate the framework's adaptability and practical impact. The findings highlight AI not only as an auxiliary tool, but as an integral, orchestrated agent for building robust, adaptable, and interpretable MCDM systems. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research, including hybrid symbolicdeep learning models, cross-domain validation, and real-time feedback integration to foster a new generation of intelligent, explainable decision support systems."

This research explores the application of the intelligent Proportional (iP) controller, a model-free control (MFC) strategy that eliminates the need for a detailed system model. The iP controller is implemented on a flexible, real-time position control task using a DC servo motor through MATLAB/Simulink with hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) integration. Comparative analysis against a conventional <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{P}$</tex> controller highlights the advantages of the iP controller in terms of steady-state accuracy, noise rejection, and ease of tuning. Results affirm that the iP controller performs competitively, even in dynamic and uncertain conditions, and suggests potential for broader application in power systems and robotics."

    "abstract": "Construction site monitoring in rapidly urbanizing regions is hindered by the limitations of traditional ground-based inspections, which are often slow, labor-intensive, and lack coverage in hazardous areas. While UAV-integrated systems offer improved aerial perspectives, many existing solutions fall short in real-time volumetric estimation and rely on lightweight CNNs that sacrifice accuracy. To address this, we propose a UAV-based, multisensor hole detection and measurement system powered by a custom deep convolutional neural network called HoleDimNet. Unlike lightweight models, HoleDimNet is optimized for high-precision volumetric regression. Experimental evaluation involved handcrafted test holes measured at three UAV altitudes across four terrain types. HoleDimNet delivered more accurate area and volume predictions than its lightweight counterpart, achieving lower Mean Absolute Error and showing resilience to variable geometry and elevation at lower heights. This approach offers a modular and scalable solution for real-world construction environments. The HoleDimNet model, thus presents a tool for enhancing excavation planning, safety compliance and autonomous site auditing."

RIS enhances the signal quality by adaptively managing wireless propagation without active transmission, whereas NOMA boosts spectrum utilization by concurrently serving multiple users on shared resources. Hybrid RIS-NOMA systems demonstrate superior performance compared to standalone configurations, particularly in terms of energy efficiency, fairness, and throughput. However, traditional clustering methods and static RIS deployments are inadequate in dynamic and densely populated settings because of their scalability and adaptability limitations. Moreover, reliance on simulations, excessive computational overhead, and overfitting in machine learning-based designs restrict their practical implementation. This study examines recent advancements in RIS-NOMA, focusing on clustering-driven allocation (CDA) and coordinated optimization algorithms (COA), and evaluates their strengths over baseline methods such as K-means. It also highlights the ongoing challenges, including hardware prototyping, complexity-aware algorithm design, and scalability, offering actionable insights to guide the development of adaptive, efficient, and user-oriented RIS-NOMA frameworks for future 6G applications."

StarNet is incorporated, and improvements are made to the backbone network of the YOLO11 algorithm to reduce the model's parameters and enhance its real-time detection capability; The XSmall detection head is added to the head of the YOLO11 algorithm and the designed C3k2_SCConv module is introduced in the neck to improve the model's detection ability for hotspot defects of small targets. The PVHSD2Net model is verified on the PV-HSD-2025 dataset. The experimental results indicate that, in comparison to the original YOLO11n model, the new model achieves increases of 5.98% in precision, 4.15% in recall, and 5.59% in mAP50, while reducing the number of parameters by 24.14%."

While deep learning has advanced this field, most existing methods face three constraints: reliance on single-sensor data, single-domain analysis, and isolated model architectures. These limitations hinder the effective use of complementary information in complex vibration signals. To address these issues, this paper proposes a multi-view signal fusion network (MVSFN) for rotating machinery Fault Diagnosis that simultaneously fuses multi-view data and time-frequency domain information. The model integrates raw time-domain signals from multiple sensors with frequency-domain representations via FFT, forming a multi-view, multi-domain input. It employs a hybrid architecture combining a 1D CNN for local features, a Transformer for global dependencies, and an LSTM for temporal dynamics. Broad Learning mechanisms are incorporated to create lateral connections across stages, enabling both progressive \"local-global-temporal\" learning and cross-level feature propagation. Experiments on our datasets confirm that the method outperforms existing approaches, demonstrating strong potential for industrial applications."

Traditional PID controllers often exhibit limited adaptability under complex driving conditions involving diverse road surfaces and driving styles, while single fuzzy PID control methods face challenges in balancing precision and robustness. To address these limitations, this paper designs a deep learning adaptive dual fuzzy logic controller that integrates fuzzy PID, adaptive cruise control (ACC), and neural networks. The performance of the proposed method is compared against traditional PID controllers and single fuzzy PID controllers.This study employs a two-degree-of-freedom vehicle dynamics model and presents visual comparisons of actual trajectories against target trajectories under four control strategies: conventional PID, conservative fuzzy PID, radical fuzzy PID, and the combined fuzzy PID approach at the core of the dual-fuzzy strategy. Additionally, trajectory deviation trends are analyzed under two critical scenarios: first, varying speeds (80/30 km/h, corresponding to high-speed/low-speed driving) on homogeneous surfaces; second, different road surface friction coefficients (0.5/0.9, corresponding to wet/dry surfaces) at constant speed. Results demonstrate that the combined fuzzy PID strategy achieves significantly lower tracking deviation than other methods under all test conditions. This study confirms the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in enhancing tracking performance in complex scenarios, providing a valuable framework for optimizing autonomous vehicle control systems."

In this paper, we investigate the problem of randomizing a game. We start by formalizing this problem as a labeling problem in directed graphs. Unfortunately, we show that a general randomizer (i.e., one that can possibly generate any finishable game) involves solving NP-hard problems as a subroutine. Motivated by this limitation, we define of a restricted family of randomizers that produce finishable games by construction. We present two polynomial time randomizers in this family. The first one is simple. The second one improves it with custom probability parameters that make the generated game more natural. Finally, some properties of these algorithms are analyzed theoretically."

    "abstract": "Energy-efficient model design is becoming a critical approach in modern AI development, aimed at optimizing computational resources while minimizing environmental impact. As deep learning models grow increasingly large and complex, their energy consumption-especially during training and inference can become significant, leading to higher operational costs and increased carbon emissions. This concern has led researchers to start prioritizing techniques that reduce power demand while preserving model accuracy. However, this shift is not yet universal. Many AI development pipelines still prioritize performance metrics such as accuracy and throughput, often overlooking energy efficiency during early design stages. To truly align with Green AI principles, energy efficiency must be embedded from the outset, guiding model selection, training strategies, and deployment decisions alike. This paper explores the essential stages involved in designing energy-efficient AI models, highlighting the strategies and methodologies that contribute to optimizing computational efficiency and reducing environmental impact while maintaining model performance. It focuses on two key perspectives: model architectural optimization, which includes pruning, quantization, and model compression techniques, and efficient training strategies, which transfer insights from larger models to smaller ones and optimize training efficiency to minimize AI's environmental footprint. This paper builds towards building the AI research community awareness in this domain, resulting in developing environment-friendly AI models."

However, the hole mobility decreases with the increase of Mg doping concentration. As a result, a medium Mg doping concentration ($1 \\times 10^{19} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$) yields the optimal balance, achieving the lowest sheet resistance ($32 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega / \\square$) at 300 K, with a hole mobility of $12 \\mathrm{~cm}^{2} / \\mathrm{V} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}$ and a 2DHG density of $1.1 \\times 10^{13} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-2}$.

    "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder affecting millions worldwide, requiring continuous monitoring to prevent severe complications such as hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. Traditional glucose monitoring techniques, like finger-prick testing, are often invasive, discontinuous, and inconvenient for patients, especially in remote or resourcelimited areas. This study focuses on addressing these limitations by developing a real-time, cloud-integrated remote glucose monitoring system. The proposed solution involves an ESP32 microcontroller that simulates blood glucose values and transmits them to the cloud platform. A mobile application, developed using ReactJS, retrieves this data and classifies glucose levels as hypo-glycemia, normoglycemia, or hyperglycemia. Firebase integration ensures secure authentication, data storage, and real-time access, while additional healthcare features-such as doctor appointment booking and medical report downloads-enhance usability. Two machine learning models, trained for pre- and post- meal scenarios, enable precise classification of glucose states. The models achieved classification accuracies of 91.3% (pre- meal) and 89.7% (postmeal), with end-to-end latency under 2 seconds. This system enhances diabetes management by enabling secure, real-time monitoring and has potential for clinical sensor integration and predictive analytics in future applications."

    "abstract": "Owing to its high operating temperature, high switching frequency and superior blocking voltage, silicon carbide (SiC) metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) has attracted considerable research attention. However, SiC planar MOSFET has several drawbacks, including low channel mobility and large cell size. The other popular device architecture is SiC trench MOSFET (TMOS), which is regarded as an effective solution to lower specific on-resistance ($R_{\\text {on, sp }}$) due to higher channel mobility and the elimination of the JFET effect. In this paper, we have fabricated the $1200 \\mathrm{~V} / 10 \\mathrm{~m} \\Omega$ SiC TMOS with deep P-well region (DP-TMOS). Numerical simulations have been completed to study the proposed device. The maximum electric field in gate oxide of the DP-TMOS is suppressed to below $3 \\mathrm{MV} / \\mathrm{cm}$, while the $R_{\\text {on, sp }}$ of the DP-TMOS is tremendously decreased compared with that of conventional SiC planar MOSFET. The fabricated DP-TMOS demonstrates outstanding characteristics, including a breakdown voltage of 1450 V, a threshold voltage of 3.7 V and a specific onresistance of $1.87 \\mathrm{~m} \\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, which are comparable to those of state-of-the-art commercial trench SiC MOSFET devices. The fabricated DP-TMOS also demonstrates excellent avalanche reliability, which make the proposed device a competitive candidate for commercial production."

    "abstract": "Complex networks analysis requires a full comprehension of the interconnection between the nodes and how these interconnections give rise to community structures. This is done by finding clusters of nodes that are well connected within the cluster but relatively poorly connected with the rest of the network. Out of the many methods conceived to make this task easier, edge weighting has become an indispensable tool, allowing one to quantify the strength of connection in terms of the importance or level of interaction between the nodes. In this work, we propose a new mechanism of edge weighting based on representation learning using autoencoders. The model is trained using the network's adjacency matrix to learn latent structural aspects of the nodes in the network, which are then used as a basis of calculating pairwise similarities using an amplified Gaussian similarity function. As a methodology, this allows us to capture some of the more subtle structural patterns that cannot be identified through traditional local heuristics. Due to the experimental results, we show that our method can give the same performance in a community detection task to popular similarity-based weighting strategies such as Jaccard, cosine similarity, and the Adamic-Adar index, thus proving that learned representations may find success in these kinds of collaborations."

    "abstract": "As a physical factor therapeutic modality, the effect of a light therapy strongly depends on the dose, i.e. the light fluence $\\left(\\mathrm{J} / \\mathrm{cm}^{2}\\right)$, delivered to the target tissue. Especially, it is well known that there exists a biphasic dose response in light therapies, where neither too low nor too high doses can lead to effective and safe treatment. Moreover, in the existing research literatures, the reported effective doses may vary in a large range even in treating a same type of disease. This, on the one hand, may be attributed to the lack of precise control and measurement methods of the therapeutic light sources. On the other hand, despite the large number of studies on light therapies and the underlying photobiomodulation (PBM) mechanisms, the research on modeling the dose response in light therapies is still very rare, because of the tremendous challenge in identifying and quantifying the related chromophores and signaling pathways. In comparison, in the other physical factor therapies, e.g., photodynamic therapy, heavy ion therapy and proton therapy, mathematical dosimetric modeling has already become a much richer research literature. This mini review paper aims at surveying the recent research reports about the doses and dose-response models in light therapies, and thereby attempts to draw more attention to these important issues."

    "abstract": "In this study, we performed parameter extraction for the small-signal model (SSM) of Gallium Nitride High Electron Mobility Transistors (GaN HEMTs) using a semi-analytical approach. During the iterative process of this method, peripheral parasitic parameters are treated as optimization variables for parameter optimization, followed by direct calculation of internal intrinsic parameters based on microwave circuit network theory. Meanwhile, an error function is constructed to compute the discrepancy between measured and simulated results. This algorithm not only preserves the physical rationality of the theoretical model but also ensures the fitting accuracy of actual measurement data. Ultimately, within the frequency range of 1 GHz to 67 GHz, the simulated S-parameter results of the obtained small-signal model are nearly completely consistent with the measured results. Based on this small-signal model, we further designed, fabricated, and finally tested a G-band pre-matched device, whose pre-matching structure is designed based on Coplanar Waveguide (CPW) transmission lines. The device underlying this small-signal model exhibits excellent direct current (DC) and radio frequency (RF) performance, with an on-resistance of less than $0.9 \\Omega / \\mathrm{mm}$, a maximum current cutoff frequency $\\mathrm{f}_{\\mathrm{T}}$ of 191 GHz, and a maximum oscillation frequency $\\mathrm{f}_{\\text {max }}$ of 331 gigahertz (GHz). Benefiting from the outstanding DC and RF performance of the device, the pre-matched device achieves a peak gain of 2.6 dB in the G-band. Furthermore, the measured results in the frequency range of 140 GHz to 190 GHz are highly consistent with the simulated results, validating the reliability of the proposed modeling method. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first time that a GaN HEMT matching structure capable of achieving G-band amplified gain has been realized on sapphire substrates."

    "abstract": "The growing demand of electric vehicles (EVs) necessitates sophisticated charging systems that emphasize efficiency, reliability, and adaptability. Modern EV chargers typically has a two-stage power conversion architecture, consisting of an AC-DC rectification stage followed by a DCDC conversion. These systems often utilize buck, boost or buck-boost converter configurations. While conventional boost converters remain common, their effectiveness in highpower EV charging scenarios is affected by excessive current ripples and declining efficiency. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an interleaved boost converter (IBC) topology integrated with a Super-Twisting Sliding Mode Control (ST-SMC), designed to minimize current ripple and hence improve performance in EV charging applications. The IBC's multi-phase current distribution mechanism substantially reduces input current oscillations, reduces inductor losses and enhances power capacity. The MATLAB simulation results shows a peak efficiency of 89% and decrease in current ripple as compared to conventional converter designs. Additionally, the IBC's modular architecture enables scalable power output for demanding applications and compatibility with renewable energy integration. These advantages position the converter as a robust solution for high-speed charging networks, delivering benefits such as lower electromagnetic interference, enhanced component longevity, and improved grid stability."

Accurate evaluation of instructors ensures better learning outcomes and a more effective return on investment in training.

To address these limitations, this study proposes a Rough Set-Based Decision Rule Extraction (RSBDRE) framework for evaluating instructor effectiveness. The framework identifies the most influential attributes, eliminates redundancies, and generates interpretable IF-THEN rules for decision-making. This approach is applied to industry training scenarios, enabling managers to classify instructor effectiveness with higher accuracy and transparency. Findings indicate that communication clarity, engagement, and post-training performance are strong predictors of effectiveness, offering actionable insights for instructor development and training quality improvement."

However, its traditional high-temperature and high-pressure bonding process introduces residual stress and limits device performance. To address this problem, plasma activated bonding (PAB), a low-temperature technology, enables highstrength bonding through surface activation and lowtemperature annealing, thereby representing a key breakthrough in the manufacturing of SiC-based MEMS sensors. In this paper, an optimized process combining plasma activation, SC1 cleaning, hot pressing bonding, and annealing in a protective atmosphere is proposed. The effects of O<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf> and N<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf> plasmas on the surface morphology, chemical state, and wettability of $4 \\mathrm{H}-\\mathrm{SiC}$ were systematically evaluated for activation times ranging from 30 to 210 s. The results indicate that under optimized parameters, both plasmas induce no significant changes in surface roughness, thus achieving lowdamage activation. Through the synergistic treatment of ‘plasma activation + SC1 cleaning’, the surface contact angle was reduced to less than 2°, thereby achieving a superhydrophilic state. XPS analysis revealed that O<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf> plasma efficiently introduces oxygen-containing functional groups through directional oxidation, whereas N<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf> plasma also triggers concomitant oxidation under certain conditions. SC1 treatment forms a dense hydrophilic layer through surface reconstruction, thereby significantly improving wettability. Finally, high-area-ratio bonding was achieved under $350^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ to $450^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ annealing conditions. This not only verified the feasibility and effectiveness of the PAB process for lowtemperature, high-strength bonding of $4 \\mathrm{H}-\\mathrm{SiC}$ but also provided both process and theoretical support for its application in the manufacturing of high-performance SiC devices."

Recent advances in network resource partitioning techniques provide practical mechanisms for managing these applications hierarchically while maintaining operational isolation. However, as system complexity increases, applications often exhibit multi-state behaviors that challenge the system's ability to meet stringent timing requirements - especially under static resource partitions. While dynamic resource reconfiguration can restore feasibility, it is typically costly and disruptive in industrial environments. To address this challenge, we propose a flexibility-aware network resource partitioning framework that introduces a novel metric - partition flexibility - to quantify how effectively a resource partition supports an application's state transitions. Using this metric, we develop efficient strategies for both static partition allocation and dynamic partition adjustment, with the goal of minimizing reconfiguration overhead. We validate our framework design through a real-world case study involving a NASA extra-terrestrial habitat system deployed on a time-sensitive networking (TSN) testbed. Extensive simulations further demonstrate that the proposed partitioning framework reduces <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{5 6. 4 \\%}$</tex> reconfigurations compared to the state-of-the-art methods."

First, the Euler-angle attitude dynamics model of the drone, incorporating gyroscopic effects, is established. Next, a prescribed performance function is designed to ensure that the tracking error remains constrained within predefined transient and steady-state boundaries, effectively avoiding overshoot and insufficient steady-state accuracy. Furthermore, by designing a time-varying performance function to constrain the dynamic response of the tracking error, a nonlinear error transformation is introduced to convert the original constrained system into an unconstrained one. Combining backstepping sliding mode control with an adaptive law, the method addresses parameter uncertainties, achieves online compensation for rotational inertia uncertainty, and ensures finite-time convergence of the system states. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can rapidly converge to the target attitude while guaranteeing both transient and steady-state performance."

A Light-Weight Self-Refinement Attention (LSRA) mechanism is introduced to refine and fuse the extracted features, selecting the most relevant indicators for depression classification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior performance, with an accuracy of 99.11 %, a balanced F1score of 98.49 %, precision of 97.89 %, and sensitivity of 98.20 %. Furthermore, the model demonstrates rapid training efficiency, completing training within 10.28 seconds, and maintains low false positive (1.00 %) and false negative (0.92 %) rates. Extensive validation confirms the robustness and effectiveness of MindSync, highlighting its potential as a reliable tool for objective mental health evaluation."

    "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles equipped with onboard units(OBUs) have ushered in a new era for the traffic management systems. With their aerial view and high mobility capabilities, UAVs have fast-forwarded advancements in the field. UAVs have become central to contemporary digital innovation, making every related field intrigued to look into them. With our increasing reliance on UAVs, it is equally important not to overlook the security concerns associated. UAVs communicate over wireless channels, making them vulnerable to cyberattacks. The resource-constrained nature of the UAVs limits the use of complex cryptographic standards. In this paper, we have presented a lightweight elliptic curve-based batch authentication protocol with a trust management mechanism. The trust-evaluated authentication aims to lower the number of invalid rendered authentication failure batches. The security of the protocol is proved using the widely accepted AVISPA tool. Informal security analysis using conventional cryptanalysis highlights the resilience of the protocol against various known attacks, such as modification attack, impersonation attack, man-in-the-middle attack, and replay attack. The protocol surpasses the computation and communication cost of various state-of-the-art protocols."

For efficient patient care and better quality of life, an early and precise diagnosis is essential. Complex, multimodal biological and behavioral data gathered from neuroimaging, blood biomarkers, cognitive tests, speech, handwriting, and motor function may now be analyzed with greater ease because to developments in computing techniques, especially machine learning and deep learning. Promising outcomes have been shown in the classification of disease stages, prediction of progression, and differentiation among related disorders using methods like convolutional neural networks, random forests, support vector machines, and ensemble classifiers. Personalized diagnosis across a range of patient populations is supported and model interpretability is improved through the integration of demographic, clinical, and multisource biological data. However, there are still issues with managing data variability, addressing disease heterogeneity, guaranteeing model generalizability, and promoting clinical translation. This review highlights methodological advancements, existing limitations, and future research directions towards scalable, dependable, and clinically impactful diagnostic systems. It also summarizes the most recent AI-driven approaches for the early detection and classification of geriatric neurodegenerative diseases."

    "abstract": "Relying on the powerful communication capabilities and rapidly changing geometric configurations, Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites have become strong candidates for offering the integrated communication and navigation (ICAN) services in future sixth generation (6G) networks. Considering the distinct performance and resource requirements, how to strike a balance between communication and navigation is one of the key design issues in LEO-ICAN systems. Against this backdrop, we take the transmission rate and geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) as evaluation metrics of communication and navigation performance, respectively, and formulate a weighted rate and GDOP maximization problem by jointly optimizing the beamforming design and satellite selection. To deal with the optimization problem, we split the original problem into the beamforming design and satellite selection subproblems, and propose a two-layer resource allocation algorithm to solve these subproblems iteratively until convergence. Specifically, in the inner layer, the beamforming design is modeled as a difference-of-convex (DC) problem, and the DC programming method is applied to maximize the communication rate. In the outer layer, the satellite selection is modeled as an overlapping coalition formation (OCF) game, and the OCF-based satellite selection algorithm is proposed to simultaneously reconcile the navigation GDOP. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms and reveal the trade-off between communication and navigation performance."

The proposed sensors and circuits detect normal and abnormal respiratory activity. These structures are based on a force-sensitive resistor sensor and a piezoelectric disk, offering a low-cost solution. The first design relies on changes in the resistance of a pressure sensor, while the second operates based on voltage variations generated by a piezoelectric disk. Since the forces of abdominal and chest breathing are relatively low, the sensors are designed to be highly sensitive to these variations. Additionally, we developed two circuits with LED displays to show inhalation and exhalation power, and one with an LCD to measure and display the respiratory rate. Breathing intensity can be visually identified by turning the LEDs on and off. The materials used and the performance of these sensors make the device a cost-effective, portable, user-friendly, and reliable alternative to current wearable smart health devices. The sensors have been tested, and the results are satisfactory. We successfully monitored various breathing patterns, including normal breathing, deep breathing, rapid breathing, weak breathing, and apnea, which are applicable for breath monitoring and data recording. Based on the results, the proposed structures demonstrate acceptable performance in respiration monitoring systems."

    "abstract": "Quantum feature selection offers a powerful route to extracting informative features from high-dimensional data by exploiting quantum parallelism and superposition. However, most existing methods focus on single-view data and fail to address the challenges of multi-view scenarios, where heterogeneous views must be integrated while maintaining the fidelity of each view. In such scenarios, achieving both inter-view complementarity and intra-view consistency is difficult due to complex dependencies and latent structures within each view. To address this problem, we propose Quantum Multi-View Feature Selection (QMVFS), a unified framework that combines configurable quantum kernel circuits with adaptive multi-kernel fusion. For each view, configurable quantum kernel circuits with distinct architectures and parameterizations embed data into a Hilbert space, producing diverse kernel representations. An integrated optimization objective jointly learns view weights, fuses multiple kernels, and enforces sparsity, enabling QMVFS to capture inter-view synergy while preserving intra-view structures. Experiments on six public multi-view datasets show that QMVFS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 4.44% in classification accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness and adaptability for quantum-enhanced multi-view learning.

Most existing methods only consider a single temporal pattern and insufficiently model the normal pattern, causing the model to learn incorrect temporal patterns from anomalous or noisy data. This poses a significant challenge for accurate anomaly detection. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a new dynamic decomposition and reconstruction anomaly detection algorithm, DMRAD. DMRAD captures various regular patterns of multivariate time series by designing a dynamic decomposition module that learns trend and seasonal features. By integrating improved channel and temporal attention mechanisms, DMRAD effectively learns the correlations within the sequence and dependencies across different sequences, thereby enhancing the model's capacity to distinguish between features and extract relevant information. DMRAD incorporates a latent anomaly-noise detection algorithm to identify and suppress the influence of noise and latent anomalies, elevating the overall accuracy of anomaly detection. Extensive experimental comparisons demonstrate that DMRAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on a variety of datasets for real-world application scenarios."

In response, this study proposes a selection hyper-heuristic framework for time-dependent green logistics, incorporating key factors such as economic costs, carbon emissions, rider types, real-time traffic conditions, and time-window constraints. To address the complexities introduced by these real-world factors, we design a two-layer distribution model with crowdsourced delivery that covers the flow from city distribution centers to regional hubs and ultimately to end customers. The first layer involves location selection and the delivery process, while the second layer focuses on order allocation and last-mile delivery. For the location selection and order allocation problems, exact optimization models are developed to obtain high-quality solutions. In the delivery process, we integrate Deep Reinforcement Learning to replace the traditional adaptive layer of the Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search algorithm, enabling dynamic and intelligent adjustments during the search. Comparative analyses against existing and traditional methods across various benchmark instances demonstrate the superior efficiency and solution quality of the proposed framework. Simulation experiments based on a real-world road network in China validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. In addition, the well-trained model can be directly applied to various scenarios, highlighting its strong generalization capability."

This strategy adopts a double-loop control structure. In the outer voltage loop, a moving average filter (MAF) is added to the PI controller. The MAF could completely suppress harmonic interference induced by DC bus voltage fluctuations, and then enables the generation of a clean reference current. In the inner current loop, a weighted average inductive current (WAIC) controller was developed, which significantly simplifies the control design. Moreover, a frequency adaptive repetition controller (FARC) is added to eliminate the harmonic distortion of grid current caused by grid voltage distortion in the presence of grid frequency variation. Experimental results of a 1kVA single-phase PWM rectifier with LCL filter demonstrate that, compared with conventional control schemes, the proposed control strategy could enable PWM rectifiers to produce ultra-low-harmonic grid current with the total harmonic distortion (THD) below 1% while maintaining fast and robust voltage and current responses in the presence of significant system disturbances."

    "abstract": "Detecting frailty early and objectively is crucial for preventing falls and maintaining independence in older adults, yet traditional assessments remain subjective and resource intensive. We developed a portable, real time frailty assessment system using a consumer grade depth camera (RealSense D435) with Nuitrack for skeletal tracking. From 3D gait data, temporal and kinematic features were extracted and evaluated using five classical machine learning models and an Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. To address limitations of prior work such as reliance on single model classifiers, wearable sensor constraints, and depth camera studies limited to Parkinson’s or fall-risk tasks we introduce a hierarchical multi-model fusion framework that integrates LSTM derived temporal representations with lower limb skeletal features. This architecture enhances robustness to noise, improves generalization on small clinical datasets, and enables real time non-wearable frailty assessment using only a monocular depth sensor. In a clinical study involving 120 gait samples across three sites, CatBoost and ensemble models achieved 97% accuracy. With multi-model fusion, performance improved to an F1-score of 0.98 and reached 100% accuracy across four frailty levels. This clinically validated framework provides a fast, objective, and scalable solution for geriatric frailty assessment in hospitals, homes, and tele-health settings."

In-orbit telemetry data on Single Event Functional Interrupts (SEFIs) and on Single Event Upsets (SEUs) corrections performed by on-board error correction codes are retrieved and employed for the radiation analysis. The simulations are derived from ground-based irradiation test data, information on the space radiation environment, and detailed three-dimensional CAD representations of the satellite architecture and on-board electronic components. The analysis focuses on radiation-sensitive SDRAM devices integrated within the mass memory units, which serve as effective in-orbit radiation monitors. The in-orbit SEFI rate data are compared with simulated rates performed using industry-standard tools based on space environmental models. The availability of precise geometrical information from the satellite down to the component level supports a correlation analysis between SEU rate and the shielding thickness provided by the satellite structure. Finally, the correlation between solar activity and in-orbit SEFI rate trend is analyzed over the short-, medium- and long-term periods and across different phases of the solar cycle."

    "abstract": "At present, the motors of propulsion systems in the aviation field are developing towards higher speed and lighter weight. However, the significant increase in electromagnetic loss under high-frequency operating conditions and thermal management issues have severely restricted the progress in this field. To this end, this paper proposes a system loss analysis and global magneto-thermal collaborative optimization method for quantifying the air-gap flux density. This method, based on the surface current method, constructs a two-dimensional magnetic field analytical model of an arbitrary shape permanent magnet array and establishes a magnetic circuit model considering the nonlinearity of the core. By quantifying the contribution mechanism of the air-gap flux density to the core loss and the eddy current loss of permanent magnets, the main parameters such as the permanent magnet array were extracted to optimize the electromagnetic loss. Then, an electromagnetic-thermal coupling node model was developed to investigate the temperature rise at the hot spot of the motor, and the temperature field optimization was carried out for the situation where the temperature rise at the hot spot was too high. Finally, an experimental platform was built, and load temperature rise tests were conducted on 60kW, 60,000 rpm high-speed permanent magnet synchronous motors under different cooling conditions. Theoretical analysis and experimental results provide important guiding suggestions for the global optimization of high-speed motors."

    "abstract": "Blending green hydrogen into natural gas presents a promising approach for renewable energy integration and fuel decarbonization. Accurate estimation of hydrogen concentration in hydrogen-enriched natural gas (HENG) pipeline networks is crucial for operational safety and efficiency, yet it remains challenging due to complex dynamics. While existing data-driven approaches adopt end-to-end architectures for HENG flow state estimation, their limited adaptability to varying operational conditions hinders practical applications. To this end, this study proposes a real-time estimator for HENG hydrogen concentration in the pipeline network under variable operations. The estimator is realized by a customized graph-enhanced DeepONet structure, where a dual-network architecture integrates operational information and target spatiotemporal location, and outputs the estimated hydrogen concentration. Moreover, cross-attention layers and graph attention layers are adopted, aiming to handle the missing boundary hydrogen concentrations and achieve high-performance aggregation about pipeline operational features. Case studies demonstrate that the customized structure achieves superior estimation accuracy for HENG concentration under varying operational conditions."

    "abstract": "We present a selective-retrieval framework for battery life prediction that, when only a few initial cycles of a new cell are available, trains on a small subset of historically similar cells rather than the full database. Similarity is scored primarily by Pearson correlation (cosine as a fair baseline under identical backbones). On a randomized-policy 18650 set (54 cells) and an external 5 Ah pouch-cell set (12 cells), Pearson-based selection matches or improves accuracy while sharply reducing the amount of training data. On the 54-cell set, Pearson improves both RMSE and MAE over training with all data in 46/54 (85.2%) for MLP, 52/54 (96.3%) for RNN, 53/54 (98.1%) for GRU, and 53/54 (98.1%) for Transformer; on the 12-cell validation set, the corresponding fractions are 12/12 (100%), 9/12 (75.0%), 7/12 (58.3%), and 11/12 (91.7%). In the rare instances where Pearson is worse than “All,” the increases are small—about 10⁻² Ah in RMSE and 10⁻³ Ah in MAE. Using Top-k retrieval also reduces the training set size by ∼94% (k=3), ∼91% (k=5), or ∼87% (k=7) relative to using all 53 source cells, yielding commensurate training-time savings. Overall, the method offers a practical, data-efficient update path that preserves (and often enhances) accuracy at substantially lower computational cost."

    "abstract": "Blockchain technology introduces a new paradigm for multiparty distributed data storage by offering built-in consensus mechanisms and data immutability. Concurrently, telecom infrastructure has evolved from 2G, 3G, and 4G to 5G, introducing new complexities in roaming use cases. In response, the GSMA developed the Billing and Charging Evolution (BCE) standard to support the dynamic nature of future wholesale roaming settlements. BCE provides a flexible, simplified settlement model through standardized formats such as Usage Data Reports (UDRs) and Billing Statement Reports (BSRs), enhancing revenue assurance and enabling support for diverse charging models, including access-based billing. This is particularly important for Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios where traditional TAP (Transferred Account Procedure) designed primarily for voice and SMS is no longer sufficient. Unlike TAP, BCE supports dynamic, real-time roaming across 5G use cases, including IoT, satellite networks, AI-driven services, and autonomous systems. Its ability to streamline inter-operator billing, settlement, and invoicing processes is essential for managing the scale and complexity of 5G environments. This paper presents a production-ready architectural framework that integrates BCE with permissioned blockchain, AI-based anomaly detection, and predictive analytics. The proposed framework is secure, extensible, and optimized to support a wide range of next-generation roaming settlement use cases."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the creation, execution, and evaluation of mental health chatbots powered by generative AI (GenAI) which provide users with tailored coping mechanisms. The progress in GenAI has allowed for high levels of personalization to be integrated through advanced content delivery systems, psychological profiling, and mood tracking. Primary research shows slight to moderate improvement in depression and anxiety symptoms. Nonetheless, this research tends to be overly simplistic in reporting sample sizes, description of participants, and research methods, and so comparability across different populations is limited. In combining various forms of technologies, instruments, such as PHQ-9, GAD-7, and mood self-report diaries, have been meticulously integrated. No authoritative comparative studies have been conducted that quantify or directly measure the scalability, user engagement, safety, or clinical efficacy of GenAI powered chatbots in relation to traditional interventions; the data available is primarily qualitative or bare minimum. This paper also looks to the challenges of privacy ethics and clinical oversight troubling data security, consent, bias, and transparency. Clinical oversight with reporting outcomes has been done in an inconsistent manner, indicating a significant absence of data and the necessity for systematic assessment frameworks alongside clear below assess grayaz add reporting. There is a consensus that GenAI chatbots have made strides in widening the scope of mental health attention. There’s a critical need to uphold privacy regulations, ethical standards, and meticulous clinical supervision to safe-guard the expansion of these scalable, cost-effective solutions."

    "abstract": "Urban noise pollution is a growing environmental concern, particularly in sensitive areas such as hospitals, schools and residential neighbourhoods. Extended exposure to background noise can lead to stress, sleep problems, cognitive issues, and heart-related conditions. To address this issue, a smart, real-time Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) system, known as the Urban Noise Canceller, has been developed using MATLAB for simulation, signal control, and performance evaluation. The system focuses on low-frequency urban noise between 50 Hz and 800 Hz by generating anti-phase sound waves that cancel out incoming noise. Unlike traditional passive noise control methods that depend on heavy acoustic insulation, this approach is lightweight, flexible, and energy-efficient. It uses the Filtered-x Least Mean Squares (FxLMS) algorithm, which is an adaptive filtering method that adjusts to changing noise patterns in real time. Microphones capture ambient noise, and MATLAB processes this data to create inverse waveforms that effectively reduce noise. Simulation results show good noise reduction in controlled settings. It is scalable and adaptable. The system is well suited for smart buildings, transport hubs and IoT based monitoring. This innovation supports Sustainable Development Goal 11 by promoting healthier and quieter urban spaces."

In this work we propose a state mandate demanding the presence of a defibrillator at every pharmacy store and argue that it could greatly enhance and augment the impact of the defibrillator network. We support our claim via detailed calculations of the immediate (a defibrillator readily available) and partial (a defibrillator available at a reasonable distance) population coverage achievable by the implementation of our proposal, taking the Argolis area in Peloponnese Greece as a case study. Our findings indicate that, in addition to other benefits, the use of pharmacies to establish a defibrillator network could bring an eight-fold increase in the immediate population coverage of defibrillators and would provide immediate/partial access to a defibrillator to 18/24 incidents of SCA per year that would otherwise lead to death, potentially leading to the saving of numerous lives.

    "abstract": "Multilinear transformations are fundamental in high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI), but their computational and memory demands grow rapidly with dimensionality. Conventional scaling-adding more processing units-quickly drives up energy costs, especially for sparse data that dominate modern workloads. This paper introduces TriADA (Trilinear Algorithm and isomorphic Device Architecture), a co-designed algorithm and architecture that addresses these challenges. TriADA combines a massively parallel low-rank algorithm for trilinear discrete orthogonal transforms (3D-DXTs), a novel outer-product-based GEMM kernel with decoupled streaming memory, and a fully distributed 3D cross-wire network of compute cells that operate in a data-driven, coordinate-free manner. In addition, it incorporates the Elastic Sparse Outer-Product (ESOP) method, which dynamically eliminates redundant computation and communication with zero operands, improving both energy efficiency and numerical accuracy. By executing diverse trilinear tensor transforms with hypercubical complexity in only a linear number of steps, TriADA achieves simplicity, scalability, and high data reuse. Moreover, it supports both dense transforms, corresponding to lossless compression, and sparse transforms, which implement lossy compression by pruning high-frequency basis functions-enabling flexible trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency."

This gives us the privilege to directly map pieces of contiguous physical memory and instantiate allocators, allowing us to finely control cores to create and eliminate interference. Additionally, we can minimize noise and interruptions, guaranteeing more consistent and precise results compared to equivalent user-space solutions.

Missing packet timing guarantees due to high latency render a real-time application unschedulable. Deflection routing is a mechanism that addresses contention when multiple packets try to access the same links simultaneously. Despite its benefits, packets may be deflected more than what their timing guarantees allow in the worst-case scenario. To achieve an upper bound of deflections in conjunction with mapping, we proposed two methods: first, a method that increases the deflections of all communication flows, and second, a method that increases the deflections based on selective communication flows. Our findings, based on running both methods in an evolutionary optimisation, show that the latter outperformed the former, with a statistically significant improvement in the maximum deflection."

This paper evaluates international approaches to defining minimum inertia requirements and procuring inertia services, drawing on experience from Great Britain and Australia. These insights are contextualised within South Africa's regulatory and market framework. Regulatory gaps related to the procurement of inertia in South Africa's Grid and Market Codes are identified, and amendments are proposed to support technology-neutral approaches through a combination of long-term contracts and spot market mechanisms. The analysis highlights the need for regulatory reform, and for further research to ensure secure and cost-effective inertia provision in a future low-inertia power system."

    "abstract": "With the accelerating global energy transition, the rapid integration of photovoltaic (PV) systems into distribution systems has introduced significant operational challenges. Traditional direct control methods have proven inadequate for managing the flexible regulation requirements of large-scale PV penetration. The operating envelope (OE), as an indirect control approach, defines the feasible power operation region for secure operation at each node, providing an effective method for distribution systems with high renewable energy penetration. By preserving the autonomous regulation capability of distributed generation while ensuring grid security, OEs have emerged as a critical research focus in modern power systems. Unlike the traditional Kornai-Liptak (KL) decomposition method that allocates the right-side coefficients based on contribution degrees, this paper proposes an improved KL decomposition method based on proportional equitable conditions. Firstly, the linear DistFlow model and the photovoltaic (PV) unit model are established, and all constraints were integrated into a compact convex polyhedron form. Subsequently, the KL decomposition decomposes the coupling constraints into specific allocations for multiple subsystems and introduces the equitable condition to reconstruct the OE of each PV. This method not only retains the computational efficiency advantage of KL decomposition, but also ensures that the OE of each PV are strictly matched with their proportional factors. The simulation results show that the proposed method achieves the equitable OE for PV units while ensuring the security operation of the power grid."

    "abstract": "Addressing the cumbersome and time-consuming process of measuring iron content in rare earth ferroalloy products, this study proposes a binocular vision-based method for quantifying cathode iron rod consumption. Leveraging the characteristic that all iron in the alloy originates from cathode iron rods during production, the method indirectly calculates the iron content in the alloy by measuring rod consumption. The method first calibrates a stereo camera system. After image preprocessing, it employs an SGBM-enhanced algorithm based on adaptive GrabCut for stereo matching to generate a disparity map. Three-dimensional point cloud reconstruction and volume calculation then determine the consumption volume. Experimental results demonstrate that the average relative error of consumption volume obtained through this measurement method is less than 5.5%, providing a reference for rapid measurement of rare earth electrolytic cathode iron rod consumption."

Despite our model’s simplicity, when paired with carefully chosen data augmentation techniques such as horizontal flipping and adaptive gamma brightness correction, the model outperforms larger architectures while achieving significantly lower inference latency.

    "abstract": "Wire sawing serves as an essential initial step in the manufacturing of silicon carbide ingots into wafers. Compared with traditional slurry-based sawing, diamond wire sawing enables superior cutting efficiency and operational speed, but introduces significant surface and subsurface damage that degrades the mechanical integrity and performance of wafers in subsequent semiconductor fabrication processes. In this study, a comprehensive optimization of processing parameters based on wire diamond sawing was bulit to mitigate cutting-induced surface damage. The experimental procedure utilized a wire diamond saw for precision cutting of silicon carbide ingots under rigorously controlled conditions. The descent speed of the worktable was dynamically modulated through a multi-stage profile, starting with an initial gradual deceleration followed by progressive acceleration, with the descent speed controlled within the range of $220-530 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{min}$. A diamond wire with a nominal diameter of $162 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ was operated under precisely maintained parameters: a wire speed of $2600-2800 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{min}$, a tension force of $25-28 \\mathrm{~N}$, and an oscillatory motion of $\\pm 3-5$ degrees at a speed of $5.5-6.0 \\mathrm{deg} / \\mathrm{s}$. Post-cutting evaluation of surface characteristics was conducted using white-light interferometry to quantitatively assess topological features and roughness parameters. Experimental results demonstrated consistent trends in both horizontal and vertical surface roughness evolution during the cutting process. Scratch depth analysis revealed progressive variation patterns corresponding to different cutting stages. Furthermore, substantial differences in surface quality were observed between crystalline orientations, as the carbon-terminated (C) face exhibited significantly higher surface roughness and deeper scratches than the silicon-terminated (Si) face, attributing to the fundamental difference in interfacial fracture toughness between these planes. Through systematic parameter optimization, the modified cutting process achieved a notable reduction in surface damage. These findings provide valuable insights for predicting material removal requirements in subsequent thinning operations and offer practical strategies for enhancing material utilization efficiency while improving overall wafer production yield. The optimized processing parameters demonstrate significant potential for implementation in industrial-scale semiconductor manufacturing environments."

In the cell structure, high-energy ion implantation was employed to optimize the current spreading layer (CSL), alleviating P-type straggling effect in the low-doped drift region and thereby enlarging the JFET width, reducing its depth, and enhancing device conduction performance.

Harnessing this data to model consumer behavior enables informed decision-making in marketing, inventory management, and customer engagement. This paper proposes an integrated methodology that combines association rule mining, k-means clustering, and Random Forest classification to extract and exploit insights from retail transactions. Association rules revealed frequent co-purchasing patterns with lift values consistently above 1.2, underscoring non-random associations of staple products. Clustering identified three distinct consumer groups—high-value, medium-level, and low-frequency shoppers—demonstrating the heterogeneity of purchasing behaviors. Random Forest achieved the strongest predictive performance, with segment-level models improving F1-scores up to 0.74 compared to a global baseline of 0.66. Experiments on publicly available supermarket datasets confirm that integrating segmentation and prediction enhances both accuracy and interpretability. By combining descriptive, unsupervised, and supervised learning, the methodology provides actionable insights and reliable forecasts, offering a comprehensive decision-support tool for modern retail environments."

Leveraging FreeRTOS multitasking capabilities, the architecture assigns Core 1 to sensor acquisition and actuator control, while Core 2 handles cloud communication and data synchronization. Ultrasonic sensors are used to detect bin fill levels, DHT11/DHT22 sensors monitor environmental conditions, and RFID modules enable unique bin identification. The system utilizes FreeRTOS features such as queues, semaphores, and mutexes to ensure efficient inter-task communication and synchronization. Sensor data is transmitted securely via WiFi to a remote cloud server, allowing for real-time alerts, bin status visualization, and dynamic collection scheduling. An optional LCD/OLED module provides localized feedback. The proposed system is energy-efficient, modular, and scalable, making it well-suited for integration into smart city frameworks. By minimizing manual waste inspection and enabling data-driven route planning, the system contributes to cleaner cities and more sustainable waste management practices."

Accurate and timely spatiotemporal predictions (STP) over these streaming sensor data are critical and, in growing demand, ubiquitous across various edge scenarios such as traffic flow forecasting. Towards that, recent advanced systems have developed sophisticated optimizations among STP pipelines, aiming at optimal prediction performance. However, based on our empirical studies in real-world settings, we identify a previously overlooked bottleneck of end-to-end STP performance: data staleness. To mitigate this issue, in this work, we investigate a new task, namely stream interception, which deliberately terminates the acceptance of incoming sensor data and anticipates model execution with imputed missing features. We propose a novel dynamic interception strategy to determine the time slot to exit waiting and present Grape, an STP system that implements it with practical system designs. Extensive evaluations on real-world traces show that Grape can strike a superior tradeoff between prediction accuracy and serving latency, achieving 1.69-1.90× speedup against traditional all-waiting baselines across various STP services with high prediction accuracy on par with offline optimal cases."

    "abstract": "Modern machine learning frameworks inadvertently keep facing issues related to data privacy, adversarial data poisoning attacks, and lack of dynamism. The solution often demands the removal of a set of data points from a trained model. Machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific data points on the outcome of a pre-trained model. Retraining a model from scratch after removing influential training points is an effective approach to achieve the desirable results, but it is often computationally inefficient and impractical.Mislabel unlearning is a sub-domain of machine unlearning that focuses on removing the influence of a specific data point on the outcome of a trained model without retraining from scratch while maintaining efficient computational expenses and retaining accuracy. This paper proposes a mathematically robust and adaptable mislabel unlearning framework that enables the removal of influence of a specific set of training points from a pre-trained model, making the model behave as if it has never seen the training point. By tracking how individual data points impact the model and simulating label inaccuracies during unlearning, our approach ensures stable performance with markedly lower computational demands.Our approach involves assigning a random label to a selected training point accompanied by mathematical calculations estimating its influence on the model’s output. The effect of the influence function is coupled with the corrupted labeling, effectively pushing the model boundaries away from the influence of the original point. The framework was evaluated against a baseline model retrained from scratch, and our results show a twofold reduction in computational time while preserving key performance metrics."

The results of cycle-accurate simulations show that the relative speed of the Person Detection is accelerated to 240% of the execution without the custom instruction. On the other hand, the performance of the Micro Speech is degraded by 13%. Analysis of this performance degradation needs further investigation but one possibility is the pipeline flushes caused by array boundary check and the overhead of additional instructions for packing the operands into registers for the custom instruction.

    "abstract": "This study investigates the impact of various EV charging strategies, including single-phase and three-phase, home, workplace, and fast-charging stations on a typical 22 kV/0.4 kV radial distribution feeder using a detailed MATLAB/Simulink model. The system comprises a 250 kVA Dyn11 transformer, a 1 km RL feeder, and five load buses with diverse load profiles. EV chargers are modeled as controlled current sources with stochastic time-varying profiles. The simulation runs over a 24-hour period with 1-second resolution, incorporating harmonic analysis and voltage monitoring. Key performance metrics such as voltage deviation, total harmonic distortion (THD), voltage unbalance factor (VUF), transformer loading and losses, power factor (PF), and reactive power (Q) flow are evaluated. The results reveal that high EV penetration, especially with fast-charging stations, leads to increased voltage fluctuations, harmonic distortion, and transformer stress. These findings underscore the need for grid modernization, including harmonic mitigation and smart charging strategies, to ensure stable and reliable power system operation under increasing EV demand."

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD) remain the leading cause of death worldwide, posing a significant challenge to global health systems. Early identification ofi ndividuals a tr isk is crucial for effective prevention and management, especially as sedentary lifestyles and metabolic disorders become increasingly prevalent. In this context, there is a growing need for accessible, reliable, and interpretable tools that can empower individuals and clinicians to assess cardiovascular risk proactively. The objective of this paper is to develop HeartWise Score, a web-based system that leverages machine learning to provide personalized cardiovascular risk predictions using routinely available health and lifestyle information. The methodology for this paper centers on the comparative analysis and deployment of multiple machine learning models-including Artificial N eural Network (ANN), Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression-using a large-scale CVD dataset sourced from Kaggle, comprising <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{7 0, 0 0 0}$</tex> records. After extensive evaluation, Logistic Regression was selected as the final predictive model due to its superior accuracy and interpretability. The dataset was carefully preprocessed, with clinical and engineered features such as BMI, pulse pressure, and mean arterial pressure calculated to enhance predictive performance. The frontend of the application was developed using React and TypeScript, styled with Tailwind CSS to ensure a modern and responsive user experience. The backend was implemented with Flask, which serves predictions from the trained and serialized Logistic Regression model. Key health metrics are computed client-side, and user data is securely transmitted to the backend for real-time cardiovascular risk assessment. The results are presented in an interpretable format, clearly highlighting individual risk factors and providing actionable insights. This work demonstrates the effective integration of machine learning and web technologies to deliver a practical, accessible, and privacy-conscious tool for preventive cardiovascular healthcare."

    "abstract": "Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) offers unconditional security for symmetric key exchange by leveraging fundamental quantum principles such as the no-cloning theorem and measurement disturbance. In recent years, continuous-variable QKD (CV-QKD) protocols have gained prominence because of their compatibility with standard optical components, higher key rates over short distances, lower cost, and potential for photonic integration. However, their performance deteriorates over long distances due to increased sensitivity to channel loss and noise. To mitigate this, non-binary Low-Density Parity Check (NB-LDPC) codes have emerged as an effective error correction strategy during the reconciliation phase. The Extended Min-Sum (EMS) algorithm is a well-suited decoding technique for NB-LDPC codes over Galois Fields (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\text{GF}(q)$</tex>). However, its high computational complexity poses significant challenges for real-time deployment. Forward/backward EMS (FB-EMS), a scheduling-optimized variant of EMS, substantially reduces complexity and improves the feasibility of hardware implementation. This paper presents a flexible High-level Synthesis (HLS)-based implementation of FBEMS, accompanied by a comprehensive design space exploration on the Zynq Ultrascale+ RFSoC <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$4 \\times 2$</tex> platform. The proposed architecture, FP-FBEMS, achieves a balance between on-chip resource usage and throughput, providing more than 2.48 Mbps over GF(64) with high scalability. Furthermore, our design achieves up to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{4 2. 0 3} \\boldsymbol{\\times}$</tex> higher throughput than a software implementation on the Ryzen Threadripper 3960X.

Conventional silicon (Si)-based semiconductors are reaching their theoretical limits and hence open the door for exploring wide band gap (WBG) and ultrawide band gap (UWBG) materials. This article provides an extensive review of the recent advancements in WBG semiconductor devices and their application to EV power converters. We assess the material properties, fabrication issues, and device performance of wellestablished WBG materials such as silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) and emerging UWBG materials such as diamond and gallium oxide (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\text{Ga}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{3}$</tex>). Special focus is given to performance parameters important to EV systems, including on-state resistance, switching losses, thermal management, and operation at harsh conditions, e.g., cryogenic temperatures. Based on a comparative evaluation, we explore the applicability of each material to various EV power converter topologies, such as traction inverters, on-board chargers (OBCs), and DC-DC converters. The paper concludes by combining the technology readiness levels, establishing the current research gaps, and forecasting future trends in WBG device deployment to facilitate the development of electric mobility."

Three-phase induction motors (IMs) are widely used in EVs for their robustness and cost-effectiveness, but their nonlinear characteristics make control challenging under varying loads. This paper presents the implementation of Field Oriented Control (FOC) for an induction motor drive tailored to EV propulsion. FOC enables decoupled control of torque and flux by transforming three-phase stator currents into a rotating reference frame using Clarke and Park transformations. The system uses cascaded PI controllers for speed and current control, and Space Vector PWM (SVPWM) for inverter switching, optimizing DC bus utilization and minimizing harmonics. MATLAB/Simulink simulations show improved torque accuracy, dynamic performance, and energy efficiency. The results confirm that FOC is a suitable control strategy for meeting the demanding requirements of modern EV applications."

    "abstract": "Renewable energy advocates worldwide emphasize the importance of environmental protection and the simultaneous advancement of social and economic benefits. Access to renewable energy sources, particularly in rural and underdeveloped regions, may increase incomes, employment, and prevent energy poverty. Legislators and stakeholders worry about accessibility and benefit inequality. Understanding geographical trends and socioeconomic grouping is essential for informed planning and targeted action. This paper seeks to identify regions where renewable energy sources have a significant social and economic impact by focusing on clusters and patterns that standard methods of inquiry may overlook. Current assessment approaches struggle to capture regional diversity and multiple socioeconomic characteristics, making policy recommendations difficult. A novel solution to these issues is to divide the globe by the social and economic benefits of renewable energy. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a novel methodology using Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to classify geographic regions based on the intensity of socioeconomic benefits derived from renewable energy access. DBSCAN identifies high-impact clusters without requiring a fixed number of clusters, making it suitable for diverse datasets. It examined multivariate socioeconomic parameters, including income, employment, education, and energy affordability, across regions. Renewable energy improves socioeconomic conditions in evident geographical groupings, whether you're seeking success stories or ignored locations. Policy implications include prioritizing investments and aid in low-impact zones for equitable development. An effective socioeconomic impact assessment technique, DBSCAN clustering facilitates datadriven decision-making and strategic planning for renewable energy development."

To address this issue, this paper presents a highinertia energy storage-based synchronous condenser (HIESC) integrating a high-inertia flywheel and a doubly-fed electric machine, equipped with a dedicated control strategy to support the grid voltage and frequency during faults. First, the mathematical modeling of the HIESC is established, and control strategies for the grid-side and machine-side converters are proposed. Second, based on a simplified circuit model during voltage dips, the impact of active and reactive power on grid voltage and frequency during faults is analyzed, along with the optimal active and reactive power ratio. Then, a simultaneous active and reactive power distribution method is introduced. Compared to traditional control strategies that only provide reactive power, the proposed strategy shows significant advantages in optimizing frequency and enhancing voltage stability. Finally, the effectiveness of the control strategy is verified through simulations."

    "abstract": "As a core technology in surface treatment of aviation parts, chemical oxidation is widely applied in enhancing corrosion resistance, strengthening coating adhesion and improving surface performance. Accurate parameter prediction of chemical oxidation is crucial for improving process stability and surface performance. However, due to experimental constraints, detection costs, and operating complexity, its experimental data often faces small sample and uneven distribution issues, namely insufficient samples under key conditions and deviated overall distribution, which prevents traditional models from learning inter-variable correlations and thus limits prediction accuracy. To address these problems, this study proposes a data augmentation and parameter prediction method based on conditional table generative adversarial networks (CTABGAN) and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) for chemical oxidation process. Firstly, considering the hybrid imbalance continuous and classified parameters in chemical oxidation small sample data, CTABGAN is utilized for data augmentation for generating high fidelity synthetic samples based on the statistical characteristics and variable dependencies, while maintaining the correlation between key variables to alleviate data imbalance. Then, considering the complex time-varying and coupling characteristics of multiple parameters in chemical oxidation process, parameter prediction model is built by GBDT integrating the original and enhanced data to achieve precise parameter prediction of chemical oxidation. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method were validated on a practical chemical oxidation process of aviation parts."

    "abstract": "Web3 technologies are fundamentally secured by classical cryptographic algorithms like the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), and Secure Hash Algorithms (SHA). The advent of fault-tolerant quantum computers, however, poses a significant threat to these systems. Shor’s algorithm can break the asymmetric schemes that underpin user wallets and asset ownership, while Grover’s algorithm quadratically weakens the security of symmetric ciphers and hash functions. This paper presents an integrated simulation framework, built using Python and Qiskit, to demonstrate these quantum threats in a unified context. We implement simulated attacks against simplified, small-scale instances of RSA, ECDSA, AES, and SHA to model the structural feasibility of these quantum attacks. For Shor’s algorithm, we utilize a classical simulation of the quantum oracles for modular exponentiation and elliptic curve point addition, focusing on the viability of the overall quantum-classical workflow. For Grover’s algorithm, we use standard Qiskit circuit library implementations with simplified oracles. Our findings confirm the theoretical vulnerabilities—successfully factoring RSA-15, solving the ECDLP on a toy curve, and finding keys/preimages in 8-bit search spaces. More importantly, this work highlights the practical simulation challenges and immense resource requirements for breaking production-scale keys, reinforcing the critical need for the Web3 ecosystem to transition towards post-quantum cryptography."

The proposed system employs customdesigned smart adapters to extend HEMS functionality beyond aggregated household control, enabling precise appliance-level energy intelligence, proactive maintenance, and seamless smart grid interaction. Data from these adapters is wirelessly transmitted to the smart meter, where a Python-based optimization algorithm analyzes load patterns and generates an optimized load curve to facilitate DSM strategies such as load shifting, peak clipping, and valley filling. These strategies are aligned with Time-of-Use (ToU) pricing, promoting costeffective energy consumption while improving grid stability. Beyond energy optimization, the system incorporates automated billing with tariff calculation and a lockout mechanism to enforce payment compliance. The major contribution in this work is the incorporation of smart adapters capable of monitoring individual appliances in real time, controlling their operation, and diagnosing inefficiencies or faults. By integrating load optimization, financial accountability, and predictive maintenance, this solution offers a comprehensive, sustainable approach to modern smart home energy management, delivering benefits such as reduced energy costs, enhanced grid reliability, and lower carbon footprints."

To address these challenges, we propose BiCrossNet, a two-branch convolutional neural network model that extracts landmark-guided features and image features through independent branches, and then fuses these two features to realize head pose estimation. We observe that naively concatenating and adding these features cannot fully utilize their complementarity, significantly reducing the accuracy of pose estimation. Therefore, we introduce the BiCrossGate module, employing a bidirectional cross-attention mechanism to model feature interactions and a dynamic gating mechanism to adaptively fuse features. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms most existing approaches and achieves competitive, state-of-the-art performance on AFLW2000 and BIWI."

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral image classification is a crucial research area in hyperspectral remote sensing, aiming to identify the land cover type of each pixel in remote sensing images using computer analysis. This task faces two major challenges: (1) patch-based models typically operate at a fixed scale, limiting their ability to capture cross-scale interactions and often blurring the contribution of the central pixel due to interference from neighboring pixels; and (2) labeled samples in hyperspectral datasets are extremely limited, making supervised training prone to overfitting. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Scale Interactive Attention Network (MSIA) that explicitly divides each patch into three concentric regions—Center, Near, and Relevant—to overcome the single-scale limitation. The Center Region is processed through multiple Transformer Encoders to enhance target-pixel perception, while the Near and Relevant Regions interact via a Central Attention Block, enabling effective local–global feature exchange. To mitigate the challenge of label scarcity, we further introduce a self-supervised contrastive pretraining strategy, which leverages abundant unlabeled samples and fine-tunes the network with only a small set of labeled data. Experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art classification performance under limited supervision."

    "abstract": "In hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD), anomalous pixels typically exhibit a sparsely distributed spatial pattern. Existing deep models often generate backgrounds by reconstructing spectral vectors, yet fail to capture the inherent spatial characteristics of the image. To overcome the semantic and structural information loss caused by neglecting spatial features, we propose the granularity-inconsistent transformer (GIFormer) for unsupervised HAD. Specifically, the interaction between the spatial and spectral dimensions is leveraged to enhance the spatial-spectral feature representation of hyperspectral images, highlighting the differences between background and anomaly features. The GIFormer performs multilevel background reconstruction to detect anomalies. In the encoder, patch-level anomaly elimination masks are applied to reconstruct background features, where spatial correlations of anomalies are utilized to suppress anomalous patterns spanning multiple pixels. The decoder operates at the pixel level, using fine-grained receptive fields for global attention modeling, which enables the model to refine local details that may have been aggregated by the encoder in larger patches, ensuring the final reconstruction retains the intricate structure of the original hyperspectral data. Furthermore, adaptive weight loss is incorporated to guide network training. Extensive experimental results confirm the superior performance of GIFormer."

    "abstract": "People often stick to their existing beliefs, ignoring contradicting evidence or only interacting with those who reinforce their views. This tendency, referred to as being rigid in one's beliefs, is often driven by one's emotional connection to their beliefs and worsened by social media platforms which promote highly personalized content to maximize user engagement. As increased belief rigidity can negatively impact decisions, it is crucial to study and design interventions to reduce belief rigidity in online social networks. We design an experimental framework to passively infer belief rigidity and empirically quantify the effects of introducing randomness into the network structure as an intervention strategy. We recruit 163 participants into two conditions: one emulating traditional online platforms and the other more random. Our results suggest that individuals' beliefs are influenced by peer opinions, regardless of whether those opinions are similar to or differ from their own. Moreover, people are more likely to incorporate peers with (slightly) differing opinions into their networks when the recommendations are more randomized. Our findings highlight the need for future exploration into how design interventions can shape people's psycho-social functionalities in online social platforms."

    "abstract": "Predicting effluent indicators is crucial for enabling a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) to actively adjust treatment processes. However, research on long-term sequence forecasting under sudden water-quality fluctuations remains scarce. In this study, we propose a novel framework called multi-scale graph convolutional seasonal decomposition LSTM (MGCSD-LSTM) to enhance effluent prediction. It integrates temporal decomposition and multiple attention mechanisms with LSTM to capture both spatiotemporal dependencies and dynamic variations in water-quality data. Experiments on real WWTP datasets show that MGCSD-LSTM achieves high predictive accuracy across key effluent indicators, with <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R</i><sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> values of 0.9221, 0.8419, and 0.9151 for PRA, TN, and TP, respectively. The model consistently outperforms the four baseline models used for comparison. For example, when compared with conventional LSTM and Transformer architectures, the average <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R</i><sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> improves by approximately 20.1% and 7.0%, highlighting the superior modeling capability of the proposed approach. Moreover, the model exhibits notably narrower 95% confidence intervals across repeated runs, demonstrating enhanced prediction stability under different initialization conditions. Overall, MGCSD-LSTM provides accurate, robust, and computationally efficient effluent forecasting even in dynamic and disturbance-prone environments."

    "abstract": "Surface defect detection is essential for industrial product quality assurance. To address challenges including large-scale variations, diverse defect morphologies, high inter-class similarity, and strong background interference in steel surface defects, an improved ELG-YOLO model based on YOLOv11n is proposed. The design integrates Gated Bottleneck Convolution (GBC) to enhance the C3K2 module, constructing the C3K2_GBC structure that reduces parameters while improving the extraction of steel defect detail features. Local-global feature representation is synergistically strengthened through the incorporated LRSA-EVCBlock attention module, boosting the discrimination of defects with high inter-class similarity. A Quadruple Adaptive Spatial Fusion Head (QASFFHead) is adopted to resolve insufficient small-object detection performance, suppress feature redundancy, and mitigate conflicts arising from multi-scale feature fusion. Additionally, the Focaler-IoU is selected as the bounding box regression loss function to optimize localization accuracy by focusing on samples of varying difficulty. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ELG-YOLO surpasses both baseline and state-of-the-art YOLO models. It achieves a 6.91% higher mAP@0.6 than the baseline, with improvements of 4.72% for crazings, 10.29% for inclusions, 26.76% for rolled-in scales, and 8.40% for scratches. These results validate ELG-YOLO’s accuracy and robustness, providing an efficient and reliable solution for steel surface defect detection in real industrial scenarios."

However, the tiny size of defects, complex textures, and irregular geometries present major challenges to existing vision-based approaches.

The proposed Multi-Scale Feature Merging (MSFM) module enables comprehensive fusion of structural information across multiple scales, enriching fine-grained feature representation and detail extraction. In parallel, the MDA-Attention module integrates channel-wise and spatial attention mechanisms with dilated convolutions [2], significantly improving semantic discrimination and spatial sensitivity while maintaining low computational complexity.

However, AMR datasets often suffer from missing values, which can significantly compromise the performance and reliability of statistical analyses and machine learning models. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of various machine learning-based imputation techniques to handle missing data in AMR datasets. Specifically, we address two types of missing data, missing completely at random and missing not at random, and evaluate their impact in both binary datasets, where entries indicate the presence or absence of resistance genes, and continuous datasets, where values represent the relative abundance of antimicrobial resistance genes. For binary datasets, we assess the robustness of each imputation method using standard classification metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. For continuous datasets, we assess imputation performance using regression metrics, including normalized mean absolute error and normalized mean root squared error. Our results demonstrate that advanced imputation techniques substantially improve data completeness and model performance across both data types. These findings highlight the importance of tailored imputation strategies in enhancing the quality and reliability of AMR surveillance and predictive systems."

To overcome this bottleneck, a novel data-driven hybrid quantum-transformer network (HQTN) is proposed for fast PEF calculation. Specifically, the classical Transformer network captures the dynamic spatial uncertainty features via a novel graph attention mechanism to model the uncertain fluctuating RES features. Additionally, a quantum neural network is proposed to extract the high-dimensional, complex relationships of IES operational data, thereby improving calculational accuracy. Case studies are conducted on both IEEE 33-node electric/20-node gas/17-node heating and 118-node electric/48-node gas/14-node heating systems. Experimental evaluation results verify that the proposed approach achieves high accuracy and maintains strong computational performance in PEF calculation."

To advance this technology, the China Southern Power Grid Corporation launched a project to develop a 10 Mvar-class HTS SC, with an initial 100-kVA-class prototype designed to validate core technologies. The prototype, featuring Rare Earth Barium Copper Oxide (REBCO) magnets and a helium gas circulation cooling system, underwent thermal and electrical performance tests. The thermal test showed that, under a stable 150 A excitation for over 1 hour, the rotor magnet's temperature rose by a mere  1 K. Furthermore, in the electrical performance tests, the stator withstood a short-circuit current exceeding 500 A, and the prototype delivered nearly 100 kW of active power output in generator mode. The prototype also successfully passed multiple rapid excitation regulation tests without any damage. These results validate the technical feasibility of the REBCO-based HTS SC design, marking a significant step toward its practical application for enhancing grid security and stability."

    "abstract": "To advance the development of maritime intelligent transportation systems (MITS), underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs), composed of numerous sensor nodes, have been widely deployed for underwater information perception. However, UWSNs face critical challenges in achieving cost-effective and timely data collection due to their large-scale deployment and stringent data timeliness requirements. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an efficient data collection scheme for UWSNs through the collaboration between uncrewed surface vehicles (USVs) and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Specifically, we first introduce a cooperative framework where AUVs select appropriate USVs to form USV-AUV clusters. Within each cluster, AUVs are responsible for sensing data collection, while USVs act as relay nodes, moving toward the destination (e.g., data center). We then devise an evolutionary game-theoretic cluster forming mechanism, deriving evolutionarily stable strategies (ESS) through replicator dynamics analysis, which guarantees a provable Nash equilibrium. Next, we present a hierarchical optimization method that models the interaction between UWSNs and the cluster as a two-agent Markov decision process, where a dual-agent Q-learning algorithm is designed to jointly optimize the decisions of both entities. Finally, extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms conventional methods in improving the efficiency of sensing data collection for UWSNs."

We analyze the magnitude and phase of the reflection coefficient derived from the grid impedance seen from a given bus and the bus impedance, and across variations of the <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathrm{P}, \\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{V}$</tex> operating point extract the reflection-coefficient shape characteristics to construct a probabilistic bus-wise oscillation-vulnerability index. Using the power-system simulator PSS/E, we compute reflection coefficients across multiple test systems and verify the association between reflection-coefficient features and oscillation-prone locations."

    "abstract": "Convolution operations are extensively used for deep learning tasks and especially in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image processing, computer vision, and other machine learning applications. Having a memory order infrastructure is not a sufficient condition for correctness of programs such as these, because these operations are computationally intensive and need high parallelism and memory bandwidth to execute on a traditional general purpose processor. To overcome this issue, Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), and Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) have been implemented as a special hardware accelerator for accelerating the convolution operation. This research paper has reviewed architectures and performance efficiency of various hardware accelerators for convolution engines. Systolic arrays, SIMD/SIMT based MAC acceleration, as well as dataflow architectures, are examined in the paper for proposing key architectures to optimize Multiply Accumulate (MAC) operations, critical to convolution tasks. Also, the techniques of reducing latency and increasing data throughput like on-chip buffering, tiling, in-memory computing are discussed in view how to optimize the memory. Finally, the paper also compares the pros and cons of GPUs, FPGA, ASIC, and neuromorphic computing platforms that are emerging, and where they can be used for particular convolution. Finally, the challenges of the design complexity, scalability, and energy consumption are discussed and future research trends of hardware based convolution acceleration are discussed as well."

    "abstract": "The increasing global population, combined with climate variability and finite natural resources, poses significant challenges to modern agriculture. Conventional farming practices are often labor-intensive, inefficient, and lack real-time monitoring of crop health and soil conditions. Precision agriculture has emerged as a solution by integrating advanced technologies such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, and artificial intelligence (AI). In this work, we propose a drone-based precision agriculture framework that utilizes highre-solution aerial images and cloud-based deep learning pipelines to automate key farm management operations. The system focuses on four main objectives: (i) detecting water scarcity to enable responsive irrigation, (ii) mapping and identifying weeds, (iii) recognizing plant diseases and suggesting appropriate treatments, and (iv) monitoring crop growth to provide accurate yield predictions. The proposed framework aims to improve efficiency, reduce resource wastage, and support data-driven decision-making in agriculture. The proposed system employs a DJI mavic 2 pro UAV equipped with a <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{4 K}, 60 \\text{fps}$</tex> camera to capture high-resolution imagery during scheduled flights. Captured images are transmitted to the cloud, where advanced machine learning algorithms process them to generate actionable insights. Experimental results demonstrate strong performance, with <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{9 4. 3 2 \\%}$</tex> accuracy in growth estimation, 97.84% accuracy in weed detection, and 93.87% accuracy in disease identification with recommended treatments. The findings indicate that the framework effectively reduces manual labor, optimizes resource usage, and enhances crop productivity. By delivering real-time insights to farmers through mobile applications, this approach supports data-driven decision-making, promotes sustainable agricultural practices, and contributes to addressing global challenges of food security and resource management."

    "abstract": "The increasing adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) has highlighted the critical role of battery management systems (BMS) in ensuring safety, efficiency, and longevity of energy storage components, emphasizing the need for effective educational tools to train future engineers and technicians. Traditional BMS training relies heavily on static manuals, unstructured technical documents, and lecture-based instruction, which limits learners' ability to quickly extract, relate, and apply complex technical information. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a Semantic Embedding Model for Technical Documentation Analysis in Battery Management Systems Education (SEM-BMS), which leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, including domain-specific embeddings and semantic similarity analysis, to automatically extract key concepts, relationships, and procedures from diverse BMS documentation. SEM-BMS organizes the extracted knowledge into structured, interactive knowledge maps, enabling adaptive learning, efficient information retrieval, and enhanced comprehension of intricate battery operation concepts. Experimental evaluation on a curated dataset of BMS manuals, technical reports, and instructional notes demonstrated that SEM-BMS achieved a 92 % accuracy in concept extraction, improved knowledge retrieval efficiency by 36 %, and increased student learning outcomes by 29 % compared to conventional keyword-based and lecture-driven methods. These results confirm that semantic embedding-based analysis significantly enhances both accessibility and quality of BMS education. In conclusion, SEMBMS provides a scalable, intelligent, and interactive framework for structuring unstructured technical content, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical understanding, and fostering a more effective learning environment for battery management systems education."

The point cloud-based 6 degrees of freedom (6-DoF) grasp pose estimation methods play a crucial role in this field but require expensive fine-grained annotations. To address this challenge, we propose a mixed supervision learning framework that integrates a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data for the 6-DoF grasp pose estimation task. Our method both take point cloud and image modalities as inputs, with supervision from 6-DoF and rectangle grasp annotations, respectively. Furthermore, for the abundant unlabeled data, we adopt a pseudo-labeling strategy, where estimations from the image-based model are used to guide the training of the point cloud-based branch. By jointly training on labeled and unlabeled data, our approach reduces the reliance on costly 6-DoF grasp pose annotations. We evaluate our method on the GraspNet-1Billion benchmark under the few-shot setting, demonstrating that our mixed supervision strategy significantly improves 6-DoF grasping performance even with limited labeled data."

A hybrid charging system connected with the PV system and the grid provides reliable and sustainable energy supply. When the power output of the PV system is high, it is the sole supplier of the charging station and the backup battery. The boost converter along with perturb and observe (P&O) MPPT algorithm ensures maximum power output. When the solar energy is unable to take the load of the charging station, the grid and backup battery supplies energy to the charging station. The V2V charging is also implemented to better manage and optimize the energy flow. To manage the power flow amongst these components, a bidirectional buck boost converter along with an optimized PI controller are used to control the charging and the discharging process of the batteries connected.

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "The framework proposed in this study is a Multimodal Biometric Authentication Framework which provides extremely accurate and reliable identification by combining face, hand, and iris traits from the Multimodal Biometric Dataset (MULB). It operates sequentially in five stages, namely, Data Collection, Preprocessing, Feature Extraction, Feature Selection, and Classification, to enhance accuracy and robustness under varying acquisition conditions. During the preprocessing step, MTCNN detects and aligns the faces, CLAHE is used for contrast enhancement, and Gaussian filtering is done along with z-score normalization to remove noise and balance pixel values. Data augmentation methods such as horizontal flipping of images, small-angle rotation, and synthetic noise are applied to make the system robust under pose and illumination variations. Feature extraction is done on face images with MobileNetV3, which possesses the ability to describe discriminative spatial representations, whereas optical flow maps carry temporal information necessary for dynamic patterns. Multimodal feature fusion across all biometric traits then happens by means of simple feature concatenation that represents more complete information. The AOA is a hybridization of the WOA and POA; it chooses the most salient features by balancing the need for global exploration/local exploitation, thereby improving dimensionality reduction and classification accuracy. The final classification is carried out by a hybrid CNN-LSTM model that concurrently considers CNNbased spatial feature learning and LSTM-based temporal modeling, with a softmax layer atop for identity verification. Experimental evaluation shows that the proposed framework has secured accuracy of 99.36 %, which well above the baseline framework in terms of standalone CNN loss of 96.10 % and MobileNetV2 loss of 95.24 %, while also maintaining low false positive and false negative rates of 0.92 % and 0.78 %, respectively. Due to the lightweight nature of this system, it can be run on edge devices in real-time, based on which adaptive decisions can be taken in security-critical environments. In the future, work can be done to make it more robust about extreme lighting conditions and cross-cultural variations, thus extending the framework further for global biometric authentication systems."

Adding new and distinct PCBs to the system, which could be inspected for missing components, is a breeze in the proposed system; simply populate the database with additional templates. This contrasts with the need for an ML. Including an entirely novel PCB for algorithm testing necessitates the recurrence of the laborious process of amassing hundreds of datasets and training the algorithm. Objectively, the project sought to create a straightforward yet precise method for locating absent PCB components. The developed algorithm is trained and tested using the MOSFET circuit driver PCB. The system was evaluated by performing two tests, and the maximum accuracy was noted to be 94 percent with good speed of detection."

This includes uniform release characteristics as well as spikes in utilization of the deployed accelerators, during which functional constraints still need to be met, albeit at a reduced confidence in the result. Existing methods address this problem with dynamic rescaling or scheduling of anytime neural networks. Dynamic rescaling is not available for most pretrained neural networks, and existing work either do not support heterogeneous execution units or incur a high timing overhead. We introduce our open-source tool CH2AI to solve this challenge. CH2AI extends existing work by the support for heterogeneous execution units and a streamlined execution. CH2AI supports the generation of anytime neural networks from existing neural networks without the need to retrain the original network and the scheduling of these anytime neural networks onto heterogeneous execution units. Our evaluation includes an analysis of timing overheads, a timeliness analyses, as well as a tradeoff analysis between accuracy and (over) utilization. We observed a timing overhead between 2.1% and 7.2% for our tested ML models. For an (over) utilization of 250%, we observed timeliness of up to 99% for uniform task releases and between 70% and 85% for random task releases, depending on the used model. We preserved the accuracy in a 15% range for utilization spikes of up to 250%."

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being deployed in industrial automation education to enhance the comprehension and delivery of programming content for programmable logic controllers (PLCs), which remain foundational to modern factory systems. However, the rapid growth of PLC-based instructional materials often varies widely in style, complexity, and pedagogy, creating inconsistencies that hinder student engagement, knowledge retention, and adaptability across diverse learning environments. Traditional curriculum designs rarely account for stylistic alignment between instructional text and learner needs, limiting the effectiveness of teaching PLC logic and programming structures. To address this problem, the paper propose an AI-Driven Stylistic Profiling and Adaptation Model (AISPAM), which combines natural language processing (NLP), transformer-based text representation, and unsupervised clustering to analyze and adapt PLC programming content according to stylistic markers such as technical density, instructional clarity, cognitive load, and domain-specific readability. AISPAM classifies content into pedagogical clusters, aligning instructional material style with targeted learner categories ranging from novice technicians to advanced engineering students. Experimental validation on a curated dataset of PLC programming manuals, learning modules, and industrial training documents demonstrated that AISPAM achieved over 87 % accuracy in stylistic clustering, while adaptive transformation improved student comprehension scores by 22 % in test scenarios. These findings confirm that AI-based stylistic analysis can effectively bridge the gap between technical rigor and adaptive pedagogy, providing a robust framework for developing dynamic, learner-centered curricula in automation education. The work highlights future potential for integrating stylistic adaptability into smart industrial training platforms and intelligent tutoring systems for lifelong learning."

With growing demands for accurate, responsive, and networked energy metering in smart homes and microgrids, the need for deterministic and modular embedded solutions has become critical. The proposed system employs the ZMPT101B voltage sensor and SCT-013 current transformer to acquire analog signals, which are digitized through the ADS1115 16-bit ADC for high-resolution sampling. FreeRTOS plays a pivotal role in orchestrating multiple parallel tasks-voltage and current acquisition, RMS computation, OLED visualization, and Blynk-based IoT communication-by leveraging features such as task prioritization, core pinning, queues, semaphores, and software timers. Through structured multitasking and resource isolation, FreeRTOS ensures minimal jitter, reliable data integrity, and real-time responsiveness across all processes. High-priority tasks like ADC sampling are protected from delays caused by Wi-Fi communication or display rendering, which are offloaded to lower-priority threads. This design enables the system to perform continuous real-time monitoring without blocking or data loss, even under fluctuating workloads. Experimental results validate the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the RTOS-powered system, demonstrating consistent energy tracking over time and seamless cloud synchronization via Blynk. Furthermore, the RTOS-centric approach provides a scalable foundation for future extensions such as TinyML-based edge analytics, blockchain integration, and energy-aware task scheduling for self-powered IoT applications. The outcomes highlight the indispensable role of RTOS in advancing next-generation, intelligent, and decentralized energy monitoring solutions."

    "abstract": "Roadside animal detection systems are advancing road safety by integrating real-time animal detection into traffic monitoring and in-vehicle applications. This scalable, softwareonly solution can be deployed on personal computers or servers, offering an efficient way to prevent vehicle-animal collisions. Using deep learning, this system leverages advanced object detection models like YOLO (You Only Look Once) and Faster R-CNN, achieving accurate animal detection from live video feeds captured by roadside or in-vehicle cameras. The system is built entirely in Python and uses frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch for developing detection models, while OpenCV facilitates real-time video processing. By identifying and classifying animals, the system displays bounding boxes with confidence scores around detected animals, providing clear visual cues to drivers. Its primary goal is to deliver timely alerts, helping to minimize vehicle collisions with wildlife, especially in areas with frequent wildlife crossings. Designed to be robust, the system operates effectively under a range of environmental conditions, ensuring reliable detection during both day and night. This project ultimately aims to enhance road safety and reduce the environmental impact of vehicle-wildlife collisions, addressing a pressing need for sustainable and intelligent traffic solutions."

    "abstract": "Heterogeneous systems commonly adopt dynamic scheduling algorithms to improve resource utilization and enhance scheduling flexibility. However, it may introduce timing anomalies, wherein locally reduced tasks' actual execution times can lead to an increase in the overall system execution time. This phenomenon significantly complicates the analysis of WorstCase Response Time (WCRT), rendering conventional analysis either overly pessimistic or unsafe, and often necessitating exhaustive state-space exploration to ensure correctness. To address this challenge, this paper presents the first timing-anomalyfree dynamic scheduling algorithm for heterogeneous systems, referred to as Deterministic Dynamic Execution. The core idea is to apply deterministic execution constraints, which partially restrict the resource allocation and execution order of tasks at runtime. It achieves a safe and tight WCRT through a single offline simulation execution. In this paper, we provide preliminary experimental validation of the timing-anomaly-free property of our algorithm and outline the basic idea of a formal proof."

Evaluation is carried out with metrics of accuracy, Hungarian METEOR, and AVeriTeC scores. The experimental results show that the proposed system yields higher-quality evidence and more accurate verdicts across four categories."

    "abstract": "Environmental perception, as a core module of the autonomous driving system, plays a crucial role in ensuring the rationality and safety of driving behavior. In recent years, Vehicle-To-Vehicle cooperative perception has significantly enhanced the accuracy of environmental perception for intelligent connected vehicles (ICVs). Among them, cross-modality cooperation enables the integration of complementary information between heterogeneous data structures, leading to further improvements in perception accuracy. However, in practical applications, it still faces problems such as limited communication bandwidth, high redundancy in data transmission, and lack of collaborative scheduling. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a method of cross-modality cooperative perception for multiple vehicles under V2X (Vehicle-To-Everything), which leverages the communication and computing resources deployed at roadside infrastructure to enable coordination and centralized processing of perception information. In this method, first, each ICV projects the raw perceptual data of both 3D point clouds and 2D images onto a unified bird’s-eye view plane during feature extraction to reduce spatial differences between modalities. Next, the vehicles apply a feature selection algorithm based on Region of Interest to filter intermediate features and upload data with high value for perception tasks to roadside infrastructure. Then, the roadside infrastructure centrally fuses the heterogeneous data from multiple vehicles, performs object detection, and returns the final results to each vehicle. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly reduces communication bandwidth overhead while maintaining perception performance, and enhances the robustness of system perception."

This paper proposes the Federation-aware Proximal Policy Optimization (FPPO) algorithm, which achieves intelligent execution mode selection for the first time. FPPO leverages federation-aware state representation to capture system task conditions, adopts a hierarchical action space to decouple mode selection from resource allocation, and introduces a hybrid decision mechanism to balance learning capability with decision reliability. Experimental results demonstrate that FPPO significantly reduces average response time compared to a baseline algorithm, while maintaining a high success rate."

    "abstract": "Today's industrial assistive robots improve worker safety, productivity, and cooperation. Robots can't understand, predict, or respond to human behavior without good body movement classification. Traditional classification methods struggle with real-time adaptability, uneven data, and noise. This paper addresses faulty classification approaches that cannot handle limited-sample or one-class learning in assistive robots. Standard machine learning methods fail in industrial settings due to the lack of large, balanced datasets. This restriction makes it challenging to design intelligent robotic systems that assist humans in adapting to changing situations. Physical Motion classification using Support Vector Data Description (PM-SVDD) is our novel solution to these issues. PM-SVDD models usual motion patterns and identifies outliers that may indicate undesirable or aberrant motions using SVDD's one-class classification feature. Kernel-based mapping and temporal feature extraction boost discriminative performance in many industrial situations. A custom assistive robotics dataset and conventional motion datasets were employed for experimental validation. With an average classification accuracy of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{9 4. 7 \\%}$</tex>, PM-SVDD outperforms SVM and k-NN in scenarios with limited negative data. Due to its low computational delay, the approach is ideal for real-time robotics. Finally, the PM-SVDD technique for physical motion classification in <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{A I}$</tex> is strong and effective, enabling more intelligent and safer human-robot interaction."

Addressing these risks is essential for improving global maternal health and reducing pregnancy-related complications. We suggest a hybrid model to improve early risk prediction and intervention. This research investigates maternal health risk prediction using a deep learning hybrid model, supplemented by an ablation study to assess the contribution of each feature to model performance. Maternal health is a significant area of concern because there is a high incidence of pregnancy, perinatal, childbirth, and postpartum complications, which have significant impacts on maternal and neonatal health. This ablation study rigorously analyses the contribution of each feature and hence detects key predictors like Body Mass Index (BMI) and pre-existing diabetes. In addition, our suggested hybrid model has a better classification performance, 99% accuracy, and high ROC-AUC scores compared to current benchmarks. This implies enhanced discriminatory ability at different levels of risk. Therefore, our contributions extend beyond predictive enhancement to providing clinical interpretability and robustness through deliberate architectural design and feature-level validation."

However, real-world LBSN datasets present several challenges, including sparsity, limited size, privacy issues, and a lack of reliable ground truth data. This paper addresses the location prediction problem in LSBNs, emphasizing a notable research gap, which is the underestimation of users' tendency to withhold information about specific visited locations and activities. In order to bridge this gap, this research proposes an Associative Hidden Location Trajectory Prediction model based on similarity measures (AHLTP-SM) that analyses user trajectories to predict unchecked, privately visited locations. The model examines the relationship between trajectory similarity and distance measure using cosine similarity and Jaccard coefficient. The proposed model is evaluated using several machine-learning techniques, including deep learning, gradient-boosted trees, and K-Nearest neighbors. Experiments conducted on the Foursquare dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, classified with gradient-boosted trees and deep learning, achieving the highest accuracy at 99%, followed by K-Nearest neighbor with 89% accuracy. A Comparative analysis on the same real-world dataset demonstrates our model's superior accuracy compared to our previous work."

However, like anything else that rises in popularity, so do the threats they face. Often, humans or bots create fake accounts to engage in malicious or illegal activities. To control this problem, we propose a hybrid embedding-based approach that uses a combination of static word embeddings and transformer-based embeddings. This method relies on embeddings, a fundamental and powerful technique in modern machine learning, specifically combining multiple embedding types which are not commonly explored in fake profile detection. Transformer-based embeddings provide powerful context awareness to handle ambiguous or misleading language, which is often common in fake profiles, while static embeddings capture word-to-word relationships efficiently. By combining the two types of embeddings, the model uses the strengths of each to accurately distinguish fake profiles from real ones. The model was tested using a publicly available dataset that contained 3,600 LinkedIn profiles. Three machine learning classifiers (SVM, Random Forest, and XGBoost) were tested across binary and multi-class classification tasks. The experimental results show that this approach achieves a high detection rate of 98.96% using a hybrid embedding combination."

To alleviate the high complexity of time domain equalization in existing algorithms, this paper introduces the concept of delay-Doppler decoupling and proposes a low-complexity equalization scheme that leverages the banded Hermitian property of the channel matrix. By decoupling the channel matrix along the delay and Doppler dimensions, the large-scale matrix is partitioned into several low-dimensional sub-matrices. It is theoretically proved that each sub-matrix is banded, positive-definite, and Hermitian. Based on this property, a Cholesky factorization is employed to further reduce computational complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed approach reduces both time (by 55%) and memory complexities (by 75%) without sacrificing detection performance, thereby offering a feasible receiver design for highly dynamic communication systems."

    "abstract": "Ultrasound-induced vaporization of perfluorocarbon (PFC) nanodroplets can be used for triggered drug delivery. Nanodroplets of perfluorobutane (PFB) and perfluoropentane (PFP) can vaporize spontaneously at physiological temperature, which can cause off-target effects. Using high-boiling-point PFCs, such as perfluorohexane (PFH), can overcome this limitation. However, PFH requires higher peak negative pressures for vaporization, making its <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">in vivo</i> use challenging. We investigated the feasibility of reducing the vaporization pressure threshold by gold-coating lipid-encapsulated PFH nanodroplets (Au-PFH-ND). We synthesized PFH nanodroplets, and the gold-coating was confirmed by UV-visible spectra. The mass of gold per nanodroplet was 5.12×10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-4</sup> pg. The size distribution peaked at 200 nm and had a mean concentration of 2×10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">10</sup> droplets/ml. Au-PFH-ND demonstrated excellent stability over 8 weeks. Ultrasound imaging <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">in vitro</i> was used to determine the pressure threshold for nanodroplet vaporization upon exposure to 2 MHz ultrasound. The vaporization threshold for Au-PFH-ND (3.29 ± 0.93 MPa) was significantly lower than uncoated PFH nanodroplets (PFH-ND, 6.19 ± 1.25 MPa). Au-PFH-ND had a similar pressure threshold to uncoated PFP nanodroplets (PFP-ND, 2.81 ± 1.08 MPa). These findings show that the Au-PFH-ND can be vaporized at a similar ultrasound pressure as PFP-ND. Increasing pulse duration from 2 to 60 cycles enhanced vaporization of Au-PFH-ND, demonstrating the dominant role of a thermal mechanism. Even when accounting for the total ultrasound on-time and effective peak negative pressure, longer bursts (i.e., more cycles per burst) were more effective in inducing vaporization, consistent with the role of localized heating around the gold coating rather than a purely probabilistic effect. Additionally, inertial and stable cavitation emissions were quantified. Au-PFH-ND exhibited a marginally lower inertial cavitation threshold and similar second harmonic emissions than PFH-ND, suggesting that cavitation could also have played a role in reducing the pressure threshold. These findings are a step towards employing gold-coated PFC nanodroplets for multimodal drug delivery."

    "abstract": "Multimodal fusion is an effective solution for holistic brain tumor diagnosis; however, it faces challenges under missing modalities. Traditional multi-encoder architectures can easily capture modality-specific features, while single-encoder architectures readily obtain modality-shared features. The reverse, however, is challenging. In this paper, we propose a two-stage dual-view prototype learning framework to extract the modality-specific feature and the class-specific feature simultaneously. In the first stage, we utilize the Transformer decoder to learn the modality-prototypes that are used to optimize the modality reconstruction task. A masked autoencoder is introduced to generate shared features of incomplete modalities. The learned modality-prototypes that contain modality-specific features are blended with the modality-share features for the reconstruction process. In the second stage, we learn the class-prototypes through the Transformer decoder to generate a segmentation mask through voxel-to-prototype comparison. A masked modality strategy is introduced to handle random modality absence during training. Furthermore, modality-view and class-view contrastive learning strategies are developed to enhance prototype learning. We conduct experiments on BraTS2020 and BraTS2018; the experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our model under various missing modality scenarios. On BraTS2020, our model achieves DSC improvements of 5.9% for ET, 0.5% for TC, and 0.2% for WT compared to state-of-the-art methods. Notably, in the challenging T1C modality missing scenario, our model achieved clinically significant gains of 9.5% for ET and 1.8% for TC.

    "abstract": "Medical image segmentation often involves inherent uncertainty due to inter observer variability. In this case, a single deterministic mask obtained by conventional segmentation networks, such as U-Net, cannot capture the distribution of plausible expert annotations, risking missed clinically relevant variants. In order to enable uncertainty quantification and reflect inter expert variability, probabilistic models like Probabilistic U-Net are used, which perform aleatoric or ambiguous segmentation where a latent space is sampled to generate multiple segmentation masks. However, the common use of a conditioned unimodal posterior in these models fails to represent true multimodality, leading to mode bias and limited diversity. To address these limitations, a multi-level Probabilistic U-Net augmented with normalizing flows is proposed to enhance the expressiveness of the latent distribution. The multi-level design induces multiple latent distributions in separate levels of U-Net, enabling more diverse sampling, while the flow module transforms the posterior to add data required modes and expand representational capacity, thereby enriching the expressiveness of the distributions. The proposed flow incorporated multi-level network enables a more flexible and powerful distribution, thereby enhancing the model’s ability to generate high fidelity segmentation masks. Extensive experiments on some publicly available datasets with multiple expert annotations per image demonstrate that the proposed model reduces generalized energy distance (GED), preserves clinically meaningful diversity and sharpens boundary fidelity, with latent grid analyses indicating fuller mode coverage and fewer artifacts. Collectively, these results indicate that the proposed framework advances accuracy, robustness, and clinical reliability for aleatoric, uncertainty aware medical image segmentation."

    "abstract": "Robust nonlinear controllers, in particular sliding mode control (SMC), have been a convenient solution for maximum power point tracking (MPPT) of photovoltaic (PV) systems, as they deal with the nonlinearity of the system and can catch the MPP in various weather conditions; however, chattering and infinite time of convergence have been related to conventional sliding mode control. In this article, we propose an integral-type terminal sliding mode MPPT (ITTSMC) controller for a PV system powering a DC load, based on the tracking error of the inductor’s current of the DC-DC boost converter, which is connected to the PV array’s output, to follow the MPP. The paper provides a theoretical study of the controller in question, demonstrating its stability and its finite-time convergence. The controller is tested under four environmental conditions, firstly, standard test conditions with a constant load, then with a variable load, secondly, a step changes in temperature and irradiance, thirdly, under real weather conditions relying on the data of temperature and irradiance of a weather station in the Faculty of Sciences and Technologies of Errachidia in the eastern south of Morocco, finally, the controller will be evaluated under realistic partial shading conditions. To assess its performance, the ITTSMC is compared to the basic terminal SMC and the classical SMC. The ITTSMC achieves an 85% reduction in reaching time, a reduction of up to 88% in chattering magnitude, and a 66% decrease in voltage RMSE compared to SMC. Moreover, it exhibits strong robustness under real environmental conditions and partial shading while ensuring high-precision MPP tracking. Overall, the ITTSMC reaches a power extraction efficiency of 99.92%, outperforming TSMC (99.81%) and classical SMC (99.64%). These quantitative improvements clearly demonstrate the superior tracking accuracy, faster transient response, and reduced chattering of the proposed control strategy."

    "abstract": "Image encryption techniques generally encrypt a secret image into a meaningless noise-like format, which could easily attract attention from attackers who then may try to crack it. On the other hand, image steganography typically embeds secret image data within a cover image, but it inevitably incurs a lot of distortion to the cover image. This makes the secret image data vulnerable to attacks by steganalysis tools. In light of the above, in this paper, we propose a Visually Meaningful Image Encryption (VMIE) scheme via image-to-image reversible transformation based on the Glow model. In this scheme, a secret image is encoded and compressed as a latent vector by the deep compression autoencoder. Then, the latent vector is scrambled and inputted into the Glow model to generate a visually meaningful encrypted image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed VMIE scheme not only provides desirable security against attacks, but also enables the reconstruction of the original images with negligible quality loss.

    "abstract": "The hybrid energy storage systems (HESSs), often configured with battery and supercapacitor (SC) combinations, can effectively regulate power imbalances between generation and loads within more electric aircraft (MEA) dc microgrids. However, traditional control exhibits limitation in precisely tracking high-frequency components within SC current loop. To address this deficiency, this article proposes a novel current control strategy enhancing SC current tracking capability in HESS. Departing from conventional approaches, the proposed strategy eliminates the proportional-integral (PI) controller from the SC current loop, instead integrating SC current regulation with pulse-width modulation (PWM) to form a modified PWM unit. Consequently, the input signal of this modified PWM unit derives from given function of the SC current, while the amplitude of the PWM carrier signal is reformulated to vary instantaneously with the SC current. The variable-carrier-based PWM method accelerates the realization of SC current synthesis. Furthermore, a small-signal model is also explored to deeply investigate the stability of the HESS. Subsequent simulations are conducted to verify the performance across multiple scenarios. Experimental validation conducted on a 25 kW HESS power stage demonstrates the theoretical feasibility of the proposed control methodology."

    "abstract": "Social manufacturing (SM) is a task-oriented production paradigm that enables coordinated scheduling across distributed manufacturing resources. However, its operational efficiency is often limited by reliance on centralized management systems. In this context, blockchain technology shows strong potential for decentralized management in SM. However; the corresponding models for early warnings of production progress, especially for task fulfillment and delay risks, remain largely unexplored. To address the limitations, this article first proposes a blockchain-based decentralized production progress early warning system in SM. Furthermore, a corresponding early warning workflow is developed to define the overall interaction logic among participants. Then, a hybrid state machine is implemented within the smart contract to construct a task fulfillment status early warning model. Afterward, a Bayesian network-based model is designed to assess the evolving delay risks of interdependent tasks. Finally, a case study on air-conditioner production is conducted to validate the proposed models. Results show that the prototype system maintains scalable performance, achieving up to 17.56 transactions/s under write-intensive workloads and 52.45 transactions/s under read-intensive workloads, demonstrating more stable scalability than traditional centralized and directed acyclic graph (DAG)-based systems."

Such cyber-physical systems have existed for decades, but with the rise of internet-connected control systems and Internet-of Things (IoT) systems in the past decade, they have become prominent and with that the challenge of securing these systems against cyberattacks, that is, remote and computer-based attempts to operate these installations in unauthorized ways, has become more urgent. In recent years a lot of research has been initiated on specific cyber-physical security mechanisms to secure cyber-physical systems. In this paper we compare such cyber-physical security mechanisms with conventional cyber security mechanisms and explain what cyber-physical security mechanisms can and cannot achieve. We propose a template for summarizing the applicability of cyber-physical security schemes. We conclude that cyber-physical security schemes come at a cost of reducing optimality of normal operation and that they can and should only serve as n-th level of defense mechanisms behind a comprehensive conventional security architecture."

    "abstract": "On a CPU-FPGA system, C/C++ applications are typically accelerated by offloading specific code regions onto the FPGA using High-level Synthesis (HLS). Although modern FPGAs can implement increasingly large and complex designs, the size and variety of potential offloading code regions remain constrained by the limitations of HLS tools (e.g., no support for dynamic memory allocation and system calls). This paper proposes automated C/C++ source-to-source transformations that tackle these limitations in two steps. Firstly, transformations reduce the entropy of an input C/C++ application by converting it into a subset of C, e.g., by flattening arrays and structs. Secondly, additional transformations make a selected code region synthesizable, e.g., by moving dynamic memory allocations out of the region, converting them to static memory, and offloading non-synthesizable C standard library calls, such as printf(), to the CPU. We evaluate the impact of these transformations showing results obtained through Vitis HLS for four real-world examples: the disparity and texture-synthesis benchmarks from CortexSuite, which contain dynamic memory allocations and indirect pointers in their hotspots; llama2, a Large Language Model that calls printf() every time it predicts a new word; and the spam-filter benchmark from Rosetta, as a debugging showcase."

    "abstract": "This study proposes an innovative and cost-effective approach to optimize the thermal field in SiC single crystal physical vapor transport (PVT) growth by regulating emissivity through a strategically designed roughness gradient on the outer wall of the graphite crucible. Rooted in the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the gradient, ranging from a roughness (Ra) of $1 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ at the bottom to $10 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ at the top, facilitates an increase in emissivity from 0.7 to 0.9, thereby enhancing the axial temperature gradient critical for efficient sublimation and deposition processes. The simulation leverages SL720 and SL920 graphite materials sourced from SIAMC, employing a 2D axisymmetric finite element model on the COMSOL Multiphysics platform. This model integrates heat conduction and radiation modules, with convergence ensured through Newton-Raphson iteration and the preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) solver, maintaining a tolerance of $10^{-7}$ to ensure computational accuracy. The simulation results reveal that the roughness gradient elevates the axial temperature gradient to a range of $14-16 \\mathrm{K} / \\mathrm{cm}$, effectively reduces radial temperature variation to less than 25 K, and achieves a significant growth rate gain of up to $18.3 \\%$ (with an average of 10.5-10.7%). Additionally, the Von Mises stress is meticulously controlled within $7-8.5 \\mathrm{MPa}$, remaining well below the flexural strength of the materials $(45-46 \\mathrm{MPa})$, ensuring structural integrity during the growth process. This method offers a low-cost, scalable thermal field optimization strategy specifically tailored for 8 -inch SiC crystals, addressing key industrial challenges such as thermal uniformity and defect reduction. The potential for further refinement through multi-segment gradient experiments is highlighted, promising to advance the industrialization of large-diameter SiC crystals by enhancing growth efficiency and crystal quality in high-throughput production environments."

The classical communication subsystem is critical for coordinating distributed control operations and supporting quantum protocols such as teleportation. In this work, we consider a realization based on a wireless network-on-chip for implementing classical communication within cryogenic environments. Traditional token-based medium access control (MAC) protocols, however, incur latency penalties due to inefficient token circulation among inactive nodes. We propose the instruction-directed token MAC (ID-MAC), a protocol that leverages the deterministic nature of quantum circuit execution to predefine transmission schedules at compile time. By embedding instruction-level information into the MAC layer, ID-MAC restricts token circulation to active transmitters, thereby improving channel utilization and reducing communication latency. Simulations show that ID-MAC reduces classical communication time by up to 70% and total execution time by up to 30-70%, while also extending effective system coherence. These results highlight ID-MAC as a scalable and efficient MAC solution for future multichip quantum architectures."

This study introduces a data-driven framework that systematically predicts the deformation response of a protective system made up of an auxetic sandwich panel resting on a reinforced concrete (RC) slab impacted vertically. Traditional finite element (FE) analysis of such impact scenarios is computationally intensive and may involve manual processes prone to human error. To overcome these limitations, this study combines FE simulations with machine learning (ML) to be able to efficiently predict the structural deformation under varying impact conditions. A series of simulations were conducted in ANSYS, systematically varying the impactor parameters in order to generate a training dataset. The main objective is to develop a predictive model for the deformation of both the auxetic core and the underlying RC slab. Various machine learning regression models—involving ensemble tree-based models (Extra Trees, Random Forest), kernel-based models (Kernel Ridge), and linear models (Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso)—were trained and evaluated. The performance of the model was measured using the coefficient of determination (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathrm{R}^{2}$</tex>), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The Extra Trees model yielded the greatest accuracy predicting core deformation (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathrm{R}^{2} = 0.98$</tex>), while the Kernel Ridge model was the best for predicting slab deformation (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathrm{R}^{2} = 0.94$</tex>).

    "abstract": "Female dropout rates in Indian schools continue to be a significant barrier to achieving educational equity and national development. This study presents a two-phase data-driven solution to analyze and address this issue. In the first phase, historical data (years 2001-2010) sourced from data.gov.in was used to visualize patterns in dropout rates across Indian states demographics and school levels. Key insights were derived using Power Bi dashboards and clustering states on the basis of higher decline in dropout rates ratio. In the second phase, states were clustered based on dropout rate decline percentages, forming five prominent clusters with similar socio-educational trends. This clustering enabled the development of a recommendation system which can provide cluster-specific solutions. The suggested solutions include development of mentorship programs, providing financial support and targeted resource allocation. The data-driven approach illustrated the existing disparities between different states and regions and highlighted the need for localized interventions."

Traditional methods of detection, like manual inspection and sensor-based systems, are costly, unreliable, and not scalable. We propose a real-time pothole detection system based on the YOLOv8 object identification framework and the Ultralytics package. Using 645 annotated images (70 percent training, 20 percent validation, and 10 percent testing), our model was improved over 70 epochs with 97.8 % detection accuracy, 1.00 precision, 0.91 recall, and mAP@0.5 of 0.98. The model uses an RTX 2060 Super GPU to process 45 frames per second video streams, enabling real-time pothole detection. The GPS coordinates of potholes are extracted to enable prompt infrastructure repair. Road safety is increased, smart city initiatives are supported, and road condition monitoring is made easier by this inexpensive, automated technology."

    "abstract": "High-Utility Itemset Mining (HUIM) identifies item combinations in transactional datasets that yield high utility, such as profit or importance. Existing approaches to periodic high-utility mining (PHM) fail to consider two practical limitations: the inability to handle items with negative utilities, and the lack of mechanisms to suppress overly frequent, low-value patterns. This paper introduces PHMN-Gap, an enhanced framework that incorporates negative utility handling and a user-defined minimum temporal gap constraint between itemset occurrences. The algorithm extends utility-list based mining by modifying the candidate generation and join process to enforce temporal separation. This ensures that only itemsets recurring after a meaningful interval are considered, thereby filtering trivial or noisy repetitions. Extensive experiments conducted on standard utility mining datasets demonstrate that PHMN-Gap achieves better performance in terms of runtime and memory usage, while generating a more concise and interpretable set of patterns. As the minimum gap constraint increases, the number of discovered patterns decreases significantly, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed pruning strategy. PHMN-Gap achieves this with linear-time joins in candidate generation and lower memory overheads, making it scalable and suitable for large-scale applications. The resulting itemsets are more relevant for real-world applications where both profitability and temporal behavior must be jointly analyzed."

Additionally, energy-concerned communication is highly desirable in future wireless networks. The current manuscript presents an energy-conscious handoff strategy that addresses the handoff delay simultaneously. The proposed algorithm limits the number of channels to be probed by considering a minimal set of target APs under scanning. This selection is based on the consumed energy of the target AP. This results in a reduction in handoff delay, keeping the dissipated energy as minimal as possible. Appropriate simulations have been conducted based on performance parameters such as throughput, consumed energy, and delay during handoff. The comparative study with the existing work also demonstrates the judicious target network selection."

The pipeline involves accurate frame selection based on annotated timestamps, followed by systematic pre-processing through face alignment and normalization. The proposed convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is trained on a speaker-independent data split to avoid temporal data leakage. The proposed CNN architecture achieved an accuracy of 83.72 % and demonstrated a balanced performance across six emotions: anger, happiness, sadness, frustration, neutral, and excitement. In addition, we also implemented and evaluated the IEMOCAP dataset using YOLOv11 and YOLOv12 for static image-based facial emotion recognition. The real-time GUI system had an average of 25 ms per frame on the commodity hardware, demonstrating practical deployability.

    "abstract": "Accurate forecasting is essential in areas such as energy systems, demand management, and load prediction; even slight differences between the real-time and predicted values can influence planning and decision-making. Traditional regression models are often used for forecasting because of their simplicity, but they face challenges when the data becomes complex or non-linear. These limitations can lead to less reliable predictions, especially when the models are prone to overfitting. In this study, we compare the performance of a standard regression model with a Bayesian Regularisation (BR) model for forecasting. Using the real and forecasted datasets, the analysis was carried out, and the accuracy of both methods was evaluated with performance measures such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and the coefficient of determination (R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>). The results show that although both approaches produce forecasts close to the actual data, the Bayesian Regularisation model performs more consistently and with greater accuracy. Its capability to balance between complexity and generalisation makes it a reliable and good choice for forecasting under uncertainty. The results emphasise the strength of BR and its potential for extensive application in forecasting jobs across energy and data-driven domains."

In this work, we conduct TCAD simulations to determine the role of interface traps in governing the I-V and C-V characteristics of SiC MOSFET. A SiC MOSFET TCAD model is first constructed, followed by a systematic analysis of how variations in interface traps type, energy level, and location affect the device’s I-V and C-V characteristics. The results indicate that acceptor traps near the valence band (Ev) and donor traps near the conduction band ($\\mathrm{E}_{\\mathrm{C}}$) located at the $\\mathrm{SiC} / \\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ interface within the channel region cause significant shifts in the $\\mathrm{I}_{\\mathrm{D}}-\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{G}}$ curve, while interface traps in the JFET region have negligible impact.

The results revealed statistically significant differences between East Asian and Black ethnicities in static parameters-including axial length (AL), corneal curvature (KM), and anterior chamber depth (ACD)-as well as in dynamic indicators such as ciliary muscle accommodative ability (ACC), modulation transfer function (MTF), and higher-order aberrations (HOAs).

This robot navigates over water surfaces, capture floating debris, and classify objects in real time. The system employs DroidCam as a live video source, processed using a Python-based pipeline with TensorFlow and a YOLO-trained deep learning model to classify floating objects as plastic or non-plastic. Upon classification, decision signals are transmitted to an ESP32 microcontroller, which governs the conveyor belt and servo mechanisms to either collect or release objects. The ESP32 also handles wireless connectivity through the Blynk IoT platform, enabling remote monitoring, manual override, and operational data logging.

The denoising module employs convolutional layers with rectified linear units and sigmoid activations to suppress noise and normalize outputs.

    "abstract": "This paper studies the path planning problem of full coverage unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in a 3-D terrain environment. Aiming at the realistic constraints such as terrain fluctuation, occlusions, and no-fly zones, a method of UAV coverage path generation and optimization is developed, employing a random experiment strategy and simulated annealing (SA) optimization. The approach begins with grid-based discretization of the UAV flight space and the 3-D terrain, followed by the establishment of a camera field-of-view model that accounts for terrain shading. Combined with the simple sweep-based approach and A* algorithm, an initial loop satisfying the coverage requirement is generated. On this basis, the SA algorithm is designed to optimize the initial path with the coverage rate and path length as the optimization objectives. The adaptive acceptance mechanism strikes a balance between solution quality and search efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively address terrain occlusion and no-fly zone constraints, and significantly shorten the monitoring path while ensuring high coverage. The method outperforms the comparison algorithms, demonstrating excellent practicality and stability."

Swin Transformers have emerged as a transformative architecture in this domain, leveraging hierarchical feature extraction and shifted window attention to address the unique challenges of medical image analysis. Unlike conventional approaches, Swin Transformers excel at capturing both fine-grained details and broader contextual information, making them particularly suited for tasks requiring multi-scale analysis. This systematic review explores the role of Swin Transformers in medical image classification, examining their architectural advantages, clinical applicability, and current limitations. Future research should focus on optimizing Swin Transformers for real-world healthcare settings, including the development of lightweight variants and robust benchmarking protocols. The review also identifies gaps in current applications, particularly in understudied modalities like ultrasound, and calls for more comprehensive datasets to enhance model generalizability. By addressing these challenges, Swin Transformers have the potential to advance medical image classification significantly, bridging the gap between cuttingedge AI research and practical clinical implementation.

    "abstract": "Emerging embedded systems have to increasingly meet energy constraints besides their timing requirements. While frequency-scaling techniques are well explored, existing operating systems for embedded real-time systems have shortcomings in comprehensively exploiting energy-saving features present in modern system-on-chip (SoC) platforms. Existing systems lack operating-system abstractions to exploit the tradeoff between computing performance and energy efficiency. Consequently, whole-system analysis techniques are not applicable to yield optimal configurations tailored to the applications' requirements. Finally, the complexity of modern energy-saving hardware features creates huge search spaces for optimal configurations. In this paper, we present WATWAOS, a framework for worst-case-aware tailoring and whole-system analysis of energyconstrained real-time systems. WatwaOS acts as both an analysis/tailoring framework and a (generated) real-time operating system. The approach exploits knowledge acquired during wholesystem analysis and applies worst-case-aware tailoring of the system for its runtime. WatwaOS has an awareness of the application's requirements (i.e., deadlines, peripheral devices) and the underlying SoC's energy-saving features. To achieve the tailoring, WATWAOS introduces a concept of hierarchical abstractions, which offer fine-grained power-management decisions. These abstractions are designed to enable merging of their states without loss of accuracy. Static analysis based on these abstractions yields worst-case-optimal (i.e., provably energy minimal) solutions with regard to given deadlines. To tackle the enormous search space of our bilevel problem, WatwaOS employs several concepts to exploit advanced features of mathematical optimizing tools. The evaluations of WATWAOS validate our claim of finding worst-case-optimal solutions within acceptable analysis times."

This paper proposes EHKEA, a lightweight mutual authentication and key establishment protocol designed specifically for H-IoT environments. EHKEA relies solely on symmetric cryptographic primitives and ephemeral randomness to provide mutual authentication, forward secrecy and resistance to common attacks such as replay, impersonation, and man-in-the-middle intrusions. We formally verify EHKEA in the Tamarin prover under the Dolev-Yao adversary model, proving key security properties including injective agreement and session key secrecy. A detailed informal analysis further confirms its robustness against desynchronization, insider threats, and key compromise impersonation. Comparative analysis with recent H-IoT protocols demonstrates that EHKEA achieves superior efficiency while offering stronger security guarantees, making it well-suited for deployment in real-time healthcare monitoring applications."

However, RES output fluctuations can increase the reliance on backup systems, higher running costs and reducing MG efficiency, while poor coordination between EVs, batteries, and RESs can raise emissions and underutilize clean energy. To overcome these limitations, this article proposes a Blood Sucking Leech Optimizer (BSLO) algorithm to optimize Energy Management (EM) in residential MG with RESs, HESS, and EVs. The main objective of the proposed BSLO algorithm is to minimize operating expenses, emissions, maximize the efficiency of the MG, and utilize RESs by optimizing the energy allocation and ensure efficient utilization of resources. The suggested method is implemented in MATLAB and compared with various existing approaches like Particle Swarm Optimization, Coati Optimization Algorithm, and Gannet Optimization Algorithm. The suggested technique achieves an operational efficiency of 98.9%, reduces emissions to 68.4 ppm, and minimizes energy cost to 1502 cents, effectively enhancing energy allocation accuracy and improving system reliability in MG systems integrated with RESs, HESS, and EVs."

To this end, emergency organizations need to collaborate to accomplish missions that exceed the capacity of any single organization. Typically, an emergency disposal is structured as a set of collaborative processes, referred to as cross-organization emergency response processes (CERPs). To deliver better emergency services, the initial step is to construct a high-quality CERP model. This paper introduces a top-down CERP model construction approach to tackle one of the most challenging issues in this area: How to construct a CERP model such that each organization can design, change, and modify their own processes without disturbing the overall collaboration and correctness of CERP. The proposed top-down CERP model construction approach involves the following stages: 1) Cross-organization public process model construction; 2) Intra-organization public process model generation; 3) Behavior-preserving intra-organization private process model construction; and 4) Organization-specific CERP model construction. A case study on cross-organization fire emergency response is conducted to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach."

    "abstract": "New possibilities for real-time operator health and safety monitoring have emerged with the incorporation of wearable technologies into industrial settings. Industries that deal with high levels of stress, physiological instability, and weariness must implement continuous wellness assessments to ensure the safety and efficiency of their workers. When it comes to multimodal wearable data, however, traditional monitoring methods that rely on threshold-based metrics or human supervision often miss subtle, nonlinear trends. With these restrictions, it is more difficult to identify signs of wellness decline early, which delays care and increases dangers in the workplace. The new framework, Sparse Autoencoder-based Wellness Monitoring of Industrial Operators using Multi-modal Data (SAWIM), is designed to fill this need. Wearable data such as skin temperature, heart rate variability, and accelerometer readings are compressed and learned by SAWIM using sparse autoencoder neural networks. Anomalies are detected with high sensitivity and a low number of false alarms by SAWIM through the modeling of individual baseline health profiles. Through experimental assessment on a simulated industrial dataset, SAWIM outperforms traditional PCA and thresholding approaches in anomaly identification, while also enhancing recall and accuracy in recognizing signs of stress and fatigue. Finally, SAWIM offers a data-driven, efficient method for proactively monitoring operators' well-being, enabling more robust and secure industrial operations."

This system aims to provide a reproducible, scalable virtual inspection verification platform. Utilizing Unity as the execution engine, it constructs realistic 3D room environments and equipment models. Built-in NavMesh/Agent technology handles path optimization and obstacle avoidance, while a UI panel enables visual display of equipment status and historical path playback. Python serves as the control terminal for task scheduling and data processing. Both components establish bidirectional communication via TCP Socket, forming a closed-loop process: \"command issuance → navigation execution → status collection → result display → data export.\" Communication and execution performance were evaluated in a loopback network environment: end-to-end transmission latency remained stable below 20 ms (minimum 0.69 ms), while internal response time from command issuance to execution in Unity was controlled within 1 s. Results demonstrate the system’s engineering characteristics of low cost, scalability, and robust real-time performance, providing effective support for intelligent server room inspection research and implementation."

    "abstract": "The intricate architecture of the Central Nervous System (CNS) underscores its pivotal role in sensory and motor function, with the brain's diverse regions—cerebellum, brainstem, and cerebrum—each contributing uniquely to cognitive and physiological processes. This comparative study delves into the critical challenges of brain tumor and ischemic stroke segmentation, emphasizing the necessity for precise imaging techniques, particularly MRI, in diagnosing and treating these conditions. We explore the evolution of segmentation methodologies, from traditional active contour models to cutting-edge quantum machine learning (QML) approaches, highlighting their respective strengths and limitations. Our analysis reveals significant advancements in segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency, particularly through hybrid quantum-classical frameworks that leverage the power of Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs) and advanced deep learning techniques. By synthesizing findings from recent literature, we demonstrate how these innovative algorithms not only enhance diagnostic precision but also pave the way for personalized treatment strategies. This study ultimately advocates for the integration of quantum computing in medical imaging, positing that such advancements could revolutionize brain tumor management and improve patient outcomes. Future research directions are proposed to optimize these models for broader clinical applicability, ensuring robust performance across diverse imaging datasets and real-world scenarios."

Recent works (2020-2025) have applied machine learning (ML) and large language models (LLMs) to predict and rank the risk of vulnerabilities based on features such as CVSS metrics, exploit presence, context and natural language descriptions. This review surveys supervised, unsupervised, and hybrid ML approaches-including neural networks, ensemble classifiers, graph-based models-and LLM-based NLP methods. We examine various model types (e.g. Random Forest, XGBoost, CNN, DistilBERT), data sources (NVD/CVE descriptions, exploit databases, OSINT, telemetry), evaluation metrics (accuracy, F1-score, MSE), and quantitative results. Performance trends indicate ML can improve on CVSS baselines (e.g. <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\boldsymbol{\\sim} \\mathbf{8 3 \\%}$</tex> accuracy), whereas LLMs require domain adaptation to perform well.

    "abstract": "South Africa's energy crisis persists despite significant renewable energy integration, with grid constraints emerging as a critical bottleneck. This study addresses the challenge by proposing a deterministic framework for generation capacity expansion planning under transmission constraints for networks with limited grid upgrades. This is achieved through the application of deterministic hosting capacity analysis to generation expansion planning. The transmission constraints considered for the study are transmission line thermal limits and transformer thermal limits. The framework calculates the generation capacity margin at each bus and iteratively adds a fixed percentage of generation capacity until the transmission constraints are exceeded or violated. This framework is applied to a case study of the Western Cape transmission network and implemented using a linear load flow analysis in PyPSA. Results indicate that a 20% increase in maximum generation capacity at each bus in the network results in line overloading. The proposed framework offers a computationally efficient and scalable approach to generation expansion planning enabling planners to assess congestion and overloading thresholds without relying on computationally intensive generation expansion planning methods."

The devices exhibit an electrical signature of short-circuit failure after repetitive discharge. Firstly, no discernible morphological anomalies and significant voids in the devices are observed by non-destructive X-ray and scanning acoustic microscope (SAM) analysis, respectively. It indicates that repetitive discharge does not induce damage at the package level and failure originates primarily at the chip level. The devices are then mechanically decapsulated and chemically stripped of the silicone-gel encapsulant, after which lock-in infrared thermography is used to rapidly pinpoint internal failure sites. Subsequent scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is employed to precisely locate the failure region. Results show that, the burn-out site is situated far from the gate pad. It originates at the edge of the anode-cell termination, with damage extending between the gate and anode. The primary cause is likely excessive gate current within the die or a defective dielectric layer between the anode and gate. This study provides valuable insights for further optimization of SiC GTO design, enhancing discharge capability and system reliability."

Deep learning relies on deep neural networks (DNNs), which run efficiently on NoCs due to their scalability, parallelism and power efficiency. However, DNNs mix global (fully-connected) and local (convolutional) communication patterns. Therefore, computations for different DNN layers must be mapped to mitigate communication bottlenecks within the NoC. Traditional heuristic-based approaches often struggle with scalability and adaptability. This paper presents a neural network (NN)-based framework that learns to map DNN neurons onto NoC cores by optimizing load distribution and communication efficiency. We also adapted and implemented three mapping heuristics, simulated annealing (SA), genetic algorithm (GA), and dragonfly algorithm (DA), and compared their performance to that of our NN-based mapper. Simulations of mapping DNNs trained on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST show that our NN-based mapper balances per-core load (by up to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$6.5 \\times$</tex>) and minimizes communication cost, yielding up to 17.1 % higher overall performance, 9.7 % lower latency, 16.8 % greater throughput, and 5.2 % energy savings compared to SA, GA, and DA, while providing fast mapping solutions (up to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$13,000 \\times$</tex> faster)."

We characterize the SoC's MPAM capabilities and experimentally assess cache portion partitioning and proportional stride memory bandwidth partitioning under controlled interference. Our results show that enabling MPAM features can reduce interference, but their behavior often diverges from expectations based on the specification, with anomalous effects observed across workloads and cores. These findings highlight both the promise of predictability from MPAM for real-time systems and the current challenges arising from optionality, heterogeneity, and limited documentation.

The DUV-LED reported by Khan et al., with an emission wavelength of 254 nm, serves as the reference device. The performance of DUV LEDs employing rectangular EBL and CS EBL was simulated by APSYS software. The results show that the CS EBL effectively suppresses electron leakage in the p-type region and enhances carrier injection efficiency. At an injection current of 75 mA, the IQE and output power are increased to 16.9% and 4.0 mW, respectively.

This paper introduces an intelligent gas monitoring system using the MQ-6 semiconductor sensor with an ESP32 microcontroller, integrated with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based deep learning model. Time-series sensor data is continuously collected and preprocessed using normalization and sliding-window segmentation methods. The trained LSTM model captures temporal variations in the data to provide early and precise predictions of potential leaks. Once a leak is identified, automated safety measures such as solenoid valve closure, power disconnection, and audible alarms are triggered to minimize risks. Furthermore, sensor readings and prediction results are uploaded in real time to a Firebase cloud platform, ensuring remote supervision, data storage, and instant notifications. Experimental evaluations show that the proposed system outperforms conventional threshold-based methods, offering higher sensitivity and reliability. The integration of artificial intelligence with Internet of Things (IoT) technology highlights a scalable and proactive solution for advanced gas safety management."

    "abstract": "Solving constrained multiobjective optimization problems (CMOPs) is a highly challenging work. Numerous complex nonlinear constraints significantly add to the complexity of CMOPs, resulting in an exceptionally intricate feasible region. Makes it difficult for the algorithm to search for the complete constraint PF. In addition, under the influence of multiple complex nonlinear constraints, the conventional calculation method of overall constraint violation is inefficient for assessing the quality of infeasible solutions, potentially misguiding the evolutionary direction of the population. In response to these challenges, this paper proposes the fuzzy constraint dominance strategy (FCDS). This novel approach facilitates nuanced comparisons of solutions to strike a better balance between objectives and constraints. The fuzzy constraint violation introduced in FCDS mitigates the misleading impact of complex nonlinear constraints. Moreover, FCDS divides the solution process of complex CMOP into multiple stages from easy to difficult, and uses adaptive methods to increase the difficulty level of the problem. Systematic experiments on four test suites and three real-world applications have conclusively demonstrated the superior competitiveness of FCDS against leading algorithms."

Classical multi-agent planners rely on globally consistent maps or communication. Local BEV pipelines depend on tightly registered perception stacks. End-to-end vision models can be brittle across scene changes. While 3D LiDAR offers geometry that transfers well, its high dimensionality and occlusions complicate real-time, multi-agent control without messaging. We propose an end-to-end mapless, communication-free navigator that consumes a single onboard 3D LiDAR scan and outputs discrete actions for decentralized execution. The approach introduces a dual-channel LiDAR projection that preserves near-field free space while aligning goal guidance. A graph-attention interaction head infers neighbors’ motion tendencies from local observations only, which guides different coordination strategies for pedestrians and vehicles. A structure-aware dense reward stabilizes learning around occlusion-prone layouts (e.g., long walls, U-shaped bays).

    "abstract": "Traffic trajectory prediction plays a crucial role in ensuring the safety and efficiency of autonomous driving systems. With increasing traffic complexity, accurate and real-time prediction of surrounding vehicle trajectories has become a major challenge. Existing methods often define trajectory prediction as a static task, predicting future trajectories at once based solely on historical states. However, this approach leads to significant long-term prediction errors and struggles to capture potential hazards in complex, dynamic traffic conditions. In this paper, we propose a lightweight end-to-end trajectory prediction model integrating a long-term guidance module and a short-term feedback mechanism. The long-term guidance module predicts the final driving goal that remains unchanged over time, guiding the vehicle’s eventual position. The short-term feedback mechanism captures the dynamic driving environment, continuously updating the model with immediate changes in vehicle interactions and road conditions to avoid unexpected dangers. At each time step, our approach leverages accumulated historical information and incorporates both short-term and long-term future information to iteratively predict multi-modal trajectories, effectively reducing long-term prediction errors. Additionally, our method introduces the Mamba module, which enhances real-time prediction performance and reduces historical information loss during long-term prediction. Experiments on the Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets show that our method, with fewer parameters and higher inference speed, achieves results comparable to or surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods."

    "abstract": "Data stream processing is a functionality of various AI applications to obtain continuous insights from data streams. Serverless edge computing (SEC) is a key solution for implementing data stream processing requests by deploying serverless functions into cloudlets. However, existing data stream processing methods focus more on processing delay, ignoring fault tolerance and complex dependencies among functions, resulting in critical events being missed in the event of any fault and processing inefficiency. Besides, due to the uncertainty of data streams, existing function deployment methods may not be suitable for their newly changed data rates, causing resource waste or shortages. To address these problems, we first propose an optimization framework to enable efficient and fault tolerant function deployment, such that the delay of data stream processing is minimized while meeting its fault tolerant requirements and resource capacity constraints of cloudlets in an SEC network. We then design an online learning algorithm that predicts data rate changes through a multi-timescale machine learning method and proactively adjusts instance locations and numbers to absorb data rate uncertainty. Experimental results in a real test-bed show that our proposed algorithms outperform their counterparts by 13.5% on the average delay and 26.3% on the average fault tolerance."

    "abstract": "Online parameter identification is essential for underwater wireless power transfer (UWPT) systems to ensure charging stability and high efficiency. However, strong conductivity, harmonic interference, and parameter deviations pose huge challenges for traditional parameter identification methods that rely entirely on circuit models. Data-driven methods are an effective method to solve this problem, while a large amount of on-site data and long computation time are necessary for high-accuracy, which limits its versatility. To overcome this limitation, this letter proposes a transfer learning (TL)-driven online joint parameter identification method with a small amount of experimental data and fast computation speed for UWPT systems. Firstly, a source domain model (SDM) is pre-trained on augmented air-domain data. Then, a target domain model (TDM) is obtained by fine-tuning with limited seawater samples, enabling joint identification of mutual inductance and load resistance while reducing underwater testing effort. A 1 kW UWPT prototype was built to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed framework provides fast, accurate, and practical parameter identification under seawater conditions. The framework achieves 0.12 ms estimation latency and errors below 5% with 109 samples."

We present DeTrAck, a non-invasive UAV monitoring system designed for embedded platforms that couples a YOLO11-based detector with an in-loop validation convolutional neural network (VaL_CNN) and DeepSORT tracking, while issuing pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) commands via ONVIF to maintain target on-sight. We curated a custom dataset comprising both visible spectrum and infrared imagery. Across recorded sequences, the proposed ensemble reduces false positives, enables lower detection thresholds, and sustains continuous tracking. In a 3,647-frame sequence, it preserved target identity without loss, achieving competitive detection performance (≈ mAP@50 78%) at near real-time throughput (≈10% FPS reduction versus baseline). An ablation study across YOLO11 variants shows that the YOLO11s + VaL_CNN configuration provides the best precision–speed trade-off, resulting in an over 4% increase in true positives and a 2.6 times inference processing reduction in false positives compared to the baseline detector even for very small targets 1:2500. DeTrAck supports multi-target and multi-camera operation via RTSP/ONVIF integration, making it suitable for practical surveillance deployments on portable ground-air observation points."

    "abstract": "This paper studies the problem of integrated optical camera communication and scene sensing. Due to the tight coupling between background images and stripe information in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) encoded images, existing methods cannot simultaneously achieve high-quality optical signal decoding for LED-to-camera communication and background image reconstruction for scene sensing. To address this challenge, this paper analyzes the adversarial characteristics between stripe information and background images, and proposes GANOCCAS, a generative adversarial learning framework tailored for integrated optical camera communication and scene sensing that effectively resolves mutual interference between stripes and background content. First, we design a generator using a CondConv-based 4-layer U-NET architecture with SimAM modules on the last three residual layers and CondConv+PixelShuffle combinations as upsampling layers. Second, we develop a discriminator that combines multi-scale convolutional networks, pooling layers, and residual networks to output stripe sequences for optical signal decoding. Third, by leveraging pixel loss, multi-scale structural similarity loss, and adversarial loss, we ensure that the generator outputs clean background images suitable for scene sensing while the discriminator decodes optical signals for communication in complex environments. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that GANOCCAS effectively reduces communication interference from background images and accurately reconstructs stripe-free background images across various SNR scenarios, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods in both reflected OCC and scene sensing tasks."

    "abstract": "Multilayer REBCO-coated conductor (CC) tapes undergo various stresses and strains when utilized in superconducting devices such as high-field magnets and coils. The stresses encountered by REBCO tapes include radial transverse tensile stresses from Lorenz forces and thermal stresses arising from differences in the thermal expansion coefficients of the constituent layers during quenching. These stresses can cause delamination at multiple interfaces within the REBCO CC tape's multilayer architecture, compromising its integrity and leading to catastrophic failure of the superconducting device. Meanwhile, the Cu stabilizer surrounding the CC tape plays a key role in preventing delamination failure by binding multiple constituent layers with different mechanical properties and maintaining structural stability against transverse external forces. However, the effect of slit edges created during the CC tape manufacturing process on delamination resistance under transverse loading is still unclear. To address this critical research gap, we conducted comprehensive delamination tests using the anvil method. We compared the effects of the slit edge geometry and the Cu layer at the edges on the mechanical delamination strength of REBCO CC tapes. By conducting a comprehensive analysis, we aimed to examine the roles of edge geometry and interfacial properties in the delamination behavior of REBCO CC tapes. This will offer valuable insights for optimizing the design and fabrication of these high-field coils, contributing to the development of more robust and reliable superconducting devices."

    "abstract": "In recent years, the application of nanocrystalline materials in wireless power transfer systems has been continuously investigated. However, due to their significantly higher conductivity characteristics than ferrite, they can trigger additional eddy current losses and attenuate the transmission efficiency of the system. This article presents a novel diagonal-laminated Fe-based nanocrystalline magnetic structure, which significantly reduces the additional eddy current loss of typical flat-laminated nanocrystalline structures and possesses excellent shielding effects. The modeling and analytical calculations of magnetic shielding energy efficiency and eddy current losses are performed and discussed in conjunction with magnetic reluctance modeling and finite element simulations. The superiority of the proposed core structure is verified by comparative experiments with five different magnetic pads prototypes of wireless power transfer couplers. Results show that the shielding effect is almost comparable to that of the ferrite pads when transmitting 3 kW power. The system efficiency is higher than 93.4%. Specifically, compared with the ferrite pads, the proposed structure reduces the core weight and volume by about 15.1% and 31.9%, respectively, realizing the lightweight design and efficient operation of the system."

Four representative slot/pole number combinations, i.e., 10p9s, 8p9s, 10p12s, and 14p12s, are studied. The discrete radial force couple model, commonly used for stator analysis, is extended into a continuous formulation to capture the relationship between tangential force and its resultant radial vibration. Furthermore, the study highlights how phase relationships, both between radial and tangential forces and between low- and high-order harmonics, can lead to either amplification or suppression of vibrations. Additionally, the influence of geometric parameters, including pole arc ratio and stator tooth-tip arc ratio, on force amplitude and phase is thoroughly explored. The results reveal that, with a fixed slot number, a higher pole count tends to induce stronger vibration due to the reinforcement between the radial force modulated from radial force harmonics and the equivalent radial force from tangential force harmonics. Moreover, a contrasting pattern is observed that high-order forces intensify low-order components in 9-slot machines but suppress them in 12-slot machines."

    "abstract": "Drug combination therapy for complex diseases is currently widely utilized in clinical treatment. An increasing number of computational methods are being adopted to discover new drug combinations. However, most existing methods mainly focus on phenotypes, while ignoring the deep level interactions between drug pairs and cell lines. In this paper, we introduce a multimodal hypergraph representation learning approach named MHGSynergy, aimed at predicting drug synergies. MHGSynergy models the synergistic relationship as a hypergraph by considering the structure, targets, and physicochemical features of drugs. The nodes represent drugs and cell lines, and hyperedges capture synergistic triplets of drug pairs and cell lines. Different drug features are used as attributes of drug nodes in the hypergraph to construct three hypergraphs. Hypergraph neural networks are employed to update embedding features of drugs and cell lines, then input these embedding features into the channel attention comprehensive fusion module to obtain a representation. Finally, these representations are used to build predictive models. In both classification and regression tasks, MHGSynergy performs well on two benchmark datasets, and outperforming those baseline methods, and MHGSynergy has unique advantages when facing unknown drug pairs or cell lines. We believe that MHGSynergy is a valuable tool for discovering synergistic drug combinations. The implementation of this method is available at https://github.com/ZhangZ33/MHGSynergy."

    "abstract": "Motorcycle accidents remain a major public safety concern, with the absence of helmets being one of the primary causes of serious injuries and fatalities. Traditional methods of enforcing helmet laws often rely on manual observation or reviewing CCTV footage, which is both time-consuming and prone to human error. This work introduces an automated system that detects motorcyclists not wearing helmets and identifies their license plate numbers using advanced computer vision and text recognition techniques. The solution employs the YOLOv8 deep learning model to detect helmet usage and locate motorcycle license plates from uploaded images. When a helmet violation is detected, the corresponding license plate is cropped and processed using Paddle OCR, which extracts the alphanumeric details after applying preprocessing steps such as noise reduction, grayscale conversion, and contrast enhancement. The system is implemented in Python with a Stream-lit based interface for ease of use and clear result visualization. It can handle multiple riders in a single image with high accuracy, reducing the need for manual surveillance. This approach can be integrated into existing traffic monitoring infrastructure for real-time or offline analysis, ultimatelyassisting authorities in improvinghelmet law compliance and enhancing road safety."

When compared to traditional systems, the system's innovative adaptive threshold algorithms, sensor fusion methods, and predictive analytics capabilities greatly increase detection accuracy and lower false alarm rates. In addition to a DHT11 sensor [13][15] for monitoring ambient temperature and humidity, the system incorporates several specialized sensors, such as MQ-5, MQ-9, and MQ-135 gas sensors [10][18] for detecting dangerous gases like liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), carbon monoxide (CO), methane, ammonia, benzene, and smoke particles [9]. The use of a dynamic calibration algorithm, which improves measurement accuracy by 23% over static calibration techniques by compensating for environmental changes and sensor drift in real-time, is a significant advance. The major processing unit is the ESP32 microcontroller [11], which uses its dual-core architecture and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{2 4 0 M H z}$</tex> operating speed together with builtin Wi-Fi and Bluetooth to provide smooth data processing, collection, and the creation of predictive alerts. With response times averaging 18 seconds (65% faster than commercial alternatives), detection accuracy of 95.2%, and false alarm rates decreased to 2.1% from 8.3% in traditional systems across a variety of operating environments, comprehensive performance evaluation shows superior system effectiveness [14]. This system is affordable for residential, commercial, and industrial applications because it uses easily accessible components and reduces costs by 78% when compared to comparable commercial solutions while keeping better performance metrics [8][23]."

The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can balance path length and energy consumption effectively compared with the single distance optimization path planning method.

The conventional methods of treating livestock, such as applying tick grease and manually spraying, are frequently labor-intensive, inconsistent, and inefficient at guaranteeing full-body coverage. An Arduino Nano microcontroller was used to create a prototype that automated the spraying mechanism in order to address these issues. The system incorporates a solar-powered pump for the dispersion of an antiparasitic solution, servo motors for gate control, a capacitive sensor for dip level monitoring, and ultrasonic sensors for animal detection. This paper presents the system's technical development and performance analysis, as well as a comprehensive future roadmap that includes integrating animal weight sensors for customized treatment, upgrading to an ESP32 microcontroller for wireless connectivity, and enabling real-time cloud data logging and mobile application interfacing. The system will become an allinclusive smart livestock management solution that is appropriate for smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa with these future enhancements."

    "abstract": "Achieving stable and efficient p-type conductivity is a key challenge for advancing the application of wide-bandgap hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) in electronic and optoelectronic devices. However, the high B-N bond energy and oxygen diffusion from the substrate generally limit the incorporation and activation efficiency of Mg, thereby restricting the attainable hole concentration and hindering device development. In this work, we propose a triethylboron (TEB) pretreatment strategy based on metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). By introducing TEB pre-paving on sapphire substrates, in-situ Mg doping is realized during the epitaxial growth of h-BN. This approach not only effectively suppresses oxygen diffusion from the sapphire substrate but also enhances Mg incorporation and activation efficiency in h-BN. Experimental results demonstrate that the h-BN films subjected to TEB pre-treatment exhibit significantly improved conductivity, with Hall effect measurements confirming p-type conduction. Moreover, the hole concentration is increased by an order of magnitude compared with untreated samples. Importantly, this method achieves remarkable enhancement in p-type conductivity without introducing additional complexity to the epitaxial process. These results indicate that the TEB pre-treatment strategy provides an effective pathway to overcoming the doping bottleneck in h-BN and enables its integration into next-generation wide-bandgap semiconductor devices."

However, ensuring their long-term stability under combined conditions of air exposure, high temperature, and high light intensity remains a critical challenge. This study investigates the impact of heat and light on the performance and degradation of Qc-LEDs, aiming to guide the development of thermal- and photo-stable QDs for high-power Qc-LED applications. Steady-state and hightemperature transient photoluminescence measurements were utilized to examine the exciton dynamics and the surface reaction mechanisms of QDs under harsh conditions, focusing on how exciton dynamics influence the degradation mechanism and kinetics. Light-induced photodegradation accelerates when excitons migrate to the surface, a process that is primarily governed by the heterostructure of the QDs and the surface energy states. A well-designed QD structure, with enhanced heat dissipation and higher surface energy levels, can better withstand high light power densities. To address these challenges, we developed a series of CdSe and perovskite-based green and red emitting core-shell QDs with multiple surface modifications and protective encapsulation layers. These modifications significantly enhance the longterm stability of the QDs under both high-temperature and high-light density conditions. The thermally stable QDs, incorporating proper surface anion passivation, demonstrated superior resistance to both heat and light-induced degradation, retaining over 90% of their initial luminance after 500 hours of operation at $150^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. This study provides valuable insights into the design of robust Qc-LEDs for commercial lighting, display technologies, and other optoelectronic applications where thermal and optical stability is crucial."

    "abstract": "Community detection and influential node identification are fundamental tasks in social network analysis. While communities reveal densely connected subgraphs, influential nodes are those that impact connectivity, flow, or structure the most. This paper bridges both concepts through a unified framework.Node-Influence and community identification approaches capture complementary aspects of network structure: the latter ranks nodes according to their structural relevance, while the former reveals coherent subgraphs. We study effective community-detection techniques, Label Propagation, with three traditional influence metrics: MDS (Minimum Dominating Set), Articulation-Point Centrality, K-Core Number, and Local Clustering Coefficient. To overcome their unique biases and build on their strengths, we provide the LACM-Score (Local Articulation-Core-Mds Score), a geometric-mean composite centrality that strikes a compromise between core embeddedness, global connectivity criticality, and local cohesiveness. We illustrate each method’s behaviour by extensive dry runs on several toy graphs, and we show that LACM-Score reliably finds truly influential nodes across a variety of topologies, beating any one metric alone."

    "abstract": "Vector-Matrix Multiplication (VMM) is the fundamental and frequently required computation in inference of Neural Networks (NN). Due to the large data movement required during inference, VMM can benefit greatly from in-memory computing. However, ADC/DACs required for in-memory VMM consume significant power and area. ‘Distributed Arithmetic (DA)’, a technique in computer architecture prevalent in 1980s was used to achieve inner product or dot product of two vectors without using a hard-wired multiplier when one of the vectors is a constant. In this work, we extend the DA technique to multiply an input vector with a constant matrix. By storing the sum of the weights in memory, DA achieves VMM using shift-and-add circuits in the periphery of ReRAM memory. We verify functional and also estimate non-functional properties (latency, energy, area) by performing transistor-level simulations. Using energy-efficient sensing and fine grained pipelining, our approach achieves <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$4.5 \\times$</tex> less latency and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$12 \\times$</tex> less energy than VMM performed in memory conventionally by bit slicing. Furthermore, DA completely eliminated the need for power-hungry ADCs which are the main source of area and energy consumption in the current VMM implementations in memory."

This method is mainly preferred for estimating PMDC motor parameters in applications like wheelchairs due to its faster convergence and less error rates. Specifically, the ABC algorithm demonstrates angular speed and armature current errors that are smaller than those produced by conventional experimental techniques, with values of 5.5607 and 1.03485, respectively."

These tasks often require fast and continuous processing across multiple stages, which makes the scheduling process more complex. In order to address the problem more effectively, we model it as a Distributed Flow Shop Scheduling Problem (DFSSP) with no-wait constraints, where each task must be executed without delays between stages. The objective is to minimize the maximum tardiness, which represents the longest delay of any task beyond its due date. Because the problem is NP-hard, exact methods are not suitable for large instances. To solve it efficiently, we propose three metaheuristic approaches: Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS), a populationbased Iterated Local Search (ILS), and Iterated Greedy with Simulated Annealing (IGSA). Experimental results on benchmark instances prove the effectiveness of our approaches in reducing maximum tardiness while maintaining low computation time."

    "abstract": "The shared and open-access nature of wireless technologies makes wireless networks susceptible to interference, such as jamming, that could lead to delays in communication and result in delays with corresponding timely information updates. Such delays in information updates can be crucial when an operator controls mobile objects since their untimely updates might lead to drastic consequences. Specifically, we consider an operator communicating with drones performing a joint mission in a protected zone. The protector (jammer) employs a spherical jamming signal to jam the communication of the operator with the drones to fail their joint mission. To design an anti-jamming strategy in such a scenario involving agents (the operator and the jammer), with different objectives, game theory is employed. Traditionally, in such a background, the anti-jamming strategy aims to minimize the total information freshness reflected by the total delay in information update. A con of such a traditional approach is that, due to limited resources, the operator might have to sacrifice the delay in information update for some drones to minimize the total delay. This could fail the joint drone mission since some drones might follow outdated commands. In this paper, motivated by this observation, we suggest using the guaranteed information freshness metric as a cost function for the operator. Under this metric, we specify the maximal time passed since the last data update for each of the drones. An anti-jamming strategy is derived, and its advantage in comparison with the minimizing total information freshness strategy is illustrated."

    "abstract": "Facial expressions, as the core carrier of nonverbal communication, can unconsciously or consciously reflect individual emotional changes and transmit multidimensional emotional signals in an instant. In the field of emotional computing, the precise spotting of micro expressions and macro expressions constitutes a key prerequisite step, with the core goal of automatically identifying the start and end time points of expressions from the original video stream, defining their duration range, and completing the classification of micro expressions and macro expressions, thus laying the data foundation for subsequent emotional state analysis and interactive applications. However, this task still faces significant technical bottlenecks: firstly, the non autonomous nature of micro expressions makes it difficult and costly to obtain their natural data; Secondly, its instantaneous nature (usually lasting 0.04-0.2 seconds) and low amplitude muscle movement characteristics not only impose strict requirements on the accuracy of manual annotation, but also directly increase the difficulty and cost of data annotation; In addition, complex lighting conditions, changes in head posture, and non-rigid facial movements can significantly reduce the model’s ability to perceive subtle facial expression changes, ultimately leading to a decrease in spotting accuracy. These challenges severely constrain the practical application of facial expression analysis technology in real-time interactive scenarios. In response to the challenges of micro expression recognition and spotting, this paper proposes a three branch micro expression spotting network based on spatiotemporal feature fusion (TFMSN). Using a fixed frame rate of micro expression intervals as pseudo labels to re label micro expression data and screen for effective apex frames. Based on the temporal characteristics of micro-expressions, a dual branch I3D network is first used to extract spatial and optical flow features of image sequences and optical flow sequences. After fusion, an LSTM network is used to enhance long-term dependency information association; In response to the subtle local changes in micro expressions, the last frame of the image sequence is used as the set peak frame input to the Swin Transformer for enhanced spatial feature representation. Finally, long short-term spatiotemporal features and global fine-grained features are fused to output the apex frame spotting result. The metric validation on the CAS (ME)<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> and SAMM datasets shows that the F1 metrics for the spotting accuracy of this method are 0.4743 and 0.4679, respectively, which are higher than other expression localization algorithms and improve the spotting ability of micro expressions."

    "abstract": "For medium- and high-voltage applications, modular multilevel converters (MMCs) have become the topology of choice due to their modularity, scalability, and overall superior harmonic performance. However, the typical Model Predictive Control (MPC) approaches can poorly control MMCs due to the intricate characteristics in their multi-variable dynamics, especially while load conditions are quickly changing. Additionally, these approaches often have inaccurate models in real-time applications with a higher computational burden. This research proposes an AI-assisted MPC paradigm that enhances performance for prediction and control of an MMC within dynamic environments, to overcome these limitations. The central contribution is the addition of a prediction model based on a neural network to the MPC loop. Since it is a neural network, it has the power to predict the states of the system accurately and in real-time, while also having less computational latency because it can be trained structure-offline with large populations of MMC operational scenarios. This prediction model assists the MPC in generating the optimal control signals to minimize a cost function considering switching losses, arm current deviations, and capacitor voltage imbalance. A comprehensive MMC model is developed and implemented in a Hardware-in-theLoop (HIL) simulation set-up using the OPAL-RT real-time simulator. The proposed control framework was evaluated in multiple situations including sudden load shifts and faults. The AI-assisted MPC was found to: better dynamic response time 30%, reduce total harmonic distortion (THD) from 6.2 % to 3.4% and keep the capacitor voltage balancing within a 5% tolerance based on comparative analyses. The results show that the real-time operation performance and robustness of MMC operation is significantly improved when AI prediction is integrated in the MPC scheme. This study sets the stage for implementing intelligent predictive control in future highvoltage direct current (HVDC) and smart grid systems."

The architecture emphasizes a clean separation of perception, transport, and actuation, and adopts IEEE-aligned practices (requirements specification, software testing, environmental considerations). We discuss limitations (lighting, lack of haptics, Wi-Fi variability), safety measures, and future work, and outline integration under study with a digital-health platform to enable secure tele-mentoring and training."

    "abstract": "A hysteresis current control strategy is proposed in this paper to address the complexities of bidirectional power control and efficiency limitations in single-phase AC/DC converters. The junction capacitance of Gallium-Nitride (GaN) transistor and the resonance of power inductors are utilized in this strategy to achieve zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) of power switches. Controlling the peak values of the forward and reverse currents of the hysteresis current enables the converter to achieve full-range ZVS in triangular current mode (TCM). The totem-pole AC/DC converter achieves ZVS and functions as a rectifier with power factor correction capability when using the proposed control strategy. It can also operate in inversion mode to feed energy back into the grid. A SIMPLIS simulation model was built to validate the rationale behind the parameter design and verify the effectiveness of the control method in both rectification and inversion modes."

    "abstract": "The most prominent technology is the grid-forming inverter (GFMI) concept. This technology enables the full potential of renewable energy to be harnessed, forming an electrical grid without relying on traditional generators. However, a significant challenge lies in the efficiency of its control systems. Conventional PI control methods often result in suboptimal power efficiency when integrating renewable energy, especially under fluctuating power conditions, making them less suitable for standalone renewable systems. To address this issue, this paper introduces a dual-loop model predictive control (DMPC) strategy, explicitly divided into voltage and current control loops to simplify control, enhance stability, and improve overall performance. This approach allows the system to deliver power more accurately to the desired set-points, significantly reducing overshoot and accelerating recovery times in transient responses. Test results demonstrate that DMPC outperforms conventional PI control in both transient and steady-state performance, achieving stable voltage, current, and frequency regulation. Additionally, the proposed method was evaluated under fault conditions, islanding mode, and load shedding, clearly illustrating its superior performance across various challenging scenarios."

This paper presents a comprehensive design and evaluation of dot-product units (DPUs) and outer-product units (OPUs) implemented on an FPGA device, targeting multiply-and-accumulate (MAC)-dominated workloads in CNNs. We investigate the trade-offs between inference time, energy consumption, hardware resource utilization, and the energy-delay product (EDP) across a range of vector sizes, array configurations, and clock frequencies. Our evaluation reveals that DPU architectures offer superior EDP performance through pipelining and efficient scaling with vector size. Furthermore, we show that model architecture, such as switching from VGG19 to ResNet-18, significantly impacts energy efficiency. Specifically, we provide a systematic comparison of DPU and OPU architectures under various parallelism and clock configurations in terms of latency, energy, and EDP. We also present realistic FPGA implementations using accurate power models to evaluate energy and resource efficiency. Finally, we quantify how CNN architecture design choices, particularly the use of ResNet-18 over VGG19, affect overall energy efficiency. These findings offer practical design guidelines for deploying AI accelerators in ultra-low-power environments by balancing architectural parallelism and hardware constraints."

A weighted clustering strategy integrating scale factors and peak prominence is designed to extract optimal peak positions from multi-scale candidate peaks, enhancing the accuracy of overlapping peak localization. A wavelet energy ratio model is constructed using both detail and approximation coefficients to enable the identification and dynamic removal of anomalous spikes. Simulation results demonstrate that the MSWC-PD method outperforms the conventional wavelet method in terms of peak identification completeness, false detection suppression, and robustness against spike interference, highlighting its strong robustness and practical applicability."

    "abstract": "In scheduling algorithms based on the Rate Monotonic method, tasks with shorter periods have higher priorities, whereas those with longer periods tend to suffer from increased response times and jitters. To address this issue, we previously proposed the Execution Right Delegation (ERD) scheduling algorithm, which introduces a high-priority server for privileged tasks. While our earlier work demonstrated the feasibility of ERD with a single privileged task on a small-scale multiprocessor system, the approach remained limited in scope. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of the ERD scheduling algorithm for multiprocessors. We extend the algorithm to support an arbitrary number of privileged tasks, up to the number of available processors, thereby generalizing the original framework. Furthermore, we conduct an extensive experimental evaluation on systems with up to 32 processors, examining response times, jitters, and schedulability under diverse workloads. The results show that the extended ERD algorithm improves the response times of privileged tasks compared with conventional partitioned Fixed-Task-Priority scheduling, while also revealing trade-offs in jitter characteristics."

    "abstract": "Small object detection in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery has become increasingly important in diverse applications such as precision agriculture, power line inspection, and search-and-rescue operations. Nevertheless, UAV images present substantial challenges including inadequate feature representation due to receptive field mismatch, difficulties in preserving edge information leading to poor target-background discrimination, and insufficient cross-scale feature fusion. To address these limitations, we propose FESA-DETR, an enhanced small object detection algorithm. First, we design the Contextual Adaptive Learning Block (CALBlock) feature extraction module, which integrates local contextual information with global feature representations through local contextual perception, adaptive attention mechanism, and feature gating unit, effectively improving the feature expression capability for small objects. Second, we introduce the Edge-enhanced Multiscale Information Transfer (EMIT) architecture, employing multiscale edge feature extraction and adaptive fusion to significantly enhance the model's perception of small object edge contours in complex backgrounds. Finally, we develop the Feature Selective Attention Feature Pyramid Network (FSAFPN), utilizing spatial dimension decomposition attention mechanisms and adaptive feature selection strategies to achieve efficient cross-scale feature integration and enhancement. Compared to the baseline RT-DETR-R18 model, FESA-DETR achieves improvements of 2.1%, 3.2%, and 1.6% in AP, AP50, and APs metrics respectively on the VisDrone2019 dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and significant advancement of our proposed method in UAV small object detection."

The study focuses on the resilience of these techniques when applied to images affected by a range of distortions, including both noise-induced degradation and geometric transformations. The experimental framework incorporates feature extraction and matching, followed by a quantitative similarity assessment using Hausdorff Distance Analysis to evaluate the correspondence between original and perturbed image sets. The noise models under consideration include Salt-and-Pepper, Speckle, and Gaussian noise, while the geometric transformations involve Rotation, Compression, and Translation, collectively referred to as RCT-based attacks. Results indicate that SURF demonstrates moderate robustness across most distortion types, providing a balanced trade-off between feature stability and discriminative capacity. BRISK exhibits higher sensitivity to Gaussian noise but maintains computational efficiency. In contrast, HOG effectively captures structural and edge-based characteristics, although its performance in feature matching under noise conditions is relatively constrained. The Hausdorff distance analysis further reveals that Gaussian noise results in the most significant degradation of feature matching accuracy, particularly affecting both SURF and BRISK descriptors."

Many systems focus on providing storage and retrieval functions; however, they very rarely provide strong mechanisms of verifying the ownership of reports considering the modern handicaps faced by data regarding compression and deliberately tampered files. Previous works on image steganography and data compression have generally dealt with generic security concerns while leaving a gap in addressing healthcare-sharing needs. This paper describes an advanced Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) based approach in terms of the enhancement of reliability and security in the verification of medical reports. Patient metadata are embedded in DCT low and mid-frequency coefficients of medical images such as X-rays or CT scans. It is ensured during lossy compression, using, for example, JPEG, that the data remains intact without degradation in image quality, thus protecting sensitive information from being disclosed while overcoming much of the limitations of existing techniques. This solution effortlessly connects with hospital systems to automate report verification and retrieval, cutting down on errors and giving patients greater peace of mind. It streamlines the secure and efficient management of medical records, meeting a crucial need in today's healthcare world."

Traditionally, this has relied on manual inspections, which are time-consuming and can be prone to errors. However, with the rise of machine learning and deep learning technologies, we now have the opportunity to automate this process, making it faster and more accurate. Despite their impressive performance, these models are often seen as “black boxes,” where the decision-making process is unclear, which makes it difficult for farmers and agronomists to trust them fully. We address this issue by introducing LIME, Captum, and Global Surrogate, methods that help make deep learning models more understandable. We tested several models, including VGG11, VGG16, ViT-Base-Patch16, InceptionV3, and a Custom CNN, using a variety of plant disease images. While models like InceptionV3 performed the best in terms of accuracy, the Custom CNN was able to match its performance while being more efficient in terms of computation. By visualizing which parts of the plant images were most important in making a diagnosis, we made the process much clearer and easier to understand. This study shows that not only can AI-driven tools be accurate, but they can also be transparent, providing farmers with both trustworthy predictions and a clear understanding of how those predictions are made."

    "abstract": "To obtain accurate results in numerical computation, high-precision arithmetic is a straightforward approach. However, most processors lack hardware support for floating-point formats beyond double precision (FP64). Double-word arithmetic (Dekker 1971) extends precision by using standard floating-point operations to represent numbers with twice the mantissa length. Building on this concept, various multi-word arithmetic methods have been proposed to further increase precision by combining additional words. Simplified variants, known as quasi algorithms, have also been introduced, trading a certain loss of accuracy for reduced computational cost. This study investigates the performance of quasi algorithms for double- and triple-word arithmetic in sparse iterative solvers based on the Conjugate Gradient method, comparing them with both non-quasi algorithms and standard FP64. We evaluate execution time on an x86 processor, iteration count to convergence, and solution accuracy. Although quasi algorithms require appropriate normalization to preserve accuracy - without it, convergence cannot be achieved - they can still reduce runtime when normalization is applied correctly, while maintaining accuracy comparable to full multi-word algorithms. In particular, quasi triple-word arithmetic yields more accurate solutions without significantly increasing execution time relative to double-word arithmetic and its quasi variant. Furthermore, for certain problems, a reduction in iteration count contributes to additional speedup. Thus, quasi triple-word arithmetic can serve as a compelling alternative to conventional double-word arithmetic in sparse iterative solvers."

This study examines a novel hybrid method that merges the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Long Short-Term Memory architecture (LSTM) networks using currently available meteorological information to improve solar output forecasting in Kerala, India. The ARIMA draws on historical solar data to extract linear patterns. The LSTM attempts to represent complex, non-linear relationships and temporality in the data. Moreover, currently available meteorological conditions are integrated into each instance of the forecast, such as temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, and wind speed, to incorporate the wider external factors associated with solar production for Kerala's tropical climate. The hybrid method was applied to actual data from five years, 2020-2025, on solar data from Kerala to yield a 42% reduction in Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) compared against both standalone ARIMA and LSTM methods. This work indicates the merit of hybrid models in combining currently available weather information to improve forecasting accuracy, leading to important considerations for the uptake of renewable energy sources in regions such as Kerala that face inconsistent climatic weather variability."

    "abstract": "In the Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) network, a wide range of network events (e.g., attacks, intrusions, violations, malicious route announcements) may occur. Network management requires real-time monitoring of untrusted and unreliable environments (e.g., unsafe components and devices). Early localization of abnormal links causing violations in the SRv6 network helps minimize the compensation required for service unavailability. However, the overhead of the state-of-the-art methods does not scale efficiently to large-scale SRv6 networks and exhibit poor robustness to addressing various disturbances from unreliable networks. To cope with these challenges, we propose Glint, an in-band network telemetry framework to localize abnormal links in SRv6 networks. The key idea of Glint is sampling part of the information while the overall information is known. Glint provides probabilistic in-band collection to gather segment-level telemetry data, reducing overhead and improving efficiency. Glint also proposes distributed verification-based detection to enhance the trustworthiness of security assessments, further improving robustness against disturbances. In addition, we design selective telemetry that reduces telemetry reports while preserving security-relevant visibility. Our evaluations demonstrate that, compared to the state-of-the-art frameworks, Glint significantly reduces header bandwidth overhead by 75.6% and memory overhead by 48.7% while reducing false positives. We also implement Glint on the Intel Tofino switch, achieving over a 50% reduction in hardware resource consumption compared to existing methods."

    "abstract": "This paper examines the interplay between the retailer's strategic information sharing and the manufacturer's quality decisions under two decision sequences: pre-quality and post-quality scenarios. We analyze the retailer's ex-post information sharing policy (deciding how to share the obtained demand information) under both sequences, discuss the impact of decision sequences on the quality level, and explore the preferences of supply chain participants for pre- and post-quality scenarios. The key findings are as follows: In the post-quality scenario, if consumers have high quality sensitivity, the retailer tends to share high-demand information but conceal low-demand information; otherwise, the result is just the opposite. Conversely, in the pre-quality scenario, the retailer consistently shares low-demand information but conceals high-demand information. Notably, whether in the pre-quality or post-quality scenario, an intriguing phenomenon may emerge, that is, the retailer may experience a counterintuitive increase in profit as the expected information cost rises. The outcomes of quality levels in pre- and post-quality scenarios depend on the information status obtained by the retailer and the consumers' quality sensitivity. Interestingly, the retailer consistently prefers the post-quality scenario, while the manufacturer may prefer the pre-quality scenario under certain conditions. Finally, our findings remain relatively robust when considering imperfect information acquisition or a general demand distribution."

However, when projected images overlap real objects, they distort the camera view, and detection accuracy drops for models like MediaPipe and YOLO. Moreover, a phenomenon known as ‘Visual Echo’, situation that system mistakes bright projected shapes as real objects, can occur. In addition, the projector-camera response is highly non-linear, which makes simple real-time correction difficult. To overcome these issues, we present a two-stage image preprocessing algorithm designed to suppress projection interference. Our method combines Color Refinement based on a Color Transformation Table and masked Lightness Compensation to effectively remove projection artifacts and enhance the visibility of physical objects. Experimental results show that the algorithm significantly reduces positional error by 70.47% and instability by 70.17% in MediaPipe hand landmark detection, while achieving 100% correct detection rate and reducing positional error by 86.32% in YOLOv8 object detection by effectively eliminating visual echoes. Furthermore, our algorithm maintains real-time performance at 27.4 FPS, making it suitable for practical applications. We successfully demonstrate the robust performance of our method through three distinct use cases: AR-based virtual ring try-on, dining etiquette education, and assembly training, highlighting its potential to enhance the reliability of projector-based AR systems across various fields."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel framework that integrates fluid antenna systems (FASs) with reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) to enhance the performance of multiuser multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) downlink systems. Unlike conventional approaches that assume continuous fluid antenna (FA) mobility and rely exclusively on passive reflective RISs, the proposed design addresses practical constraints by: (i) incorporating discrete FA positioning to accommodate hardware limitations; (ii) utilizing irregular RIS configurations with low-resolution phase shifts to enhance channel diversity; and (iii) deploying irregular, low-resolution simultaneous transmitting and reflecting RISs (STAR-RISs) to achieve full-space signal coverage. A unified optimization framework is developed to jointly design the transmit beamforming vectors, discrete FA positions, and RIS/STAR-RIS coefficients. The proposed solution combines regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoding with a probabilistic learning mechanism based on the cross-entropy optimization method. Simulation results reveal that the proposed architecture significantly outperforms conventional fixed-antenna systems and purely reflective RIS configurations, leading to substantial gains in sum-rate performance."

    "abstract": "The rising global population and rapid urbanization have increased the demand for food, with many people now living in apartments and leading busy lifestyles that limit their ability to grow plants. Indoor hydroponic cultivation has emerged as a promising solution, offering higher productivity and more efficient use of resources. However, growing and maintaining plants indoors can still be challenging. To address this, we designed and implemented a self-maintaining, IoT-enabled smart pot called “GrowSphere” for the indoor cultivation of peppermint, aimed at minimizing human intervention and optimizing growth conditions. The system architecture integrates an Arduino microcontroller with multiple sensors, and environmental data are continuously collected through pH, electrical conductivity, and water-level sensors. The system automatically regulates nutrient levels, water supply, and LED light spectra to maintain optimal growth conditions. In addition, GrowSphere supports remote monitoring, data analysis, and prediction of growth patterns. Compared to traditional soil and Deep Water Culture (DWC) hydroponic methods, the proposed approach demonstrates enhanced plant growth rates and yield quality, while reducing labor, water, and energy requirements. Plants grown in the GrowSphere achieved the highest fresh weight (11.0 ± 1.5 g), with some reaching up to 12.5 g. In contrast, DWC hydroponics (1.2±0.3 g) and soil cultivation (0.9±0.4 g) produced significantly lower weights. The proposed system was developed at a cost of approximately USD 268 and built using open-source software, offering a low-cost, sustainable, and high-performance solution for urban plant cultivation."

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising remains challenging due to the difficulty in recovering the complex structure in HSIs under the corruption of mixed-noise. Existing methods face two key limitations: 1) they ignore the underlying structural information, thus failing to preserve fine textures while smoothing the global structure, leading to the appearance of staircase artifacts or over-smoothing on spatial details; 2) the TV regularization overlooks the mixed differences of noise across three dimensions of HSI, thereby exacerbating the spectral over-smoothing and causing spectral distortion. To address these issues, we propose a structural information enhanced three-dimensional weighted correlated total variation (IE-TV) method for HSI denoising. We first construct a weighted CTV (WCTV) regularization term to adaptively adjust the smoothness constraints on different dimensions according to the noise characteristics. Furthermore, our IE-TV framework learns a structural information enhancement matrix at a more refined scale, which is then utilized to impose constraints on the gradient nuclear norm in WCTV. By solving this new optimization problem, IE-TV achieves a balance between the preservation of details (such as edges and textures) and the restoration of the global structure (such as spectral continuity). Experimental verifications on three HSI datasets show that IE-TV outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both visual quality and quantitative indicators (PSNR, SSIM, ERGAS), reducing over-smoothing while maintaining fine structures and spectral consistency."

With the rapid proliferation of social networks, various manifestations of multimodal sarcasm have become widespread. Consequently, there is a growing emphasis on discerning sarcasm conveyed through multimodal data. Existing research often provides only a superficial interpretation of images, lacking a thorough exploration of the contextual nuances embedded within, particularly in understanding the scene depicted in the image. In this paper, we aim to delve deeper into the information embedded within images. Specifically, we begin by extracting entity relationships from images to capture the contextual information they convey. Additionally, we utilize image text recognition to extract textual information from the images. After conducting a comprehensive analysis of the image information, we establish consistency modeling between the image content and text using external knowledge. Finally, we employ a graph neural network to process the constructed cross-modal graph and make predictions regarding sarcasm. Extensive experiments validate the state-of-the-art performance of our model on publicly available multimodal Twitter datasets."

This paper presents a lightweight iAKA authentication protocol. Its distributed regional core network (ACN) deployment shortens the user-authentication network element path. The regional authentication key technology based on identity-based cryptography enables end-to end authentication key self-organization between LEO satellites and ACNs and between users and ACNs, solving the pre-shared symmetric key dependence in centralized authentication. Also, it reduces authentication interactions to three steps for completing authentication and key negotiation. The protocol has security features like mutual authentication and man-in-the-middle attack resistance, and strengthens user identifier anonymous transmission. Experiments show that compared with other protocols, the iAKA protocol has lower computational time overhead, is more LEO-resource-friendly with low computational and storage demands, suits LEO’s resource-constrained environment, and reduces overall transmission bandwidth by $25.2 \\%$."

The explosive use of AI and large language models (LLM) raised concerns about data privacy and security. To overcome privacy concerns researchers and practitioners have started widely employing federated learning methods. The fully homo morphic encryption (FHE) is the underlying mechanism for the success of federated learning techniques. FHE suffers from significant limitations ciphertext expansion leads to slower data transmission and processing speeds, and increased storage requirements. Furthermore, as a newer encryption scheme, HE’s widespread adoption is limited, increasing the risk of undiscovered vulnerabilities. This paper discusses the security challenges with 5G and next Generation wireless networks. By leveraging NOBE, we propose framework not only enhances security but also facilitates advanced data processing capabilities without compromising user privacy.

    "abstract": "Robotics programming education is expanding globally, where students and instructors often engage with learning resources, tutorials, and programming exercises written in multiple languages. While this opens access to diverse knowledge sources, the lack of standardized cross-language instructional material hinders effective learning and collaboration in programming environments. Language barriers create inconsistencies in understanding algorithms, control logic, and domain-specific robotics terminology, particularly when nonnative learners work with technical code documentation or tutorials available only in English. To address this limitation, the paper propose a Neural Machine Translation for Robotics Education Framework (NMTRF), which leverages transformer-based neural machine translation models fine-tuned on domain-specific robotics programming corpora. The framework is designed to handle technical terminology, code-comment translations, and dual-mode educational materials, ensuring semantic accuracy and pedagogical clarity across languages. NMTRF integrates context-aware translation modules with preannotated robotics datasets, thereby delivering accurate translations for both textual instructions and embedded code explanations. Experiments conducted on multilingual robotics courseware and online repositories demonstrated that NMTRF achieved a BLEU score improvement of 14% over baseline NMT systems while reducing terminology mistranslations by 21%. Furthermore, student comprehension assessments indicated significant learning improvements for non-native participants exposed to translated material versus traditional bilingual reference sheets. These results confirm that AI-driven translation adapted to robotics contexts can eliminate cross-language barriers, enhance inclusivity, and support international collaboration in robotics programming education. The NMTRF framework is expected to serve as a foundation for building multilingual learning platforms and global robotics education ecosystems."

We apply the method on frames extracted from the UCF-Crime dataset, using SSIM-based keyframe selection and brightness-guided normalization as preprocessing steps. The anomaly scoring is based on the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the reconstructed and original frames, with abnormality defined by exceeding the 95th percentile threshold. According to experimental results, the Transformer decoder achieved the lowest 95 th percentile MSE of 0.2206, followed by AttentionAugmented (0.2489), UNet (0.2644), Multi-Scale (0.2805), and Baseline (0.3167).

Furthermore, a stage-wise strategy introduces P_CBAM modules into Layers 3–5 of MobileViT, progressively constructing hierarchical features from local textures to global semantics. To further enhance recognition performance, a customized loss function is designed to improve inter-class discrimination.

    "abstract": "Motivated by the imperative for real-time responsiveness and data privacy preservation, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed on resource-constrained edge devices to enable localized inference. To improve output quality, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is an efficient technique that seamlessly integrates local data into LLMs. However, existing edge computing paradigms primarily focus on single-node optimization, neglecting opportunities to holistically exploit distributed data and heterogeneous resources through cross-node collaboration. To bridge this gap, we propose CoEdge-RAG, a hierarchical scheduling framework for retrieval-augmented LLMs in collaborative edge computing. In general, privacy constraints preclude accurate a priori acquisition of heterogeneous data distributions across edge nodes, directly impeding RAG performance optimization. Thus, we first design an online query identification mechanism using proximal policy optimization (PPO), which autonomously infers query semantics and establishes cross-domain knowledge associations in an online manner. Second, we devise a dynamic inter-node scheduling strategy that balances workloads across heterogeneous edge nodes by synergizing historical performance analytics with real-time resource thresholds. Third, we develop an intra-node scheduler based on online convex optimization, adaptively allocating query processing ratios and memory resources to optimize the latency-quality trade-off under fluctuating assigned loads. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse QA benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed method significantly boosts the performance of collaborative retrieval-augmented LLMs, achieving performance gains of 4.23 % to 91.39% over baseline methods across all tasks."

Through an in-depth analysis of frameworks like RSNN, TinyM2Net-V2, and CODEBench, and toolchains such as Vivado HLS, TVM, and TensorFlow Lite, the review showcases their application in edge AI, computer vision, scientific computing, and secure processing. Quantitative comparisons reveal that FPGA-based designs achieve an optimal balance between performance and power efficiency, outperforming GPUs and ASICs in several energy-constrained scenarios. Challenges such as partitioning complexity, fragmented toolchains, and limited automation are discussed alongside trends in dynamic partial reconfiguration, AI-driven toolchains, and RISC-V-based SoCs. Future research directions emphasize the need for unified frameworks, support for complex models and hardware-aware optimization techniques. This review concludes that hardware/software co-design is essential for enabling scalable, low-power, real-time ML systems, offering a promising pathway toward next-generation intelligent edge computing and high-performance embedded systems."

    "abstract": "As cyber threats against Internet of Things (IoT) environments have become more diverse and complex. Therefore, there is increased demand for accurate and intelligent Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). Conventional machine learning techniques fall short in defining the inherent spatial-temporal patterns typically found in network traffic. This paper introduces a hybrid deep learning methodology that integrates one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers to perform multiclass learning. The model was trained and assessed using the UNSW-NB15 dataset, which includes a variety of attacks. The preprocessing pipeline was comprehensive and covered missing value handling, categorical encoding, feature scaling, and categorical label transformation. The input data, once reshaped through a preprocessing pipeline, was fed to a stacked CNNLSTM architecture for local feature representation learning and sequential dependence learning. The model produced a test score of 97.81% for accuracy, 98.97% precision, and 97.00% recall when identifying both common and complex attack categories. Given the model has relatively few trainable parameters, it can deliver a high performance whilst remaining computationally efficient - the ability to use the CNN-LSTM architecture could enable the deployment of security solutions in real-time for IoT security frameworks."

The system consists of gyroscope, control board, lidar, encoder, camera, industrial computer, remote control computer and router. The vision positioning system improves the positioning accuracy of the robot by processing the camera image. This paper proposes a particle filter SLAM algorithm based on least square matching. The core of SLAM algorithm is to obtain the robot position through least square matching in each iteration, expand the particle set and optimize the particle set distribution. After the fusion of visual images and lidar data, when the distance is fixed, the larger the gray value of the fusion data is. The camera and 3D lidar are used to fuse the target detection results to improve the effectiveness of target detection. In the visualization part, the GIS platform component library and model components are combined, and the flood inundation data set is output. The process of flood dynamic evolution is formed on the basis of topographic data. The development process and development trend of inundation range are calculated, and the flood inundation information is mastered to reduce flood loss."

The primary objectives are to identify traffic patterns, detect abnormal behaviors, optimize resource allocation, and enhance network operation efficiency and quality. This study analyzes the current status of inter-provincial traffic in China Telecom’s IP backbone network, summarizing the main characteristics of traffic distribution. The results indicate that while inter-provincial flows exhibit strong localization characteristics, significant room for optimization remains. Furthermore, traffic imbalance and localized congestion are observed in certain directions and links.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised semantic segmentation approach for food images which takes advantage of the zero-shot capabilities and promptability of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) along with the attention mechanisms of Vision Transformers (ViTs). Specifically, we use class activation maps (CAMs) from ViTs to generate prompts for SAM, resulting in masks suitable for food image segmentation. The ViT model, a Swin Transformer, is trained exclusively using image-level annotations, eliminating the need for pixel-level annotations during training. Additionally, to enhance the quality of the SAM-generated masks, we examine the use of image preprocessing techniques in combination with single-mask and multi-mask SAM generation strategies. The methodology is evaluated on the FoodSeg103 dataset, generating an average of 2.4 masks per image (excluding background), and achieving an mIoU of 0.54 for the multi-mask scenario. We envision the proposed approach as a tool to accelerate food image annotation tasks or as an integrated component in food and nutrition tracking applications."

To address this challenge, we propose a platform based on a Digital Twin (DT) model for student stress management, integrating physiological, self-reported, and contextual data to enable stress monitoring and prediction. The proposed solution includes wearable devices to collect heart rate, heart rate variability, activity, and sleep quality, while a mobile application gathers pre- and post-activity stress levels, workload evaluations, and academic performance metrics. Additionally, contextual data, including academic schedules and deadlines, will be examined as stress related factors. The proposed DT use machine learning algorithms to predict individual stress and to optimize personalized interventions. The system aims to adjust study plans and suggest behavioral changes, in order to prevent high stress levels of the individuals. Initial results reveal that integrating biosignals with academic data, enhances stress prediction accuracy, offering an adaptive tool for improving students’ well-being and academic performance."

These approaches serve as powerful analytical and diagnostic tools that aid in making informed decisions. This study investigates the effectiveness of various machine learning algorithms—both individual and ensemble—in the diagnosis and prediction of breast cancer. Key evaluation metrics, including accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and precision, are employed to assess model performance and efficiency. The analysis involves the application of several individual classifiers, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (C4.5), and Simple Logistic, alongside ensemble methods including Majority Voting and Random Forest. All models were evaluated using a breast cancer dataset obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, with 10-fold cross-validation employed to ensure reliable and unbiased performance estimation. Experimental results demonstrate that the Majority Voting ensemble—comprising SVM, KNN, and Simple Logistic—consistently outperforms individual models, achieving a classification accuracy of 98.1% and an error rate of only 0.01%. These findings suggest that the proposed ensemble approach offers a highly accurate and robust solution for breast cancer diagnosis."

As international standards (e.g., IEEE 1547-2018; IEEE 2800-2021) continue to evolve, incorporating such models into protection assessments is increasingly essential. Our objective is to validate MATLAB/Simulink fault-response models and benchmark them against implementations available in OMICRON RelaySimTest software, quantifying their impact on relay-measured currents in medium-voltage feeders.

    "abstract": "With the shift toward online platforms for education, coaching, and therapy especially accelerated by the COVID19 pandemic-the need for emotionally expressive digital tools has grown significantly. Traditional virtual education solutions often lack the emotional interactivity required for effective communication, particularly for children with communication disorders such as autism. Furthermore, most avatar-based systems are built around English-speaking contexts, leaving a cultural and linguistic gap for widely spoken dialects such as Egyptian Arabic. This paper presents the development and evaluation of an Egyptian emotional avatar designed to express six primary emotions: Anger, Sadness, Fear, Surprise, Happiness, and Neutrality at varying intensity levels. The avatar was adapted from a Unity Asset Store model (Awaii Studio), enhanced by adding ten custom blendshapes using Blender to support additional facial expressions. Emotion targets were modeled based on average facial expressions of an Egyptian actor, derived from a curated dataset. Synchronization of lip movement was achieved using an Egyptian Arabic Text-to-Speech model developed by Omar Samir, alongside a blinking system to enhance realism. A user study was conducted with 40 participants (22 female, 18 male), comparing avatar videos with and without emotional expressions. Participants were divided to mitigate order bias and assessed the avatar based on naturalness, understanding, and reasonableness. Filler and attention-check questions were included to ensure reliability of responses. Results showed that 95% of participants preferred the emotionally expressive avatar, and found its expressions believable and contextually appropriate. This research contributes a culturally-tailored, emotionally rich avatar system for Arabic-speaking learners. Future work will explore dynamic emotional transitions, integration of body language, and enhancements to the TTS system for improved Egyptian Arabic fluency and realism."

Four KPIs are modeled: enrollment, employees, graduates, and R&D expenditure.

Models are evaluated with an 80/20 chronological split using MAE, RMSE, MAPE, and R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>. Results across three universities of different scales show that Random Forest produces lower errors and more stable forecasts. At the same time, LSTM is sensitive to recent fluctuations but less reliable with short annual series.

    "abstract": "Intrusion detection in Internet of Things (IoT) environments is a critical yet challenging task due to the heterogeneous nature of devices and the complex attack landscape. Traditional machine and deep learning models often suffer from limitations such as poor class balance, irrelevant or redundant features, suboptimal classification accuracy, ineffective hyperparameter tuning, and scarcity of labeled data. To address these challenges, we propose an enhanced intrusion detection system model. Variance threshold is applied to select informative features, while the proximity weighted random affine shadow sampling technique is used to balance the dataset effectively. Capsule Network (CapsNet) is employed for robust classification due to its ability to capture spatial hierarchies in data. To further optimize CapsNet, we implement the Reptile Search Algorithm (RSA), resulting in the Reptile-Optimized Capsule Network (ROC-Net). ROC-Net is further enhanced using Margin-Based Active Learning (MBAL), forming Marginal Active-learning with Reptile-optimized Capsule Network (MARCO-Net), which efficiently annotates the most uncertain samples from the unlabeled pool. Experimental results show that the proposed ROC-Net and MARCO-Net significantly outperform traditional models, achieving improvements of 8.75 % and 12.5 % in accuracy, 13.75 % and 11.25 % in precision, 1.19 % and 9.52 % in recall, <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{7. 4 1 \\%}$</tex> and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{1 1. 1 1 \\%}$</tex> in F1-score, <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{1 1. 9 4 \\%}$</tex> and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{2 0. 9 0 \\%}$</tex> in Matthews Correlation Coefficient, and 13.64 % and 22.73 % in Cohen's Kappa.

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) represent a promising conceptual framework to describe such complicated interplays. In our current research, we build a heterogeneous biomedical knowledge graph (KG) based on the Toxin and Toxin Target Database (T3DB) 1, containing 49,501 nodes and 89,988 edges which are toxins, symptoms, protein/gene targets, routes of exposure, and environmental factors. Our prediction task can be defined as a two-step procedure: we first apply node prediction to toxins using embeddings and then apply link-prediction methods in order to identify toxin-disease associations. This type of layered architecture makes it easier to extract shared nodes among the predicted links, thus enhancing both interpretability and biological relevance. Experimental assessments were done on an <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$80 / 20$</tex> training test split, using a variety of random seeds to ensure robustness. Accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score were used as a measure of model evaluation. Findings highlight that Graph Attention Networks (GAT) have the best trade-off between accuracy and generalization, reaching an F1-score of 0.975; compared to RGCN and Enhanced GCN which is stable when faced with smaller or noisier graphs. The work has three main contributions: (1) incorporation of environmental exposure pathways into a toxin-disease KG, thus transcending the scope of a pure molecular toxicity prediction; (2) a systematic benchmark of a variety of GNNs within a systematic evaluation pipeline; and (3) the insights of interpretability, elucidating a variety of biologically meaningful substructures.

    "abstract": "Under the dual carbon goals, the rising proportion of new energy sources-to-load ratio brings greater challenges to power supply-demand balance due to its inherent uncertainties. In the current and foreseeable future, the “supply-demand imbalance” in electricity has become the new normal, with heightened risks of exceeding steady-state frequency limits. Therefore, in the critical frequency window between exhausted generator frequency regulation capacity and pre-low-frequency load shedding activation, it is imperative to establish an additional frequency control defense layer that automatically disconnects partial loads, serving as an effective supplement to dispatch-based load curtailment measures. This paper analyzes the inadequacies of existing load control measures in modern power grids. Aligned with the functional positioning of steady-state low-frequency active control defenses, it investigates two major control schemes (centralized and decentralized). It proposes four engineering implementation plans: Utilization of batch load control functionalities, Upgrades to precision load-shedding security and stability control systems, Retrofit of existing low-frequency load shedding devices at substations, Deployment of compact automation devices for interruptible load disconnection. The paper provides a detailed analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of each plan, offering engineering implementation solutions and equipment support for frequency active prevention and control functions in emergency supply scenarios under high-proportion renewable energy power systems."

    "abstract": "Knee osteoporosis is a degenerative bone condition characterized by reduced bone density, leading to increased fracture risk and impaired mobility. For prompt treatment to be possible and long-term complications to be avoided, early and accurate diagnosis is essential. Despite their effectiveness, traditional diagnostic methods like quantitative ultrasound (QUS) and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) are still constrained by subjectivity, cost, and accessibility. Deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) approaches have recently demonstrated great promise for automatically detecting osteoporosis in the knee from radiographic pictures. This paper provides a thorough analysis of machine learning (ML)-based methods used to detect osteoporosis in the knee from medical imaging modalities, with an emphasis on datasets, feature extraction methods, classification models, and assessment metrics. With the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning, several studies have shown encouraging results, reaching up to 91% accuracy. However, there are several issues with current research, including limited explainability, inconsistent labeling standards, small dataset sizes, and a lack of external validation. Finally, we discuss new developments, challenges, and future directions to enable ML-driven osteoporosis detection systems that are trustworthy, comprehensible, and clinically useful"

    "abstract": "Monitoring our environment is more important than ever as they face growing challenges from pollution and climate change. This paper introduces an IoT-based system designed to keep a close eye on air and soil quality in real time. Using a network of affordable sensors, the system tracks key environmental factors such as air temperature, humidity, particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), CO, NO, soil moisture, pH, and essential nutrients. These sensors send data wirelessly to a cloud platform that can be easily viewed and analyzed using a user-friendly web dashboard or mobile app. Alerts are generated when environmental conditions cross safe limits, helping users respond quickly. The system is designed to be scalable and adaptable, making it suitable for cities, farms, and industrial areas alike. Testing has shown that the system works reliably and accurately, offering a practical tool for better environmental awareness and smarter decision making. Ultimately, this approach supports healthier ecosystems and contributes to sustainable living. In general, their work provides a versatile and easy-to-use framework to monitor air and soil quality side by side. The system enables users from farmers to city planners to take action on real-time environmental insights by combining affordable technology with dependable data pipelines and reasonable interactive visualizations. This not only supports smarter agricultural practices and more resilient urban planning, but also contributes to healthier ecosystems and communities. The proposed system architecture, using the sensor calibration techniques, the data processing workflows, and the outcomes of field case studies that demonstrate the platform's usefulness and potential are covered in the parts that follow."

This paper investigates a novel hybrid deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for resource allocation in a multi-user uplink system assisted by multiple active RISs. The objective is to maximize the minimum user rate by jointly optimizing user transmit powers, active RIS configurations, and base station (BS) beamforming. We derive a closed-form solution for optimal beamforming and employ DRL algorithms—soft actor-critic (SAC), deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), and twin delayed DDPG (TD3)–to solve this high-dimensional, non-convex optimization problem. Simulation results demonstrate that SAC achieves superior performance with a high learning rate leading to faster convergence and lower computational cost compared to DDPG and TD3. Furthermore, the closed-form of optimal beamforming enhances the minimum rate effectively."

Cooperative inference by offloading workload across nearby devices improves feasibility, but most existing schemes do not analyze end-to-end timing and are thus not suitable for real-time applications. This Work-in-Progress paper studies deadline-aware distributed DNN inference with an asynchronous execution semantics: a device proceeds as soon as its required partial outputs are available, without global synchronization. We develop a time-aware optimization model that minimizes response time subject to deadline constraints. We also outline our ongoing research efforts and future extensions of the proposed work."

The system captures real-time images of drivers by calling on-board cameras, preprocesses images, extracts features and recognizes behaviors through ModerArts platform, and finally prompts drivers to pay attention to safety through early warning mechanism.

    "abstract": "As industrial control applications scale up, mesh networked control systems (MNCSs) are gaining popularity, where multiple control loops share a multi-hop mesh network. However, these loops often suffer from long-span, time-varying delays caused by the multi-hop transmissions of multiple flows, which significantly degrade control performance, particularly stability. Existing studies on delay-aware stability conditions are usually independent with network scheduling, leading to a pessimistic stability analysis. Meanwhile, existing stability-aware scheduling approaches rely on coarse-grained designs, further worsening stability guarantees and limiting network capacity. In this work, we propose a stability-guaranteed scheduling mechanism for MNCSs with fine-grained timing. We first establish a stability condition that accounts for time-varying delays over an extended horizon spanning multiple superframes, which reduces the pessimism in stability analysis and enables more refined scheduling strategies. Based on this condition, We design a Long time-horizon and Fine-grained network scheduling mechanism with Stability Guarantee (LFSG), which deterministically maps the stability condition into the fine-grained network scheduling, considering fluctuating delays over the extended horizon. Furthermore, we provide a stability-capacity-aware LFSG (SCA-LFSG), which aims to maximize the number of stabilizable control loops and demonstrates its effectiveness through various application paradigms. Extensive studies demonstrate the advantages of stability analyses, LFSG, and SCA-LFSG over state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both control and timing performance."

    "abstract": "To address the challenges of complex spatiotemporal coupling and strict physical constraints in emergency control of power systems with high penetration of renewable energy, this paper proposes a Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Constrained Reinforcement Learning framework (DSTC-RL). The method aims to balance model accuracy, computational efficiency, and action feasibility, thereby overcoming the adaptability bottlenecks faced by traditional approaches under strong uncertainty. Specifically, a dynamic spatio-temporal graph modeling module is developed to capture the evolving transient characteristics of the power grid using an adaptive adjacency matrix and gated spatio-temporal convolution units. By leveraging reinforcement learning, the DSTC-RL framework enables the system to autonomously learn optimal emergency control strategies through trial-and-error interactions with the environment, rather than relying on handcrafted rules or offlineoptimized schedules. This learning paradigm facilitates real-time decision-making under uncertainty, while incorporating spatiotemporal dynamics and operational constraints into the policy learning process. Experimental results on the IEEE 39-bus system demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional DQN and DDQN-based approaches. Moreover, under node short-circuit faults, the proposed strategy enables rapid voltage recovery and stabilization, offering a highly reliable solution for the secure and stable operation of nextgeneration power systems."

    "abstract": "The treatment of hemodialysis remains complicated and operator-dependent due to the need to adjust machine settings continuously. This need comes to respond to changing patient situations and avoid complications like intradialytic hypotension. Existing systems do not have adaptive control and are not dynamically customized so that treatment can change on-the-fly. The purpose of this study is to provide a RL framework that facilitates patient-specific hemodialysis treatment management. This article suggests a simulation environment designed for clinical purposes that recreates both machine mechanics and patient physiology. Therefore, it encompasses machine-level state that can reach up to a 20-dimensional vector and another continuous action space that regulates critical machine dynamics. The agent is encouraged to learn stable and effective treatments through a hierarchical reward function that adheres to medical safety guidelines. The performance of the three RL algorithms, including Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), were compared in terms of cumulative reward, alarm frequency, and physiological stability. The results indicate that DDPG demonstrates better performance in terms of smoother controlled policies and alleviated number of safety violations. This study shows the promise of using Reinforcement Learning as a potential tool for modeling and optimizing dialysis treatment in a dynamic yet safe way. The discussion also covers limitations that exist when it comes to clinical integration, simulation of fidelity, safety guarantee, and interpretability. It appears that the methodology presented is a promising scheme for future intelligent dialysis systems that can provide personalized care while minimizing clinician workload."

In this paper, a nonvolatile IoT sensor node where nonvolatile (NV) memory is used for the storage element of the micro-controller unit (MCU). The use of NV memory makes it possible to perform instant power-gating behavior without losing internal data which results in great standby power reduction. Moreover, the use of sensorinput driven power-gating scheme, where the power supply of the NV-MCU is turned on only when a valid sensor input is obtained, makes it possible to extend standby time and skip wasted MCU operation which results in further power saving. For the functional verification, the proposed IoT sensor node is virtually implemented on an FPGA board (Digilent Basys 3) with a temperature sensor device (Digilent Pmod TMP2). It is estimated that the proposed IoT sensor node saves 35% of power consumption compared to conventional CMOS-based IoT sensor node under 1-second data sampling rate."

    "abstract": "The Robot Operating System 2 (ROS) is heavily used in autonomous systems due to its large ecosystem and modular design. However, ROS remains problematic for real-time applications despite prior efforts to improve its real-time capabilities. Many of these problems are rooted in the implementation of the ROS executor, which does not support preemption or userspecified priorities. These properties are fundamental to real-time scheduling and desirable for general systems to reduce latency. ROS variants in prior work have separately supported the preemption and prioritization of callbacks but place restrictions on the application, preventing their adoption in a real-world workload. This paper addresses these deficiencies with a novel executor framework, <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\operatorname{ROS}^{\\text{RT}}$</tex>, which is compatible with any type of ROS application while supporting preemptive, priority-driven scheduling.

This work investigates how data compression can be integrated into postquantum blockchains to alleviate computational stress and improve scalability, particularly in fluctuating load environments. Our results indicate that, while compression introduces a slight overhead during data encoding, it significantly reduces memory consumption and improves latency stability under pressure. For example, our experiments reveal that compression reduces average transaction latency under normal conditions and lowers memory usage during peak CPU loads. These findings contribute to the growing research on enhancing the efficiency of postquantum blockchain systems, offering a lightweight and practical optimization technique."

    "abstract": "In real-time and safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPSs), control synthesis must guarantee that generated policies meet stringent timing and correctness requirements under uncertain and dynamic conditions. Signal temporal logic (STL) has emerged as a powerful formalism of expressing realtime constraints, with its semantics enabling quantitative assessment of system behavior. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning (RL) has become an important method for solving control synthesis problems in unknown environments. Recent studies incorporate STL-based reward functions into RL to automatically synthesize control policies. However, the automatically inferred rewards obtained by these methods represent the global assessment of a whole or partial path but do not accumulate the rewards of local changes accurately, so the sparse global rewards may lead to non-convergence and unstable training performances. In this paper, we propose an online reward generation method guided by the online causation monitoring of STL. Our approach continuously monitors system behavior against an STL specification at each control step, computing the quantitative distance toward satisfaction or violation and thereby producing rewards that reflect instantaneous state dynamics. Additionally, we provide a smooth approximation of the causation semantics to overcome the discontinuity of the causation semantics and make it differentiable for using deep-RL methods. We have implemented a prototype tool and evaluated it in the Gym environment on a variety of continuously controlled benchmarks. Experimental results show that our proposed STL-guided RL method with online causation semantics outperforms existing relevant STLguided RL methods, providing a more robust and efficient reward generation framework for deep-RL."

Residual nitrogen from a previous epitaxial growth run can lead to an uncontrolled increase in the average doping concentration of subsequent epitaxial wafers, adversely affecting the doping concentration stability during run-to-run growth. Furthermore, the disparity in doping concentration increase between the edge and center of the epitaxial wafer hinders the regulation of doping uniformity during growth, resulting in poor within-wafer doping concentration uniformity. To maintain yield during mass production of continuous multi-batch epitaxial wafers, frequent fine-tuning of the dopant flow rate based on data from prior runs becomes necessary, significantly reducing equipment productivity and automation levels. To address these challenges, this study systematically investigates the doping mechanisms of nitrogen and ammonia by analyzing the structural configuration of the epitaxial growth reactor and the distinct doping characteristics of the two sources.

    "abstract": "To achieve the strategic goals of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality, China has established a multi-energy market system centered on electricity, carbon, and green certificate markets. However, significant temporal scale differences exist among the three markets: the electricity market operates primarily on hourly trading, the carbon market adopts monthly settlements, and the green certificate market implements annual compliance, creating severe challenges for coordinated optimization decisions of power generation enterprises due to temporal granularity mismatches. A multi-temporal-scale market optimization model for integrated energy systems incorporating P2G and CCS technologies is developed in this paper. First, a three-tier nested architecture covering annual-monthly-daily periods is established, through which coupled analysis of electricity-carbon-green certificate markets is achieved via a two-stage generator decision-making process. Second, an information transfer mechanism across temporal scales is designed, effectively solving the temporal granularity mismatch problem among different markets. Finally, a rolling correction optimization framework is constructed, realizing coordination between long-term planning and short-term scheduling. Based on the annual-monthly nested optimization architecture, coupled analysis of the three markets across medium-to-long-term and short-term temporal dimensions is achieved, effectively enhancing both economic efficiency and environmental performance of system operations. Optimization results demonstrate that, compared with single temporal scale optimization, the multi-temporal-scale optimization increases renewable energy generation proportion by 21.1 %, reduces annual total costs by 12.1 %, and decreases carbon emissions by 7.2 %, validating the effectiveness of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "Existing image-based virtual try-on methods are limited to frontal views and lack real-time performance. While per-garment virtual try-on methods have tackled these issues by adopting per-garment training, they still encounter practical limitations: (1) the robotic mannequin used for per-garment datasets collection is prohibitively expensive; (2) the synthesized garments often misalign with the human body. To address these challenges, we propose a low-barrier approach to collect per-garment datasets using real human bodies, eliminating the need for an expensive robotic mannequin and reducing data collection time from 2 hours to 2 minutes. Additionally, we introduce a hybrid person representation that ensures precise human-garment alignment. We conducted qualitative and quantitative comparisons with state-of-the-art image-based virtual try-on methods to demonstrate the superiority of our method regarding image quality and temporal consistency. Furthermore, most participants in our user study found the system effective in supporting garment purchasing decisions."

Existing workload estimation methods use standard machine learning techniques to model the relationships between physiological metrics and workload. However, such methods are not sufficient for adaptive systems, as standard machine learning techniques struggle to make accurate workload estimates when the human–robot team performs unknown tasks. A meta-learning-based workload estimation algorithm is introduced and an initial analysis is conducted to show how adapting a machine learning model's parameters using task-specific information can improve result in more accurate workload estimates for unknown tasks."

    "abstract": "Large language models have revolutionized various sectors, including education and healthcare, by demonstrating significant advancements in producing human-like text and enhancing translation accuracy. Despite these advancements, the conventional process of cross-cultural instrument translation remains labor-intensive, expensive, and heavily dependent on the expertise of human professionals, including translators and healthcare specialists. The objective of this study is to address the translation challenges in health-related instruments. This study introduces a Human and Large Language Models Collaboration Framework, called H-LLMCF, designed to automate the key steps of instrument translation while maintaining linguistic precision and cultural appropriateness. The proposed framework integrates human expertise and LLM capabilities across two phases: AI-guided translation and human-guided evaluation and refinement. When applied to the translation of two validated instruments in the health sector from English to Arabic, the framework demonstrated promising outcomes. The proposed framework achieved BLEU scores of ~0.54 and ~66 for the two instruments. SBERT-based cosine similarity exceeded 0.85 for 80% of items, with a mean of ~0.92 and ~0.96, indicating strong semantic alignment with human translations. Human evaluation of the 35-item HPV Knowledge Assessment instrument yielded an average I-CVI of 1.00, with 91.42% of items rated as fully acceptable by both reviewers. For the KIDMED instrument, out of 16 items, 15 (93.75%) received a rating of 3 from both reviewers, resulting in an I-CVI of 1.00 for those items. Most discrepancies were linked to translation and fluency adaptation. This highlights the potential of LLMs to enhance cross-cultural translation processes while maintaining translation quality."

    "abstract": "Electric autonomous mobility-on-demand (EAMoD) systems are emerging all over the world. However, their potential swarm charging in depots may deteriorate operation of the power system, further in turn affecting EAMoD system’s optimal operation. To prevent this latent risk, we develop a real-time coordination framework for the EAMoD system and the power system. First, the temporal-spatial characteristics of EAMoD fleets are fully described based on a Markov decision process model, including serving trips, repositioning, and charging. Second, charger accessibility of EAMoD depot charging is well modeled as real-world configuration, wherein fast and slow charge piles are both included. Third, the power system regulation model provides real-time charging regulation constraints for EAMoD systems to prevent potential overload and undervoltage. To address the poor solution quality attributed to the complex decision space of the EAMoD system, this paper proposes a piecewise linear-based approximate dynamic programming algorithm combined with model predictive control. Numerical experiments in the Manhattan and a 14-node power distribution network validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and underscore the necessity of system coordination."

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) power Doppler (PD) imaging enables visualization of volumetric microvasculature networks. However, 3D ultrafast PD imaging with matrix arrays suffers from limited resolution due to the restricted aperture size and the use of unfocused plane waves, while delay-and-sum (DAS) exhibits high sidelobe levels and broad main lobes, hindering high-quality PD imaging. In this study, we aim to improve the 3D null subtraction imaging (NSI) and propose coherence-based NSI beamformers including NSI based on coherence factor (NSI-CF) and NSI based on spatial and angular coherence factor (NSI-SACF). Specifically, NSI-SACF integrates the high-resolution capability of NSI and the high-contrast performance of spatial and angular coherence factor (SACF). The proposed beamformers are validated through simulations, phantom experiments, and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">in vivo</i> experiments. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations confirm the superiority of NSI-SACF. In the simulations, NSI-SACF achieves a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 0.059 mm compared with 0.391 mm for DAS and 0.225 mm for SACF. NSI-SACF also reduces the sidelobe level by 75.5 dB and 33.6 dB compared with DAS and SACF respectively, while effectively suppressing grating lobes. In the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">in vivo</i> experiments, NSI-SACF improves the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of blood flow by 20.03 dB and 8.65 dB over DAS and SACF, respectively. Furthermore, the FWHM of the vessel is reduced to 0.098 mm with NSI-SACF, compared with 0.326 mm for DAS and 0.159 mm for SACF. In summary, the proposed NSI-SACF beamformer effectively enhances the PD imaging by simultaneously improving spatial resolution and contrast, demonstrating the potential for clinical applications."

    "abstract": "Traditionally, crash data, crash risk models, video recordings and user surveys have been utilized by agencies to measure the safety benefits of ramp metering technology. Connected vehicle data can now provide an agile evaluation alternative for quantifying impact of ramp meter deployments. Furthermore, in contrast to crash data, connected vehicle near miss events occur much more frequently, so the before-after evaluation can be conducted over a much shorter time period consisting of a few months, or perhaps even a few weeks. Indiana deployed ramp meters on the southeast section of I-465 around Indianapolis, on or around May 14, 2024, which were then active primarily during the morning and evening peak hours. Hard-braking events, a surrogate safety performance measure, were estimated from high-frequency connected vehicle data available at 3-second fidelity for vehicles passing through the metered ramps and the adjacent mainline interstate. A before-after analysis for the 4-5 PM peak hour showed approximately a 61% reduction in hard-braking events on mainline merge areas adjoining the metered ramps on the inner loop of I-465. Spatial analysis also showed a 70%, 41% and 33% median reduction in mild, moderate and severe hard-braking events per 0.1-mile segment in the entire 7.5-mile mainline corridor adjacent to metered ramps. The methodologies and performance measures provided in this paper demonstrate how connected vehicle data scales well to systematically assess and document the performance of new ramp metering deployments."

Although the significance of SVC and SSC is well established, the underlying principles related to their performance bounds have not been thoroughly investigated. To address this issue, we study the performance bounds for online SVC/SSC in this paper. Initially, to evaluate coding performance, we propose a new metric referred to as effective coding gain (ECG), which jointly considers the entropy of the source data and the mutual information between the source and the encoded video data. Next, from the perspective of information theory, we derive a closed-form expression for the ECG bound while accounting for the impacts of diverse SVC/SSC coding structures. Our results not only ensure that the performance bounds can be efficiently evaluated but also provide valuable insights for resource allocation, cost optimization, performance evaluation and comparison, as well as for understanding the optimization space of existing systems."

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is advancing at a rapid pace with Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and is becoming integral for real-time monitoring and data-driven decision-making in different sectors. Emerging real-world applications are greatly reliant on IoT-based WSNs to improve productivity and operational efficiency. However, WSNs encounter significant challenges in handling substantial data amounts and maintaining robust security requirements. These networks are prone to many security risks that may compromise network operation and data integrity. This paper proposes a novel technique by integrating Blockchain and Incremental Extreme Learning Machine (abbreviated as BIELM) to effectively detect such malicious nodes in WSNs and ensure secure data collection. BIELM utilizes an interplanetary file system for efficient data storage and blockchain to record hashes and provide secure data access. This work also introduces an effective feature selection method by modifying the Sparrow search optimization and the edited nearest neighbor for data balancing with a combination of a standard oversampling technique (SMOTE). The experimental results reveal an accuracy of 99.38%, demonstrating the superior performance of BIELM in detecting malicious nodes, with an average cost saving of approximately 22.72% in blockchain transaction costs across key operations compared to conventional blockchain-based methods, revealing its overall efficiency over existing methods."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we analyze the secrecy performance of a two-hop cooperative network consisting solely of energy-harvesting (EH) self-sustaining nodes drawing energy from a multi-antenna power beacon (PB). The performance of such networks is quite different from that of powered nodes. For improved performance, we consider the optimal combining of the direct and relayed signals at the multi-antenna destination as well as the multi-antenna eavesdropper. Due to massive deployment of machine-type communication nodes, the availability of channel state information at the source is impractical in such networks, we assume fixed-rate signaling. To implement incremental signaling, we utilize feedback bits from the destination. Assuming practical nonlinear EH, approximate expressions are derived for the secrecy outage probability of the selective decode-and-forward (SDF) and the incremental decode-and-forward (IDF) relaying schemes. It is demonstrated that IDF has much better secrecy performance than SDF, just as with powered nodes. However, unlike with powered nodes, the secrecy performance is a convex function of the transmit power of PB. We propose a novel power back-off scheme to improve secrecy under different network operating conditions. The security-reliability trade-off is analyzed to highlight the trade-off between outage and secrecy performance with the power back-off scheme. Simulation results validate the analytical expressions."

However, these approaches are often limited by their reliance on accurate parameter identification, threshold-setting issues, and the need for large-scale, high-quality data. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in active measurement techniques utilizing sensors for the fault diagnosis of lithium-ion batteries. Among these, magnetic-field sensing presents a contactless solution for fault diagnosis. This paper proposes an innovative intelligent magnetic-field sensing technique based on Tunnel Magnetoresistive (TMR) sensors and magnetic-field image recognition for the effective and low-cost fault diagnosis of lithium-ion batteries. First, the electrochemical and magnetic characteristics of lithium-ion batteries are investigated to establish the underlying principles of magnetic field variation and to model the battery. A TMR sensor is employed to measure the magnetic field of lithium-ion batteries under various conditions, and magnetic field distribution patterns and image features are subsequently identified. A contactless fault diagnosis system is then developed using the convolutional neural network algorithm and a Raspberry Pi 5. The proposed system is demonstrated to reliably diagnose the healthy, aging, anomalies, and swelling of batteries, offering a promising solution for production quality inspection and recycling of lithium batteries."

The system integrates a battery-powered TMS module with a wearable MEP detector, with a total weight of <3.5 kg. The TMS module utilizes a push-pull converter topology to generate a 720 V DC source from a 12 V lithium battery, coupled with a resonant circuit that produces transient currents exceeding 2000 A in a figure-8 coil. The MEP module employs a 361.7 Hz low-pass filter and a 24-bit analog front-end to suppress electromagnetic artifacts and maintains a resolution of 0.08 μV/bit. Experimental results demonstrated a linear magnetic field output (0.38-0.77 T) at ≥ 50% intensity with <1% residual error. MEP recordings from the first dorsal interosseous muscle in five healthy subjects showed amplitudes surpassing the 50 μV threshold (range: 75.2-283.3 μV). While the system's magnetic field intensity limits high-intensity paradigms, its portability enables deployment in emergency settings. Future integration of high-energy-density capacitors may reduce the performance gap with conventional systems."

The first stage employs integrated resource planning and simulations to design cost-optimal decarbonization pathways. The second stage then conducts a detailed resilience analysis, considering factors like equipment damage probability and system-wide impacts, which are quantified using generalized metrics. A case study on the Kinmen region, targeting a 2030 carbon intensity of 0.4 kg CO2e/kWh, examines system resilience against tsunamis. Results indicate that achieving the target requires substantial deployment of solar PV and energy storage to increase renewable energy (RE) penetration and reduce reliance on thermal generation. Findings reveal that decentralized BESS with grid-forming capabilities are critical for system resilience. Moreover, the proposed generalized metrics uniquely capture bidirectional frequency deviations, offering a more effective assessment tool and actionable insights for planners."

    "abstract": "Energy harvesting (EH) is increasingly used in wireless sensor nodes to extend the lifetime of battery-powered devices in remote locations. On such devices, the use of deep neural networks (DNNs) is limited not only by the memory and computational constraints of the system, but also by the often large amount of energy required to perform DNN inference. As a result, continuous DNN inference cannot be guaranteed on such systems, especially under severe power constraints resulting from small battery capacities and solar panel sizes. A promising approach to dynamically adjust the power consumption of DNN inference are early-exit neural networks (EE-NNs), that allow a DNN to exit early at different points during its inference. In this paper, we propose a simulation-aided neural architecture search framework to explore EE-DNN architectures (EENAS) and an online energy manager (EM) that dynamically decides which early exit to take based on the available energy and the EE-NN's confidence in its predictions while ensuring energyneutral operation (ENO). We evaluate our approach on four vision datasets and show not only that our EENAS approach can find EE-NNs with low energy consumption that maintain a high accuracy, but also that our proposed EM can execute the explored EE-NNs with an up to 36 % improved accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art while satisfying the ENO constraints."

    "abstract": "Twitter account recommendations rely on a broad spectrum of factors including language, which influences all spheres of social life. Most notably, virtually every action of informal human communication online is almost exclusively actualized by language. As it largely remains the main stage upon which such communicative acts unfold freely, language is subject to a myriad of minor changes eventually accumulating to discernible patterns indicating lexical, syntactic, or semantic changes giving rise to dialects. Since often they are readable by speakers of the original language, it is statutory to ask whether recommendations can be made based across dialects and, if so, whether it can be deployed on a scalable back end infrastructure. Two use cases using Faiss for storage and Go as the implementation language yield encouraging results."

    "abstract": "Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems face cybersecurity threats that require anomaly detection mechanisms capable of processing long-range temporal dependencies in multivariate time series data. Existing deep learning approaches are lack of efficiency, generative modeling, and adversarial training for industrial environments. While recent advances have introduced state space models like Mamba for various applications, their integration with generative adversarial training for IIoT security remains unexplored. To address these challenges, we propose MambaGuard, a hybrid architecture that combines Mamba state space models, variational autoencoders (VAEs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs) for unsupervised anomaly detection in IIoT environments. Our method uses Mamba’s selective state space mechanism for long-sequence modeling, VAE’s probabilistic framework for latent representations, and GAN’s adversarial training for improved discrimination. The key contribution is the feature-space reconstruction approach that allows all components to work together effectively. We also introduce automated hyperparameter optimization using Bayesian optimization with hyperBand (BOHB) to eliminate manual tuning requirements. Experimental results on four datasets (UNSW-NB15, ToN-IoT, Bot-IoT, and CICIDS2018) demonstrate improvements over existing methods, showing good performance across different network environments and anomaly rates while maintaining efficiency for real-time deployment."

This study presents an enhanced deep learning pipeline, Attention-Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (A-ESRGAN), to address these gaps. By integrating attention mechanisms into the RRDBNet generator within the Real-ESRGAN framework, the model focuses on semantically meaningful regions, such as facial features, inscriptions, and textures, thereby improving perceptual and structural fidelity. We synthetically degraded the curated public-domain dataset with Gaussian blur and JPEG compression to mimic real-world conditions. We evaluated the model on paired low- and high-resolution images using PSNR and frequency-spectrum analysis. Results show that A-ESRGAN enhances PSNR and restores high-frequency details critical for visual clarity and historical interpretation. This research offers a scalable, interpretable framework for ethical and transparent AI-driven digital heritage restoration."

    "abstract": "Breast cancer remains the most prevalent cancer type among women globally, contributing to high mortality and substantial economic and social costs. HER2-positive (HER2+), accounting for 15-20% of cases, represents an aggressive subtype that worsens prognosis without timely treatment. Although HER2-targeted therapies like trastuzumab have improved survival, early diagnosis remains challenging in developing countries due to limited diagnostic infrastructure and high testing costs. This study investigates a cost-sensitive learning (CSL) framework leveraging routinely collected clinical features from the METABRIC dataset to support HER2+ classification in resourceconstrained settings. After data preprocessing and SMOTEbased class balancing, three CSL models-Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and XGBoost-were trained and evaluated. Despite these adaptations, all models struggled to achieve clinically meaningful performance. SVM attained perfect recall (1.00) but extremely low precision (0.12), misclassifying nearly all HER2- cases. XGBoost offered better precision (0.30) but low recall (0.09), while Decision Tree showed modest balance across metrics. These results underscore the difficulty of detecting minority class instances using routine clinical features alone, even with advanced imbalance-handling strategies. CSL, while valuable, cannot fully compensate for limited feature separability. Enhancing diagnostic reliability may require integration of more discriminative yet cost-conscious and interpretable data sources, such as histopathological or molecular inputs. Nonetheless, this study provides empirical insight into the limitations and opportunities of deploying interpretable, resource-aware diagnostic frameworks in constrained healthcare environments."

    "abstract": "Worst-case timing analysis traditionally begins with estimating the worst-case execution time (WCET) of individual tasks using either static analysis or measurement-based techniques. To derive worst-case response times (WCRTs), engineers typically compose these WCETs with bounds on preemption and operating system overheads. However, WCRTs depend on complex system-level interactions, including task communication, OS behavior, and asynchronous events. Compositional analysis often overestimates, assuming that worst-case conditions across components coincide, admitting infeasible global control-flow paths. whole-system Static techniques refine this by modeling the system holistically but require platform-specific tailoring or extensive annotations. A dynamic equivalent has been missing. We present Fret, the first dynamic whole-system approach for estimating WCRTs. Fret employs feedback-guided fuzzing to uncover timing-critical dependencies, including inter-task communication, task/OS interactions, and interrupt effects, without requiring prior knowledge of inputs or states. Implemented using LibAFL and evaluated on FreeRTOS with realistic benchmarks, FRET consistently outperforms state-of-the-art fuzzing strategies in estimating accurate response times. Although not sound, Fret delivers more than timing estimates: it produces actionable artifacts-worst-case inputs, interrupt schedules, and intertask program-flow information-that complement static analyses and support system validation, runtime monitoring, and robust mixed-criticality scheduling."

Performance evaluation was carried out using Bland-Altman and linear regression methods are used to determine the accuracy and correlation. Data was collected from 60 individuals aged between 18 and 25, with each sensor's output being validated by the readings from pulse oximeter. This gives us the variations in measurement consistency and signal quality across the sensors. This analysis provides information for selecting appropriate sensors in health monitoring applications. Additionally, this study addresses a key limitation in the existing literature by presenting a comparative analysis of three distinct types of pulse detection sensors MAX30102, KY-039, and Murata 7BB-15-6LO under uniform experimental conditions, benchmarked against a clinically validated pulse oximeter. While prior studies have independently evaluated the MAX30102 and KY-039, or compared them in limited scenarios, few have incorporated a mechanical-mode piezoelectric sensor such as Murata's 7BB-15- 6LO into a direct comparison with optical sensors. The novelty of this work lies in its multimodal approach, where optical and pressure-based sensing modalities are evaluated together using standardized testing. Additionally, this study enhances methodological rigor by employing both Bland- Altman plots and a suite of statistical performance metrics, including MSE, RMSE, MAE, coefficient of determination <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\left(\\mathbf{R}^{\\mathbf{2}}\\right)$</tex>, and correlation coefficient. These comprehensive metrics allow for a detailed performance characterization, surpassing many earlier comparative works that relied only on correlation or visual agreement. The result is a holistic framework that informs sensor selection in both research and real-world biomedical applications, especially in lowcost or embedded monitoring systems."

One such advancement is LoRa (Long Range) technology, which enables long-range transmission of data with reduced power consumption. The deployment of LoRa devices is a very important issue in the case of large-scale networks. Indeed, the various Spreading Factors (SF) can be sources of interference that significantly impact the performances of a LoRa network. One of the most well-known deployment techniques in LoRa networks is circular deployment around the gateway. LoRa nodes are deployed in circular bands and are assigned spreading factors based on their distance from the gateway. This type of deployment, while interesting, has its limitations when the network scales up. Indeed, in this case, Co -SF interference can severely impact network performance. The main objective of this paper is to find an efficient and optimal deployment of LoRa nodes in a large multi-agricultural area. It follows the same principle of SF allocation as in the case of circular deployment. The major innovation is the division of the area into vertical zones corresponding to crops. Thus, depending on the monitoring requirements of each crop area, LoRa nodes can be activated periodically and independently.."

Initially, the study examines the performance of various machine learning models, including Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), particularly in managing high-dimensional data and capturing nonlinear relationships. Subsequent research efforts focus on improving the overall efficacy of fault detection through feature enhancement of multi-class prediction probabilities and the implementation of multi-model integration strategies. The results indicate that employing a Stacking model significantly enhances Precision by 22.29% and Recall by 3.03% when utilizing a newly devised training dataset inclusive of multi-class prediction probabilities from XGBoost, thereby demonstrating a substantial improvement in predictive performance. This approach illustrates economic viability in reducing prediction costs, especially in practical applications where the advantage is more pronounced as the false negative-to-false positive ratio escalates.

This system is a combination of motion detection, GPS tracking and timely communication to achieve instant alerts when suspicious acts happen. An Arduino microcontroller is used as the central device, and controls a Passive Infrared (PIR) sensor to identify abnormal motion, GPS module to get accurate location of the animal and GSM module to relay SMS alerts to farmers. The coordinates through the GPS are instantly transmitted through GSM when motion is detected; this allows a prompt action to be taken even whenever one is in another place. It has an LCD display for on-site indications of motion status, location information and system diagnostics to ensure monitoring in low mobile network circumstances. The system is built to suit the rural environment and is economically, electrically and environmentally sustainable in terms of cost, energy usage and the potential to work off-grid by using either batteries or solar power. It can be extended in the future by addition of temperature or health monitoring sensors as well due to its modular design. This solution will minimize the need to manually monitor hazards, get alerts quicker once an attack has been detected, and decrease the risk to the livestock, hence guaranteeing farmers more security and freedom of mind and maximum protection of their valuable animals."

Poor posture habits formed during these repetitive actions often lead to serious health concerns like chronic back pain, joint strain, and long-term musculoskeletal disorders. Addressing these challenges necessitates effective, accessible monitoring tools that raise awareness of body positioning and promote corrective actions. This paper presents the development of a low-cost, real-time posture monitoring system that is simple in design, easy to use, and built around a flexible (bend) sensor embedded within a wearable kneecap connected to an Arduino Nano microcontroller. The sensor continuously tracks knee joint movement and generates analog voltage values corresponding to the bending angle, which the Arduino processes to classify the user's activity-sitting, standing, or walking-based on predefined threshold ranges. This proposed system provides a standalone, fully offline solution, displaying posture data instantly on a serial monitor for immediate feedback. Its compactness, low power consumption, and affordability make it suitable for various use cases, including physiotherapy for tracking patient recovery, office settings for posture correction, and personal wellness applications to promote awareness of movement habits."

This paper proposes a method based on the identification of the least recursive squares parameter of the forgetting factor for the location of grounding faults in hydroelectric generators. By establishing the mathematical model of the hydroelectric generator and using the least recursive squares algorithm with the forgetting factor to update and identify the model parameters in real time, the accurate estimation of the grounding fault location can be achieved. The experimental results show that this method has high positioning accuracy and fast convergence speed, and can effectively improve the efficiency and reliability of ground fault location for hydroelectric generators."

    "abstract": "In the course of China's promotion of green and low-carbon energy transformation and the realization of the “dual-carbon” goal, various types of market trading mechanisms have been gradually introduced to optimize the existing trading structure in order to promote the development of the electricity market in a low-carbon direction. Among them, the carbon quota trading mechanism can inhibit the excess emission behavior of traditional energy generators from the source, and reduce the overall carbon emissions by clarifying the supply-side carbon emission rights and responsibilities; the green certificate trading mechanism can effectively stimulate the enthusiasm of renewable energy generators. Therefore, the interactive trading of electricity, carbon quotas and green certificates will play an important role in promoting the optimal operation of the regional electricity market, and thus facilitating the transformation of the energy structure from traditional energy-led to renewable energyled."

The study investigates the performance of a conventional totem-pole boost converter, a dual boost converter, and an advanced totem-pole configuration under identical input and load conditions. The primary objective is to evaluate each topology's effectiveness in improving the power factor, reducing total harmonic distortion (THD), and enhancing overall efficiency in ACDC conversion systems. MATLAB Simulink is used to model each converter topology and simulate their behavior in continuous conduction mode (CCM) with PFC control strategies. Key performance parameters, including input current waveform quality, output voltage regulation, and dynamic response to load variations, are analyzed. Special attention is given to the effectiveness of each topology in achieving near-unity power factor and maintaining low input current distortion. The results provide valuable insights into the trade-offs between control complexity and power quality improvement."

We introduce the PenQuest, a gamified cybersecurity platform that simulates adversarial dynamics with a standard-aligned metamodel made based on various frameworks of MITRE ATT&CK, CAPEC, D3FEND, NIST SP 800-53. As an interactive 2-grouparch strategy game, PenQuest models realistic attack-defense processes of reconnaissance, intrusion, mitigation and recovery on interdependent assets. In a role-playing context, participants experience cybersecurity as attacker and defender forces, each with a distinct set of tools and tactics. Scenario based learning, cascading failures modeling and quantitative risk analysis was comprised by the platform. An experimental investigation with students and practitioners has shown that Pen Quest improves cybersecurity knowledge, decision-making, and strategic thinking. Additionally, the model’s consistency and generality can enable its application in penetration testing planning and AI-based adversarial simulation. In this paper, we describe the underlying metamodel, gameplay mechanics, educational evaluation, and observed limitations while also taking stock of ongoing improvements that we plan on integrating such as reinforcement learning and domain-specific expansions. PenQuest combines gamification and cyber security best practice to innovatively engage risk online and educate across a variety of digital environments."

The accurate forecast of wind speed is vital to ensure optimal power production in wind energy systems, particularly in the wind turbine sector. The volatile nature of wind patterns poses a significant challenge to wind power generation. To overcome this, several techniques of wind speed prediction are applied to improve electricity yield. This research mainly aims to develop deep learning models that incorporate ensemble learning methods, including recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory networks, gated recurrent units, and ensemble models. The performance evaluation metrics of these models are based on the four primary measures: mean squared error, root mean squared error, mean absolute error, and the coefficient of determination. The performance evaluation results indicate that the ensemble learning model outperforms other models significantly in terms of prediction accuracy. In particular, the ensemble learning model obtains a short-term wind speed forecasting accuracy of 0.5252 MSE, 0.7247 RMSE, 0.5302 MAE, and 0.9686 R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>."

    "abstract": "Consensus algorithms are widely adopted in clustered systems to distribute data efficiently, with Raft being a prominent failover algorithm due to its effectiveness and fault tolerance. However, Raft and other consensus algorithms do not provide timing guarantees, limiting their application to time-critical systems such as industrial control systems, drone swarms, and autonomous vehicle networks, where it is critical to distribute state machines in time and prevent multiple timing misses of data. In this paper, we propose CARTEL (Consensus Adapting Real-Time and Efficient Logging), a novel consensus algorithm that integrates time-predictability into the Raft framework. To achieve this aim, we examine Raft's mechanisms and identify the characteristics that impact the timing of data propagation within a distributed system. Based on these insights, we design CARTEL by developing two mechanisms that address the primary limitations of Raft: (i) CARTEL voting to solve the uncertainty of leader election timing, and (ii) CARTEL node buffer to limit the number of indeterminately deferred data during leader failure. Moreover, we propose how to utilize the mechanisms of CARTEL to ensure time-predictability in leader elections and mitigate the indeterminate nature of data logging during leader transitions, without harming the integrity of Raft. We validate the effectiveness of CARTEL through real-world implementation. The experiments confirm that CARTEL not only reduces the uncertainty of system recovery inherent in the election process (by 65.7% compared to Raft) but also enhances the integrity of the distributed system by guaranteeing timely data logging."

    "abstract": "Electroencephalography (EEG) is integral to diagnosing brain disorders, particularly epilepsy. As research advances, there is a significant shift towards mobile and ambulatory EEG systems, necessitating the simplification of traditional setups that typically involve numerous electrodes, thereby increasing cost and complexity. This study harnesses time domain features within EEG recordings, proposing the exclusive use of temporal channels to enhance device practicability. Utilizing the CHB-MIT dataset, we investigate three experimental setups: one employing all available channels, another using six temporal channels (three from each hemisphere), and a third deploying ten channels (five from each temporal region). Our analysis reveals that while the full-channel configuration achieved a True Positive Rate (TPR) of 95 % and a False Positive Rate (FP/hr) of 0.16, the reduced-channel configurations yielded promising results, with only minor decreases in performance metrics. Notably, the ten-channel configuration demonstrated precise seizure focus localization, occasionally surpassing the full setup's performance. This paper substantiates that reducing EEG channels to ten temporal channels can maintain robust detection capabilities, thus supporting the development of more efficient and cost-effective EEG systems."

We formulate the MQTT-AoI optimization problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and propose a novel Whittle index-based scheduling policy. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively minimizes AoI while satisfying resource constraints. Furthermore, we show that the dual variable converge, ensuring the algorithm reaches a feasible solution under the hard constraints. This work provides a practical solution for managing information freshness in MQTT-based IoT networks."

The model is able to leverage the strengths of various expert networks to achieve a high classification accuracy of 93.8%, which is better than various traditional and deep learning-based approaches presented in the literature. Moreover, the model exhibits robustness to outliers and rare object classes, such as carbon-enhanced stars or heavily reddened quasars, thereby offering both improved performance and interpretability relative to monolithic neural networks or static template-matching methods. In addition, by adding uncertainty estimation or Bayesian MoE versions, we can increase the stability of the model in real applications where data quality can be significantly heterogeneous. These projects can assist in pushing the grand goal of enabling rapid and accurate cataloging of stars in the realm of big data astronomy."

This work deals with an optimal photovoltaic-battery energy storage system (PV-BESS) sizing framework for two urban high-rises. The proposed architecture utilizes a shared BESS that buffers the complementary load profiles of the buildings considered in this study. Inter-building energy exchange is facilitated through a common DC bus. Three objectives have been formulated to capture energy reliability, affordability, and grid stress. A multi-objective grey wolf optimization algorithm is applied to these conflicting objectives in order to achieve a balanced, cost-effective, and grid-supportive net-zero energy operation. A comparative study between individual and shared BESS configurations has been performed. The shared BESS with the proposed energy transfer significantly enhances overall grid friendliness by 42%, and lowers deficit energy by 68% with a moderate, justifiable increase in initial investment in the considered buildings. The results confirm that shared BESS-based optimal sizing improves operational efficiency and affordability, thereby promoting net-zero energy attainment in urban settings."

    "abstract": "With the continuous increase in the proportion of new energy sources connected to the power grid, the operational uncertainty of distribution networks has significantly increased. Reasonably configuring and dispatching energy storage systems has become a key approach to enhancing the flexibility, stability, and economic efficiency of the system. This paper takes a typical distribution network as the research object and constructs a joint economic dispatch model that includes battery energy storage and pumped - storage systems. It comprehensively considers factors such as the charging and discharging behaviors of the two types of energy storage, energy state updates, water level changes, and capacity investment, and establishes a joint objective function that includes operating costs and construction costs. To solve this model, an improved multi - particle swarm optimization algorithm is adopted, and simulation verification is carried out in the IEEE 33 - bus distribution network to optimize the dispatch scheme of the system under the typical daily load curve. The results show that the introduction of pumped storage significantly improves the utilization rate of wind power and the economic efficiency of the system. Reasonable configuration of hybrid energy storage can effectively improve the ability of the distribution network to absorb wind and solar energy and its operational stability."

    "abstract": "RGB-D Saliency Object Detection (SOD) is a specialized research area in computer vision that focuses on identifying the most prominent or attention-grabbing objects within a scene using both RGB (color) images and depth information (D). It is used for various applications like image segmentation, video analysis, and object recognition, where highlighting key objects quickly and accurately is essential. The RGB-D SOD methods typically involve deep learning techniques. Lately, many deep learning methods based on encoder-decoder architectures have been introduced. The RD3D model and its improved version (RD3D+) addressed the RGB-D SOD through 3-D convolutional neural networks. In this paper inspired by the RD3D+ deep learning-based model, we propose an improved RD3D+ model, which aims to enhance the performance of salient target detection. Our innovations are reflected in the following: Firstly, based on the RD3D+ model, a deep supervision strategy is introduced for this model, where an auxiliary supervision branch is added for each decoder. Secondly, the Intersection and Union ratio (IoU) loss and the pixel-level Binary Cross Entropy (BCE) loss are combined to be optimized together, which facilitates the rapid convergence of the model and improves the detection capability. The experimental validations show that our improved model has an excellent performance on five benchmark datasets compared with seven state-of-the-art RGB-D SOD approaches in terms of four key evaluation metrics."

    "abstract": "With internet connectivity's dynamic development and network communication escalating, an upward trend in advanced threats and cyber attack crimes is being witnessed, targeting sensitive data and critical systems. As the number of connected devices continues to increase, more opportunities are provided for malicious actors to exploit these vulnerabilities. Therefore, the attack surface expanded, particularly within the Internet of Things (IoT), reinforcing the necessity to design a suitable and adaptable security model for protecting data and minimizing the damage caused by network system intrusions and attacks. Machine learning is a swift and flexible way to develop a cybersecurity model. Clustering and other unsupervised learning techniques are frequently used to find hidden patterns or anomalies without needing labeled data. Still, they are limited in accurately distinguishing between normal and malicious behaviors, particularly when dealing with emerging attacks (such as zero-day attacks). This paper provides a hybrid semi-supervised classification-based clustering approach model to distinguish malicious emerging cyber-attacks. Initially, unsupervised clustering methods were implemented to group related data points and find underlying patterns to the reduced data dimensionality under Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Then, the pseudo-labels generated by clustering were used in supervised tasks with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification. The experiments have been carried out on two IoT datasets, namely MQTTset and IoTID20, and the results confirm that the hybrid strategy is a viable and effective approach to dealing with IoT security issues in complicated and real-world situations."

    "abstract": "Overcharging smartphone batteries is one of fundamental causes of battery degradation. As it can significantly impact their lifespan by the increased battery temperature it causes. Predicting the target time for unplugging the smartphone from the charger has become a hot topic in both academia and industry. In this paper, we propose a new machine learning approach using XGBoost to predict the target unplugging time, the event upon which the user will unplug the phone from the charger, based on the user's charging routine. We integrate our proposed approach into a commercial product that charges the battery at intervals based on the predicted unplugging time. This technique can almost double the average battery lifespan cycle from two to four and a half years in realworld testing. Our proposed technique can help users extend their battery life by avoiding overcharging by predicting the end time of the charging session. Our end-to-end system is introduced in this work, emphasising the prediction machine learning model. To train our model, we used a real-world dataset with different charging routines, achieving an accuracy of 0.94 and an F1-score of 0.91 in real-world testing, not limited to simulation testing. Additionally, our solution provides a reasonably accurate prediction for any charging session, unlike previous work, which focused solely on predicting the longest session."

    "abstract": "Gas leaks pose significant safety and economic risks, and therefore, early detection is an imperative need in industrial as well as residential settings. Conventional gas sensors give reactive signals only after a significant leak occurs, which restricts them from preventing accidents. This work presents a machine learning predictive gas leak detection system deployed on an ESP32 microcontroller based on pressure pattern recognition. Pressure sensor readings are continuously being monitored and analyzed by a trained ML model that detects minor fluctuations and anomalies that signal the development of a leak. A hybrid of LSTM and XGBoost models is employed to detect both gradual and sudden leaks with improved accuracy. In contrast to threshold-based measures, the proposed system utilizes time-series pressure trends to predict possible severe declines before they reach critical points, thus offering an early warning system. Experimental results show that the system provides stable detection accuracy under a resource limited IoT platform. The proposed solution is scalable, low-cost, and holds great promise in improving safety in gas distribution networks, storage facilities, and domestic applications."

    "abstract": "The hybrid modular multilevel converter (HMMC) comprising both full-bridge submodules (SMs) and half-bridge SMs has drawn extensive attention for its cost-effective DC fault ride-through capability. However, IGBT OCF diagnosis-a prerequisite for fault isolation and fault reconfiguration, is critical to the reliability of HMMCs, while relevant research remains scarce. Furthermore, varied OCF scenarios within HMMC further complicate fault diagnosis. To fill this gap, this article first conducts a dual-perspective analysis of IGBT OCFs in HMMCs, covering single and multiple OCF scenarios in an SM. Two unified characteristics are yielded: 1) Unified Characteristic I, derived from the mode-type perspective and reveals that IGBT OCFs cause specific mode-type conversions of the faulty SM; 2) Unified Characteristic II, derived from the switching-function perspective, indicates that the faulty SM maintains a specific switching function. Therefore, a unified characteristics-driven strategy is proposed, including a detection stage and a localization stage. In the detection stage, the suspected faulty SM is selected via Unified Characteristic II and its status is then ascertained using Unified Characteristic I. Upon the identification of a fault, other suspected faulty SMs are screened, with their statuses determined in the ensuing localization stage. Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy."

The method tracks the beam by estimating the spatial response parameters, which include both angle and range, using the first-order differential product between signals from closely spaced and overlapped subarrays. A single-antenna-element displacement between overlapped subarrays introduces phase symmetry, enabling robust and efficient parameter estimation for near-field beam tracking."

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of power electronics, active power filters (APFs) have emerged as a preferred solution for mitigating harmonic resonance in high-voltage direct current (HVDC) systems. APFs can be broadly categorized into current compensation APFs (I-APFs) and resistive APFs (R-APFs), depending on their control strategies. Although both types have demonstrated effectiveness in practical applications, previous studies have not comprehensively compared their resonance mitigation performance, particularly under capacity-limited conditions. To address this gap, this paper establishes an equivalent harmonic model for LCC-HVDC systems with APFs connected and proposes a novel metric, capacity utilization efficiency (CUE), to compare the resonance suppression effectiveness of APFs. The variation characteristics of CUE are systematically analyzed considering factors such as resonance frequency, system damping, and APF capacity. The findings provide a practical guideline to assist utilities in selecting the optimal APF control, accounting for factors such as varying network impedances and background harmonic distortions. Finally, the developed harmonic model and the APF-selection guideline are validated using a real-life LCC-HVDC system experiencing resonance issues and a modified IEEE 39-bus system."

    "abstract": "This paper compares methods for rejecting in-patient scattered photons in PET instruments, which can degrade image quality by introducing bias and noise. The focus is on events where both annihilation photons interact several times in the detection medium. Compton scattering physics and annihilation photon polarization entanglement are utilized. Events are classified by the number of hits in the detector to assess information quality, and the spatial response from lines of response or Compton cones is analysed. A comparison between methods is made through a simulation of an ideal cylindrical detector with a radius of 15 cm and a thickness of 1 cm, using Geant4. Results from the simulations are used to create histograms for the different observables. Metrics, such as receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curves and noise equivalent count (NEC), are used to quantify the efficiency of each method and the influence of hit multiplicity. Alongside this simulation-based investigation, an experiment using a pair of CdZnTe Compton cameras has been set up to validate the entanglement model and its integration simulation. We demonstrate that entanglement information may be considered less valuable, achieving an area under the ROC curve of 52% compared to energy deposition and Compton kinematics, which have an area of 97%. Finally, the obtained detective quantum efficiency (DQE) demonstrates the superiority of Compton cones for low resolution, up to around 0.05 cm-1, followed by the line of response, which achieves a spatial bandwidth of 1.6 cm-1, thus showing the complementarity between the two types of information. This study highlights the importance of Compton kinematics and the limited value of entanglement for rejecting scattered events."

However, this growth has also drawn the attention of malicious actors, with some phishers extending their reach into the Solana ecosystem. Unlike platforms such as Ethereum, Solana has distinct designs of accounts and transactions, leading to the emergence of new types of phishing transactions that we term SolPhish. We define three types of SolPhish and develop a detection tool called SolPhishHunter.

This study utilized COMSOL software and the finite element method to simulate the thermodynamic behavior of a $3 \\times 3$ Micro-LED array. The stress and thermal expansion of the bumps after thermal gradient bonding and isothermal bonding were analyzed. The results indicated that thermal gradient bonding would generate a certain temperature gradient on both sides of the solder bumps, driving Au atoms to diffuse into Sn and form intermetallic compounds. This temperature gradient can alleviate local thermal expansion, significantly reducing the stress and displacement of the bumps compared to isothermal bonding, thereby enhancing the reliability of the device. In addition, thermal gradient bonding can form IMCs in a shorter time, avoiding excessive growth of IMCs due to prolonged isothermal processes."

In this paper, a hybrid ASR system that employs the T5 transformer model in postediting is introduced for improving transcription quality and coherence. Our methodology focuses on utilizing a conventional ASR pipeline to obtain preliminary transcripts followed by a fine-tuned version of the T5 model, which refines errors and makes the transcript readable. We experiment with the system on several corpora, producing significant gains in word error rate (WER) and linguistic clarity. Experimental metrics indicate that the hybrid method not only surpasses baseline ASR models in precision but also achieves greater readability, rendering it especially appropriate for realistic applications like subtitles, meeting records, and virtual assistants. Further, we also investigate the versatility of the model to accommodate variability in speaking behavior and domain terms. The system we suggest points towards the capabilities of transformer-based post-processing in transforming ASR output to make it more human-like and contextually correct. Our research also discusses the computational efficiency of the process, which ensures its practicality for real-time deployment. We also test the robustness of the model over various conditions of noise and speech accent and prove its generalizability."

The consequence of this expansion is an increased pressure on ecosystems in the city as well as on urban fringes and a decrease of ecosystem service provisions. This work presents a multitemporal estimation of built-up area dynamics and its impact on ecosystems along with its service provision for the Taipei City. The area was chosen as it forms and administrative island within the municpality of New Taipei City area which limits expansion. The mutlitemporal assessment is based on pixel classification of Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager data as well as on secondary data derivatives and indices with yearly time slices classified using a U-Net Deep Learning architecture combined with a ResNet50 backbone. The model training accuracy reaches 84 % over all training classes on average and provides consistent results for different time slices, presenting a granular picture complementing the Urban Centre Database grid assessment of human settlements.

    "abstract": "The asymmetric half-bridge flyback (AHBF) converter is widely used in applications such as switch-mode power supplies (SMPS) and low-power chargers etc. However, excitation circulating current is easily induced in light-load conditions under conventional PWM control in the AHBF converter, which will lead to a reduction in efficiency. Owing to the advantages of SiC power devices-including smaller output capacitance ($C_{\\text {oss }}$), no reverse recovery in the body diode, and high-frequency switching capability-this paper proposes a hybrid control strategy for the AHBF LED driver by further leveraging the unique characteristics of SiC devices (specifically stable resonant frequency and low voltage spike amplitude), wherein the switching frequency is reduced during light-load operation. Both upper and lower switches are controlled by a hybrid PWM/PFM scheme to initiate a free-resonance stage. Subsequently, zero-voltage switching (ZVS) turn-on of the main switch can be enabled by a short pulse applied to the clamp switch at the half-bridge voltage valley point to improve the light-load efficiency. The operating principles and operating process of the AHBF driver with the proposed control strategy are analyzed in detail. Key circuit and control parameters are thoroughly designed. Computer simulations were performed, a $160-\\mathrm{W}$ prototype (40 -V/4-A output) was developed, and experimental results have been obtained to verify the feasibility of the AHBF LED driver with the proposed control strategy."

This study develops a synthetic yet empirically anchored dataset for seven emerging offshore technologies—Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC), offshore solar, tidal, wave, floating wind, piezoelectric harvesters, and subsea compressed air storage—across ten geographically diverse marine regions. Real-world anchors were obtained from the International Energy Agency (IEA), National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), and other authoritative databases to construct realistic techno-economic parameters such as Levelized Cost Of Energy (LCOE), Capital And Operational Expenditures (CAPEX/OPEX), Technology Readiness Levels (TRL), and sustainability indices. The analysis reveals that offshore solar and OTEC exhibit relatively stable long-term LCOE trajectories, while floating wind and subsea compressed air storage demonstrate the steepest cost-reduction slopes. Regionally, the Gulf of Mexico and Arabian Sea achieve the lowest average LCOEs, whereas the North Sea and South China Sea remain comparatively higher due to harsher installation and maintenance conditions. Correlation analysis further indicates weak but notable relationships between resource potential and LCOE, suggesting that resource abundance alone is insufficient to guarantee economic viability without supporting policies and technology maturation. The findings highlight the potential of hybridized offshore systems to balance sustainability and affordability, while also providing a reproducible framework for scenario analysis of emerging marine renewables between 2025 and 2050."

However, the development of effective detection models is impeded by challenges such as imbalanced data distributions, limited availability of labeled samples, and the difficulty of tuning deep learning architectures to accommodate diverse threat patterns. In response to these challenges, this paper introduces two novel DenseNet-based frameworks, DN-UBS and DN-GBO, for advanced IoT intrusion detection. The proposed approach begins by applying a variance threshold technique on RT-IoT2022 dataset, to eliminate low-variance features, followed by synthetic minority oversampling technique to alleviate class imbalance and enhance minority class representation. DN-UBS integrates an uncertainty-based sampling strategy to iteratively select the most ambiguous instances for annotation, reducing labeling effort while improving model discriminability. In contrast, DN-GBO incorporates a gradient-based hyperparameter optimization using the hyperband strategy, allowing for automatic adjustment of network depth, learning rate, and regularization parameters. The DN-GBO achieved superior detection performance with an improvement of 7% in accuracy, 4% in F1-score, 12.8% in precision, 6 % in recall, 3 % in Receiver Operating CharacteristicArea Under the Curve (ROC-AUC), and 17.6 % in Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC). Similarly, DN-UBS also delivered high efficacy with an improvement of 5.3 % in accuracy, 3 % in F1-score, 3% in precision, 4.6% in recall, 4% in ROC-AUC, and 10.1 % in MCC, while minimizing reliance on labeled data.

DMS4096+ addresses several limitations inherent in DMS4096 by introducing improvements in key generation, encryption speed, memory usage, and brute-force resistance. The new version maintains the robust 4096-bit key size but incorporates optimized techniques for faster encryption, key management, and improved computational efficiency. To evaluate the performance and security of DMS4096+, we conduct comprehensive experiments comparing it against AES-256, a widely recognized industry standard. Key performance metrics such as encryption time, brute-force resistance, memory usage, and storage size are analyzed. In particular, DMS4096+ demonstrates superior brute-force resistance, with a significantly higher time-to-crack than both AES-256 and the previous DMS4096 algorithm. Additionally, we compare DMS4096+’s key generation time, memory footprint, and encryption efficiency to show its practical viability in real-world applications. The results indicate that DMS4096+ offers not only a substantial increase in security but also notable performance enhancements, making it a strong candidate for use in systems requiring high levels of encryption.

While these methods offer improved control performance over traditional modelbased approaches, they also pose significant computational challenges, particularly for resource-constrained platforms. FieldProgrammable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) offer an attractive solution due to their energy efficiency and customizable architecture. In this work, we propose FALCON, an innovative approach for designing real-time intelligent controllers for autonomous systems using FPGA accelerators. Our approach begins with designing DNN-based intelligent controllers with varying levels of complexity and accuracy on the FPGA platform. Then, a performance function is proposed to capture the interplay among controller complexity, computational behavior, physical system characteristics, and overall control performance. Based on this performance function, we develop an algorithm-hardware codesign framework to determine the optimal control complexity, hardware configuration, and resource allocation. Finally, a case study on the co-design of intelligent controllers and FPGAbased overlay processors, together with a hardware-in-the-loop simulator, is conducted to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed methods. Compared to benchmarking controllers on other platforms, FALCON's optimized intelligent controller using FPGA accelerators shows competitive control performance with superior real-time capability and power efficiency.

    "abstract": "The rapid expansion of wind energy technologies has increased the demand for practical, lab-based training that prepares students and professionals with technical and communication skills essential for safe and efficient operations. In wind energy Feedback system labs, effective instructor–trainee communication is critical, particularly when dealing with complex procedures such as turbine maintenance, performance monitoring, and safety protocols. However, conventional communication methods are often hindered by noisy lab environments, technical jargon misunderstandings, and limited real-time feedback, resulting in reduced clarity and learning efficiency. To address this issue, the paper propose the AI-Enhanced Speech Processing for Wind Energy Feedback system (AISP-WEE) framework, which integrates speech recognition, noise reduction, domain-specific language modeling, and real-time feedback mechanisms to improve clarity and interaction. AISP-WEE employs advanced natural language processing and acoustic modeling to filter ambient noise, transcribe domain-specific instructions, and provide adaptive feedback through bilingual captions, alerts, and interactive prompts. Experimental evaluation in simulated wind lab environments demonstrated that AISP-WEE improved speech recognition accuracy by 28%, reduced communication errors by 33%, and enhanced trainee task performance by 24% compared to traditional verbal instruction methods. These results highlight the potential of AI-driven speech processing systems in improving both the effectiveness and accessibility of wind energy Feedback system. In conclusion, AISP-WEE offers a scalable, intelligent solution that enhances instructor–trainee communication, ensures safety, and fosters more effective experiential learning in renewable energy training environments."

    "abstract": "Plant diseases pose a significant threat to global food security, with potato crops being highly susceptible to fungal infections like Early Blight and Late Blight. While numerous studies have utilized convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify these diseases using image data, most models are trained on clean, ideal datasets and fail under real-world conditions. This paper proposes a robust hybrid model that integrates deep CNN features with handcrafted descriptors such as GLCM, HOG, and PCA for improved disease classification. A custom 4-class dataset is constructed, including a Non-Potato class to simulate practical field deployment scenarios. Experimental evaluations on both 3-class (standard) and 4-class (realistic) datasets show that the proposed hybrid architecture, combined with SMOTE and fine-tuned MLP classifiers, achieves superior performance in terms of accuracy and macro F1-score. The model achieved up to 98.0% accuracy on the 3-class dataset and 85.8% on the challenging 4-class dataset. Extensive ablation studies and feature importance analysis further validate the robustness and generalizability of the framework. This research contributes a scalable, interpretable, and real-world-ready AI solution for precision agriculture."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes an observer-based prescribed-time consensus tracking control method for nonlinear multiagent systems with unknown virtual control coefficients. Existing prescribed-time distributed observers require information about leader input dynamics, which is unavailable in many practical applications. To address the above issue, this paper proposes an improved prescribed-time strategy as a foundation. Then, an auxiliary system is constructed, which removes restrictions on leader input information. With the assistance of such a system, a distributed observer is synthesized, which enables a prescribed-time observation of leader state signals. Meanwhile, by decomposing the virtual control coefficient, a prescribed-time compensation law is investigated to handle nonlinear dynamics and unknown virtual control coefficients. In addition, a prescribed-time control protocol is formulated, which drives the stabilization of the multi-agent systems and the boundedness of all signals for any initial condition. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed control method is evaluated through simulation under three distinct conditions."

We demonstrate how edge computing is a key enabling technology for latency sensitive remote health informatics applications, which aids in achieving highly regulated telemedicine applications. We propose a comprehensive control framework for remote patient monitoring. Furthermore, we examine the impact of distributing cardiovascular disease application modules across multiple edge layers. IFogSim was used to simulate the system under two modes of operation: pulse rate mode and ECG mode. In comparison to cloud-only systems, the results show a reduction of up to 80% in application loop delay, 90% in network usage, and 83% in energy consumption.

    "abstract": "Ensuring safety and reliability in vehicles becomes challenging because traditional diagnostic systems often fail to detect real-time exceptions, leading to delayed responses or serious accidents in the era of intelligent vehicle systems. In this paper, we address this issue with a novel approach based on the Random Forest (RF) method for an interpretable and lightweight anomaly detection framework. The model utilizes four key input features—vehicle speed, engine temperature, brake pressure, and steering angle and predicts abnormal vehicle behavior in real-time. With an accuracy of 94% and an OOB error of 0.22, the model demonstrates good generalization and low variance. According to Gini feature importance, engine temperature is the most significant predictor (importance <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\approx$</tex> 0.75), followed by speed (importance <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\approx 0.15$</tex>) and brake pressure (importance <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\approx \\mathbf{0. 1}$</tex>), which contribute to a lesser extent. Our approach performs competitively with recent advanced models, including CNN, LSTM, and XGBoost, offering advantages of interpretability and lower computational costs. The originality of this work lies in its usefulness for real-time construction processes by being reliable and providing explanatory insights through visualizations such as feature importance plots, prediction confidence curves, and convergence graphs. Due to its ability to both classify and explain anomalous predictions, our model can be easily deployed for smart vehicles, autonomous systems, or preventive maintenance applications, significantly enhancing road safety and vehicle health."

However, lately there has been a turn towards using authentic material in the classrooms and literature provides such a resource. But young children and teenagers seem to have lost interest in reading books since they prefer digital media. So, how can a teacher use literary texts without discouraging their students from studying them? Technology has come to help. Multimodal texts and digital educational games have received increasing attention in recent years as research shows that they affect students’ learning and motivation. They stimulate the students’ imagination and promote skills such as problem solving and collaboration. They help students develop multiliteracies such as visual literacy, cultural literacy, information literacy and critical literacy. In this paper we shall focus on the main steps to consider in this process."

    "abstract": "In India, over 19,500 dialects with 121 major languages are spoken, making accurate communication challenging, thus highlighting the need for effective translation solutions. The existing machine translation systems are often inaccurate and face challenges due to limited or insufficient linguistic data and research for low-resource and code-mixed languages, such as Hinglish. To improve the translation of Hinglish low-resource language, to standard English, we propose a neural machine translation framework comprising four major steps: dataset acquisition, text normalization and pre-processing, translation using multi-lingual transformers, and performance evaluation. The experimentation is performed on two varying-size datasets representing social media discourse: Hinglish-TOP (10896 instances) and PHINC (13738 instances). The datasets are normalized, preprocessed, and passed to the proposed translation system. The translation system comprises Google Cloud Translation API (GAPI), mBART, and MarianMT multi-lingual transformers. The GAPI leverages Google’s pre-trained or translation-focused large language models (LLMs) to offer the scalability, ease of use, and cost-effectiveness of Google Cloud’s infrastructure. The quality of the translation is evaluated using recent evaluation metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, and WER scores. The proposed GAPI+mBART approach obtains better results than existing machine translation techniques/approaches, i.e., an average BLEU score of 0.342, an average METEOR score of 0.512, and 0.692 WER on the PHINC dataset. Also, the proposed GAPI+mBART approach performed better than the proposed GAPI+MarianMT approach on Hinglish-TOP datasets"

The proposed method identifies layers that can be approximated within given accuracy requirements, while taking into account the number of operations relevant to FPGA implementation. In our experiments, the proposed method was applied to five QCNN models, and the resulting approximated QCNN models were implemented on an FPGA. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through evaluations of circuit area, execution time, dynamic power consumption, and energy consumption."

This paper proposes an enhanced algorithm that combines the Dueling DQN architecture with an adaptive target network update mechanism. The mechanism dynamically adjusts the update frequency of the target network based on the Bellman error and Q-value stability, thereby improving the stability and performance of the training process. Experimental results in the CartPole-v1 environment show that the Adaptive DQN outperforms both Fixed DQN and Dueling DQN in terms of average reward and stability. Specifically, the Adaptive DQN achieves average rewards that are 88.11% and 36.58% higher than Fixed DQN and Dueling DQN, respectively. Moreover, the average Bellman error of Adaptive DQN is reduced by 84.25% compared to Fixed DQN and by 82.91% compared to Dueling DQN. In path planning tasks within the FrozenLake-v1 environment, Adaptive DQN also demonstrates superior success rates and stability. It achieves a success rate of 0.015, which is significantly higher than the 0.008 for Fixed DQN and 0.008 for Dueling DQN. Additionally, the path length planned by Adaptive DQN is notably shorter at 25 steps, compared to 33 steps for Fixed DQN and 81 steps for Dueling DQN. In the continuous maze environment, Adaptive DQN effectively mitigates ineffective exploration behaviors in robotic path planning, enhancing the efficiency of reaching the target point. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the Adaptive DQN in enhancing the efficiency and stability of path planning."

The model incorporates the Stackelberg game structure that naturally occurs in the information structure and decision sequence, where the aggregator assumes the role of a leader and the participating consumers play the role of followers. The aggregator aims to reduce the most electricity consumption during on-peak hours so that it can obtain most commission and similarly, the consumers aim to save some electricity bills and get more rewards. The proposed model is demonstrated to be effective in load control, helping the aggregator to meet the target reduction while the consumers pay a cheaper electricity bill. We also discuss a way to incorporate fairness into all consumers with a tradeoff for the profit and the performance."

Existing adversarial methods often suffer from a trade-off between imperceptibility and attack strength, either producing noticeable outliers or requiring excessive point displacements. In this paper, we propose a novel unsharp-inspired adversarial perturbation that leverages low-rank approximation to balance global structure preservation and fine-detail manipulation. Specifically, the point cloud is decomposed via eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) into global and residual components, where the low-rank reconstruction captures the overall shape and the residual highlights salient details. Perturbations are then selectively applied to these fine-detail regions and smoothed according to local magnitude and orientation, ensuring geometric consistency. Extensive experiments on ModelNet40 and ShapeNet-Part using PointNet and DGCNN demonstrate that our method achieves 100% attack success rate while significantly reducing geometric distortion compared to state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the effectiveness of spectral-domain low-rank modeling for generating adversarial point clouds that are both strong and imperceptible."

    "abstract": "In response to the problems faced by synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images in detecting ships in complex near-shore scenarios, such as low signal-to-noise ratio of small targets and limited feature representation capacity of a single SAR mode, and also due to the fact that real optical images in near-shore areas are often affected by conditions like clouds and day/night, and thus difficult to be real-time registered with SAR images. We propose an unsupervised multimodal SAR image ship detection network (SAR-UMSDN) with its performance enhanced by deriving multimodal inputs from SAR data. SAR-UMSDN consists of a self-supervised SAR image enhancement network (URSIEN), SAR colorization module based on generative adversarial networks (cGAN4ColSAR), and multimodal detection model. URSIEN performs unlabeled illumination–reflection decoupling and detail restoration to enhance the original SAR image, while cGAN4ColSAR maps the single-channel SAR image onto a pseudo-color image with rich optical textures. We use images of these two modalities as inputs to the multimodal SAR-UMSDN for ablation tests, model comparisons, and other evaluations. URSIEN achieves a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 28.63 dB and inference speed of 0.0017 s for a model size of 0.4 million parameters, improving most indicators compared with other image enhancement models. After applying URSIEN, the mean average precision at 0.5 (mAP@0.5) of SAR-UMSDN is 0.4% higher than that of the baseline model, and after using cGAN4ColSAR, mAP@0.5 is 1.9% higher than that of the baseline model. The combined effect of the two components improves the SAR-UMSDN mAP@0.5 to 93.5%. SAR-UMSDN outperforms 10 baseline models and 7 state-of-the-art models, with its mAP@0.5–0.95 (67.4%) being superior to that of traditional single-modal and mainstream baseline models, showing improvements of 1.4–2.7%. The generalization experiments conducted on six public ship datasets have shown that SAR-UMSDN has a significant advantage in ship detection within SAR images.

It then uses this signal directly as a dynamic weight to adaptively integrate the outputs of two complementary expert models: a high-precision LSTM-Attention for known patterns and a high-recall Isolation Forest for unknown threats. This synergy, reinforced by an adaptive update layer to mitigate concept drift, achieves F1-scores of 99.39% and 96.97% on the CSIC 2010 and ATRDF 2023 datasets, respectively. Performance tests in a production-like environment further validate its practical viability, demonstrating that this high accuracy is achieved with a justifiable overhead. An ablation study highlights the pivotal role of our fusion engine: disabling it results in a sharp decline in F1-score on the ATRDF 2023 dataset, from 96.97% to 11.47%, demonstrating its critical contribution to robust, dual-model collaboration."

    "abstract": "The recent launch of the Chinese FengYun-3G/3F (FY-3G/3F) satellites provides new opportunities for Earth observation enabled by their unique combination of non-sun-synchronous and sun-synchronous orbits. This study provides the first comprehensive evaluation of the Level-1 brightness temperature (BT) products from both the FY-3G MWRI-RM and FY-3F MWRI-II microwave imagers. Using a globally collocated dataset with the GPM Microwave Imager (GMI) as the reference, we assess the radiometric consistency through direct comparison and quantify the random errors of using the Triple Collocation (TC) method. Results show that both two sensors have high consistency and low systematic bias, with Mean Bias Deviations (MBD) generally below 1.0 K and Root Mean Square Deviations (RMSD) of lower than 3.0 K for most channels. Nevertheless, the TC results uncover a significant performance divergence in their random errors, particularly over land. Specifically, MWRI-II exhibits a high level of performance, with an overall Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) over barren land of 0.72 K, compared to 0.82 K for GMI. In contrast, while the MWRI-RM performs well over oceans, its TC-derived errors are substantially larger over vegetated land, reaching a peak RMSE of 4.67 K. The findings from this study suggest that the FY-3F MWRI-II BT has good potential in a wide range of scientific applications, while the FY-3G MWRI-RM BT, though valuable for oceanic studies, requires substantial refinement of its land surface processing to realize its full potential."

    "abstract": "The growing adoption of electronic personal health records (ePHRs) demands cryptographic solutions that ensure secure and efficient data access. Threshold cryptography provides a framework for controlled multi-party access, yet existing schemes face practical limitations. Many require trusted key dealers, creating single points of failure and key escrow vulnerabilities, while others rely on pairing-based constructions that scale poorly. Furthermore, batch-oriented processing in previous schemes fails to support individual on-demand access patterns typical in healthcare applications. We propose a Distributed Identity-Based Threshold Decryption (DIBTD) scheme that addresses these limitations. First, our protocol removes all trusted setup assumptions through a fully distributed key generation mechanism based on verifiable secret sharing. Second, it achieves constant-time encryption and decryption operations, independent of committee size, by using efficient elliptic curve operations on secp256k1 rather than computationally heavy pairings, yielding up to 56× faster encryption than prior work. Third, DIBTD integrates the detection of malicious actors via zero-knowledge proofs, allowing the dynamic exclusion of compromised participants during system initialization. We provide formal security proofs showing the security of IND-CCA2 in the random oracle model under the discrete logarithm of the elliptic curve (ECDLP) and computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) assumptions. The scheme remains secure against adaptive adversaries that control up to <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$t-1$</tex-math></inline-formula> participants. Experimental evaluation demonstrates practical efficiency: ciphertexts of only 86 bytes, constant 33-byte public keys, and sub-millisecond encryption latency. A pure Rust implementation on commodity hardware achieves 0.065ms per patient record while maintaining 128-bit security."

To address these issues, an imaging algorithm called General Radon Fourier Transform-Modified Niching Particle Swarm Optimization (GRFT-MNPSO) with low computational complexity is proposed. First, this algorithm employs NPSO to distribute particles around the potential peaks of the received signal in the GRFT domain for preliminary search. Then, a hierarchical clustering algorithm is used to cluster these particles around each peak to form subpopulations. Subsequently, GRFT-PSO is applied to each subpopulation to refine the peak locations in the GRFT domain. Based on the estimated peak locations, high-quality ISAR images can be constructed. The proposed algorithm has low computational complexity while maintaining diversity, convergence and estimation accuracy, and performs well even in low SNR conditions. Experiments on both simulated and real data demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm."

    "abstract": "We consider 2nd generation (2G) Quantum Repeaters (QR) for creating long-distance entanglement in quantum networks. Combining a distance-dependent depolarizing error model with the non-local Bell-state purification procedure required by 2G QRs leads to an error model consisting of correlated and biased errors. To correct correlated errors, non-symmetric CSS codes with joint decoding between stations can be used. The dominating errors are biased, such that different repeater stations suffer from different types of errors. To mitigate this, different quantum codes can be used at the stations, optimized for the specific error model of the station. To comply with the 2G QR procedure, the codes used in neighboring stations must allow for the transversal implementation of non-local logical CNOT gates across the two stations, or alternatively, non-local CZ gates combined with logical Hadamards. We provide a complete characterization of pairs of Calderbank-Steane-Shor (CSS) codes that allow CNOT- or CZ-transversality, and examine an explicit family of mirrored CSS codes allowing CZ-transversality. We verify the Hadamard gate transversality using our framework and show the importance of the mapping matrix. Also, we conclude that using different QECCs can not achieve transversal universal computation with Clifford + <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$T$</tex-math></inline-formula>-gate set. Finally, we study the entanglement generation rate (EGR) in 2G QRs with limited quantum memory, minimizing the number of intermediate stations for a given fidelity and EGR.

Existing accelerators struggle to balance timesteps, accuracy, and energy efficiency, while hardware-oriented timestep compression remains underexplored. To address these challenges, this work presents STISA, a unified algorithm-hardware co-design framework featuring: 1) a Temporal Splitter Compression (TSC) technique with a Temporal Split Structure (TSS) to reduce temporal redundancy while preserving network dynamics; 2)a hardware-efficient spatiotemporal parallelism scheme, which co-optimizes dataflow and architecture through a Temporal-Prioritized Output-Stationary (TPOS) mapping and a flexible Block-Mux Streaming (BMS) architecture; and 3) a joint TSC-TPOS-BMS co-optimization framework featuring a bandwidth-aware resource allocation strategy to achieve balanced accuracy, latency, and energy efficiency across diverse network architectures. On the algorithmic side, TSC reduces synaptic operations by 24.44%-51.71% while achieving competitive accuracies of 96.38%, 81.10%, 68.51%, and 82.40% on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and DVS-CIFAR10, respectively.

However, since the upper bound is usually unknown and large, the resulting stepsizes are not only difficult to determine in practice but also overly conservative, which leads to slow convergence. To solve this issue, we propose an adaptive stepsize strategy for a typical asynchronous optimization method—the Incremental Aggregated Gradient (IAG) method. Unlike existing methods in the literature, our stepsize does not rely on any delay information and is less conservative, which leads to easier stepsize determination and faster convergence. Under standard assumptions, we provide the convergence rate of IAG with the proposed stepsize. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our stepsize over alternative stepsize strategies."

    "abstract": "As the penetration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) increases rapidly, the power system's transient stability is facing severe challenges. Grid-forming converters (GFMC) with voltage-frequency support capability are in urgent need of investigation. Conventional power-synchronization based GFMCs need a constant DC-link voltage (DV), which is not always available. DV synchronization control (DVSC) that can spontaneously maintain constant DV has better adaptability in practice. However, the transient stability of DVSC-based GFMC is relatively complicated and has been rarely studied due to its frequency-related varying inertia and internal voltage. In this paper, the kinetic and potential energy of DVSC-based GFMC is analytically deduced, which captures the impact of frequency-related varying inertia and internal voltage. Based on equal area criterion (EAC), the transient stable boundary of DVSC-based GFMC is accurately quantified through an iterative method. Further, the influence of different control parameters on transient stability is revealed. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the transient stability analysis results."

Through a systematic literature review guided by five research questions, we analyze how this relational explosion intensifies across IoX domains—spanning IoT, IoP, and IoTk—and undermines the efficacy of Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI) in managing dynamic, heterogeneous environments. This review proposes that Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) offers a transformative solution, enabling adaptive reasoning, cognitive firewalls, and unified decision-making to navigate complex relationship networks. AGI-driven methodologies enhance system resilience, security, and efficiency in aggregating, moderating, and evolving relationships across CPST spaces. The paper outlines a classification of relationship types, evaluates AGI’s advantages over ANI, and proposes a future research roadmap emphasizing ethical governance, human-AGI collaboration, and sustainable architectures. By framing IoX development around the management of relationship explosion, we provide a roadmap for future research, emphasizing interdisciplinary efforts, ethical governance, and sustainable frameworks to foster intelligent, socially aware IoX ecosystems."

The ASDIDT (Adaptive Skill Development and Intelligent Diagnostics Training) framework is suggested as a method for resolving these challenges. This framework utilizes AI, adaptive learning algorithms, and simulations to provide a tailored and constantly changing training environment. Furthermore, ASDIDT draws upon real-time diagnostic data from EVs and concurrently alters its training modules according to performance. Technicians can develop their skills with an AI-enabled simulation, a customized learning path, and diagnostic tools in the proposed platform. This ensures that the development of the EV workforce can be flexible and ramped up.

The design of JFET region influences both the device’s characteristic and reliability.The electric fieldshielding effect is greatly enhanced when the distance between the two adjacent p -well regions ($\\mathrm{W}_{\\text {JFet }}$) is reduced. However, this can aggravate the conduction performance of SiC planar-gate MOSFETs as the narrow JFET region contributes a large proportion of device resistance in conduction mode. SiC MOSFETs are used as power switches in circuits without clamp protection, which results in the device operating in avalanche mode. In this work, the effects of JFET region width on the avalanche reliability of 1200 V planar gate SiC MOSFET devices with narrow JFET region designs were investigated. The avalanche capability of the devices with the different JFET region widths was compared through the unclamped inductive switching (UIS) tests. The results show that the device of $\\mathrm{W}_{\\text {JFET }}=1.6 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ has the weakest avalanche robustness. TCAD simulation demonstrate that the primary failure mechanism of the devices is the source metal melting. When the $\\mathrm{W}_{\\text {JFet }}$ less than $1.6 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$, the proportion of P+ region decreases, leading the avalanche current density increases. The enhanced electrical stress causes the weaken avalanche robustness. The current path during the avalanche process shifts from the bottom of the P+ region to the corner region of the P -well as the $\\mathrm{W}_{\\mathrm{JFet}}$ more than $1.6 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$. This shift leads to a relocation of the internal hotspot, which is the primary reason for the enhanced avalanche capability of the devices."

    "abstract": "The main motivation of this paper arises from the fact that some complex systems have high demands for time precision, which need to reach the desired state in a pre-specified time interval. This paper addresses the predetermined-time output projective synchronization of coupled fuzzy neural networks. To mimic the uncertainty and relatedness among complex systems, coupled fuzzy neural networks are introduced to characterize complex systems in this paper. First, a novel controller is developed by means of a generalized exponential function and output states information, which can effectively avoid the chattering situations arising from the sign function. Under the controller, the output states of coupled fuzzy neural networks eventually converge to the projective state in the predefined time, which can reduce the requirements for sensor devices and improve the flexibility and efficiency of the control scheme. Second, in light of Lyapunov function and inequality techniques, sufficient criteria for ensuring to achieve the predetermined-time output projective synchronization of coupled fuzzy neural networks are deduced based on the assumption of the digraph containing a spanning tree. Furthermore, the results obtained in this paper not only represent an extension of master-slave systems but also demonstrate that the output synchronization of coupled fuzzy neural networks is a specific case of projective synchronization exemplified by a corollary. Finally, numerical examples are offered to reveal the correctness of theoretical results."

    "abstract": "Due to high computational complexity, the design of Deep Neural Network (DNN) accelerators faces significant challenges, including high power consumption and considerable area overhead. While Stochastic Computing (SC) provides a way to reduce hardware overhead in DNN accelerator design, it has lower computing accuracy compared to traditional methods. The reason is that randomized bit-stream representations introduce statistical errors and sensitivity to correlation between input streams, leading to significant computing errors in the multiplyaccumulate operation. To mitigate the accuracy limitations inherent in stochastic computing (SC), in this work, we introduce the Integrated Multiply-Accumulate (IMAC) architecture, which enhances precision while maintaining SC's hardware efficiency. The IMAC uses an Accumulating Bipolar-to-Unipolar Converter (ABUC) and a Correlating Linear Gain (CorrGain) to correct the scaling errors from SC adders. To further reduce the area and power overhead, we employ a toggle flip-flop (TFF)-based adder tree and hardware sharing in this work. Compared to traditional SC-based MAC design, the proposed IMAC can reduce MSE by 64.3%-90.6% and improves throughput-to-error ratio by <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$2.77 \\times-10.68 \\times$</tex>. Integrating the proposed IMAC into the LeNet-5 architecture allows LeNet-5 with IMAC to achieve the same inference accuracy as conventional LeNet-5 without IMAC."

While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has shown promise as a foundational vision model for generic segmentation, its generalization to medical imaging-particularly through transformer encoders and prompt-based adaptation-remains an active research frontier. This systematic review evaluates SAM-based approaches for multi-modality medical image segmentation, analyzing adaptation strategies (e.g., fine-tuning, prompt engineering) and benchmarking performance against conventional models like nnUNet. From an initial pool of 100 papers, we rigorously selected 15 peer-reviewed studies (2023-2025) sourced from PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and arXiv, based on inclusion criteria focusing exclusively on medical image segmentation using SAM's generalized architecture. Our findings reveal that fine-tuned SAM variants (e.g., MedSAM) achieve comparable performance to traditional models in 2D segmentation but exhibit limitations in 3D tasks. Prompt-based methods (e.g., TV-SAM) reduce annotation time by 40-60%, while architectural modifications (e.g., SAM-Att) improve accuracy by 8-15%. Beyond performance, we identify critical barriers to clinical adoption, including scalability and domain shift. This review synthesizes empirical evidence to highlight SAM's potential and constraints in medical imaging, offering actionable insights for future research in generalizable AI-driven segmentation."

    "abstract": "The characteristics of laser-induced plasma exhibit considerable potential for industrial applications in fields such as electrical engineering, environmental monitoring, medical and health sciences, and laser processing, thereby demonstrating significant research value. However, current understanding of the formation and evolution mechanisms of laser-induced plasma remains limited. It is well recognized that both the initial plasma parameters and external environmental conditions play critical roles in determining the behavior of laser-induced plasma. In this study, a numerical model of laser-induced plasma under vacuum conditions was established based on the Particle-in-Cell (PIC) method using the VSim simulation software. The model investigates the dynamic processes of laser-plasma interaction and the associated diffusion characteristics. A two-dimensional spatial domain coupled with three-dimensional momentum space was constructed to simulate the evolution of the pre-formed plasma generated by the interaction between laser pulses and a copper target. To address the challenge of representing an infinite physical space within a finite computational domain, absorbing boundary conditions and the Perfectly Matched Layer (PML) technique were implemented. Convergence verification and validation of the PML absorption coefficients were also conducted to ensure the stability and accuracy of the numerical computations. The simulation results indicate that the proposed model is capable of effectively capturing the early-stage evolution of laser-induced plasma. These findings offer theoretical support for the advancement and application of laser-induced plasma technologies in electrical engineering and related disciplines."

The conventional fuel gauges lack accuracy and do not always give an accurate reading. To address this, FUELSPARK integrates GPS and a microcontroller-based float sensor to enable real-time fuel tracking. When the fuel level is so low, the system is designed such that it sends out an alarm via a buzzer and finds the nearest gas stations based on geospatial (latitude and longitude) mapping. Drivers are provided with an onboard LCD screen to view critical data such as the volume of fuel, an approximate mileage estimate as well as the route to the nearest fuel station. Unlike conventional systems FUELSPARK shifts fuel monitoring towards intelligent and predictive monitoring. By comparing fuel consumption cycles and range travelled, the system enables more accurate mileage estimation. This helps motorists to plan trips efficiently and avoid unexpected fuel shortages. Efficiently and prevent inauspicious shortage of fuel. Tested in different automobile classes, FUELSPARK has proven to be more responsive, reliable, and easy to integrate, which is why it is classified as a smart vehicle technology and practical step.

First, a bi-level decision-making framework is established for wind-pumped storage hybrid systems participating in electricity markets: the upper level maximizes the expected revenue of wind farms and pumped storage stations in joint energy-frequency regulation markets while quantifying wind power uncertainty risks through CVaR; the lower level minimizes electricity procurement costs for market clearing. The bi-level model is transformed into a solvable single-level mixed-integer linear programming problem using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions and strong duality theory. Numerical simulations are conducted on a modified 30 -bus system. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework maintains the revenue of wind farms and pumped storage stations while effectively mitigating extreme market risks, reducing revenue volatility by 36.3% compared to conventional methods and decreasing maximum potential losses in extreme scenarios by 42.1%. This enhanced revenue stability enables decision-makers to control CVaR within an acceptable range at <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{9 5 \\%}$</tex> confidence level, significantly improving investment decision predictability and system operational robustness.

The framework encompasses various dynamic visualization modules, including density plots, pie charts, histograms, and line charts, that effectively reveal distinct aspects of treatment patterns and patient characteristics over the population. Our results show ChemoInsight can be used in early‑stage tumor detection, revealing gender‑based disparities in tumor staging patterns, capturing seasonal and long‑term fluctuations in advanced‑stage diagnoses, and highlighting age‑related prevalence trends.

Precise planetary landing is a classical control problem in aerospace engineering, which requires that the spacecraft decelerates/repels, orients and lands safely under uncertain dynamics with limited fuel. Conventional control techniques like PID and model predictive control need good models and substantial tuning. In this paper we explore the ability of recent reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to learn such control policies directly from interaction with a physics simulator. We compare our approach against four popular algorithms - Deep Q-Network (DQN), Double DQN, Dueling DQN and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) on OpenAI Gymnasium and LunarLander-v2 benchmark. We present a unified PyTorch implementation, conduct multi-seed experiments and compare in terms of convergence speed, stability of rewards and computation efforts. We observe that PPO achieves competitive rewards in a quarter of training time compared to value-based methods, while the best peak reward is obtained by Dueling DQN. We discuss for real world autonomous landing and other high risk robotic tasks."

    "abstract": "Although face forgery detection has achieved considerable progress in recent years, many existing approaches display high accuracy on specific datasets but still struggle to generalize effectively to novel datasets produced by diverse image manipulation techniques. To address this limitation, we present a detection framework that jointly exploits frequency-domain, local spatial, and global spatial features. The design is motivated by the observation that frequency-domain artifacts tend to be more consistent across different forgery methods compared to spatial-domain artifacts. Building on this insight, we construct a frequency-guided multi-feature fusion architecture.In the frequency stream, multi-scale Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) features are combined with 8×8 block-level Discrete Fourier Transform (B-DFT) features, where the latter are efficiently computed using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). This combination enables the extraction of spectral patterns that are widely shared across manipulation techniques. The derived frequency information then guides the feature-level fusion between local spatial features, obtained via an Xception network, and global representations captured by the Swin-Transformer V2, thereby improving the robustness of spatial-domain analysis. At the decision level, the outputs from all three streams are integrated to further enhance detection accuracy.Ablation experiments indicate that the proposed fusion strategy increases the accuracy of the Swin-Transformer V2 and Xception baselines by 3.09% and 3.75%, respectively. Cross-dataset evaluations further demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms multiple state-of-the-art approaches in terms of generalization capability, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed framework."

    "abstract": "The widespread adoption of IoT devices has fundamentally altered digital connectivity, facilitating real-time data exchange and autonomous interactions worldwide. While this transformation offers significant operational advantages, it also introduces critical security challenges, particularly concerning the Identity and Access Management (IAM) of non-human identities such as sensors, devices, machine agents, and service accounts. Traditional perimeter-based security models, which rely on static trust boundaries and implicit trust for internal actors, have been used over the years for human identities. However, they are inadequate for non-human identities. Their limitations have led to a growing interest in Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA), a cutting-edge security concept, built upon the foundational rule of \"never trust, always verify\". This paper explores the application of ZTA in securing IoT ecosystems, with a specific focus on managing nonhuman identities. It investigates ZTA’s core tenets, like least privilege, micro-segmentation, continuous monitoring, and identity-centric access control—and analyses how these can be effectively implemented in resource-constrained IoT environments. The study identifies key implementation challenges and considerations for the use of ZTA in IoT. The findings of this paper highlight that ZTA, when properly implemented, offers a robust framework for mitigating cyber risks inherent in IoT ecosystems. Finally, the paper outlines future research directions, aimed at integrating ZTA into IoT environments. Ultimately, this work contributes to the growing body of knowledge advocating for Zero Trust as a foundational approach to modern IoT security."

    "abstract": "Research on underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) has been significant for applications such as forecasting adversity and disaster, hydrological and military surveillance, seepage monitoring, and underwater triangulation. These networks however, face challenges like significant delay spread, soaring interference, noise, jarring environments, poor connectivity, and restricted battery life. They also cause significant problems in terms of energy efficiency and network longevity. Nodes in UWSNs are subject to additional limitations, including fluctuating ambient conditions, large propagation delays, and limited energy supplies. Designing routing protocols for UWSNs is a promising solution to overcome these issues. The Adaptive Fuzzy Energyefficient Clustering and Energy Optimization (AFECEO) protocol, proposed especially for UWSNs, is thoroughly evaluated in this study in comparison to six popular clustering protocols: GEC, LEACH, PEGASIS, DCHS, DEEC, and LGCA. The fuzzy logic-based adaptive clustering process used by AFECEO dynamically chooses cluster heads by taking into account variables including distance to the sink, node residual energy, and underwater communication difficulties such as acoustic signal attenuation. According to simulation data, under various underwater settings, AFECEO performs better than its competitors in a number of critical performance parameters, such as average remaining energy, dead node count, and network longevity. Notably, AFECEO outperforms conventional protocols in terms of residual energy by up to 45% and dead node reduction by 60 %, guaranteeing improved energy optimization and dependable data transfer in UWSNs. This study demonstrates how well AFECEO works as a reliable option for energy-efficient communication in submerged settings, opening the door for more advanced monitoring and exploration uses."

    "abstract": "India has recently ascended to the third position globally in solar power generation, marking a significant milestone in its renewable energy trajectory. The nation's solar capacity has witnessed exponential growth, surging from 2.6 GW in March 2014 to approximately 123.13 GW as of August 2025[1]. This includes 93.90 GW from groundmounted solar plants, 20.85 GW from grid-connected rooftop installations, and additional contributions from hybrid and off-grid systems. The National Institute of Solar Energy (NISE) has estimated India's solar potential at approximately 748 GW[1], underscoring the vast untapped opportunity for clean energy expansion. As India continues to integrate new solar connections into its electrical infrastructure, particularly at the distribution level, it becomes imperative to evaluate the technical feasibility and grid stability implications of such additions. Uncoordinated integration can lead to voltage fluctuations, reverse power flows, and protection malfunctions, especially in radial distribution networks. This paper presents a structured methodology for assessing the impact of proposed solar connections on the distribution electrical network. The approach includes load flow analysis, voltage profile assessment, fault level evaluation, and hosting capacity estimation to ensure reliable and secure grid operation while facilitating the country's transition to a sustainable energy future. In this paper we would like to share the methodology to analyze the technical feasibility & impact of new solar connection on Distribution electrical network."

    "abstract": "The creation of LLMs which focus on specific domains will enable new opportunities for analyzing healthcare conditions while also performing legal tasks in the future. The chapter examines the complete characteristics and evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) in modern artificial intelligence as well as their essential contribution to contemporary systems. The discussion shows how LLMs can resolve complicated language problems while enabling human-computer communication and multimodal information learning. The review demonstrates how Large Language Models reshape different sectors in society including education and healthcare and they influence the finance sector and entertainment industry. The exceptional performance of LLMs comes with substantial difficulties particularly regarding their costly operations and demanding training requirements alongside empathy-intensive interpretation of their judgment methods. Ongoing research must focus on model efficiency as well as explainable approaches and sustainable AI practices because these challenges exist. The adoption of responsible AI development procedures becomes vital because of ethical risks which include privacy violations as well as bias and misinformation challenges. Building fair and transparent AI-driven technologies requires full cooperation between policymakers, researchers and industry stakeholders to create guidelines focused on accountability. The upcoming era of LLM technology development will rely on fresh approaches to explain analysis methods while adopting power-efficient training processes and enhanced interpretability software frameworks. The deployment of LLMs between practical execution objectives and moral principles enables progress in natural language processing and their suitable implementation throughout various disciplines. The future success of AI depends on how human beings utilize LLM technology with both knowledge and responsibility to generate maximum positive impact alongside risk management."

    "abstract": "Current Text-to-SQL methods are evaluated and only focused on executable queries overlooking the semantic alignment challenge both in terms of the semantic meaning of the query and the execution results correctness. Even execution accuracy itself shows significant drops when moving from English to other languages, with an average decline of 6 percentage points across non-English languages. We address these challenges by presenting a new framework that combines Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) within a multilingual contrastive reward signal to enhance both task efficiency and semantic accuracy in Text-to-SQL systems in cross-lingual scenarios. Our method teaches models to obtain better correspondence between SQL generation and user intent by combining a reward signal based on semantic similarity. On the seven language MultiSpider dataset, finetuning the Llama-3-3B model with GRPO improved the execution accuracy up to 87.4% (+26 pp over zero-shot) and semantic accuracy up to 52.29% (+32.86 pp). Adding our contrastive reward signal in the GRPO framework further improved the average semantic accuracy to 59.14% (+6.85 pp, up to +10 pp for Vietnamese). Our experiments showcase that a smaller parameter efficient 3B llama model finetuned with our contrastive reward signal outperforms a much larger zero shot 8B llama model with uplift of 7.43pp on execution accuracy from 81.43% on 8B model to 88.86% on 3B model and cutting close on semantic accuracy with 59.14% on 3B vs 68.57% on 8B just with 3,000 reinforcement learning training examples. These results demonstrate how we can improve the performance of Text-to-SQL systems with contrastive rewards for directed semantic alignment without requiring huge amounts of datasets for training."

    "abstract": "The rapid integration of renewable energy into the energy mix has resulted in transmission line power flows becoming increasingly constrained. Traditionally, transmission system operators have relied on a conservative Static Line Rating (SLR) approach. In contrast, Dynamic Line Rating (DLR) is an innovative approach that potentially increases transmission headroom by accounting for the spatial and temporal variability of parameters that influence line ratings. During early-stage planning, a high-level potential assessment of DLR is crucial to identify lines that benefit the most. In this study, a geospatial assessment methodology is implemented to evaluate the potential benefits of DLR using historical weather data of wind speed, wind direction, solar radiation and ambient temperature. These parameters are spatially mapped to individual transmission lines to identify lines that potentially benefit the most from DLR. This work represents the first regional-scale DLR potential assessment in South Africa. Results demonstrate the ability of DLR to unlock additional headroom on overhead lines with some lines rating above the SLR for over 90% of the year. This shows how DLR can unlock additional transfer capability, highlighting its value as a short- to medium-term measure to relieve transmission constraints and enable higher renewable energy integration while long-term grid reinforcements are developed."

The device architecture incorporates $50-\\mathrm{nm}$-wide fins to strengthen electrostatic control, while a tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) surface treatment is employed to improve surface quality and suppress interface-related defects. The combination of LPCVD-SiN ${ }_{x}$ and ALD-AlN enables strong polarization-induced modulation and reduced interface trap density, thereby stabilizing the gate potential. As a result, the fabricated enhancement-mode (E-mode) MIS-HEMTs exhibit a positive $V_{\\text {TH }}$ of 0.2 V (at $1 \\mu \\mathrm{~A} / \\mathrm{mm}$), a low on-resistance of $27 \\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm{~mm}$, and an ON/OFF current ratio exceeding $10^{8}$, together with minimal threshold hysteresis ($\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{TH}} \\sim 10 \\mathrm{mV}$). Importantly, the devices maintain excellent off-state robustness with a breakdown voltage of 614 V, underscoring the reliability of the gate stack under high electric fields.

The leading cause of death globally, cardiovascular illnesses claim almost 17.1 million lives each year. Among these, cardiomyopathy represent a significant group of disorders that affect cardiac function. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is an essential tool for the diagnosis and management of such conditions. In this context, deep learning has emerged as a powerful technique for predicting and classifying heart diseases, including different types of cardiomyopathy. The preprocessing involved image enhancement using CLAHE and normalization to ensure computational efficiency. These processed images were then classified using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is designed to identify and categorize various cardiomyopathy conditions, including dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction, and abnormal right ventricle. Different activation functions and optimizers were applied to achieve faster convergence. The proposed deep learning framework demonstrated excellent performance, achieving a classification accuracy of 98.9%, effectively distinguishing between multiple categories of cardiomyopathy and related heart diseases."

    "abstract": "Distribution network operators (DNOs) face growing backlogs of distributed generation (DG) interconnection requests, threatening the energy transition. Effective regulation requires balancing efficiency in application processing with accuracy in assessing hosting capacity (HC). Existing frameworks fall short: fast-track screening is overly conservative, while detailed studies are resource-intensive. Intermediate methods that combine the speed of screening with the accuracy and risk-awareness of detailed analysis are needed. Shorthand HC methods aim to fill this gap but are typically deterministic, neglecting DG spatial diversity and load stochasticity that strongly influence HC. This paper develops a risk-based HC estimation method with two key probabilistic enhancements to short-hand HC calculations: (1) centering the DG's aggregate voltage effect at a risk-based impedance location to PV spatial distribution, and (2) probabilistic computation of available voltage and transformer loading headroom to account for load stochasticity. Tested on practical feeders in South Africa, the method shows reliable estimates with acceptable accuracy relative to detailed stochastic HC results while substantially outperforming deterministic estimates based on standard screening criteria. The method streamlines interconnection processes, facilitating more effective utilization of the grid capacity."

Swarm algorithms have demonstrated their effectiveness in solving problems using the power of collective intelligence and in order to address this issue, we propose SwarmRoute which can compute and evaluate multiple routes concurrently. SwarmRoute uses a weighted function with each of the road parameters assigned weight values that can be modified to prioritize on different parameters, with genetic algorithm optimized weights being used for the comparison study. A network graph of Chennai is extracted from the OSMNX package for comparing the algorithms and SwarmRoute is able to demonstrate an 81% decrease in route length compared to the best-performing existing algorithm, stochastic hill climbing, and a 10% decrease compared to a modified breadth first algorithm that has been described in this paper."

When a fault occurs on the AC side of a DC system, changes in DC current directly affect AC shortcircuit current. Moreover, since the DC control system of the LCC-CLCC configuration exerts a significant impact on the transient process of DC current after a fault, this paper proposes an approximate analytical method for calculating DC current that accounts for the influence of the DC control system, applicable to fault analysis of the receiving-end AC system in LCC-CLCC systems. Firstly, the basic topology and operating principle of the controllable line-commutated converter are introduced. Secondly, considering the impact of the DC control system, its structure and transient response characteristics are analyzed, and an approximate DC current calculation method is put forward. Finally, the correctness of the proposed calculation method is verified by comparison with actual simulation results. These approximate analytical results can provide a basis for selecting line protection settings and configuring relevant circuit breaker parameters."

The proposed partitioning method in this tool is designed for stream processing, such as CNN, and aims to partition the circuit into a minimum number of FPGAs and to minimize the through-put degradation caused by the partitioning. Unlike traditional approaches that divide circuits at the RTL or netlist level, in the proposed method, circuits described in the C++ language are divided by high-level synthesis. After partitioning, the RTL descriptions for communication interface circuits between the portioned modules. Also, the RTL descriptions for data stream packing and unpacking circuits are also automatically generated. This stream packing trys to minimize the latency for data transfer between the partitioned modules. Thirdly, the RTL description for data stream sharing circuits is generated. This stream sharing also try to minimize the latency for data transfer. This technique takes advantage of the Data Initial Interval (DII) of the packed data. Lastly, the header information of the packet, such as destination address, slot address, is automatically decided, creating an RTL description. This capability is similar to Network-on-chip (NoC), but this tool does this function with small circuits. The proposed tool allows the designer to synthesize circuit on multiple FPGAs completely automatic. In the experiment, MobileNet-v1 written in C++ language was automatically partitioned into multiple FPGAs, and it was confirmed that the partitioning was done correctly and there was no degradation in throughput."

A specialized dataset of 1,500 iced transmission line images was constructed from field data collected in Dingxi, Gansu Province, China, and preprocessed using noise reduction and data augmentation techniques. To optimize the network structure, attention mechanisms were integrated into the DeepLabV3+ architecture, and the loss function was refined to improve the segmentation accuracy of small-area icing. Furthermore, the dilation rates in atrous convolutions were adjusted to increase the receptive field, enabling more precise detection of long-distance icing. The icing thickness was subsequently calculated by comparing images of the transmission lines before and after icing events. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an MIoU of 96.37% on the validation set, outperforming both the original DeepLabV3+ and its variants with additional modules. These findings provide reliable technical support for intelligent power grid inspection and hold significant engineering application value."

    "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) systems have become increasingly prominent in recent decades in both civilian and military applications, owing to their ability to perform a wide range of complex tasks quickly and accurately. The software architecture of UAVs is inherently complex, requiring coordinated management of hardware, software, communications, and sensors, along with integration of advanced technologies like the Internet of Things. As a result, UAV systems face significant security and privacy challenges. They are frequently viewed as attractive targets for malicious actors and remain vulnerable to diverse attacks that threaten data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. This paper presents a pilot analytical study of security vulnerabilities in UAV systems by examining the growth rate and density of security related-errors measured as the number of errors per 1K physical Source Lines of Code (SLoC) across four releases of the ArduPilot system. To identify these vulnerabilities, a static analysis tool, Cppcheck, was applied to detect weaknesses categorized under the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE). In addition, the study explores the evolutionary properties of UAV systems using the CodeScene tool, aiming to establish how these properties correlate with the presence of security vulnerabilities. The findings show that ArduPilot exhibits a consistently high rate of source code vulnerabilities across the analyzed versions. The most frequently detected vulnerabilities were CWE-398, CWE-563, and CWE-758. Overall, this work advances the comprehension of UAV system security by providing detailed analytical insights into source code vulnerabilities, thereby serving as a guiding resource for future research and secure UAV development."

    "abstract": "A deep learning based control approach is proposed in this paper for permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drive. A popular choice for traction application is the PMSM drive because of its reliability and low maintenance requirements. The PI (Proportional-Integral) controller is used in the standard vector control technique for traction motors used in industrial applications. The technique's fundamental flaw is its susceptibility to changes in parameters. DL-based regression has not yet been examined as a control technique for traction drive control, to our knowledge. A long short-term memory network (LSTM)-based regression is investigated in this paper to find a suitable replacement for the conventional controller. Performance metrics are used to conduct a comparative performance analysis for normal and uncertain settings. The RMSE values of the LSTM controller outputs reduce by an average of 31.81% compared to the PI controller outputs. The simulation results suggest that while LSTM responses are slower than traditional methods, they can be used as as as alternative to traditional controller, with more fine-tuning. This study examines the application of deep learning to electric motor speed control."

This paper proposes a novel machine learning-based system architecture for autonomous UAV parcel delivery, leveraging standardized 5G Network Exposure Function (NEF) and CAMARA Device Location API to achieve sub-meter location precision. Our approach integrates dynamic geofencing and predictive rerouting at the network edge, powered by a Random Forest-based collision prediction model that proactively adjusts UAV trajectories to avoid restricted zones in real time. Through simulations of six UAVs navigating dynamically updated no-fly zones, we demonstrate that our system significantly reduces time spent in restricted areas to near zero, compared to GNSS-only and rule-based methods, while limiting path-length inflation to approximately 30% for five of six flights. These results underscore the potential of combining 5G-enabled location services with edge intelligence to enhance safety and compliance in urban UAV operations."

    "abstract": "With the increasing integration of renewable energy sources, the number of active microgrids has grown significantly. However, the spatiotemporal mismatch between load demand and generation introduces operational risks to the distribution network. To mitigate these risks, integrating load shedding analysis into the planning stage is essential. Therefore, this paper proposes a coordinated planning model for distribution-microgrid systems considering large-scale reliability constraints. Massive uncertainties are quantified through potential operational scenarios, ensuring that operational uncertainties are thoroughly addressed during the planning stage. To alleviate the computational burden associated with massive reliability scenarios, a Lagrangian-based state-space classification method is developed. By identifying the active constraints, the proposed approach significantly reduces computational complexity while maintaining planning accuracy. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed method not only enhances system reliability but also significantly improves planning efficiency."

    "abstract": "To address the challenges of low accuracy and limited feature extraction capabilities inherent in conventional methods for classifying tea leaf diseases, this study introduces an enhanced ResNet50 model incorporating Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) channel attention mechanisms. Focusing on a dataset comprising seven tea leaves (six diseased and one healthy), the proposed approach integrates the SE module into each residual block of ResNet50 to enhance the emphasis on disease manifestations. Additionally, the utilization of Focal Loss with label smoothing aims to mitigate issues related to class imbalance and overfitting. Experimental findings demonstrate that the SE-ResNet50 model achieves an accuracy of 94.27% through 5-fold cross validation, surpassing alternative models such as VGG16, DenseNet169, and EfficientNet-B5 by a margin of 0.59%, 6.25%, and 5.56%, respectively. These results underscore the model's efficacy in proficiently extracting features related to tea diseases, thereby offering a viable solution for intelligent disease recognition."

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) power Doppler (PD) imaging enables visualization of volumetric microvasculature networks. However, 3D ultrafast PD imaging with matrix arrays suffers from limited resolution due to the restricted aperture size and the use of unfocused plane waves, while delay-and-sum (DAS) exhibits high sidelobe levels and broad main lobes, hindering high-quality PD imaging. In this study, we aim to improve the 3D null subtraction imaging (NSI) and propose coherence-based NSI beamformers including NSI based on coherence factor (NSI-CF) and NSI based on spatial and angular coherence factor (NSI-SACF). Specifically, NSI-SACF integrates the high-resolution capability of NSI and the high-contrast performance of spatial and angular coherence factor (SACF). The proposed beamformers are validated through simulations, phantom experiments, and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">in vivo</i> experiments. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations confirm the superiority of NSI-SACF. In the simulations, NSI-SACF achieves a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 0.059 mm compared with 0.391 mm for DAS and 0.225 mm for SACF. NSI-SACF also reduces the sidelobe level by 75.5 dB and 33.6 dB compared with DAS and SACF respectively, while effectively suppressing grating lobes. In the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">in vivo</i> experiments, NSI-SACF improves the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of blood flow by 20.03 dB and 8.65 dB over DAS and SACF, respectively. Furthermore, the FWHM of the vessel is reduced to 0.098 mm with NSI-SACF, compared with 0.326 mm for DAS and 0.159 mm for SACF. In summary, the proposed NSI-SACF beamformer effectively enhances the PD imaging by simultaneously improving spatial resolution and contrast, demonstrating the potential for clinical applications."

In this regard, we propose an Acoustic Ranging algorithm based on BELLHOP ranging model and Dynamic ranging-ratio model (ARBD). Specifically, in response to the limitations of traditional ranging algorithms such as the shape of the Sound Speed Profiles (SSP), lack of consideration for reflection effects, and complex nonlinear root-finding methods, we transform the BELLHOP acoustic toolbox into a BELLHOP ranging model. A novel ARBD algorithm is developed by combining the fast convergence solution strategy of the Dynamic Ranging-ratio Model (DRM) with ray tracing. Furthermore, the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is derived to establish the theoretical performance limits. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm reduces ranging errors compared to traditional algorithms, while maintaining fast computational efficiency and adaptability, particularly in long-range distance measurements in deep-sea environments."

    "abstract": "Future IoT networks will demand increasingly lower latency for transmitting mission-critical information while simultaneously adopting quantum technologies to enhance security and accelerate information processing. This survey reviews the state-of-the-art in latency-optimal quantum circuit design, focusing on minimizing circuit latency without sacrificing essential functionality. The space is primarily allocated to the network level aspects, exploring balance between the network latency and the energy consumption, programmability and cost, while establishing a proper interface with the problems that should be delegated to the practical design carried on by circuit developers. Section I analyzes how aggressive latency reduction constrains the use of <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">universal</i> and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">reversible</i> gates—both of which tend to increase circuit depth (latency). Universal gates enable programmability, while reversible gates reduce energy dissipation, yet both can extend circuit latency. Aware of these trade-offs, Section II discusses latency-optimal design methodologies and their implementation aspects. Next we discuss exact minimization of quantum circuits, presenting quantitative improvements. For instance, controlled-T gate implementations demonstrate reductions from 15 → 9 T gates (compression = 15/9), 16 → 12 CNOT gates (compression = 16/12), and 9 → 5 T-latency (compression = 9/5). Similarly, for a 1-bit full adder, reductions include 14 → 8 T gates (14/8), 12 → 10 CNOT gates (12/10), 4 → 2 H gates (2), and 8 → 2 T-latency (4)."

    "abstract": "A novel energy-harvesting interface (EHI) circuit that employs a continuously scalable-conversion-ratio (CSCR) switched-capacitor (SC) DC-DC converter is introduced in this paper. CSCR converters inherently sustain high power conversion efficiency across a wide voltage conversion ratio (VCR), making them well suited for EHI applications. Realizing wide-range maximum-power-point tracking (MPPT) with a hill climbing algorithm, however, demands accurate on-chip power estimation. Recent EHI works failed to provide such estimation, neglecting the unit step voltages in the internal flying-capacitor network, hence constraining the attainable MPPT range. To overcome this limitation, a compact power monitor that explicitly accounts for the unit step voltages in the internal flying-capacitor network is introduced. The monitor employs a capacitive divider and is tightly coupled to an exponential digitally controlled oscillator (DCO), yielding precise power measurements over a broad frequency span. Fabricated in a 180 nm CMOS process, the prototype delivers up to 6.05 mW while achieving 90.4% end-to-end efficiency. It sustains ≥ 97% MPPT efficiency over a 14.6× dynamic-power range (130 μW – 1.9 mW), 3.4× wider than previously reported CSCR-based harvesters. The proposed architecture thus offers an efficient and scalable solution for next-generation energy-harvesting systems."

This complex and dynamic problem requires real-time decision-making and adaptation to evolving warfare environment. While our previous work addressed the static NADP problem by proposing a mathematical model and heuristic solutions for sensor allocation, engagement scheduling, and ship routing, this study extends to the dynamic NADP problem. Unlike the static version, which assumes complete knowledge of future threats, the dynamic NADP problem requires continuous updates and real-time adjustments to decisions as new threats emerge and situational parameters change. We present modifications in the mathematical formulation, which is based on a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model, alongside a comprehensive simulation structure. We employ heuristic solution approaches that utilize a combination of a genetic algorithm, construction of an engagement graph to solve the shortest path problem, and dynamic programming (DP) techniques. Computational experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of these methods in addressing the dynamic NADP problem. The study also explores machine learning models for threat prioritization, offering innovative solutions to the challenges posed by dynamic naval air defense scenarios."

Subsequently, we develop a discrete-time perturbation-based distributed dual consensus ADMM (PDC-ADMM) algorithm, which achieves an optimal integer solution to the ILP problem and eliminates the unmatched phenomenon. In addition, we propose a distributed optimistic gradient descent ascent (D-OGDA) algorithm with a constant step size, which guarantees exact convergence to the optimal formation reference center.

    "abstract": "Nowadays, short-term time-series prediction is increasingly vital across domains such as transportation, energy, and weather forecasting. Its high accuracy and rapid response provide crucial support for dynamic changes in these applications. Transformer-based methods, with their powerful temporal feature extraction, have emerged as a leading paradigm for this task. However, many Transformer-based methods exhibit excessive complexity for short-term horizons and rely too heavily on long-term dependencies. In this article, we propose the specialized sparse Transformer without shortcuts (SSTwS) to approach short-term multivariate time-series prediction (SMTP). We specialize in the Transformer-based prediction methods from two perspectives: simplifying the model structure and improving the self-attention mechanism. The SSTwS aims to balance performance and cost. Specifically, we removed residual connections designed for deep networks and enhanced convergence speed through the prepositioned layer normalization (LN). We developed a specialized sparse-centering self-attention mechanism, removed half of the linear projections typical in vanilla self-attention mechanisms. In addition, we leveraged the sparsity of the self-attention mechanism, employing five probabilistic methods combined with centering to select the dominant features. Extensive experiments on seven widely used datasets demonstrate the superiority of our SSTwS in terms of training speed and performance relative to existing state-of-the-art methods."

    "abstract": "Traditional electromagnetic (EM) design optimization often relies on high-fidelity simulations and external optimization algorithms, resulting in excessive runtime and substantial memory consumption. Simulation-inserted optimization (SIO) methods, such as complex Newton’s SIO (CNSIO), integrate optimization directly within the EM simulation loop, alleviating the computational and memory overhead of conventional closed-box approaches. However, CNSIO still requires full-order EM model evaluations at each iteration, which limits its scalability for large-scale, multiparameter problems. This article proposes the reduced-structure augmented Lagrangian with complex Newton (RSAL-CN) method, which integrates model order reduction (MOR) that preserves the essential EM characteristics, augmented Lagrangian method (ALM), and CNSIO. The second-order Arnoldi method for passive order reduction (SAPOR) is used for model reduction, while ALM internally couples EM simulation with constraint handling. New formulations based on CNSIO avoid repeated Hessian factorizations and accelerate convergence. Optimization is performed directly on reduced-order EM models, significantly reducing runtime and memory usage while maintaining accuracy comparable to CNSIO. Validation on two waveguide filter design examples demonstrates that RSAL-CN is more efficient and robust than CNSIO, offering a practical solution for large-scale EM design optimization."

Existing planning approaches that adopt fixed scenarios or static uncertainty models often fail to capture the time-varying and uncertain behavior of the FCEV's charging demand. To address this challenge, a novel dynamic uncertainty set (DUS) is constructed to represent the stochastic inflow and outflow of FCEVs, enabling a comprehensive exploration of worst-case scenarios based on historical data. This approach enhances the robustness of the integrated hydrogen energy storage system under varying operational conditions. The capacity planning problem is then formulated by a tri-level robust optimization model and solved using a constraint-and-column generation (C&CG) algorithm. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in producing more resilient and cost-effective planning results compared to those from the conventional static robust model and scenario-based stochastic programming method. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis on robust budgets reveals the trade-offs between the system's robustness and capacity planning."

    "abstract": "Collaborative multi-agent sensing via Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication has emerged as a promising solution to overcome the limitations of single-vehicle perception in autonomous driving. However, efficiently fusing large-scale, high-dimensional features across multiple vehicles remains a significant challenge, particularly under communication localization constraints. This paper proposes a collaborative 3D object detection framework, termed Collaborative 3D Detection with Multiscale Clustering Mamba (CoMCM). It performs adaptive feature fusion across multiple spatial scales, integrating both coarse- and fine-grained information. CoMCM comprises two core components: the Contextual Clustering Mamba (CCMamba) and a collaborative Mamba in BEV fusion module(CoM). The MCMamba module incorporates multiscale clustering within a Mamba-based state-space model to capture both global and local contextual information. This design addresses the limitations of selective state modeling in non-causal BEV representations. The CoM module further fuses BEV features from multiple Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) using relative pose-aware attention and adaptive weighting, enabling effective multi-vehicle collaboration. Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets, OPV2V, V2XSet and the real-world DAIR-V2X datasets, demonstrate that CoMCM significantly outperforms existing collaborative 3D object detection methods and remains robust under bandwidth limitations and pose estimation errors. Moreover, CoMCM achieves low computational cost while maintaining high detection accuracy. CoMCM lays the foundation for scalable and accurate collaborative perception in intelligent connected vehicle systems operating in complex environments."

    "abstract": "This work presents an automated, real-time approach for localized sea state estimation using a single camera mounted on a shipfs bridge. A labeled dataset of sea surface images, collected during regular operation of an overseas liner, is built and used to train deep neural networks to estimate sea state on the Beaufort scale from 1 to 8. To improve robustness and better capture operational variability, a substantially enlarged test set is constructed relative to previous work, enabling a more comprehensive evaluation under diverse navigation and environmental conditions. Additionally, to mitigate the scarcity of rarely occurring sea states in real-world operation, a synthetic training dataset is generated that simulates a wide range of sea and weather conditions while preserving key physical relationships to increase variability in illumination and wave appearance without degrading realism. We evaluated state-of-the-art convolutional and transformer-based architectures, including Resnet-101d, DeiT III, Swin transformer, XciT and CoAtNet. The impact of different synthetic.to.real training data ratios in both RGB and grayscale domains is systematically examined, yielding a 6% improvement in test accuracy and mean F1 score and a reduction of the maximum error from 7 to 3 Beaufort. Finally, a temporal voting framework that aggregates predictions over several consecutive frames further reduces the maximum error to 2 Beaufort and achieves 96% intra.1.class accuracy and an F1 score of 62%, substantially outperforming a baseline trained only on real data without temporal voting. Impact Statement – The maritime industry is increasingly adopting artificial intelligence to enhance operational efficiency, improve navigational safety and achieve sustainability goals. Ensuring navigational safety, as well as the environmental and economic efficiency of maritime operations, requires an accurate assessment of sea state. Traditionally, sea state is visually assessed using the Beaufort scale, which relates wind speed to sea surface state and classifies it into 13 classes (0-12). Since this method relies on visual observation, it is subjective and prone to human error, so automating sea state assessment using computer vision methods can provide an effective monitoring alternative. The models proposed in this paper achieved intra-1-class accuracy of 96% on a varied test set, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach for robust sea state estimation."

(2) the parameters in all the fuzzy rules of each quasi-higher-order TSK fuzzy subclassifier except the last one are transformatively trained to have their desired and undesired parts such that the resultant fuzzy rules with desired parameters for clean data are acquired in early training and simultaneously difficult-to-classify data containing noisy labeling data are fixed. (3) each successive quasi-higher-order TSK fuzzy subclassifier is stacked on difficult-to-classify data from the previous subclassifier so as to form NSARD-TSK's nested stacking structure with enhanced generalization capability. In particular, the last quasi-higher-order TSK fuzzy subclassifier adopts the proposed anti-noisy-labeling squared loss function as its unique learning objective with a theoretical guarantee for suppressing noisy labels. (4) NSARD-TSK linearly aggregates all the subclassifiers to further improve its final classification performance without affecting NSARD-TSK's interpretability. Experiments on 12 benchmarking datasets with and without noisy labels validate NSARD-TSK's efficiency over the comparative methods in terms of average testing performance and model complexity."

A scenario optimization framework is employed to handle model uncertainties, in which sampled uncertainty realizations are transformed into linear matrix inequality (LMI) constraints. By solving the resulting convex problems, local estimator gains are obtained, ensuring bounded mean-square error. Furthermore, an explicit upper bound for the fusion error is derived, and optimal fusion weights are determined through an LMI-based criterion. Finally, target tracking systems are provided to demonstrate the advantages and effectiveness of the proposed methods. The influence of the violation and confidence parameters on estimation accuracy and computational complexity is further analyzed."

However, the precise estimation of SOC is a complex endeavor due to the inherent non-linear characteristics of these batteries. Recent advancements in Artificial Neural Networks and Machine Learning have introduced significant modifications in the estimation of these parameters. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) exhibit significant promise for state of charge estimation, as they can learn temporal patterns and generate predictions independently of a predetermined battery model. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are particularly proficient, providing precise real-time SOC predictions and the capability to project future SOC over diverse timeframes.

    "abstract": "In the evolving landscape of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), ensuring robust intrusion detection mechanisms is vital for maintaining security and data integrity. Initially, a hybrid deep learning model combining Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Deep Neural Network (DNN) was developed to classify attacks with high accuracy using the WSN-DS dataset. This model effectively captured spatial and abstract features from network data, achieving strong baseline performance. Building on this foundation, the current work introduces an Isolated Thresholding Method (ITM) based on the Inter Quartile Range (IQR) to further enhance detection reliability. The ITM acts as a post-processing filter that re-evaluates samples initially classified as 'Normal' by the hybrid model. By applying IQRbased anomaly scoring, hidden outliers often corresponding to false negatives are identified and reclassified as intrusions. This statistical refinement significantly reduces undetected attacks, particularly those belonging to minority or stealthy classes. Experimental results demonstrate a marked improvement in sensitivity and an overall boost in the system's robustness. The integration of IQR-based statistical analysis with deep learning provides an intelligent, making the intrusion detection system more precise and dependable for real-world WSN security applications."

The proposed framework is divided into two steps. The first step is Material and Properties Selecting Tool. The scheme uses constraints imposed by application-oriented scenarios to determine design priority values. The second step is AI-assisted 3D Visualization Tool. The tool normalizes the best five candidates of each specific layer into the design property space using a weighted distance-overlap criteria.

    "abstract": "Optimal power flow (OPF) problems are a challenging issue for worth economic and secure power systems under satisfying constraints. An approach to accomplish these issues is optimizing the systems by Dragonfly Algorithm (DA). DA dragonflies behave flying toward the food source (optimal solution) and outward from the enemy source (worst solution) only directionally. This results in limited exploration, premature convergence and poor solutions. To overcome these drawbacks, this study proposes Improved DA with Sinusoidal Movement (IDASM). By modifying the weight factors of those flying movements into a sinusoidal pattern, IDASM dragonflies can fly bidirectionally toward and outward from these sources, locate at various positions, and avoid local optima. Also, exploration and exploitation are improved throughout iterations. The effectiveness of IDASM is tested on the IEEE-30 bus test system via mathematical OPF objective functions. The results show that IDASM outperforms DA and the other referred algorithms achieving superior solutions for OPF problems."

    "abstract": "MongoDB has become a popular NoSQL database for large-scale, latency-sensitive applications. Although existing benchmarking studies using the Yahoo Cloud Serving Benchmark (YCSB) typically focus on the default single-table configuration with varying thread counts, they often overlook scenarios involving multiple tables, clients, or larger datasets.This study expands the evaluation beyond traditional methods by introducing multi-table, multi-client scenarios, as well as varying data sizes while maintaining identical operational loads. The study shows that dual-table configurations introduce significant performance degradation, with runtime increasing up to 21× times and throughput dropping substantially compared to default single-table setups. Similarly, scaling the dataset size caused runtimes to increase up to 18× times, highlighting the substantial performance penalties introduced by larger working sets. Function-level profiling with Linux perf revealed that approximately 10.4% of the additional runtime overhead in multi-table cases is due to extra computation, with 5.66% due to new functions. Scaling the dataset size resulted in an additional 9.13% runtime overhead, primarily due to increased costs along existing code paths.This dual-layered analysis highlights scalability limitations and internal overheads associated with MongoDB under diverse workloads and deployment conditions, providing valuable insights for system architects optimizing database performance at scale."

    "abstract": "The placement of microservices in the compute continuum plays a vital role in delivering services that comply with customers’ needs, such as reduced latency, storage requirements, quality of service and availability. To achieve customers’ needs in the geographically dispersed architecture of the compute continuum, Service Level Objectives (SLOs) have been largely used in decision-making to place microservices. However, because low-level SLOs increase the barrier to entry for continuum users, placement decisions based on high-level business vocabulary are required if the compute continuum is to be adopted at scale. This paper proposes an architecture for microservices placement decisions in the computing continuum utilizing highlevel user intents described in natural language as input. The approach utilizes Generative Artificial Intelligence to translate the intents to low-level SLOs, which are used along with the infrastructure description to decide where different microservices that compose an application must be deployed so that SLOs are met. We implement and evaluate a prototype of the architecture to demonstrate the approach’s feasibility."

This study proposes a two-step signal processing system based on FMCW radar for non-contact respiratory analysis. The system first classifies target motion states and then segments stationary state signals into normal breathing and apnea intervals. During the motion recognition stage, a threshold comparison of the target’s velocity is used to label the target as moving or stationary. In the stationary state phase, this method extracts the target’s chest vibration signal (breathing and heartbeat) and then calculates the sliding standard deviation of the vibration signal. A low standard deviation indicates apnea, while a higher value indicates normal breathing. In this study, threshold processing of the vibration signal was used for demonstration, showing that even this basic method can reliably separate breathing signal based on motion state and sliding standard deviation."

    "abstract": "Power electronics training involves mastering complex concepts that are crucial for designing and controlling electronic power systems. Traditional teaching methods often struggle to identify and address students' conceptual weaknesses efficiently. This paper proposes a novel approach called Concept Discovery via Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (CD-NMF) to analyze learners' responses and uncover underlying concept patterns. The primary problem is the challenge of extracting interpretable and actionable insights from large-scale training data, which is often sparse and nonnegative by nature. CD-NMF leverages the mathematical properties of NMF to decompose student response matrices into meaningful latent components corresponding to core concepts in power electronics. These components serve to reveal concept mastery levels and identify misconceptions. The interpretability of NMF facilitates educators' understanding of students' learning status without requiring labeled data or complex feature engineering. Experiments on a dataset collected from power electronics training sessions demonstrate that CD-NMF outperforms baseline matrix factorization and clustering methods in terms of concept detection accuracy and educational relevance. The approach successfully identifies distinct concept clusters aligning with curriculum design, providing a practical tool for personalized intervention and curriculum adjustment. In conclusion, CD-NMF is an effective and interpretable datadriven method for concept discovery in power electronics education. It enhances training efficacy by pinpointing knowledge gaps and supporting tailored feedback, potentially improving learning outcomes significantly. Future work will explore integrating CD-NMF with adaptive learning systems to automate personalized curricula dynamically."

    "abstract": "This paper presents the simulation-based optimization of a novel 3D 4H-SiC trench MOSFET. The device features a P+ electric field shielding region placed perpendicular to the gate trench, enabling a compact cell pitch and achieving a low specific on-resistance ($\\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{on}, \\mathrm{sp}}$) of $2.24 \\mathrm{~m} \\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm{~cm}^{2}$. However, the thin P -well base layer required for low $\\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{on}, \\mathrm{sp}}$ introduces punch-through possibility and high trench-corner gate oxide electric fields. To address these issues, two innovations are proposed. Firstly, a P-well additional implantation (PAITMOS) can suppress premature punch-through and thus enhance breakdown voltage from 900 V to<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>|738 V.

Furthermore, simultaneous optimization of channel length and P -well doping raises the threshold voltage ($\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {th }}$) to 3.42 V with minimal Ron,sp penalty.

    "abstract": "With the transformation of the global energy structure and the proposal of low-carbon development goals, the development of a clean, economical and efficient energy supply system has become an important task in the energy field. Integrated Energy Systems (IES), as a system that is synergistically optimized through multiple energy forms, are gaining traction due to their potential to improve energy efficiency and reduce system operating costs. Especially at high altitudes, it is particularly important to promote the application of oxygen integrated energy systems due to the special needs and challenges of oxygen supply. This system can not only effectively meet the demand for oxygen in high-altitude areas, but also cope with the impact of new energy volatility. By promoting local energy sharing transactions between multiple energy entities, it can not only improve the utilization rate of new energy, but also reduce the overall operating cost of the system. In this paper, we propose an oxygen integrated energy system (OIES), in which oxygen is introduced as an important energy carrier to optimize its use, thereby improving energy conversion efficiency and resource utilization. The main contributions of this paper include the proposal and exploration of the Oxygen-Integrated Energy System (OIES), which effectively integrates multiple energy forms while specifically addressing the unique oxygen demands of high-altitude regions. By optimizing the processes of oxygen production, storage, and release, the paper demonstrates the advantages of OIES in improving energy efficiency, reducing operational costs, and mitigating the volatility of renewable energy sources. Through an economic comparison of water electrolysis and compressed air methods for oxygen production, the study reveals the benefits of each approach in different operational contexts, with water electrolysis being particularly well-suited to addressing energy fluctuations. Furthermore, the paper introduces a scheduling model based on the Improved Particle Swarm Optimization (IPSO) algorithm, which optimizes the oxygen production, storage, and release process, thus reducing costs and enhancing system flexibility. This system provides a practical and effective solution for the efficient management of oxygen in multi-energy systems."

    "abstract": "With the rapid rise of electric vehicle (EV) adoption in 2024-2025, ensuring reliability and serviceability is a major challenge. Traditional reactive or scheduled maintenance cannot adequately prevent sudden subsystem failures in batteries, motors, or power electronics, which cause downtime, safety risks, and higher costs. This study presents an Internet of Things (IoT)-based predictive maintenance framework for smart EVs, emphasizing real-time fault prediction and anomaly detection. The framework integrates sensor networks, cloud analytics, and machine learning models to anticipate failures before escalation. Key components include: (i) monitoring of the Battery Management System (BMS), traction motor, and thermal modules; (ii) a machine learning pipeline using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for time-series forecasting and Random Forest for fault classification; and (iii) a scalable, cloud-enabled architecture for fleet-wide reliability. A prototype drivetrain instrumented with voltage, current, temperature, and vibration sensors transmitted data via a Raspberry Pi gateway over MQTT. The LSTM achieved above 92% accuracy in thermal forecasting, while the Random Forest reached up to 96% accuracy and balanced precision-recall above 92% with cross-validation. Results demonstrated a 30% reduction in unplanned service events and up to 8% efficiency gain, confirming IoT-driven predictive maintenance as a viable strategy for smart EVs."

Using the HX711 24-bit ADC to carefully watch the signals from the weight sensor, and with the AT24C02 EEPROM acting like a permanent storage for liquid density records, the system sends data through Bluetooth BLE channels. It also uses polynomial fitting algorithms to make measurements more accurate. This system can figure out liquid density, calculate volume, clean up data, and send it wirelessly. It's known for being super precise, responding really fast, and easy to use. Tests prove that the system is really stable and accurate for titration analysis, meeting the needs of both labs and factories.

    "abstract": "Lingua Franca (LF) is a coordination language for cyber-physical systems that ensures deterministic execution through the reactor model. While LF's conservative scheduler guarantees correctness, it can hinder performance due to synchronization barriers that limit parallelism. Timing enclaves, a recent extension to LF, mitigate this by partitioning programs into independently scheduled regions with decoupled logical timelines. However, determining optimal enclave configurations is non-trivial and not intuitive to programmers, as it requires balancing parallelism, synchronization overhead, and system constraints. In this paper, we present a framework for Design Space Exploration (DSE) of timing enclaves in LF programs. Our approach automatically analyzes the program's topology, identifies valid enclave partitions, and uses heuristics to explore trade-offs between determinism and latency. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method on synthetic benchmarks and a realworld 4G baseband processing application. Results show that our DSE framework can significantly improve performance while preserving deterministic semantics, highlighting its practical value for complex real-time systems."

This paper proposes the interconnection of Flores, Sumba, Sumbawa and Lombok islands using the MTDC transmission system in Indonesia. The proposed MTDC system has four terminals, one on each island. Each terminal has a modular multilevel converter for the connection of the AC and DC power networks. Thus, the photovoltaic power generated on Sumba and Flores islands can be transmitted to the load centres on Sumbawa and Lombok islands. Droop controllers are implemented on the converter terminals to improve dynamic sharing of disturbances and variations. The performance of such a system is studied using time domain simulations of generation fluctuations and transient short circuit faults in the AC side on Flores as examples. These simulation studies show that the MTDC system can ride through the faults on the three islands and safely recover to normal operation, as long as the Lombok terminal, which is the largest of all, is operational."

To tackle these challenges, we present TransUNet++, a hybrid CNN-Transformer model that integrates convolutional feature extraction with hierarchically organized multi-scale attention pathways. This design enables the network to capture detailed local structures while simultaneously modeling global contextual dependencies. To address boundary ambiguity and class imbalance, we employ a composite loss function that combines focal loss, multi-scale structural similarity (MS-SSIM), and the Jaccard index. In addition, an attention-guided decoder is incorporated to filter out irrelevant background signals and refine segmentation accuracy. We evaluated TransUNet++ on the BraTS 2021 benchmark and a clinical dataset from CHU Hospital. The model achieved Dice scores of 0.92 for whole tumor, 0.87 for tumor core, and 0.85 for the enhancing region. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of TransUNet++ and its strong potential for supporting clinical neuro-oncology workflows, particularly in diagnosis and surgical planning."

We propose AeroMeldNet, a lightweight partial-labeled multi-task pipeline built on MambaVision, featuring two heads (scene vs. disaster) and advanced optimization stages: pruning, dynamic quantization, half-precision training, and knowledge distillation. Our multi-stage approach drastically reduces FLOPs and parameter counts without sacrificing accuracy. We leverage the AID dataset for aerial scene classification and AIDER dataset for disaster detection, preserving each dataset's unique label space. Extensive experiments indicate up to 95-96% accuracy on respective test sets with significant FLOPs reduction, making it feasible for real-time edge deployment. Our method addresses the scarcity of combined aerial datasets by enabling partiallabeled multi-task training, demonstrating that synergy across tasks can yield robust feature extraction without forcing normal re-labeling. This pipeline sets a practical precedent for resourceefficient drone-based aerial detection systems."

    "abstract": "Object tracking in real-time applications often relies on the tracking-by-detection paradigm, where object localization and temporal association are decoupled. While methods such as DeepSORT integrate a detector like YOLO with additional CNN-based ReID module for appearance matching, the ReID network imposes significant computational and memory burdens, especially on edge or CPU-only systems. This work explores the use of zero-training appearance descriptors extracted directly from YOLOv8's internal multi-scale feature maps (P3, P4, P5), used individually as lightweight alternatives to conventional ReID embeddings. Our method selects a feature scale based on object size and retrieves a fixed-length feature vector via a simple center-cell lookup. On the MOT20 train benchmark, our fastest configuration, (i.e. based on the P3 feature map) achieves more than 90% of the HOTA score of the standard DeepSORT with ReID, while reducing tracking time per frame from 0.279 s to 0.035 s on a CPU. These results demonstrate that YOLOv8's native features hold sufficient discriminative power for training-free, real-time object association, eliminating the need for costly ReID networks in resource-constrained deployments."

Early detection is crucial in lung cancer, which has high malignancy rates. Although several deep-learning methods exist for nodule segmentation, challenges such as nodule characteristics, positioning, false positives, and boundary detection still remain. An innovative approach using a Proportional Integral Controller (PIC) within the UNet++ framework effectively manages feature map intensity during training, targeting a normalized mean of 0.5. This method adjusts activations based on the difference between current and desired intensities, with learnable proportional (Kp) and integral (Ki) gains enabling real-time internal feature modulation. Concepts from control theory enhance adaptive control, optimization, and training dynamics. The PIC framework improves convergence, reduces errors, and stabilizes training, resulting in better neural network performance. The design ensures stable feature flow and clearer feature maps, while the PIC Attention Layer enhances supervision for more consistent training outcomes. With a Dice coefficient of 0.96 and an IoU of 0.91, the model shows outstanding performance on the LIDC-IDRI dataset. A p-value of 0.0006 further confirms the model's stability and effectiveness compared to the current state-of-the-art."

    "abstract": "Operational pattern mining plays a vital role in industrial maintenance by identifying recurring sequences of machine behavior, faults, and maintenance activities to enhance system reliability. The increasing complexity of industrial systems and the large volume of sensor and maintenance log data create challenges for effective pattern discovery. Existing methods often rely on statistical analysis or manual expert rules, which are unable to efficiently capture hidden sequential dependencies and temporal relationships in large datasets, leading to incomplete or inaccurate predictive insights. This study proposes the SPADE-Based Sequential Pattern Mining Framework (SSPMF), a datadriven approach that leverages the SPADE algorithm to automatically extract frequent operational and fault sequences from historical maintenance and sensor data. The framework transforms raw data into structured sequences, applies SPADE for pattern discovery, and enables predictive maintenance decision support. The proposed method helps maintenance teams predict faults and schedule preventive actions in advance. Experimental results demonstrate that SSPMF effectively uncovers significant patterns, improving fault prediction accuracy and reducing unplanned downtime."

    "abstract": "Radar multi-target tracking is a core research direction in radar data processing, where data association, as a key step, directly affects tracking accuracy. Traditional data association methods are prone to errors in clutter, noise, and target intersection scenarios. In contrast, deep learning technologies have shown superior performance potential over traditional methods in this field. Therefore, this paper proposes a data association method based on Transformer, addressing the limitations of classical data association algorithms, which require prior information such as the target motion model and clutter density. The proposed method leverages data-driven learning to capture the relationships between target tracks and measurements. It uses position embedding to capture the motion characteristics of targets and Doppler information embedding to maintain velocity similarity, effectively performing the data association task for multi-target tracks and measurements in motion-crossing scenarios."

    "abstract": "This study presents the design and implementation of an Automated Drainage Monitoring and Gas Hazard Prevention System with Energy Utilization, aimed at improving urban infrastructure safety and sustainability. Integrating IoT-based real-time monitoring with automation and energy recovery, the system employs an ESP32 microcontroller, gas and ultrasonic sensors, and a GSM module for effective hazard detection and remote communication. The system detects toxic gas emissions (such as methane and hydrogen sulfide), monitors water levels to predict blockages or overflows, and automatically triggers safety mechanisms, including solenoid valves and SMS alerts. A key innovation is the utilization of hazardous gases through a boiler-turbine-generator system to convert waste gas into usable electrical energy, contributing to environmental sustainability. Notably, release gas is also used for burning stoves, further emphasizing the practical energy reuse aspect of the design. Performance testing confirmed the system's high sensor accuracy, quick hazard response, and effective energy conversion, making it a scalable and eco-smart solution for future urban drainage management."

    "abstract": "With the increasing sophistication of cyber attacks, traditional passive defense systems struggle to cope with stealthy offensive techniques. Although the MITRE ATT&CK framework provides a comprehensive knowledge base of adversarial behaviors, its structured and specialized nature limits its accessibility for average security practitioners. Large language models (LLMs) excel in natural language processing tasks but suffer from hallucinations, outdated knowledge, and data privacy concerns in specialized domains. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) based question-answering model that integrates the ATT&CK knowledge graph with LLMs to accurately answer multi-hop reasoning questions in cybersecurity. The method constructs a knowledge graph integrating multiple sources such as ATT&CK, CVE, and CWE, and leverages LLMs for entity recognition, relation pruning, and path reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms baseline models in F1-score, validating its effectiveness in cybersecurity knowledge question-answering."

The results revealed a strong dependence of both surface morphology and crystalline quality on growth temperature. At $1550^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, the epitaxial layer consisted of 3C-SiC polytype with rough surface morphology and non-uniform grain distribution. When the growth temperature was elevated to $1600^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, step-flow growth mode became dominant, producing a smooth and dense $4 \\mathrm{H}-\\mathrm{SiC}$ epitaxial layer with optimal crystalline quality and a surface roughness of merely 1.27 nm. Further increasing the temperature to $1650^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ maintained the step-flow growth mode but induced step coalescence and local surface roughening, resulting in diminished surface flatness. These findings provide significant guidance for optimizing the homoepitaxial growth process on C-face $4 \\mathrm{H}-\\mathrm{SiC}$ substrates and contribute valuable insights for enhancing the performance of SiC-based electronic devices."

    "abstract": "Selecting a safe and optimized route for ships is a route design requirement in ship transportation, and crew members design and choose ship routes through various methods. Aiming at the color image sensing data obtained from high-density AIS (Automatic Identification System) data, this study proposes a method for extracting route information from ship navigation trajectory sensing images, providing a new technical path for the application of maritime sensors. Firstly, focusing on the color image sensing model driven by ship AIS data, this study classifies the ship trajectory information in the sensing images and proposes a K-means clustering method based on Lab brightness and color features. This method can establish the customary route of a ship and fully leverages the high-precision advantage of color image sensing data in trajectory recognition. Secondly, by using a low-pass filter and sensing image edge extraction technology, the noise interference in color image sensing data is reduced. Closed clustering regions and continuous trajectory information are extracted, enabling the identification of route continuity from color image sensing data. Then, through the feature point matching of color image sensors and image stitching technology, the dense ship routes under large-scale nautical charts are established. Combined with a distributed sensor network, the efficiency of multi-region data fusion can be improved, ultimately realizing the extraction of long-distance customary routes. Finally, taking the AIS color image sensing data from Shanghai Port to the East Sea Estuary as an example, the proposed method is used to derive the characteristics of the habitual ship routes in this water area. The results show that the route information extracted based on the color image sensing model is consistent with the actual trajectories; the clustering algorithm can solve problems such as ambiguous pixel distinction and noise interference, verifying the effectiveness of the sensor application. Compared with traditional K-means, DBSCAN, and hierarchical clustering algorithms, the clustering algorithm based on the color image sensing model is superior in pixel processing, noise reduction, operation efficiency, and result accuracy, providing data support for the maritime promotion of color image sensing technology."

The input text was enriched through three methods—MiniLM, FastText, and ConceptNet—each generating semantically meaningful paraphrases. These enriched inputs are evaluated using traditional classifiers, deep learning, and transformer models. The results show that semantic enrichment, especially with ConceptNet, significantly boosts detection accuracy across all different models. ELECTRA combined with ConceptNet achieved the highest performance, with an F1 score of 92% and an accuracy of 97%, while the BiLSTM models achieved a strong balance of efficiency and precision.

We propose a learning-based framework that trains a lightweight policy network via reinforcement learning to refine existing priority assignments toward schedulable solutions. Based on the policy network, we propose an inference-time policy refinement mechanism that improves schedulability without additional training. It combines breadth sampling—generating candidate orderings via stochastic perturbations—with depth refinement, which iteratively enhances promising candidates. A continuous reward function based on a schedulability hazard metric enables effective training. Preliminary experiments show that the proposed method performs better than classical heuristics such as Deadline Monotonic and DkC, demonstrating its potential as an effective learning-assisted approach to real-time scheduling."

Our design begins by enabling effective pipelining across vision encode, LLM prefill, and LLM decode stages of VLMs, by exploiting their heterogeneous resource demands during execution and incorporating elastic GPU spatial partitioning among stages to maximally utilize the compute and memory resources. Building on this, we introduce a realtime scheduling algorithm that adaptively calibrates resource allocation among stages based on a Pareto-optimal analysis of the latency-throughput trade-off, allowing the system to sustain responsiveness and resource efficiency under dynamic request loads. To further alleviate GPU memory pressure, we design a lightweight weight offloading strategy for vision encoders that preserves inference efficiency with minimized memory overhead. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world agent workloads demonstrate that Nova consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines, improving the maximum latency by up to 23.3 %, while keeping competitive throughput."

    "abstract": "This paper presents the First Boat Rescue (FBR) problem, a new challenging variant of the well-known Electric Vehicle Routing problem. FBR stems from practical rescue operations where a rescue lifeboat and its medical team provide assistance to a boat close to the coast. Quite often the boat calls for unnecessary assistance which leads to a waste of resources. As an alternative and cheaper approach, this paper proposes the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with basic medical tools. More precisely, a lifeboat departure can be avoided when the UAV reaches the boat and remotely connects to the medical team which, by using the UAV’s medical tools, deems the assistance unneeded. UAVs are battery powered which may require recharging activities to accomplish the rescue operations. A buoy recharging station that uses the sea movement and provides a charging pad for a UAV can be used. When buoys are suitably disposed in the rescuing area, a UAV can assist multiple boats in need of emergency without wasting rescue lifeboat fuel and unnecessarily occupying the time of the medical team. This paper studies FBR in two scenarios with partial and full battery recharging policies and presents the Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulations of the problems. For FBR in the partial recharging scenario, the paper proposes two heuristics. The paper also proves that there is an algorithm that approximates FBR with full recharging policy. The paper concludes by describing various simulations and evaluates the proposed algorithms on random and ad-hoc instances."

    "abstract": "Well-established nonlinear control methods often rely on mathematical models that can be imprecise or uncertain. Classical robust control techniques address this by designing conservative control laws, which inherently limit performance. As modern applications demand higher performance, learningbased controllers have emerged as a promising alternative; however, they frequently lack stability guarantees, rendering them unsuitable for safety-critical systems. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces a novel control strategy that integrates a robust controller with an Echo State Network (ESN)-based adaptive law to stabilize a class of uncertain nonlinear systems under persistent disturbances. The robust controller is first designed to ensure Input-to-State Stability (ISS) of the closed-loop system, irrespective of the ESN’s actions or disturbances. Subsequently, the ESN is trained online to compensate for the disturbances and improve the system’s output performance. A key feature of this architecture is that the closed-loop stability is guaranteed a priori by the robust controller, regardless of the ESN’s learning process, while the online adaptation significantly enhances performance. This framework also maintains relatively low computational complexity. Numerical simulations demonstrate the strategy’s effectiveness: in one example, the average performance improves from 60.6% to 92.7% over time, and in another, from 22.8% to 92.3%. These results confirm the controller’s ability to learn and adapt online, showing a significant attenuation of disturbance effects compared to using the robust controller alone."

Current UOT trackers include two-stream and one-stream trackers represented by Siamese network and OSTrack, respectively. However, these trackers have not achieved a balance between performance and efficiency. In addition, when observing large numbers of visually similar underwater objects (such as schools of fish), the current UOT trackers might result in tracking drift. To address these issues, we propose a novel underwater single-branch tracker, USBTrack, which only performs inference on the branch of search area. The template is preprocessed once through a novel template prompt module (TPM) consisting of a convolutional layer, a linear layer, and a residual connection, and the generated template prompt features are summed to the search area. The USBTrack integrates the advantages of template pre-processing in two-stream trackers and joint feature processing in one-stream trackers, thus achieving a balance between efficiency and performance. Additionally, the summation-based interaction paradigm in USBTrack enables the model to focus more on the feature representation of the central part of the search region while suppressing tracking drift caused by the similar appearances of numerous objects of the same type. Comprehensive experiments show that USBTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance while balancing efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/xxh1016/USBTrack."

    "abstract": "This study presents a cooperative algorithm for heterogeneous unmanned ground and aerial vehicles (UGVs and UAVs). Such cooperative systems have recently garnered significant attention in domains like disaster response, target tracking, and exploration. However, many existing methods are constrained by hierarchical structures for task assignment, path planning, and control, which limits adaptability in dynamic environments. Furthermore, these approaches often rely on clustering processes, with performance frequently sensitive to the chosen granularity. To address these limitations, thiswork extends the previously proposed model predictive path integral control-genetic algorithm (MPPI-GA) framework, initially developed for UGVs, to quadrotor UAVs, resulting in an output-sampled MPPI-GA (oMPPI-GA), by adapting it to their dynamic characteristics. Building upon this extension, a unified algorithm is proposed that integrates task scheduling, obstacle-avoidance path planning, and control input generation into a single, cohesive framework. The algorithm adopts an output-sampled MPPI structure to alleviate control input sampling sensitivity for UAVs, and a novel triple-layer chromosome enabling UAVs to generate closed tours without explicit task clustering. In this system, UAVs equipped with oMPPI-GA and UGVs using MPPI-GA cooperatively execute missions. A distributed task conflict resolution scheme facilitates seamless task allocation among these heterogeneous agents. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated through numerical simulations and real-world hardware experiments."

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of precipitable water vapor (PWV) is of great significance in meteorological applications. Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is a widely used technique to obtain PWV data. However, many regions still suffer from sparse station coverage, with only a single station available in some cases. This study proposes a multichannel CNN–LSTM model designed for a single-station scenario by integrating key meteorological variables, including surface pressure, weighted mean temperature, and zenith wet delay, using a 5-day historical input sequence. Compared to the widely used Global Forecast System (GFS) and classical LSTM model, the CNN–LSTM model achieved superior performance, with an MAE of 0.694 mm, an RMS of 0.789 mm, and a correlation coefficient of 0.997. This indicates 69.8% reductions in MAE and 68.6% reductions in RMS relative to GFS, and a slight reduction in MAE along with a 20.8% reduction in RMS compared to LSTM. The subsequent seasonal and weather-specific analyses reveal the high accuracy in winter with 0.443-mm MAE and 0.580-mm RMS, and under clear skies with 0.708-mm MAE and 0.769-mm RMS. Performance declined during summer and rainfall periods due to heightened atmospheric instability and rapid PWV variations. Nevertheless, the developed CNN-LSTM model maintains robust prediction capability across all conditions, demonstrating the benefit of integrating meteorological features for PWV prediction in effectively data‑scarce or data-sparse regions."

The observed VDC dynamics is characterized experimentally, and its physical origin is investigated through comprehensive multiscale simulations. The developed TCReRAM device, integrated at the floating diffusion node of a CMOS image sensor (CIS) pixel, introduces VDC that helps mitigate saturation under high illumination conditions. Pixel-level simulations further demonstrate that incorporating the TCReRAM significantly improves the dynamic range by nearly 25% compared to the existing reported Hybrid CIS, effectively addressing performance limitations across varying illumination levels."

    "abstract": "With the increase of electrical load, the temperature rise in axial flux permanent magnet (AFPM) motor is gradually prominent. Excessive temperature rise directly affects the stable operation of the motor and limits its performance improvement. This article proposes an efficient immersion cooling system for high-torque AFPM motor. Comprehensively considering the cooling oil flow characteristics, oil baffle plates are installed between the end windings and the shell, which improve the cooling oil coverage and enhance the stator heat dissipation capability. Furthermore, flow channels are integrated in the sealing plate, reinforcing the cooling of winding regions with high eddy current losses. Based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD), the thermal analysis of the AFPM motor is carried out. The results show that compared to the conventional oil-immersed cooling structure, the stator core temperature decreases from 67°C to 52°C, and the winding temperature declines from 85°C to 63°C. Then, the flow network and thermal network are constructed and coupled iteratively to investigate the effect of key parameters on motor thermal performance. Finally, a 850 N·m AFPM motor is manufactured and tested. The experimental data for temperature rise are in good agreement with the proposed calculation method, with a deviation of within 5%."

    "abstract": "Muscle coordination pattern can be disrupted by neural disorders and perceptual disturbance, leading to abnormal gaits. However, it is still unclear how neuro-muscular control regulates walking gaits through training and exercising due to lengthy rehabilitation periods and complicated musculoskeletal redundancies. This paper proposes a gait rehabilitation monitoring method based on muscle deformation to elucidate the evolution of muscle coordination during the full-course vertigo-gait rehabilitation. The proposed method is verified by musculoskeletal dynamics simulation and experimentally validated through immediate applications to five healthy subjects and five vertigo patients. The vertigo gaits were assessed by comparing with the normal gait of healthy subjects. For the first time, this paper reports experimental results and muscle coordination analysis throughout the full course of vertigo-gait rehabilitation. The findings reveal that the vertigo patient adjusts phase difference between the rectus femoris (RF) and medial gastrocnemius (MG) at toe-off, driving the knee and ankle joints to regulate foot-to-ground angle, thereby enhancing gait stability and walking efficiency. These results indicate that muscle deformations serve as an alternative quantity besides traditionally employed kinematic features, and the proposed wearable sensing method is expected to provide an effective tool for clinical gait assessment."

    "abstract": "Compact ultra-massive antenna arrays (CUMA) share key characteristics with holographic communication systems, featuring densely spaced and individually controlled antenna elements that enable precise manipulation of electromagnetic waves. In this paper, we investigate the spectral efficiency (SE) of CUMA deployed within some constrained physical space. Departing from prior works that assume ideal isotropic antennas, we derive a closed-form expression for the SE assuming a line-of-sight (LoS) channel at the electromagnetic level, explicitly accounting for mutual coupling and antenna orientation. The analysis reveals that the channel gain is highly sensitive to both the array orientation and individual antenna directions. In the single-user case, our results show that the optimal orientation of the user array is either aligned parallel or perpendicular to the signal direction, depending on the inter-element spacing. Notably, near-optimal channel gain is achieved when individual antennas are oriented perpendicular to the signal direction. In the multi-user case, we further optimize transceiver configurations under mutual coupling constraints. Simulation results confirm that SE is strongly influenced by the directional alignment of user antennas and array placement in the near-field regime. CUMA significantly outperforms traditional half-wavelength spaced arrays in terms of SE when constrained to the same physical aperture."

    "abstract": "Do entrepreneurial ecosystems (EEs) in cities facilitate nascent, emergent, and hypergrowth entrepreneurial activity, and what configurations of city EE quality and technological development correspond to distinct types of entrepreneurial activity? The answer to these questions is not straightforward. Building new space for EE theory, we use rigorous research methodology to provide compelling empirical evidence identifying how EE quality and city-level technological development shape nascent, emergent, and hypergrowth stages of entrepreneurship. Using fixed effects in generalized least squares estimation, we analyze data from 762 cities worldwide in 2019 to explore the direct and indirect effects of city-level technological development in alpha, beta, gamma, delta and insufficient cities, as well as the impact of improvements in EE elements on the three stages of entrepreneurship. Our findings from rigorous research methods clearly demonstrate that nascent, emergent, and hypergrowth entrepreneurship all benefit from an increased quality of EE elements. Nascent and hypergrowth entrepreneurship are facilitated by a combination of high EE quality and high technological development (alpha cities). In contrast, emergent entrepreneurship is facilitated in cities with high EE quality but, on average, lower city-level technological development, where there remains room for technological improvement. We also challenge traditional clustering arguments and suggest that digital technologies allow scale-ups and unicorns to transcend local ecosystem boundaries."

Over the past 50 years, the technology and performance of satellite altimetry have been continuously improved, especially the successful launch of the new generation of altimetry satellite SWOT. Based on the abundant altimetry data accumulated over the years, a series of global ocean gravity field models were constructed. In the paper, the typical marine gravity field models DTU17, SIOV32.1, SDUST2022, NSOAS24 and SIO SWOT were selected for comparison, and their accuracy and spatial resolution were evaluated by using the shipborne gravity data of the NCEI. The evaluation showed that the SIO SWOT model built with 7 months of next-generation altimeter data had an accuracy of 1.43 mGal, which was at the same level as the ocean gravity field model constructed by fusing traditional altimeter data for many years. Compared with the spatial resolution of other ocean gravity field models (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$13.4 ~\\text{km} \\sim 14.6 ~\\text{km}$</tex>), its spatial resolution is 9.9 km, which is significantly improved."

    "abstract": "The transition to decentralized and inverter-based resources (IBR) in the power system has led to a significant reduction in system inertia, which in traditional systems is used for inertia support, making frequency stability a critical operational challenge. Flywheel energy storage systems (FESS) offer a promising solution for short-duration frequency support due to their rapid response time, high power density, and long cycle life compared to similarly sized battery energy storage systems (BESS). This paper investigates the use of FESS to enhance power system frequency stability during transient disturbances and load-generation imbalances. The study emphasizes the dynamic behavior of FESS in delivering synthetic inertia and primary frequency regulation within milliseconds. Various control strategies, including virtual synchronous generator (VSG) control, frequency-droop characteristics, and coordinated control with other storage systems, are reviewed and evaluated. The simulation was conducted on MATLAB/Simulink to demonstrate the effectiveness of FESS-based DC machines in limiting frequency deviations, improving the rate of change of frequency (RoCoF), and supporting system recovery. The findings underscore the suitability of FESS for short-duration, high-power applications in power systems. Future research directions are proposed to address optimization in sizing, integration with hybrid systems, large-scale FESS, and advanced control for improved frequency resilience."

The online data is recorded in the preprocessing step and verified online, whereas the novel critic is implemented in the assembling step through appropriate algebraic calculations. On this basis, the composite adaptive critic design is developed with satisfactory convergence. The adaptive critic design can be implemented in an online fashion with the hierarchical design scheme, and the FE condition can also be online verifiable. It is shown that the composite adaptive critic design guarantees the closed-loop stability of the equilibrium point and convergence to the optimal solution. Simulations are conducted to show the efficacy of the composite adaptive critic design."

    "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) perception systems frequently encounter sudden changes in lighting, altitude, and viewpoint that were never present in the training data, causing rapid drops in object detection accuracy. We propose SkyMapper-RT, a fully source-free self-calibration framework that updates a convolutional or transformer-based object detector on-board the UAV within a single forward–backward pass for each new frame. The core components are: (1) Adaptive Covariance Normalization (ACN), which standardises each batch of features by dynamically decorrelating their covariance, and (2) Spherical Dispersion Learning (SDL), which enlarges the angular separations among latent features without requiring any memory queue or explicit negative samples. Together, these two modules yield domain-agnostic yet discriminative feature representations, optimized by an entropy-regularised objective that encourages confident predictions. Evaluated on public UAV datasets UAVDT and DomainNet-126, SkyMapper-RT achieves the highest mean average precision (mAP) by 60.3% in overall detection and attains the highest top-1 accuracy of 71.5%, while adding only approximately 8 ms processing latency per 640 × 384 frame on a Jetson AGX Xavier edge GPU. The framework thus offers a practical real-time solution for on-the-fly UAV model maintenance in the face of continuously shifting data distributions."

Traditional approaches often depend on handcrafted features or fixed-length input constraints, limiting their ability to capture complex spatiotemporal dynamics. This work introduces a novel weakly supervised multimodal architecture that leverages advanced transformer-based models for fine grained violence detection. Visual features are extracted using TimeSformer, a transformer architecture employing divided space-time attention for video representation learning, while audio cues are encoded with VGGish, a VGG-based convolutional neural network adapted for audio representation learning. These multimodal embeddings are processed by Perceiver Input-Output (IO), a transformer-based model capable of handling arbitrary input modalities and producing structured, task-specific outputs. The framework simultaneously supports binary violence detection, event type recognition, and temporal localization. Evaluation on the Extensive-Description Violence dataset demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, achieving an average precision of 89.4%. Comparative experiments further highlight the effectiveness of this design, confirming that the integration of domain-specific encoders with Perceiver Input-Output (IO) provides a scalable and robust solution for complex video surveillance tasks."

The study first constructs a Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) model based on experimental data, and then employs SHAP to analyze the importance of input features, thereby enhancing model interpretability. The model achieved a high prediction accuracy of 0.9444 with a computation time of just 10.001 seconds. Finally, the Kruskal–Wallis H test is applied to statistically validate feature differences. The results demonstrate that the proposed method, while maintaining high predictive accuracy, successfully identifies the elastic modulus (E) and shear modulus (G) as the core discriminative criteria for chassis material selection. This study not only provides a scientific basis for material optimization under complex operating conditions but also highlights the potential of artificial intelligence methods in the field of engineering materials."

    "abstract": "Emerging embedded platforms increasingly rely on heterogeneous processing units to address diverse performance and energy requirements. The recently introduced AMD Embedded+ architecture reflects this trend by interconnecting via PCIe on the same motherboard one AMD x86 host processor with one Arm AArch64+FPGA complex. This implementation is another step forward towards a more compact heterogeneousISA platform designed with embedded applications in mind. While cross-ISA execution has been explored in the past with a focus on performance, programmability, and energy efficiency, its potential for embedded and predictable real-time workloads remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we start exploring such potential by investigating the real-time capabilities of the first commercial platform based on the AMD Embedded+ architecture: the Sapphire Edge+. We (1) outline key research challenges and real-time use-cases, (2) discuss suitable software architectures for the use-cases and highlight associated trade-offs, and (3) report an initial assessment of the potential of such architectures and use-cases via an experimental evaluation of latency and bandwidth on the real hardware."

    "abstract": "The societal movement toward smart, personalized healthcare highlights the need to protect the individual privacy of people in utilizing machine learning. In this paper, we introduce a new system called Federated Multi-Layered Deep Neural Network with Adaptive Hyperparameter Optimization (Fed-MLDNN-AHPO) which combines federated learning, metaheuristic optimization, and Biogeography Based Optimization (BBO) to apply to deep neural networks with sensitive healthcare data. It has the capacity to apply training processes from across multiple locations to comply with privacy-related legislation such as HIPAA and GDPR. Moreover, the adaptive tuning works with data from the customer which is heterogeneous and not consistently independent and identically distributed (IID). Applications are demonstrated and evaluated from datasets from eICU, FeTS, MIMIC-III, and BRATS20. Various approaches were considered from this novel system to be very effective in classification and segmentation performance over baseline approaches. Furthermore, we have implemented modules for explainability and fairness to support trust in AI in healthcare. Thus, Fed-MLDNN-AHPO allows the implementation of safe, understandable, and scalable privacy-preserving intelligence in the healthcare domain."

LTLBC is a low-latency lightweight cryptography introduced in 2024, which has a smaller circuit size and lower latency than conventional cryptographic algorithms. These cryptographic algorithms ensure computational security. However, risks such as fault analysis using information from cryptographic hardware implementations have been reported, and it is important to evaluate the tamper resistance (security) against this analysis. Therefore, this study evaluates the security of LTLBC against fault analysis. Experimental results show that all subkeys can be recovered with as few as 20 ciphertext pairs when the fault injection probability is 20%."

    "abstract": "WCET (Worst-Case Execution Time) estimation on multicore architecture is particularly challenging mainly due to the complex accesses over cache shared by multiple cores. Existing analysis identifies possible contentions between parallel tasks by leveraging the partial order of the tasks or their program regions. Unfortunately, they overestimate the number of cache misses caused by a remote block access without considering the actual cache state and the number of accesses. This paper reports a new analysis for inter-core cache contention. Based on the order of program regions in a task, we first identify memory references that could be affected if a remote access occurs in a region. Afterwards, a fine-grained contention analysis is constructed that computes the number of cache misses based on the access quantity of local and remote blocks. We demonstrate that the overall inter-core cache interference of a task can be obtained via dynamic programming. Experiments show that compared to existing methods, the proposed analysis reduces inter-core cache interference and WCET estimations by <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{5 2. 3 1 \\%}$</tex> and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{8. 9 4 \\%}$</tex> on average, without significantly increasing computation overhead."

Current clinical practice relies mostly on manual interpretation of CT scans by radiologists, an approach that incurs considerable delay and variability since it is dependent on human knowledge. In order to overcome such limitations, the present research proposes Optimized CNN, a novel vision transformer-based automated stroke detection system for high-accuracy analysis of neuroimaging data. The model utilizes powerful self-attention mechanisms to exhaustively assess localized microstructural defects and global contextual patterns in CT scans, which allows for identification of subtle indicators of stroke easily overlooked by standard approaches. In contrast to conventional CNN-based methods that are prone to long-range dependencies in medical imaging, Optimized CNN vision Transformer model is able to attain robust performance in a wide range of clinical situations, such as early ischemic changes and hemorrhage detection.

    "abstract": "As vehicles become extensions of the living environment, automotive interior lighting for non-driving activities like napping is gaining significant interest. This study investigates the effects of illuminance and correlated color temperature (CCT) on subjective perception and mood states in in-vehicle napping and waking scenarios. A within-subjects experiment was conducted in a vehicle mockup where participants were exposed to lighting conditions before napping and after waking. The lighting conditions comprised three eye-level illuminance values (10 $\\mathrm{~lx}, 150 \\mathrm{~lx}, 300 \\mathrm{~lx}$) and two CCTs (warm white light, $\\sim 2000 \\mathrm{~K}$; natural white light, $\\sim 4500 \\mathrm{~K}$). Subjective evaluations of happiness, comfort, tension, glare, brightness, satisfaction, as well as positive/negative affect (using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, PANAS) were collected. Results revealed that for the napping scenario, lower illuminance significantly increased comfort and reduced tension. For the waking scenario, a low CCT significantly enhanced comfort. The tested lighting parameters did not, however, produce a significant impact on positive or negative affect in either scenario. There was a significant difference in perception of the same light stimulus between pre-nap and post-nap states, particularly for happiness, comfort, tension ratings and positive affect. Furthermore, the study demonstrated a brightness perception saturation effect around<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>|50 lx within the confined vehicle space, indicating a higher sensitivity to light compared to larger, open-plan indoor environments. In conclusion, this research provides evidencebased recommendations: lower illuminance is preferable for inducing sleep, while low-CCT light is better for a comfortable awakening."

    "abstract": "With the rapid growth of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), ensuring secure, lightweight, and real-time transmission of health data has become a critical challenge. Traditional encryption schemes like AES and RSA exhibit excessive computational overhead for resource-constrained devices. Moreover, centralized identity management schemes are vulnerable to breaches. This research proposes LISA-a Lightweight IoMT Secure Authenticator-combining efficient authenticated encryption with blockchain-compatible identity verification based on Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). Using smart contracts on the Solana blockchain and IPFS-based storage, LISA enables secure, low-latency, tamper-proof transmission of health records. Evaluation shows that LISA outperforms AES-GCM and Ed25519 in energy efficiency, latency, and m emory consumption, making it a practical security solution for next-generation healthcare networks."

    "abstract": "Machine learning is gaining significant prominence as a practical approach for predicting disease outbreaks and trends. Regression-based models have drawn considerable attention in the time-series disease forecasting domain. Earlier, disease prediction relied heavily on handcrafted statistical models like ARIMA and SEIR. However, the evolving nature of COVID-19 data has made machine learning-based forecasting an active area of research. Regression models like e Extreme Gradient Boosting XGBoost and Random Forest have recently shown promising results when trained on temporal clinical and demographic data. These models analyze lagged case data and mobility trends to discover low-level patterns not captured by classical models, enabling the system to anticipate infection surges more efficiently. Efficient feature engineering and model optimization are vital to achieving this. The architecture proposed in this paper integrates time-lag and rolling average features with a tuned regression pipeline for end-to-end COVID-19 prediction. The proposed approach converges quickly and outperforms conventional regressors in both accuracy and error metrics. This research work has been tested on public COVID-19 datasets and improved R-squared score by 15% and reduced RMSE by 28%."

This approach effectively overcomes the limitations of traditional Kalman filtering in dealing with nonlinear systems by leveraging the nonparametric representation and functional learning capabilities of kernel methods. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the standard Particle Filter in terms of both tracking accuracy, computational efficiency, and robustness, especially under conditions of high maneuverability and complex noise distributions."

This paper proposes a game-theoretic AI framework that integrates strategic reasoning, probabilistic modeling, and mathematical optimization to assess and enhance cyber defense capabilities. The framework supports Zero Trust enforcement across all OSI layers by continuously evaluating threats and enabling adaptive, real-time decision-making. Grounded in the principle that no entity is inherently trustworthy, the system dynamically adjusts defensive strategies, prioritizes resources, and improves network robustness. This strategy enables cyber defense analysts to anticipate risks, optimize resource allocation, and sustain mission operations. Ultimately, the framework delivers a scalable, intelligent foundation for resilient cybersecurity, strengthening the ability of critical systems to resist and recover from sophisticated, persistent attacks."

    "abstract": "Automated data mapping of legacy systems is one of the most critical enablers of digital transformation across various sectors, including healthcare, finance, and government. In system modernization when organizations shift from their legacy systems to new platforms, an automated mapping scheme is vital in handling many and often disparate data models, thus allowing seamless data migration without any loss or corruption that manually transformed data might incur. Over the past two decades, the demand for solutions with higher accuracy and reliability has increased. Thus, a semantic-based mapping is thus proposed in this context to enhance accuracy and reliability regarding data transformations while exploiting ontologies and semantic relations within the data. This gives a possibility for precise, relevant mapping of entities enhancing their integrity while minimizing errors. The observed results show that sematic-based mapping reduces data greatly loss, increases interoperability, and ensures consistency across platforms as compared to the rule-based mapping. Therefore, by maintaining quality information during transitions between systems, semantic mapping facilitates more effective digital transformation where organizations can make full use of their legacy information in modernized contexts."

Simulations were conducted on a low-voltage residential feeder with 18 nodes, each representing a household. PV sizes ranged from 3 to 25 kW and EV chargers from 7.4 to 22 kW. The Time-Series method identified constraint violations more accurately across a 24-hour cycle, while the Deterministic method produced variable results depending on static assumptions—ranging from overly conservative to overly optimistic. Time-Series simulations revealed voltage rise at far-end nodes during midday due to PV export and transformer overloading during evening EV charging. These findings highlight the value of temporal analysis in realistic HC assessment. The Time-Series method is recommended for utility planners due to its ability to reveal when and where violations occur, supporting smarter DER integration strategies."

However, in the lowest temperature range, near the helium temperature, DTs are strongly affected by the influence of the self-heating and external magnetic fields, which makes their use as temperature sensors practically impossible. In this work, the new design of DTs, the advanced silicon diode temperature sensors (AdvDTs), created on the basis of a heavily doped silicon diode structure, is proposed and tested, which allows improving their performance for cryogenic applications. For AdvDTs, in the low temperature range, the influence of Joule heating and magnetic fields on their performance is minimized. The physical mechanisms responsible for the formation of the improved performance of AdvDTs are discussed."

Building upon the derivation of the DAE model, we introduce parametric quantization modeling to enhance computability. Furthermore, we propose a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) -based Optimized Twin-Complementary Algebraic Derivative Estimation Method (OTC-ADEM) for dynamic DAE compensation that balances accuracy with computational efficiency. Through a quantitative analysis of the impact of derivative order and initialization period on compensation performance, this method constructs parameter-adaptive windows suitable for diverse dynamic operating conditions. Experimental results demonstrate effective suppression of displacement errors: reducing the error from ±4 nm to within ±0.2 nm during initial uniform motion and from ±65 nm to within ±9.73 nm during variable-speed motion. Compared to conventional correction methods, our proposed approach exhibits superior performance in continuous compensation accuracy while enhancing suitability for measurements under high dynamic changes. It simultaneously mitigates the risk of Algebraic Derivative Estimation Method (ADEM) errors during sudden high-speed transitions, achieving a favorable balance between compensation precision and computational efficiency."

    "abstract": "High-voltage dc power supply (HVdcPS) is widely used in vacuum tubes such as radar and microwave plasma generators. In these applications, low output charge and low ripple are required. Consequently, the traditional method of reducing ripple by increasing output capacitance is not applicable. In this article, a scalable multilevel series-connected ripple suppression unit (RSU) for reducing voltage ripple in HVdcPS is proposed. The RSU is composed of two switches, two diodes, and one capacitor. It generates a multilevel staircase wave to fit the ripple and suppress it through antiphase superposition by connecting the RSU in series with the HVdcPS and load. Compared with the traditional solutions, this method uses additional RSU to suppress ripple, featuring a scalable structure with negligible additional losses. The operating principle and state analysis of the RSU are presented, along with a comprehensive study of the optimal control method for ripple suppression. Finally, a prototype of the RSU used in two different HVdcPS is built to verify. The experimental results demonstrate that the two-stage RSUs can reduce the voltage ripple to 28% while the power loss is only increased by 0.13%."

The resonance mechanism is utilized to significantly enhance radiation efficiency compared to a conventional amplifying lever. This prototype employs a high-performance electret thin film as the source of electromagnetic radiation, offering advantages such as miniaturization and high radiation intensity. Additionally, the radiation mechanism of the electret with a single charge is studied, and a vibration-radiation model of the electromagnetic dipole is established. The vibration and the magnetic field simulations and tests are conducted to evaluate the prototype’s performance. A tenfold vibration amplification is obtained at resonance with the designed lever compared to the off-resonance state. As a result, the designed mechanical antenna can achieve a radiation distance of up to 92.2 km at 1 fT.

Two transmission schemes with the goal of maximizing quality-of-service (QoS)-constrained sum rate and rate of the HST are formulated and then reformulated using a hybrid maximum ratio transmission and zero-forcing strategy. The HSR communication system is abstracted into a heterogeneous graph, and HSTGNN consists of complex heterogeneous graph attention layers and fully-connected layers. To meet QoS requirements and power budget constraints, we employ constraint-based penalty terms and a numerical scaling operation. HSTGNN is trained via unsupervised learning to solve the two schemes in a unified framework. Numerical results demonstrate that HSTGNN achieves millisecond-level inference speed with an average optimality gap of only 4% relative to traditional optimization algorithm across various scenarios. Moreover, HSTGNN exhibits strong scalability to unseen configurations of both cells and LUs."

    "abstract": "This article proposes a robust closed-loop control architecture with a leading-edge-aligned modulation strategy to ensure zero-voltage switching (ZVS) of the resonant T-type bridge in an unfolding-based ac-dc conversion system. In the proposed approach, ZVS is achieved throughout the grid cycle by precisely aligning the leading edges of the T-type bridge output quasi-square voltages. The closed-loop control is designed for the high-frequency T-type bridge to simultaneously achieve sinusoidal grid current shaping and output power regulation. Accurate small-signal modeling is presented to ensure appropriate closed-loop bandwidths for system stability and robust dynamic performance. Additionally, a detailed ZVS analysis is presented, taking into account the nonlinear behavior of the MOSFET output capacitance to ensure accurate results. Based on this ZVS analysis, combined with conduction loss calculations, optimized tank design guidelines are provided. The effectiveness of the proposed modulation and control architecture, along with the ZVS operation of the T-type bridge throughout the grid cycle, is experimentally validated on a 20 kW, 480 V, 3-ϕ grid-tied ac-dc hardware prototype. Experimental results demonstrate complete ZVS operation throughout the grid cycle, a peak ac-dc efficiency of 96.51%, and a low grid current total harmonic distortion of 2.3% at rated output power. Furthermore, a comparison with a center-aligned modulation strategy implemented on the same hardware prototype shows a 0.76% higher ac-dc efficiency and a 6 dB reduction in radiated electromagnetic interference, corresponding to a twofold decrease, thereby establishing the superior practical performance of the proposed approach."

    "abstract": "Currently, most magnetic coupling wireless power transfer (MCWPT) systems are designed based on integer-order components (IOCs). However, in practice, inductors and capacitors exhibit fractional-order characteristics due to physical factors, giving rise to fractional-order MCWPT systems. Although these systems can reduce the sensitivity of traditional integer-order MCWPT systems to coupling coefficients, load disturbances, and resonant frequency offsets, they suffer from narrow transfer range and poor load adaptability, which restrict their application prospects. To address this, this paper proposes a fractional-order MCWPT system with extended load adaptability. Firstly, a fractional-order MCWPT topology with a wide load range is proposed based on topology switching. Then, the frequency and output characteristics of the system are analyzed using circuit theory. Subsequently, an optimized control method for fractional-order capacitors applicable to the proposed system is presented, and an output control strategy of constant current (CC) and constant voltage (CV) is designed. Finally, an experimental prototype with a 24V/2A output is built to verify the feasibility. The results show that the proposed system significantly expands the load variation range and ensures that the output voltage and current of the system have strong robustness to the variations of coupling coefficient, resonant frequency deviation, and load fluctuation."

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) power Doppler (PD) imaging enables visualization of volumetric microvasculature networks. However, 3D ultrafast PD imaging with matrix arrays suffers from limited resolution due to the restricted aperture size and the use of unfocused plane waves, while delay-and-sum (DAS) exhibits high sidelobe levels and broad main lobes, hindering high-quality PD imaging. In this study, we aim to improve the 3D null subtraction imaging (NSI) and propose coherence-based NSI beamformers including NSI based on coherence factor (NSI-CF) and NSI based on spatial and angular coherence factor (NSI-SACF). Specifically, NSI-SACF integrates the high-resolution capability of NSI and the high-contrast performance of spatial and angular coherence factor (SACF). The proposed beamformers are validated through simulations, phantom experiments, and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">in vivo</i> experiments. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations confirm the superiority of NSI-SACF. In the simulations, NSI-SACF achieves a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 0.059 mm compared with 0.391 mm for DAS and 0.225 mm for SACF. NSI-SACF also reduces the sidelobe level by 75.5 dB and 33.6 dB compared with DAS and SACF respectively, while effectively suppressing grating lobes. In the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">in vivo</i> experiments, NSI-SACF improves the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of blood flow by 20.03 dB and 8.65 dB over DAS and SACF, respectively. Furthermore, the FWHM of the vessel is reduced to 0.098 mm with NSI-SACF, compared with 0.326 mm for DAS and 0.159 mm for SACF. In summary, the proposed NSI-SACF beamformer effectively enhances the PD imaging by simultaneously improving spatial resolution and contrast, demonstrating the potential for clinical applications."

Wireless power transfer is the transmission of electrical power without using transmission network. Issues associated with safety, maintenance and simple structure as compared with wired system. There are many ways of transferring power wirelessly, but the more suitable way is inductive power transfer and resonant power transfer. The wireless power transfer consists of transmitter and the receiver network. In transmitter end, a switched-mode power supply (SMPS) and a DC-DC converter are connected to convert the grid supply into required DC voltage for transferring the power to a transmitter coil. In receiver end, a rectifier circuit, filter, battery management system (BMS) is connected to charge the battery as per the standards. The core workflow of the design moves through four major stages. The creation of a Switched-Mode Power Supply (SMPS) as a better power regulation solution is the first stage. Next, a 100 W wireless power transfer system with a Series-Series compensated topology is established to achieve high power transfer efficiency and a successful system implementation. The stage 4 is largely centered on providing full control of the State of Charge (SOC) and battery charge cycle to properly optimize battery life and performance. The confirmation of the prototype and the new design simulation to ascertain the effectiveness and the durability of the design are the last stages of the proposed workflow."

We frame the problem as maximization of aggregate user utility subject to per-phase current capacity, phase unbalance constraints, and discrete charging rates. We propose an online algorithm by recasting the problem as a separable and increasing concave maximization over an integer polymatroid. The resulting algorithm is proven to find the globally optimal solution in polynomial time. The algorithm is computationally lightweight, does not require specialized optimization solvers, and is scalable for real-time control of large-scale EV charging, offering a practical and effective solution for charging station operators."

    "abstract": "Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) systems, offer remarkable advantages such as continuous monitoring capabilities regardless of weather conditions or time of day. Among SAR constellations, Sentinel-1 (S1) stands out for its provision of openly accessible imagery. However, challenges arise from S1's intrinsic spatial resolution limitations and the high level of speckle noise, which complicates data analysis. An alternative to address these limitations is to utilize commercial satellite missions, which typically provide high-resolution on-demand data, but their widespread adoption is hindered by the significant costs associated with accessing such resources. To tackle these challenges, this research introduces a novel methodology designed to simultaneously alleviate speckle noise and enhance the spatial resolution of S1 data. Accordingly, this methodology consists of two phases. Firstly, the model is pre-trained using either simulated noisy input images or synthetic clean reference images to mainly focus on despeckling. Then, the model is finetuned, leveraging low-resolution S1 Interferometric Wide Swath (IW) mode products as input and high-resolution TerraSAR-X Stripmap mode imagery as ground truth data to further enhance the super-resolution task. As a result, despeckled S1 images at 5 m ground sampling distance (GSD) are generated from noisy S1 IW images at 10 m GSD, narrowing the resolution gap between S1 and commercial SAR satellites while enhancing output quality in terms of speckle noise disturbances."

Both antenna types are simulated using the Method of Moments (MoM) implemented in MATLAB, with identical ground plane dimensions and material properties to ensure a fair comparison. Key performance metrics, including the two-dimensional (2D) elevation (E-plane) pattern and the three-dimensional (3D) radiation pattern, are analyzed.

We extracted valuable patterns in the time and frequency domains after cleaning and processing the data using filtering and normalization. Next, we evaluated three distinct models: one that used Autoencoder, CNN, LSTM, and Attention for deep learning, another that used Autoencoder, CNN, and Transformer for simple TQWT + Random Forest with SMOTE. The same dataset was used to train all three models, and metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curve, and AUC were used to assess each model. The Transformer-based model among them provided thebest accuracy of 98.12%, whereas the Random Forest model fared well with quicker training. Strong performance was also demonstrated by the LSTM-based model, particularly in comprehending timerelated patterns.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer unprecedented semantic understanding, their propensity for factual hallucination renders them unreliable for safety-critical systems. This paper presents a novel neuro-symbolic framework to address this challenge. Our approach leverages an LLM for initial instruction translation, guided by Chain-of-Thought prompting for logical transparency and Retrieval-Augmented Generation for contextual grounding. Critically, we introduce a post-hoc verification layer where every structured command candidate generated by the LLM is rigorously validated against a domain-specific knowledge graph for entity correctness, operational legality, and parameter safety. Through a series of case studies, we demonstrate that our framework effectively resolves contextual ambiguities, prevents the execution of factually incorrect commands, and enforces implicit safety constraints that a standalone LLM would miss. Our work provides a robust methodology for creating verifiable and trustworthy instruction-following systems, bridging the gap between linguistic flexibility and operational reliability."

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of electric vehicles (EVs) has intensified the demand for efficient and strategically planned charging infrastructure, making accurate financial forecasting crucial for sustainable investments. Traditional forecasting approaches often rely on opaque statistical models or historical trends, which limit transparency, hinder investor confidence, and fail to capture complex market dynamics, regulatory changes, and consumer adoption patterns. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an Explainable AI-Supported Financial Forecasting framework for EV Charging Infrastructure Investments (XAI-FFECI), which combines advanced machine learning algorithms with explainable AI techniques to predict revenue streams, operational costs, and investment returns while providing interpretable insights for decision-makers. XAI-FFECI integrates time-series forecasting, feature importance analysis, and scenario-based simulations to capture market volatility, policy interventions, and demand fluctuations. Experimental evaluation conducted using publicly available EV adoption and charging infrastructure datasets demonstrated that XAI-FFECI improved forecasting accuracy by 28%, enhanced interpretability for stakeholders by 34%, and enabled more informed investment decisions compared to conventional black-box financial models. The framework allows investors and policymakers to identify key drivers of profitability, evaluate risk exposure, and optimize resource allocation in EV charging networks. In conclusion, XAI-FFECI provides a scalable, transparent, and adaptive solution for financial planning in EV infrastructure investments, bridging the gap between predictive performance and explainability, and supporting sustainable, datadriven investment strategies in the rapidly evolving electric mobility sector."

    "abstract": "The image quality assessment (IQA) process seeks to determine how people perceive the quality of an image it remains necessary for many image processing and computer vision applications. In this paper, we propose a novel noreference IQA method based on quality-aware texture descriptors constructed using Four-Patch Local Binary Patterns (FPLBPs). Our First, to improve the description of local textures typically affected by visual distortions, we propose modeling them using a multiscale approach. In which, each image is rendered on several subscales using Laplacian-Gaussian (LoG) filters at varying frequency bandwidths. Second, obtained subband images are then used to calculate the FPLBPs descriptors. Second, we calculate the FPLBP descriptors for each of the subband images. In fact, FPLBP consists of modeling the spatial structure based on local intensity variations across each patch, defining local texture representations as local histograms, and generating the global feature vector by concatenating these local histograms. This reflects the overall perceived image quality. Lastly, we train a Support Vector Regressor (SVR) to estimate the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) directly from the feature vectors. Evaluation using a benchmark for IQA, shows that our method has strong associations with subjective quality scores."

One of the most common techniques used in real-time object detection is Deep Learning (DL) because of its ability to process vast amounts of visual data efficiently and accurately. Among the various deep learning-based detection algorithms, You Only Look Once (YOLO) has established itself as a cornerstone of real-time object detection due to its unique ability to combine high accuracy with exceptional processing speed. Its successive versions have introduced significant architectural enhancements, innovative training strategies, and attention mechanisms, making YOLO a preferred choice in mission-critical applications such as autonomous driving, surveillance, and robotics. In this study, YOLOv11 algorithm is applied to the KITTI dataset, a well-known benchmark dataset for computer vision tasks in autonomous driving. This research evaluates the capability and efficiency of enhancing real-time object detection within the autonomous driving domain. A comparison also is made between our work and other studies that applied different algorithms using the same dataset to evaluate the efficiency of YOLOv11. Their strengths and weaknesses are evaluated using parameters such as precision, recall, F-measure and computation time. The results show that YOLOv11 demonstrated robust performance in detecting the majority of road objects. The model achieved an overall precision of 91.7%, recall of 89.5%, and F-measure of 90.62% across all classes."

This digital dice operates by utilizing a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) that employs the XORshift algorithm. This algorithm is coded explicitly in Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL) and is integrated into a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The digital dice itself comprises various components such as a tilt sensor, display screen, power management circuit, and a rechargeable battery, all neatly enclosed within a 3D-printed dice casing. When interacting with this digital dice, users can initiate the generation of a random number by simply shaking the device. This action triggers the tilt sensor within the dice, which in turn generates a seed for the PRNG to produce a random number. The numbers displayed by this digital die range from 1 to 100, effectively simulating the various sides of a traditional dice.

    "abstract": "Accent classification in industrial voice-controlled IoT systems is essential for ensuring accurate speech recognition and safe operation in multilingual industrial environments. With the rise of voice-activated machinery, recognizing diverse accents of operators has become critical for improving command interpretation and operational efficiency. Existing accent classification methods often rely solely on conventional i-vector frameworks or basic acoustic features, which struggle to maintain accuracy in noisy industrial settings and under varying phonetic patterns. To address these limitations, this study proposes an Accent-Adaptive Deep i-Vector Fusion with Convolutional Bottleneck Features (CABi-Vector) framework. The method first extracts MFCC or logmel spectrograms from speech signals and passes them through a convolutional neural network to obtain deep bottleneck features capturing fine-grained phonetic-acoustic patterns. These embeddings are fused with traditional i-vectors to form accent-adaptive representations, which are then classified using a lightweight neural network optimized for real-time industrial deployment. The proposed CAB-iVector framework enhances the robustness of accent recognition in challenging industrial environments and allows voice-controlled IoT systems to dynamically adapt to operator accents. Experimental results demonstrate improved classification accuracy, reduced misinterpretation of commands, and increased operational safety and efficiency compared to conventional methods."

    "abstract": "Current era aims at low-power, high-speed nano devices with security concerns. The fundamental components of digital circuits are logic gates that convert binary inputs into binary outputs by performing simple logical operations. In digital computing and circuit design, logic gates AND, OR, NOT are significant, to build combinational and sequential circuits that satisfy specific logic principles. This paper concentrates on speed and security concerns in logic gates. When there is a change from micro to nano devices, a trade-off exists between speed and power. Logic locking is emerging as a powerful strategy for safeguarding integrated circuits (ICs) against intellectual property (IP) piracy, overproduction, and hardware Trojan threats. This work emphasizes high speed with satisfactory power dissipation while addressing security issues. Security is implemented using the logic encryption technique, Input-Dependent Key-Based Logic Locking (IDKLL). Unlike traditional methods that rely on a single key sequence, the suggested IDKLL method employs several key sequences to lock and release the functionality across different input combinations, thereby fully mitigating attacks. Based on this concept, Gate Lock, a lightweight gate-level logic locking method, is introduced to replace standard CMOS gates with IDKLL-based FinFET counterparts. Logic structures with keys are implemented using FinFET and simulated using Cadence Virtuoso 6.1 in 20nm and 16nm nodes. The experimental findings indicate that the power and energy consumption of the XNOR gate has decreased by 27.57 % and 32.6 %, respectively, while the delay of the NOR gate has been reduced by 28.9 % at 16 nm. The results confirm the effectiveness of FinFETs in achieving power-delay trade-offs while being secure and reliable for lower nanometres."

    "abstract": "Hybrid clustering algorithms have emerged as powerful tools for addressing the complexity of skill profiling in technical education, particularly in fields such as microgrids and distributed energy resources (DERs), where interdisciplinary knowledge and hands-on expertise are critical for workforce readiness. Traditional training approaches often fail to capture the multi-dimensional nature of students' competencies, leading to skill gaps in system operation, control, and integration of renewable technologies. The problem lies in accurately mapping students' heterogeneous learning patterns and technical proficiency to craft adaptive learning trajectories that ensure comprehensive understanding of both theoretical and practical aspects. To overcome the issues, the paper propose a Hybrid Clustering for Skill Profiling (HCSP) framework that integrates <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$k$</tex>-means for fast partitioning with hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) for structural refinement, leveraging their complementary strengths to achieve both scalability and fine-grained grouping. The HCSP algorithm incorporates domain-specific performance indicators such as control system simulations, energy management case studies, and laboratory-based DER integration tasks. Experimental results on a dataset of microgrid-focused training programs demonstrated that HCSP significantly outperforms singlemodel clustering in terms of cluster cohesion, interpretability, and alignment with expert evaluations, achieving a 15% improvement in normalized mutual information and better mapping of learner trajectories. The findings indicate that adaptive curricula generated through HCSP can more effectively identify high-potential learners, guide intervention for underperformers, and promote collaborative learning in team-based projects. In conclusion, HCSP provides an intelligent and scalable methodology for deriving actionable skill profiles to enhance education in microgrid and DER domains, thereby supporting workforce transformation in the clean energy transition."

These results demonstrate that waste cooking oil methyl ester (WCOME) is a technically feasible and environmentally sustainable candidate for transformer insulation applications."

This work investigates the design and implementation of Moving Average Filters (MAFs) based on Verilog HDL in iterative and recursive methods with fixed-point and floating-point arithmetic. The research compares the four different implementations—fixed-point iterative, fixed-point recursive, floating-point iterative, and floating-point recursive—tested in terms of performance such as resource usage, timing latency, power dissipation, and numerical precision. In the study, real-life ECG records obtained from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database are used to emulate the filter performance. Results prove that fixed-point recursive filters achieve the optimal trade-off between accuracy, stability, and hardware efficiency and therefore are suitable for real-time and low-power embedded applications. On the other hand, floating-point implementations provide increased dynamic range but in exchange for increased resource usage and sensitivity to rounding errors. This study aids in choosing the filter design for performance-limited signal processing applications."

    "abstract": "Successful demand forecasting is a key sector in boosting the efficiency and robustness of contemporary supply chains. This paper introduces an AI-based demand forecasting system that has been implemented to streamline supply chain operations by applying sophisticated machine learning methods and data analytics. The system incorporates sales history, current market sentiment, and external events such as weather and economic conditions to make highly accurate demand forecasts. In contrast to traditional forecasting methods, which often rely on linear models and data, the AI method can accommodate complex, non-linear supply chain patterns. The architecture is a hybrid deep learning model that utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and ensemble learning methods to address the temporal dependency and heterogeneity of the data. Experimental testing on actual datasets from real business firms in the manufacturing and retail industries demonstrates improved prediction accuracy to a considerable extent, reducing errors by as much as 25% compared to statistical models. Additionally, the system's predictive forecasts enable companies to minimize inventory expenses, enhance order fulfillment rates, and anticipate supply-demand imbalances, allowing them to respond accordingly. The study also highlights the scalability and flexibility of the proposed system across various supply chain functions, noting its ability to facilitate strategic decision-making. By incorporating AIbased forecasting into supply chain operations, organizations can achieve greater operational efficiency, reduce waste, and enhance customer satisfaction. The findings confirm the system's ability to serve as an effective solution for handling uncertainty in the modern business world."

The research project creates and tests MoE-based LLMs with parameter sizes between 2 and 3 billion to predict patient outcomes from MIMIC-IV multimodal database data . The proposed MoE models use sparse activation to select only a portion of experts for each input while distributing computational power according to input modality and feature relevance. The proposed models will surpass dense LLMs (with 7 billion+ parameters) in forecasting patient deterioration and mortality risk and hospital stay duration by activating only 40-50% of total parameters. Our method uses hierarchical attention mechanisms with cross-modal fusion techniques to merge structured data (ICU vitals, lab results) and unstructured data (radiology reports, clinical notes) for strong temporal and contextual understanding. Model performance is benchmarked against state-of-the-art methods using evaluation metrics such as AUROC, AUPRC, and calibration scores. The study evaluates MoE efficiency for real-time clinical inference through performance metrics that include latency and memory footprint and deployment feasibility in limited resource settings.

    "abstract": "Mixed-signal integrated circuits (ICs) are critical in various electronic systems, requiring precise and cost-effective testing to ensure their functionality under real-world conditions. A significant challenge lies in the post-silicon validation phase, where low-temperature performance screening is a complex, time-consuming, and expensive process. Traditional methods require dedicated, extensive testing at cryogenic temperatures, which substantially increases overall time-to-market and manufacturing costs. This article addresses this critical industry need by proposing an artificial intelligence framework to predict the low-temperature performance of mixed-signal ICs using the efficient low-cost few-shot characterization results from normal- and high-temperature. A convolutional neural network and least squares support vector machine (CNN-LSSVM) model helps to improve the estimation accuracy of full-temperature range performance drift. The CNN is leveraged for automated feature extraction from the high-dimensional test data, while the LSSVM provides a robust regression engine for accurate performance prediction in highly imbalanced dataset. The efficacy of the proposed framework is validated on 2102 and 4634 sets of measured results from two types of mixed-signal chips. The results demonstrate that it achieves an accuracy of 98.86% and 99.48%, allowing for the reliable pruning of redundant low-temperature test steps. This study provides a highly efficient, supervised learning method that significantly reduces test time and cost for the reliability screening of mixed-signal chips."

    "abstract": "Semantic communication technology conserves spectrum resources, while unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), a key component of the low-altitude intelligent networks, enhance communication flexibility. Combining these technologies improves wireless performance. However, due to the openness of wireless channels, high-quality communication links are vulnerable to eavesdropping, which compromises system security. Additionally, maritime communication faces challenges such as dynamic channel variations, and high-altitude UAVs struggle to locate sea surface users and eavesdroppers. To address these issues, we propose a secure UAV-RIS-assisted communication scheme that integrates semantic communication, and integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). This scheme maximizes the secrecy semantic rate, reduces communication and computation energy consumption, and ensures constraints on sensing spectral efficiency and semantic accuracy. We jointly optimize UAV-RIS trajectories, RIS phase shifts, spectrum allocation, and the average number of semantic symbols to enhance security under eavesdropping attacks. We propose an approach that integrates semantic communication, the multi-agent softmax deep double deterministic policy gradient, and the multi-agent dueling deep Q-network (S-MA-SD5), effectively supports UAV-RIS-assisted communication in maritime environments. Performance evaluations reveal that the proposed method exceeds existing methods, achieving higher security semantic rates and lower energy consumption, thereby significantly enhancing security and efficiency in the low-altitude intelligent maritime networks."

Experimental results show that the Fano resonance intensity of the proposed Gr-AUSR sensor can be altered by the Fermi level shift of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) graphene under slight external stimuli, achieving a minimum midkine (MK) detection limit of 125 pg/ml. Moreover, we extract the maximum wavelet coefficient from the two-dimensional wavelet time-frequency diagram, combining with the Fano resonance amplitude and effective transmission area to construct a multiscale pyramid-shaped model, where its volumes intuitively correspond to different MK concentrations.

    "abstract": "The growing importance of ocean exploration has established Autonomous UnderwaterVehicle (AUV) swarm operations as a key technology. However, underwater operations face significant challenges due to inherent communication constraints and dynamic mission requirements. Current approaches often lack scalable and adaptive network frameworks capable of responding flexibly to complex mission transitions, such as shifting from wide-area surveying to high-precision inspection. To address these limitations, this paper proposes SCAL-Net, a Scalable and Adaptive Layered Network framework for AUVs. SCAL-Net adopts a three-tier clustering architecture with a Gateway (GW), Cluster Heads (CHs), and Cluster Members (CMs). Operating on this architecture, an adaptive Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) protocol dynamically adjusts to changing mission phases through four distinct operational modes: Initialization, Search, Deep Search, and Error. Notably, the Deep Search Mode incorporates a novel mechanism that maximizes data throughput by adaptively reallocating idle communication resources from inactive clusters to an active one. Comprehensive evaluations using OMNeT++ demonstrate that SCAL-Net achieves predictable linear scalability with an increasing number of clusters. Furthermore, comparative analysis confirms that the proposed dynamic resource reallocation significantly enhances data throughput compared to conventional static TDMA baselines, while intelligent energy distribution extends the swarm’s operational lifetime. This work establishes a robust foundation for the autonomous and efficient execution of AUV swarm missions in complex marine environments."

The method employs scattered sensors that perform individual detections, whose binary decisions are mapped into space through Voronoi partitioning and refined using an adaptive spatial interpolation logic. Simulation results demonstrate that the approach achieves a high spectrum-hole geolocation detection rate with low variance. Compared to cooperative spectrum sensing, the proposed strategy offers superior spatial fidelity while significantly reducing communication overhead, establishing itself as a simpler and more scalable solution for cognitive radio networks."

    "abstract": "Cross-scene hyperspectral image (HSI) classification plays a vital role in a variety of applications, including agricultural monitoring, military reconnaissance, and urban planning. Due to the nonlinear nature of land-cover characteristics, the diversity of scenes, and the distribution shifts caused by variations in acquisition conditions or sensors, deep HSI open-set domain adaptation (OSDA) has emerged as a key approach to tackling cross-scene HSI classification. Existing methods assume identical joint distributions between training and test data. However, this rigorous assumption renders them ineffective in real-world scenes when encountering varied sensors, changed imaging conditions, different spatial resolution in HSI imaging, e.g., water vapor bands at 1.36-1.39 μm. To address this, we propose a more generalizable deep HSI OSDA method JDMUS based on Joint Distribution Matching and unknown class Uncertainty Suppression, for cross-scene HSI classification. Specifically, we employ χ<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>-divergence to characterize the joint distribution discrepancy and propose a least-squares χ<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>-divergence estimator without explicitly modeling the two joint distributions, yielding a quadratic problem with an analytical solution.

Based on this methodology, we design joint distribution matching and unknown class uncertainty suppression mechanisms, and thus construct the JDMUS algorithm with theoretical guarantees, in which weighted generative adversarial network with dynamic thresholding is used for feature extraction.

In particular, it presents a novel approach that jointly optimizes power allocation (PA) and user grouping (UG) in the uplink of NOMA-based ISAC to achieve higher communication rate while meeting the required radar performance. The proposed optimization is a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem, which is a non-convex and non-deterministic polynomial time-hard. To solve the formulated problem, an outer approximation technique is employed to transform the original MINLP problem into a mixed-integer linear programming problem and a non-linear programming one. The performance of the optimized PA and UG approach is evaluated through extensive simulations, which examine the impact of the radar signal and the maximum power limit for each user equipment. Additionally, the performance of the radar system is assessed using the radar channel estimation and probability of detection. Compared to benchmark techniques, it is shown that the proposed scheme produces higher achievable communication sum rates while satisfying the performance requirements of the radar system."

    "abstract": "As 5G networks rapidly expand and 6G technologies emerge, characterized by dense deployments, millimeter-wave communications, and dynamic beamforming, the need for scalable simulation tools becomes increasingly critical. These tools must support efficient evaluation of key performance metrics such as coverage and radio-frequency electromagnetic field (RF-EMF) exposure, inform network design decisions, and ensure compliance with safety regulations. Moreover, base station (BS) placement is a crucial task in the network design, where satisfying coverage requirements is essential. To address these, based on our previous work, we first propose a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) that predicts location specific received signal strength (RSS), and EMF exposure simultaneously from the network topology, as images. As a network designing application, we propose a Deep Q Network (DQN) framework, using the trained cGAN, for optimal base station (BS) deployment in the network. Compared to conventional ray tracing simulations, the proposed cGAN reduces inference and deployment time from several hours to seconds (under 10 seconds) while achieving a prediction accuracy of approximately RMSE 7 dB. Unlike a standalone cGAN, which provides static performance maps, the proposed GAN-DQN framework enables sequential decision making under coverage and exposure constraints, learning effective deployment strategies that directly solve the BS placement problem. Thus making it well suited for real time design and adaptation in dynamic scenarios in order to satisfy predefined network specific heterogeneous performance goals."

However, some studies only focus on computing delay and energy consumption in each time slot, ignoring the impact of task backlog queues on system performance. In addition, the delay-oriented optimization tends to offload a large number of tasks to servers, failing to fully utilize the computing resource of mobile devices. To address these issues, we propose the multi-dimensional preference-driven resource optimization framework (MPROF). This study includes several key points: 1) constructing a three-layer heterogeneous architecture that applying the collaboration among edges for CEE; 2) proposing the task backlog estimation mechanism, which mitigates the impact of previous unfinished tasks on the current time slot; 3) proposing the group relative direct-preference policy optimization (GRDPO) that incorporates the preference information for efficient task offloading, and combines it with mathematical programming for the system resource optimization. The simulation experiments are conducted across multiple typical scenarios. The results show that, the proposed framework outperforms existing mainstream methods in task offloading, system delay, task backlog, and energy consumption control, demonstrating certain practical application prospects."

However, its high computational cost and large model size hinder deployment in practical industrial applications. To address this challenge, we designed a lightweight binary-weighted Transformer (BWT) for PMSM PHM, reducing the model size to 5.5% of the baseline. The proposed BWT achieves 99.81% classification accuracy across four classes. We also developed a hardware accelerator for matrix multiplication (MM)—the most time-consuming operation in BWT—and implemented it on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The proposed SW/HW co-design achieved an 85.55× speedup over the software-only implementation on the ARM microprocessor unit (MPU)."

    "abstract": "Industrial few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD) requires identifying various abnormal states by leveraging as few normal samples as possible (abnormal samples are unavailable during training). However, current methods often require training a separate model for each category, leading to increased computation and storage overhead. Thus, designing a unified anomaly detection model that supports multiple categories remains a challenging task, as such a model must recognize anomalous patterns across diverse objects and domains. To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces FocusPatch AD, a unified anomaly detection framework based on vision-language models, achieving anomaly detection under few-shot multi-class settings. FocusPatch AD links anomaly state keywords to highly relevant discrete local regions within the image, guiding the model to focus on cross-category anomalies while filtering out background interference. This approach mitigates the false detection issues caused by global semantic alignment in vision-language models. We evaluate the proposed method on the MVTec, VisA, and Real-IAD datasets, comparing them against several prevailing anomaly detection methods. In both image-level and pixel-level anomaly detection tasks, FocusPatch AD achieves significant gains in classification and localization performance, demonstrating excellent generalization and adaptability."

    "abstract": "Existing methods for learning 3D point cloud representation often use a single dataset-specific training and testing approach, leading to performance drops due to significant domain shifts between training and testing data. While recent crossdomain methods have made promising progress, the lack of inherent semantic information in point clouds makes models prone to overfitting specific datasets. As such, we introduce 3D-CFA, a simple yet effective cross-modality feature aggregation method for cross-domain 3D point cloud representation learning. 3D-CFA aggregates the geometry tokens with semantic tokens derived from multi-view images, which are projected from the point cloud, thus generating more transferable features for cross-domain 3D point cloud representation learning. Specifically, 3D-CFA consists of two main components: a cross-modality feature aggregation module and an elastic domain alignment module. The cross-modality feature aggregation module converts unordered points into multi-view images using the modality transformation module. Then, the geometry tokens and semantic tokens extracted from the geometry encoder and semantic encoder are fed into the cross-modal projector to get the transferable 3D tokens. A key insight of this design is that the semantic tokens can serve as a bridge between the 3D point cloud model and the 2D foundation model, greatly promoting the generalization of cross-domain models facing the severe domain shift. Finally, the elastic domain alignment module learns the hierarchical domain-invariant features of different training domains for either domain adaptation or domain generalization protocols. 3D-CFA finds a better way to transfer the knowledge of the 2D foundation model pre-trained at scale, meanwhile only introducing a few extra trainable parameters. Comprehensive experiments on several cross-domain point cloud benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to the state-of-the-art methods."

    "abstract": "New Wi-Fi systems have leveraged beamforming to manage a significant portion of traffic for achieving high throughput and reliability. Unfortunately, this has amplified certain security risks since beamforming critically relies on the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">clear-text</i> beamforming feedback information (BFI): though similar risks have been exposed using emulation platforms (e.g., USRP), they have never proven realistic till this day. In this paper, we propose BeamCraft, the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">first</i> attack to manipulate traffic in <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">commodity</i> Wi-Fi systems; it differs significantly from existing attacks either staying only on emulation platforms with limited real-world applicability or jamming communications by brute force. The core idea of BeamCraft involves corrupting beamforming decisions by injecting crafted BFIs that feed an access point (AP) with erroneous information on channel states. To mount a covert yet purposeful attack, we develop i) a joint location and transmit power selection strategy to evade detection by victims and ii) a novel BFI forgery method to effectively manipulate AP's beamforming decisions. We implement BeamCraft using commodity Wi-Fi devices and perform extensive evaluations with it; the results reveal that BeamCraft effectively manipulates Wi- Fi traffic while maintaining a low exposure rate. Furthermore, we also introduce a defense strategy, namely BeamCrypt, that jointly leverages reciprocity and similarity of the channel within the coherence time to authenticate the legitimate user with low overhead. We implement it using WARP and evaluation results verify the effectiveness."

    "abstract": "Many emerging artificial intelligence-driven applications rely on the availability of large-scale, stable, and fresh sensing data, underscoring the Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications (URLLC). This paper proposes to amalgamate Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) and Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest with Incremental Redundancy (HARQ-IR) to accommodate reliable and real-time wireless services. The outage probability and the Average Age of Information (AAoI) are used to evaluate the transmission reliability and data freshness for HARQ-IR-NOMA schemes. To reveal physical insights as well as ease system designs, the asymptotic outage probability in the high Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) regime is derived by developing a recursive dominant term approximation method. Moreover, the AAoI is deduced in terms of the outage probability by considering an M/G/1/1 queuing model. The asymptotic AAoI at high SNR is shown to be an increasing function of the diversity order-deficiency, which theoretically justifies the tradeoff between the transmission reliability and the data freshness. Furthermore, the AAoI is minimized by optimizing the transmission powers between users as well as HARQ rounds while maintaining the outage and total power constraints. The minimal AAoI is obtained by developing Geometric Programming (GP)-based and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based methods. Finally, the numerical results are presented for verification."

Incorporating the data-driven mechanism, the offline data-set is utilized for learning, eliminating dependence on the exact system model. Within the Q-learning structure, an actor-critic framework is employed to facilitate policy improvement and Q-function updating. Specifically, an improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is developed to mitigate gradient vanishing and overcome the premature convergence issue of standard PSO. Additionally, theoretical analyses are conducted to establish monotonicity and convergence of the designed Q-function. Finally, the constructed EIQL method is validated on real-world physical systems, demonstrating its effectiveness and advantages over conventional approaches."

    "abstract": "The first challenge in fault prediction for pressure transmitters lies in the fact that fault samples are extremely scarce in industrial settings, making some commonly used supervised algorithms inapplicable. The second challenge is that, as a measurement component of an overall system, the observed data dimension of pressure transmitters is very limited. In most cases, the only available data point is the pressure value returned by the transmitter itself, which serves as the starting point and data basis for fault prediction. Given these two challenges, this paper proposes a fault diagnosis method for pressure transmitters based on Isolation Forest and Linear Regression, capable of detecting specific types of faults. This method utilizes the unsupervised Isolation Forest algorithm as its foundation, enabling fault prediction without the need for training on fault data. With the aid of univariate linear regression as a supplementary approach, interference from special cases can be filtered out, thereby achieving the goal of fault prediction using one-dimensional fault-free samples."

    "abstract": "Recently, demands and usages of artificial intelligence are growing more and more. The various of electrical computation devices, such as mobile devices, are being built with AI technology. But the AI operation's load is very heavy. The AI data processing method, usually a convolutional neural network, mainly consists of the matrix convolution and the matrix multiplication-actually, they are the same effective, depending on how the operation sequences are arranged. The matrix multiplication is not suited to sequential data processing. During matrix convolution or matrix multiplication, the memory access pattern is non-linear. This is difficult to use the parallelized data processing and, actually, the original sequential processor has limit hardware unit resources for parallelized data processing. Even in sequential processing, the non-linear access pattern needs a conditional branch test and jump instruction for address calculation. Eventually, these situations induce large power consumption and poor performance during AI operation. Therefore, it is necessary that the appropriate hardware-software system, that system is the matrix structure planarize to linear access and uses the parallel data processing based on MAC tile, is implemented for efficient AI algorithm computation. In this paper, a parallel data processing structure based on systolic tile array is used for fast operation time and efficient ALU resources usage in matrix multiplication. For enhanced data processing throughput, the proposed new accelerator is equipped with a heavier processing element-(PE) tile than the original systolic tile PE, making it possible to calculate the multi state partial sums at once. Reordering multidimensional matrix as a linear planarization matrix array is also proposed at the micro-architecture level for diminishing the nonlinear access address calculation. The accelerator's memory system enables multiple elements to commit and reduces the data access times to DRAM memory during operation. In conclusion, this proposal accelerator ends up performing AI CNN operations much faster, with low power consumption."

By transforming structured spatial datasets into instruction–question–answer format, the model is trained to interpret and respond to natural language queries related to mineral types, locations, and associated geographic metadata.

    "abstract": "Accurate segmentation of retinal blood vessels is crucial for automated detection of diabetic retinopathy (DR), a leading cause of vision impairment worldwide. Although UNet and its variants are widely used for medical image segmentation, their comparative robustness under noisy image conditions remains underexplored. This study systematically evaluates five deep learning-based UNet architectures—UNet, Dense UNet, Attention UNet, Inception UNet, and Residual UNet—using three benchmark retinal image datasets. A uniform preprocessing and augmentation pipeline is applied, and all models are optimized using the Dice loss function with the Adam optimizer. Also, to simulate real-world imaging challenges and assess the noise resilience of these models, salt-and-pepper and Gaussian noise are artificially introduced. The architectures are benchmarked across multiple metrics, including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, Dice coefficient, and Intersection over Union (IoU). Among the variants, Attention UNet consistently achieved superior performance, particularly in highlighting fine vascular structures and managing inter-image variability. These findings demonstrate that UNet-based deep learning models, especially those incorporating attention mechanisms, provide a robust and scalable approach for retinal blood vessel segmentation."

    "abstract": "Hydrogen, as a clean and renewable energy source, has potential applications in various sectors, including power generation, transportation, and industry. However, the production of hydrogen is not without its challenges, which include high costs, low efficiency, and environmental impacts. The focus of this project is to examine the effects of variable voltage on a solar-powered electrolyser aimed at photovoltaic hydrogen production. This study intends to clarify how variations in solar intensity impact solar PV output voltage and electrolyser's hydrogen production. The results show that insufficient driving force and activation overpotential limitations slow down hydrogen production at solar PV output voltages under 2.5 V. However, solar PV voltages over this threshold significantly enhance hydrogen evolution, with optimal analysis occurring between 5 V and 6 V. It is also observed that the hydrogen collection was maximum at higher solar PV output voltages in comparison with lower voltages. The results are helpful to understand how green hydrogen production takes place at lower intensity of solar irradiance and solar PV."

    "abstract": "Non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) based on Low Earth Orbit satellites are drawing increasing attention. They can meet diverse future application requirements, such as anytime connection, low latency, and high immersion. By applying satellite edge computing (SEC) technologies, computation tasks can be distributed and offloaded to improve user quality of service (QoS) and also enhance network resource utilization. However, compared with conventional terrestrial networks, NTNs exhibit greater complexity and dynamics, which substantially complicates offloading decision-making in SEC. To achieve more efficient computation offloading in SEC, we first formulate the interactions among satellite nodes as a Stackelberg game, thereby incentivizing nodes to participate in offloading. Considering factors such as energy consumption and offloading process, the utility function is established for the participants. Then, the backward induction method is used to prove the existence of the unique equilibrium for the game. Finally, we propose a deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on generative stable diffusion models to compute the Stackelberg equilibrium. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

    "abstract": "Community detection in social networks is highly influenced by the noise, outliers, and choice of clustering parameter tuning methods. Graph autoencoder (GAE) models and their variants have been developed for community detection in the last few years which resolved the noise and clustering parameter tuning issues. However, the performance of these models is not significant. Hence, in this work, a new approach, GAETOPTICS, is presented. It combines the enhanced GAE model and tuned-OPTICS density-based clustering for detecting more accurate communities in the network. GAETOPTICS approach uses three significant advances to improve clustering accuracy: (1) enhancing the GAE architecture to capture deeper networks in complicated systems and avoid overfitting; (2) including a clustering-specific loss to directly optimize the embeddings for clustering and achieve a balance between community preservation and rebuilding; (3) tuning the OPTICS clustering parameters to maintain significant clusters while further lowering noise while using agglomerative clustering to reconstruct the communities. Performance of the proposed model GAETOPTICS is evaluated using normalized mutual information evaluation metrics with respect to the four other baseline algorithms, i.e., Louvain, Label Propagation, GAE with DBSCAN and GAE with KMean. The experimental results show that the GAETOPTICS community detection approach is scalable and data-driven, which makes it appropriate for intricate and large-scale networks."

    "abstract": "Businesses are increasingly using hybrid multi-cloud architectures, which divide workloads among public clouds (e.g., AWS, Azure, OCI, GCP) and branch offices. Despite being the industry standard for connectivity management, Software-Defined Wide Area Networking (SD-WAN) primarily optimizes for metrics like jitter and latency through its traffic engineering methods. This method ignores a significant and erratic operational expense: cloud data egress fees, which can account for 10 - 15% of the overall cloud bill and increase nonlinearly as user adoption and new features increase [1]. We introduce COPA (Cost-Optimized Path Aware), a novel SD-WAN framework that integrates both performance metrics and actual cloud egress costs into its routing decisions. COPA uses an adjustable multi-objective utility function to balance path latency and egress cost. COPA's application-aware policy engine is its key component. Through the use of specific Performance-Cost weights (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\alpha, \\beta$</tex>) and traffic classification (e.g., latency-sensitive VoIP vs. cost-sensitive bulk data transfer), the architecture ensures that network path selection aligns with both application-level Service-Level Objectives (SLOs) and overall financial constraints. In our simulation, we show that COPA can lower egress costs by over 66 % compared to a performance-only routing scheme while maintaining a high weighted average SLO compliance of 93.7 %. Our findings provide a useful tool for businesses to control multi-cloud networking expenses without sacrificing user experience by quantifying the trade-off area between cost savings and performance."

The proposed algorithm known as Neural Network-Driven Simulated Annealing (NNDSA) makes use of the adaptive capabilities of the simulated annealing algorithm, guided by realization from a trained MLP regressor to find the optimized seed set. By including the trust, persuasion, and opinion factors, NNDSA embodies the diverse aspects of influence propagation. Here trust determines information credibility, persuasion determines message impact and the opinion aspect models the growing beliefs of peoples in the network. Experiments are performed on two datasets: Bitcoin and Advogato, where the NNDSA algorithm with MLP regressor outperforms the one with- out MLP regressor and achieves higher influence propagation, while maintain the attractive execution time. The proposed algorithm with MLP regressor achieves average influence spread of 592.2 on the Bitcoin dataset and 991.2 on the Advogato dataset, outperforming the influence spread achieved without MLP regressor by 36.6 and 6.6 respectively. These finding reflects the potential of NNDSA technique with MLP regressor for the advancement of influence maximization strategies."

The research supports the development of transparent, user-centered, and accountable digital public services, aligning with SDGs 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure). User-generated review data was collected from the Google Play Store and processed using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The preprocessing steps included text cleaning, case folding, tokenization, normalization, and a comparative evaluation of stemming effectiveness. Sentiment labeling was conducted using the VADER lexicon, while classification was performed with the XGBoost algorithm. Two preprocessing variants-stemming and non-stemmingwere evaluated to determine their impact on model performance. The results show that stemming improved classification accuracy by reducing lexical variation. The bestperforming models achieved accuracies of 80.84 % (IKD), 89.48% (SIGNAL), and 73.70% (M-Paspor), respectively. Subsequently, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was employed to extract key discussion topics from the most accurate sentiment classification pipeline. Identified aspects included reliability, interaction capability, functional suitability, and performance efficiency. These findings highlight the effectiveness of big data techniques in extracting actionable insights from large-scale user feedback, supporting data-informed improvements in public digital services."

Especially, the introduction of wireless networks results in more severe induced delays than wired networks, owing to the greater complexity of factors affecting reliable state updates. From the perspective of control requirements, the state update process depends on the successful rate and real-time performance of information transmission. A low successful transmission rate causes data backlog and delays state updates, while a high rate reduces delay but requires more communication resources. Nevertheless, the control center must rely on previously updated state information before the next sampling period. Therefore, simply increasing the transmission rate may not necessarily enhance long-term system performance."

These challenges often result in low lane-changing success rates and compromised safety, drawing significant attention from researchers in the field of autonomous driving. Focusing on mixed traffic flow scenarios where lane-changing is required, this study proposes a multi-game integrated lane-changing strategy based on dynamic-static games and cooperative-non-cooperative games. During the lane-change preparation phase, a utility-based model is used to select a suitable lane-change gap. The Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm then guides the vehicle to a pre-lane-change position smoothly and assesses the safety conditions. To handle various unsafe lane-changing scenarios, the proposed strategy fuses multiple game-theoretic models. This fusion enables the vehicle to adaptively select the most suitable game-theoretic method for the current scenario, thereby completing the maneuver. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed Multi-Game Fusion Lane-Changing Strategy significantly improves the lane-changing success rate compared to algorithms such as SL2015 and MOBIL. This improvement holds under various traffic volumes and penetration rates. Furthermore, during the lane-changing process, both the SV and surrounding vehicles exhibit minor fluctuations in velocity and acceleration, indicating good comfort. This process also has a minimal impact on the overall stability of the traffic flow."

Our approach introduces a seasonal subscription mechanism where farms join crop-specific clusters at the beginning of each agricultural season. The proposed three-layer architecture consists of individual smart farms at the client level, crop-specific aggregators at the middle layer, and a global model aggregator at the top level. Within each crop cluster, clients collaboratively train specialized models tailored to specific crop types, which are then aggregated to produce a higher-level global model that integrates knowledge across multiple crops. This hierarchical design enables both local specialization for individual crop types and global generalization across diverse agricultural contexts while preserving data privacy and reducing communication overhead. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system, showing that local and crop-layer models closely follow actual yield patterns with consistent alignment, significantly outperforming standard machine learning models. The results validate the advantages of hierarchical federated learning in the agricultural context, particularly for scenarios involving heterogeneous farming environments and privacy-sensitive agricultural data."

This decomposition transforms the original long-horizon task into a series of easier sub-tasks with reward monotonicity, providing valuable spatial priors for the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and guiding it toward more effective exploration. As a result, the proposed method enhances learning stability and mitigates the negative effects of sparse and delayed rewards, facilitating the learning of an optimal navigation policy.

    "abstract": "The frequency security of islanded microgrids is addressed through a distributionally robust scheduling method that optimizes heterogeneous frequency regulation resources, including generation sources, storage systems, and loads. A linear approximation model for frequency regulation power is developed by considering differences in response rates and dead zones. Frequency constraints under coordinated regulation are established and incorporated into the microgrid scheduling model. Wind power uncertainty is described using a moment-based ellipsoidal uncertainty set, and joint chance constraints are formulated to limit wind power output and frequency regulation reserves. Auxiliary variables are introduced to transform the joint chance constraints into individual chance constraints. Non-convex individual chance constraints are further converted by accounting for distribution unimodality. Bilinear terms are convexified using the McCormick envelope, reformulating the model into a mixedinteger second-order cone programming problem. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed method ensures the frequency of the islanded microgrid remains above 49.2 Hz following active power disturbances. The inclusion of frequency support from demand-side resources improves operational economics."

We propose a methodology for designing such a pasteable device that makes use of available gait dataset to identify various monitoring parameters while obviating upfront user studies for parameter exploration and tuning. We apply the method in the design of a pasteable for detecting gait abnormalities through plantar pressure monitoring."

    "abstract": "Navigating complex indoor environments like university campuses poses a significant challenge, compounded by the difficulty of accessing specific institutional information. While vision-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) offers continuous tracking, it suffers from cumulative drift. Sim- ilarly, standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems for question-answering are prone to context collision. This paper presents a unified mobile application that integrates a robust AR indoor navigation module with an intelligent conversational assistant to address both challenges simultaneously. The pro- posed navigation system fuses the continuous motion tracking of SLAM with high-precision QR code markers for drift correction, providing accurate, real-time visual guidance. For information retrieval, a novel RAG architecture is proposed featuring an LLM-powered router that intelligently directs user queries to one of several specialized vector stores, effectively eliminating con- text collision and improving contextual accuracy. Experimental results confirm that the navigation module provides robust and accurate visual guidance in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, the chatbot's router-based architecture demonstrates a marked improvement in retrieval accuracy, consistently identifying more relevant information than a standard RAG system. The proposed system demonstrates the feasibility of synergistically combining spatial computing with advanced conversational AI to create a comprehensive smart campus assistant, enhancing the student experience by providing seamless access to both physical and digital resources."

Increasing annealing temperature markedly improves interface quality: $1000^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ samples show steeper CV depletion, reduced frequency dispersion, and near-ideal behavior. The effective negative oxide charge decreases with temperature, consistent with enhanced nitrogen diffusion and passivation in SiO<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf>. High-temperature annealing lowers interface states near the conduction band, with near-interface trap density at $1000^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ about $50 \\%$ lower than at $800^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, due to nitrogen bonding with sub-oxides that shifts defect levels deeper in the bandgap.

    "abstract": "Knowledge adaptation for human activity recognition (HAR) allows activity recognition models trained with data from one source domain to be adopted so they can be (re)used effectively in other target domains. Such recognition generalization is important because it reduces the cost and effort required to develop and manage multiple activity recognition models, each limited to a specific domain. Related work on knowledge adaptation is in early stages as it is currently limited to the recognition of generic activities like walking, running, or standing, and related data is usually collected in controlled environments lacking complexity and variability found in real-world settings. This paper proposes a novel AI of Things (AIoT) knowledge adaptation solution that combines full-body wearable sensors for collecting HAR data from real-world environments with an AI-based ensemble (referred to as ADAPT-X) that adapts activity recognition models for use across multiple target domains. ADPAT-X combines Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with Machine Learning (ML) models, and unlike existing approaches, it performs cross-domain HAR of complex activities in real-world settings. The paper presents an evaluation of ADAPT-X with five real-world datasets collected from 11 activities in sports and industrial production settings, where ADAPT-X achieves 76%–84% accuracy in HAR across target domains."

The leakage inductance on the output side of the high-frequency transformer in multi-port DC converters can cause the resonant slot currents of other ports to couple, affecting the power transfer of the converter. Accurately estimating the leakage inductance of a three-winding transformer is crucial for optimizing the design and performance of the converter. This paper focuses on the fully isolated series resonant three-port converter and provides detailed design steps for the threewinding transformer and two methods for calculating the leakage inductance of the three-port transformer. The design of the three-winding transformer is optimized to reduce the leakage inductance on the output-side branch. Three-dimensional finite element simulations are used to calculate the leakage inductance of each port under different winding arrangements and winding methods. Both simulation and experimental validation are carried out."

The basic thesis of the paper is that digital cultural documentation, when structured through formal modelling methods such as Unified Modeling Language, can serve as a sustainable framework for preserving and interpreting urban heritage. The paper begins with introductory elements on the meaning and importance of documenting abandoned buildings as part of a city’s tangible and intangible cultural identity. Through the text, we analyze how cultural heritage data is organized and represented in conceptual and technical models. Then, we focus on the relationships between buildings, users, and digital tools—such as My Google Maps, ArcGIS StoryMaps, and Artsteps—and how these interactions form coherent workflows for cultural preservation. Finally, we demonstrate how the Unified Modeling Language provides a clear and systematic representation of the documentation process, ensuring that digital heritage projects can be replicated, maintained, and expanded, thereby enabling continuity and public accessibility in the digital era."

Building upon the Intelligent Eco Networking (IEN) framework that unifies blockchain trust anchors with NDN's data plane, proposed by Peking University's research team, which integrates blockchain and distributed AI with NDN, the proposed Non-Fungible Data (NFD) mechanism implements IEN's tri-layer convergence paradigm which effectively operationalizes its vision through fully leveraging the advantages of NDN's named routing and in-network caching mechanisms. By introducing the Raft consensus protocol, it ensures metadata consistency and fault tolerance. Additionally, innovative optimizations are made in resource scheduling, where an improved auction protocol is designed and implemented to enhance resource allocation efficiency in decentralized storage and data distribution processes. This solution not only effectively addresses the centralized risks and efficiency bottlenecks of traditional off-chain storage but also provides Non-Fungible Data (NFD) with a high-performance, highly available distributed storage environment, ensuring rapid data access and scalability to meet data asset management requirements."

To overcome these issues, decentralized technologies like blockchain have emerged as a promising solution for enhancing the security, transparency, and scalability of traffic signal data management. This paper presents a blockchain-powered system tailored for traffic management, emphasizing the role of consensus algorithm which combines the functionalities of PoW and PoS to strengthen data integrity and security. The proposed framework adopts a decentralized approach to traffic data management, ensuring that only authorized entities can access and exchange information. The objective of this work is to develop a secure authentication mechanism leveraging blockchain technology to enable real-time, trustworthy traffic data sharing while mitigating potential security threats. This study creates a robust model for smart city traffic management by protecting against threats including Sybil assaults and hash power manipulation."

    "abstract": "The strategies for reducing torque ripples in switched reluctance motors, or SRMs, are examined in this review paper. Because of their doubly salient structure, nonlinear magnetic properties, and discrete commutation, SRMs display torque ripple. This torque ripple can cause vibrations, acoustic noise, and a decrease in efficiency. They are not as appropriate for some applications because of these effects. They are unable to function well in high-performance industrial systems or in systems like electric cars. Motor design improvements, current profiling techniques, advanced converter topologies, and smart control strategies such as fuzzy logic and sliding mode control are various methods reported in the literature for minimizing torque ripple. Key findings that are from existing research are summarized along with a thorough study that is of these methodologies. Particularly for emerging applications like electric mobility and renewable energy systems, improving the performance of SRM drives is the primary practical reference."

Software Defined Networking (SDN) addresses these limitations by decoupling the control plane from the data plane, thereby facilitating centralized and programmable network management. This study introduces a novel dynamic resource allocation method utilizing the Ryu controller and Mininet to optimize traffic flow by identifying congestion-free channels based on critical network attributes such as link bandwidth utilization, latency, and packet loss. The proposed method comprises four principal components: traffic categorization, a dynamic queuing system, an advanced status collection module, and a path selection module. The Ryu controller's dynamic packet direction based on priority levels ensures efficient resource utilization and improved Quality of Service (QoS). Simulated traffic scenarios demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm, hence highlighting its ability to enhance network performance beyond traditional static routing methods."

We characterize the broadcast channels which permit this Byzantine consensus and determine their capacity. We show that communication with consensus is possible only when the broadcast channel has embedded in it a natural “common channel” whose output both receivers can unambiguously determine from their own channel outputs. Interestingly, in general, the consensus capacity may be larger than the point-to-point capacity of the common channel, i.e., while decoding, the receivers may make use of parts of their output signals on which they may not have consensus provided there are some parts (namely, the common channel output) on which they can agree."

    "abstract": "The forthcoming launch of China's Fengyun-4 (FY-4) geostationary orbit microwave (GEO-MW) satellite will first implement microwave atmospheric sounding with high temporal resolution from a geostationary orbit, which is of critical importance to the fields of remote sensing and meteorological. To evaluate the potential contribution of geostationary microwave observations to operational numerical weather prediction (NWP), this study conducts a hybrid observing system simulation experiment (Hybrid-OSSE) for the FY-4 GEO-MW satellite, leveraging the China Meteorological Administration Global Forecast System (CMA-GFS). For validating the feasibility of the proposed GEO-MW Hybrid-OSSE framework, a preliminary Hybrid-OSSE experiment using FY-3E Microwave Temperature Sounder3 (MWTS3) data is initially performed. The results of the MWTS3 Hybrid-OSSE exhibit excellent consistency with those derived from data assimilation experiments utilizing the actual FY-3E MWTS3 observations across various evaluations, including analysis field verification, observation-space diagnostics, and Forecast Sensitivity to Observation (FSO) diagnostics. The FY-4 GEO-MW Hybrid-OSSE findings reveal that: (1) The assimilation of FY-4 microwave data significantly improves the atmospheric analysis over East Asia, with average improvements of 9.99% and 3.93% in the geopotential height and temperature fields, respectively. This demonstrates that enhancing the temporal resolution of microwave observations in a given region can notably improve data assimilation performance; (2) The additional sub-millimeter frequency channels on the FY-4 GEO-MW satellite positively impact data assimilation; (3) High temporal resolution microwave observations provide a clear advantage in improving the accuracy of humidity fields, yielding average improvements of 2.09% globally and 10.5% over East Asia—improvements that remain meaningful even within a multi-satellite observational framework."

    "abstract": "Hand motion capture devices are widely used in sign language translation, virtual reality (VR) motion reconstruction, and human–computer interaction. However, current devices often suffer from limited hand information collection due to the use of single sensor types, large sizes, and unreasonable layouts. To address these issues, we propose a smart glove based on the fusion of optical fibers and inertial sensors, which consists of nine polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) flexible optical fiber sensors and an inertial sensor. The flexible optical fiber sensors detect finger joint bending, while the inertial sensor captures spatial hand information. The system employs a multimodal fusion algorithm to enable both gesture recognition and human–computer interaction. Dynamic gestures of the 26 English letters and common English words consisting of two to five letters can be recognized using long short-term memory (LSTM) or bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) models combined with an attention mechanism. The gesture prediction accuracy for the 26 English letters and common English words reaches 99.76% and 97.66%, respectively. Additionally, the glove system wirelessly transmits data to a computer via the ESP32S3 chip’s Wi-Fi module, where UE4 software uses C++ programming to achieve VR motion restoration. By encoding the glove data in Python and transmitting it to a robotic hand, real-time control of the robotic hand can be achieved."

    "abstract": "Guided topic detection plays a crucial role in public opinion management and crisis response. To address the adversarial nature of group stances and the dynamic evolution of topics, this study proposes a guided topic detection model based on topic evolution and group stances. First, considering the hidden nature of groups in guided topics, the TA-Louvain hidden community mining method is proposed to quickly and accurately discover the community structure and track the structural changes of the same group. Then, for the complexity of group features in guided topics, an attention mechanism-based group feature representation method AG2vec was designed, which can improve the accuracy and robustness of group feature representation. Finally, to address the confrontational nature of group stances, stance-related features are extracted by combining game theory with a multiple linear regression algorithm. Based on this, group change GRU (GC-GRU), a GRU-based guided topic detection model, is proposed to capture the dynamic evolution of group features over time. Experimental validation shows that the method can flexibly respond to the rapid evolution of topics. It also fully accounts for the confrontational and dynamic types of user group stances, thereby enabling the effective detection of guided topics."
