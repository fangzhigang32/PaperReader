    "abstract": "Vertically stacked phase-change memory (PCM) architectures represent a promising strategy for realizing high device density; however, they remain susceptible to thermal disturbance (TD), manifested as heat-induced crosstalk between neighboring cells during switching operations. In this study, thermal effects in 3-D PCM arrays are systematically investigated using a multiphysics simulation framework, where our electrothermal and phase-field models are implemented within a commercial finite element solver. By quantitatively analyzing the effects of intercell spacing and cell dimensions, we identify geometrical regimes where TD can be suppressed without sacrificing memory density. Furthermore, we demonstrate that engineering the cell architecture to enhance thermal boundary resistance (TBR), for example, by incorporating recessed heater structures, significantly mitigates heat transfer to adjacent cells and enables lower reset energy operation. Simulation results further reveal the tradeoffs among heater thickness, interlayer dielectric (ILD) thickness, and device endurance over repeated programming cycles. These insights guide the design of stackable PCM cells for robust, energy-efficient, and scalable memory integration."

However, the parasitic capacitance between the sampling capacitor and the reference capacitor in the pre-sampling MDAC can induce gain and intercept errors in the pipeline stage, which significantly degrades the linearity of the entire pipelined ADC. This work presents a pre-sampling MDAC with parasitic compensation using a split-capacitor technique in the analog domain, combined with an intercept calibration method to correct the gain and intercept errors. Employing this technique, a 12-bit pre-sampling pipelined ADC fabricated in a 28nm CMOS process consumes 495mW at a 10GS/s sampling rate, achieving a signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) of 50.8dB and a spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) of 60.7dB with a Nyquist input signal."

    "abstract": "The growing integration of massive multi-source heterogeneous distributed generation (DG) into power grids and the emergence of cluster-collaboration-based generation modes have highlighted significant challenges in effectively controlling microgrid clusters (MGCs). This paper develops an interval type-2 (IT2) Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model for the secondary control layer of MGCs with additive disturbances, designed to capture the dynamics of heterogeneous DG under non-cyber attacks. By adopting the constrained-tightening-based prescribed performance control strategy, the proposed low-computation distributed fuzzy secondary control protocol achieves voltage cooperative restoration for MGCs subject to additive disturbances. Notably, this protocol eliminates reliance on the dynamics of upper-level DG for lower-level communication networks while the efficient multi-layer communication structure is employed to facilitate cluster collaboration. Subsequently, the MGC security detection-isolation-deferred switching framework under distributed cyber attacks is established. The proposed method based on performance monitoring for security detection, node isolation, and performance recovery, demonstrating that multi-source heterogeneous DGs can be reconnected to the MGC through deferred switching. This approach enhances the feasibility of the design while maintaining MGC performance standards. Finally, a standard IEEE 33-node distribution model is employed to validate the proposed control protocol's effectiveness via the OPAL-RT real-time simulation platform."

    "abstract": "Existing closed-loop controllers for functional electrical stimulation are prone to exceeding subject-specific stimulation limits, thereby limiting performance and also accelerating stimulation-induced muscle fatigue. In view of these challenges, this paper develops a Lyapunov-based model predictive control method to control knee flexion and extension during input-delayed stimulation. The method incorporates a contractive constraint under an electromechanical delay (EMD) compensation control law that achieves system stability despite an unknown constant input delay, bounded control constraints, and imperfectly estimated model parameters. A Lyapunov stability analysis proves that the Lyapunov constraint renders the closed-loop error ultimately bounded, and gain conditions are provided to guarantee recursive feasibility. LMPC's performance is explored in simulation and experiments and compared against an analytical proportional derivative-dynamic surface controller (PD-DSC) and a proportional-derivative-delay compensation (PD-DC) controller. In simulation, LMPC improved tracking root-mean-square error by 75.57% and 71.71%, on average, compared to PD-DSC and PD-DC, respectively. We observed that incorporating a slackening term often improved LMPC's tracking performance, although strict enforcement of the Lyapunov constraint was superior when there was greater EMD estimation error. Additionally, unlike PD-DSC and PD-DC, LMPC was not destabilized when EMD was overestimated or underestimated, nor did it violate input constraints. In knee extension experiments, LMPC respected input constraints, which PD-DSC did not. The LMPC was also validated in overground walking experiments to test its ability to produce both knee flexion and extension in participants with and without spinal cord injury."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a systematic review of Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM), analyzing its scientific, methodological, and infrastructural evolution over more than three decades. Rather than being a taxonomic survey, the review develops a system-level synthesis in which NILM is conceptualized as an observability-conditioned cyber-physical inference problem. In this formulation, sensing regimes, physical observability ceilings, abstraction mechanisms, and deployment contexts jointly delimit the admissible inference space and condition achievable performance. A corpus of 2,908 publications indexed in the Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus was analyzed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol and interpreted through an integrated bibliometric and qualitative analytical framework structured under the Theory-Context-Characteristics-Methodology (TCCM) perspective. The literature is organized into methodological regimes including deterministic low-frequency formulations, probabilistic and optimization-based models, and abstraction-driven deep learning architectures. The analysis indicates that reported performance gains are primarily conditioned by sensing infrastructures and observability structures rather than by algorithmic refinement in isolation. Heterogeneity in sensing configurations and evaluation protocols limits cross-study comparability and deployment transferability. A structural gap is identified between abstraction-driven performance gains and the progressive attenuation of explicit physical interpretability, with implications for validation transparency, physical coherence, and operational robustness. Interpretability is therefore examined as an evaluation-layer property emerging from the interaction between observability regimes, abstraction depth, and deployment constraints. The review concludes that sustainable progress in NILM requires regime-aware design and evaluation paradigms that integrate performance, generalization, physical coherence, and interpretability within deployment-constrained operational environments."

This letter proposes a self-governing harmonic mitigation strategy through coordinated operation of multiple ELZs in large power-to-hydrogen (P2H) plants. First, the harmonic model of TR-powered ELZs is derived, revealing a natural harmonic cancellation mechanism among them. Based on this, a system-level operation scheme based on phasor modulation is developed and integrated into plant scheduling. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed method reduces harmonic currents by 21.2%–39.7% and ensures grid-code compliance, with only a 0.25% loss in hydrogen output, while increasing total revenue by over 21% compared to production-oriented strategies."

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks have emerged as powerful tools for analyzing graph-structured data. However, their performance often varies across datasets due to challenges such as noisy edges, sparse connectivity, and over-smoothing in deep layers. To address these limitations, Graph Deformation Network Convolution (GDNConv) is proposed as a novel graph convolution model that incorporates four key innovations: <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">dynamic edge weight learning</i> to filter noisy connections, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">graph attention deformation</i> to prioritize relevant neighbors, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">multi-level aggregation</i> to capture multi-scale patterns, and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">self-regularization</i> to stabilize training. This proposed model demonstrates robustness and scalability, particularly for real-world applications involving complex and noisy graph structures, such as social networks and recommendation systems. It has ability to dynamically adapt graph topology during training and superior performance on both dense and sparse datasets highlight its potential as a versatile solution for graph-based learning tasks. Additionally, GDNConv’s computational efficiency and self-regularization mechanisms make it suitable for large-scale applications where resource constraints are a concern. The proposed model is evaluated on four benchmark datasets—Cora, CiteSeer, PubMed, and ogbn-arxiv—and compared with several state-of-the-art models, including Graph Convolutional Network, Graph Attention Network, and Graph Sample and Aggregate. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model consistently outperforms these baseline approaches, achieving improvements of 4.7% and 4.2% in both accuracy and F1 score."

    "abstract": "Distributed IoT water quality monitoring systems are evolving toward greater density, broader coverage, and enhanced real-time performance. However, severe constraints on edge-node bandwidth, power consumption, and computational capability make high-accuracy prediction and reliable anomaly detection extremely challenging under intense noise and non-stationary conditions. Water quality time series are characterized by abrupt changes, complex time–frequency patterns, and dominant noise components. Conventional deep learning models applied to such data tend to over-smooth signals, exhibit limited sensitivity to transient features, and incur excessive communication overhead.To address these limitations, a boundary-aware time–frequency sparse learning codec termed BASM is proposed for resource-constrained environments. Preservation of abrupt boundaries and localized anomaly structures is enhanced through boundary-weighted wavelet sparse reconstruction, while prediction robustness in low-SNR regimes is achieved via sparsity-guided ESN. Additionally, a lightweight adaptive anomaly-triggered reporting mechanism is integrated, enabling substantial reduction in uplink traffic without compromising the integrity of anomaly information. Extensive evaluation on real-world datasets from the Yangtze River basin demonstrates that BASM maintains superior stability and accuracy in low-SNR conditions while significantly lowering both communication and computational costs. The framework establishes a new communication–computation co-design paradigm for efficient edge intelligence in IoT-based water quality monitoring."

    "abstract": "Current propulsion methodologies employed during deep space exploration are usually short in their ability to enable manned interplanetary missions to be performed over a long period of time. Chemical rockets are very reliable in terms of launch performance; however, they are inefficient for long-range operation, as they consume a significant amount of propellant and have a low specific impulse. The current propulsion systems, including electric and plasma propulsion systems, as well as the Hall effect and VASIMR propulsion systems, have limitations in the form of plasma instabilities, energy loss, and a lack of high thrust scalability. The outcome of these inadequacies is the need for a propulsion paradigm that is sustainable and capable of producing increased efficiency, thrust density, and mission flexibility. To address this issue promptly, we introduce Quantum-Powered Plasma Propulsion (QPPP). This hybrid propulsion system integrates a blend of state-of-the-art plasma acceleration principles with quantum-capable sensing and control. It involves heating the plasma in a system, applying radio frequency to accelerate ions efficiently using superconducting magnetic nozzles, and accurately locating and in real-time the density, potential, and electromagnetic variations of the plasma. These measurements are fed into a quantum-assisted predictive control loop, in which quantum algorithms can compute the dynamics of the plasma within seconds, enabling sub-cycle optimal control of thrust and stability. Furthermore, the quantum hydrodynamic corrections, including the contribution of the Bohm potential and quantum pressure, are provided to achieve a perfect ion energy distribution and suppress turbulence, which is usually devastating to plasma thrusters. Analytical estimates based on scaled-down quantum magnetohydrodynamic models suggest that QPPP is capable of achieving a thrust and efficiency gain in the 20 to 40 per cent range compared to state-of-the-art plasma thrusters at the same power levels, and that specific impulse can increase to 20 times, thereby reducing propellant consumption and extending mission lifetimes. Finally, QPPP proposes an opportunity-based, transformational propulsion technology that will address the inefficiencies of existing systems in terms of sustainability, efficiency, and scalability, enabling reliable and high-performance exploration of deep space."

Our system, GenSQL, uses a context-aware semantic parsing framework that responds to different database schemes while eliminating tag needings forming domain specific training. In contrast to previous approaches focusing on phrase based schema linking or heavily dependent on complex predefined encoders/genetive models, GenSQL illustrates how large generative models can capture user intent and outperform the syntactically correct SQL on schema aware translation. The system supports multiple input types including text face and speech recognition, and multiple inputs can support dynamic schema adaptation. GenSQL achieves a precision of $\\mathbf{9 4 \\%}$ incomplex analytical queries, surpassing recent methods by $\\mathbf{7. 8 \\%}$. Analysis of error cases reveals that GenSQL shines particularly in simplifying ambiguous natural language queries and queries that involve complex joins. With support for an array of data formats and the ability to handle unfamiliar schemas, this system is especially useful for non-technical users wanting to analyze different data sets without any SQL training."

The DSW application, launched by the Depok City Government, provides various public service information accessible via mobile phones, and users can leave reviews about their experiences. Sentiment analysis of user reviews can provide insights into public perception of the application. This research utilizes a dataset of user reviews from the Google Play Store and applies a hybrid approach by using IndoBERT for textual embedding and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for sentiment classification into positive, negative, and neutral categories. Experimental results show that the IndoBERT-SVM model achieves excellent performance, with a test accuracy of 99.1%, macro-averaged precision of 99%, recall of 98%, and F1-score of 99%. At the class level, the model reaches an F1-score of 1.00 for negative sentiment, 0.97 for neutral sentiment, and 0.99 for positive sentiment. These results highlight the potential of combining language-specific pre-trained transformers with traditional machine learning classifiers. The findings are expected to assist application developers and the Depok City Government in understanding user sentiments, improving public service quality, and addressing key community concerns."

However, digital and network technologies in smart grids bring significant vulnerabilities that can be exploited by malicious attackers. In addition to discriminative models for attack detection tasks, generative models such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) are also exploited in the field of false data injection attack (FDIA) on smart grids. In this paper, we propose a novel objective-guided generative model for FDIA sample generation which is designed to support various objectives. Our approach employs a GAN to create FDIA samples, while the training process is guided by an extra pretrained GNN detector. From attackers’ perspectives, adversarial samples can be generated by our model to discover and exploit weaknesses in current detectors. From defenders’ perspectives, they can utilize the model to generate FDIA samples for further training and analysis without running expensive and time-consuming simulations that require domain expertise. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model in generating high-quality FDIA samples based on various objectives."

Conventional forecasting methods which are mainly the products of the numerical weather prediction (NWP) models are founded on computer simulations and atmospheric science. Although helpful, the models also have drawbacks since they are very demanding in terms of processing, lack a good understanding of the physical process, and struggle to utilize large-scale observational data. The development of data-driven technologies has brought promising topical advances in terms of better predictions and efficiency in processing, adaptation to complex patterns, especially regarding Machine Learning (ML) in addition to Artificial Intelligence (AI).

This paper proposes a dual-layer game-based optimization framework for VPPs under a shared energy storage leasing mechanism. The upper layer models cooperative interactions among VPPs, while the lower layer captures internal leader-follower decisions between operators and distributed resources. To address the model's high dimensionality and nonlinearity, an improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm is developed by introducing adaptive inertia weights and a chaotic disturbance mechanism to improve convergence and stability. Simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances the overall economic performance of VPPs and effectively reduces energy storage investment costs, providing theoretical and practical guidance for low-carbon and efficient VPP operation."

    "abstract": "The partial shading in Photovoltaic (PV) arrays causes the single maximum power versus voltage (P-V) curve to transit into the multi maximum curve, this led to convergence issues with the traditional maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithms. Many partial shading centered maximum power point tracking algorithm are available in the literature, these are referred as global maximum power point tracking (GMPPT) methods. The number of peaks considered in these algorithms are less. In this paper, a new partial shading algorithm is proposed, the algorithm can handle a greater number of peaks on the P-V curve. The proposed algorithm is based on the module voltage guidance control. The region of operation on the P-V curve is verified by observing the module voltages. The algorithm is implemented on a boost converter connected to the terminals of a PV array, the array is having three modules connected in series. The model is simulated for two difference cases of three peaks."

    "abstract": "Ensuring food security and sustainable agricultural practices depends on early diagnosis of crop diseases. This paper presents a strong multi-crop disease classification system able to detect ten distinct conditions: Wheat Septoria, Wheat Rust, Sugarcane Fungal, Sugarcane Bacterial, Rice Fungal, Rice Bacterial, Maize Fungal, Maize Bacterial, Pest Attack, and Healthy leaves. Class imbalance was handled using the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) on 1,262 photos gathered from Kaggle and online sources. Feature extraction was done using a hybrid approach incorporating 283 features from statistical descriptors, Haralick texture features, Hu moments, Shannon entropy, and Gabor filters. Using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, several classifiers including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN 1D), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) were assessed. Of them, RF, GBM, and CNN 1D performed best with accuracies higher than 95 %. A stacking ensemble model incorporating these three high-performing classifiers was created, hence improving classification performance to 96% accuracy, 95.98% precision, 96% recall, and 95.98% F1-score. For multi-crop disease identification, the suggested model shows good generalisation capacity and efficiently uses both handmade and deep features. This study offers a scalable and precise method for early identification and categorisation of several agricultural diseases, which can greatly help farmers and agronomists in carrying out timely intervention plans for better control of crop health."

Traditional communication tools don't always have the intelligence and responsiveness needed to make decisions in real time, let people work together smoothly, and give people personalised experiences. The goal of this study is to suggest a business communication architecture that uses AI, NLP, machine learning, sentiment analysis, and automated feedback systems to improve the flow of information both inside and outside of the company. The capabilities of the framework include the automation of tedious communication activities, the improvement of message routing, the determination of what the sender intended, and the provision of intelligent, context-aware responses. Because it is able to adjust to changing circumstances and acquire knowledge from data in real time, the framework is capable of undergoing transformations. People are still trying to find out how the framework may assist the company in carrying out its functions more efficiently, improving its communication, and maintaining its concentration on the ultimate objective. The findings of this research may provide us with further knowledge about intelligent business systems since they explain how to improve communication models in order to make them more responsive, safe, and in accordance with the goals."

To further exploit the dual-sequence voltage support capability of the DFIG, this paper proposes a novel model aimed at maximizing this support subject to the rotor-side limitations. For a prescribed rotor current magnitude, the proposed model analytically derives the optimal injection angles for both the positive-and negative-sequence rotor current components. A key finding reveals that, in contrast to conventional grid tied converters, these optimal angles are functions not only of the grid impedance parameters but also of the DFIG’s intrinsic inductances. Experimental validation based on SimuNPS confirms that the proposed rotor current injection strategy significantly enhances the DFIG’s capacity for unbalanced voltage suppression, while strictly adhering to the rotor-side operational constraints."

    "abstract": "In modern digital systems, efficient arithmetic operations are crucial for improving performance and reducing power use. Carry Select Adders (CSAs) are popular due to their speed, but conventional designs have high power consumption and larger area because of unnecessary logic. This paper shows the design and implementation of XOR-based 16-bit and 32-bit CSAs using reversible logic gates, created with Vivado. Unlike traditional methods that use Cadence-based workflows and irreversible gates, this new design uses reversible logic to cut down on power use, lower the gate count, and improve area efficiency. The XORbased structure removes unnecessary sum and carry logic while keeping speed advantages. Simulations in Vivado show that the reversible logic-based CSAs result in significant decreases in power consumption (up to 76%) compared to traditional 16-bit CSA designs. The results confirm that reversible logic is suitable for low-power, high-performance arithmetic designs and provides a scalable solution for energy-efficient computing platforms."

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, driven by the airborne transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which primarily affects the lungs and can become life-threatening if not diagnosed and treated early. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 10.6 million people contracted TB in 2022, and 1.3 million deaths were reported among HIV-negative individuals, with an additional 167,000 deaths among HIV-positive individuals, highlighting the ongoing global health burden. While a range of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning-based systems have been developed for TB detection using chest X-rays, CT scans, or multimodal data, existing approaches often suffer from key limitations, including lack of interpretability, data privacy concerns, and generalization issues when applied across diverse populations or healthcare settings. To address these gaps, a novel privacy-preserving tuberculosis detection framework is proposed, leveraging federated learning integrated with a Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture enhanced by Grad-CAM for interpretability. This approach enables collaborative model training across distributed datasets without centralizing sensitive patient data, while also offering visual explanations for clinical validation. Experimental evaluation on publicly available chest X-ray datasets demonstrates significant performance, achieving an accuracy of 98% and F1-score of 0.98, indicating its robustness, transparency, and suitability for real-world deployment in resource-constrained and privacysensitive environments."

By combining wearable smart badges, sensor-equipped disinfectant dispensers, and gamification elements, healthcare workers are encouraged to perform hand disinfections more frequently and correctly. Initial field tests demonstrated a significant increase in disinfection rates and a reduction in hospital-acquired infections. However, challenges such as inaccurate user identification, lack of disinfection reminders, and staff concerns about surveillance were identified. To address these issues, the project explores alternative technologies including ultrasound and UWB-based positioning, biometric hand geometry recognition, and NFC wristbands. Furthermore, the integration of spatial risk modeling based on hospital layouts and privacy-preserving activity tracking is proposed. The paper outlines these enhancements and presents a framework for future hygiene-supporting systems in clinical environments."

This research introduces a privacy-preserving framework that achieves 99.2% accuracy in detecting brute-force attacks in encrypted 6G traffic without decryption. We compare supervised (CNN) and unsupervised (autoencoder) models operating exclusively on flow-level metadata such as packet timing, size distribution, and protocol behavior. The CNN classifier significantly outperforms the autoencoder and can be optimized (0.7MB) for edge deployment, enabling terabit-speed monitoring with sub-millisecond latency when distributed across 6G networks. Our approach resolves the security-privacy tension by maintaining encryption while effectively identifying malicious activities, making it ideal for future 6G environments where both privacy and computational efficiency are critical."

    "abstract": "Modern security systems require rapid and accurate threat identification, particularly in high risk environments such as military facilities, airports, and weapon storage areas. Computer Vision based firearm detection has become an effective approach due to its ability to operate automatically using deep learning algorithms. Although the YOLO family continues to evolve, comparative evaluations of the latest versions YOLOv8, YOLOv11, and YOLOv12 on the same static image dataset remain limited. This study analyzes the performance of these three models using metrics such as mAP, precision, recall, training time, inference time, and statistical testing. The experimental results show notable performance differences. YOLOv8 achieves the fastest training time (25.17 ± 0.11 minutes), followed by YOLOv11 (28.90 ± 0.21 minutes) and YOLOv12 (30.63 ± 0.24 minutes). For inference speed, YOLOv11 is the fastest in detecting long gun (0.58 ± 0.29 s) and short gun (0.68 ± 0.29 s) objects, while YOLOv8 shows moderate speed and YOLOv12 performs the slowest. In terms of detection accuracy, YOLOv8 provides the highest performance for long gun (88.00 ± 13.89%) and short gun (84.00 ± 5.29%), YOLOv11 reaches moderate accuracy, and YOLOv12 records the lowest and most variable results. Paired T-test results confirm significant differences in training time, with all p-values < 0.05, indicating that the three models differ statistically in computational efficiency. Meanwhile, no significant differences were found in detection speed or testing accuracy, as all p-values exceed 0.05 for both categories. Overall, YOLOv8 is the most suitable model when accuracy is the primary objective, while YOLOv11 is preferable for applications requiring faster inference. YOLOv12 provides the weakest performance and offers no clear advantage in this context."

    "abstract": "There are two aspects to the fact that the modern power grid must grapple with the massive growth of the renewable sources of the energy. Although it is both environmentally clean and economically efficient, the intermittent and unpredictable nature of wind and solar generation poses the most crucial implementation challenges, in the context of both providing grid stability and reliability and the grid efficiency in general. To address this issue, this paper suggests the Federated Edge-Enhanced Hybrid AI (FEEHAI) System, a new real-time forecasting and combination framework, which was created with intelligent, large, and privacy-sensitive renewable grid controls in mind. The consequence is that FEEHAI incorporates a decentralized yet synergistic distributed architecture of edge computing that has three fundamental capabilities (federated learning, multi-modal data fusion, and federated learning). The opportunity to process the data on the edge nodes located within the grid infrastructure and obtain a rapid response in real time is provided by the fact that there are edge nodes embedded within the grid infrastructure. At the same time, federated learning standards facilitate training on multi-model on decentralized devices where user and infrastructure privacy is maintained and enhance the performance levels of prediction. Such a system combines multiple non-homogeneous data, such as weather sensors, satellite data, and past pattern of electricity use, present telemetry of the grid depending on an aggregate of AI that included deep neural networks and spatiotemporal models. The simulation results are further extrapolated to the extent that: FEEHAI performs better than the older counter parts, which are centralized and not federated in the aspects of the precision of the prediction and responsiveness to highly volatile parts. Besides, the architecture accommodates the dynamic scaling on regional scale and also grid-layer-by-grid-layer scale within the micro grids and national transmission system. The proposed FEEHAI System will guarantee the attainment of resilience reasons, real-time renewable energy activities since; the proposed system will have the capacity of carrying out AI driven intelligence of the edge level infrastructure that will make the system sustainable as far as the data privacy and system nimbleness is concerned."

First, a frequency response model for TCLs is established, incorporating communication and response delays, and a dynamic response model analogous to the droop characteristics of conventional generators is constructed. Subsequently, a response control method for TCL participation in grid frequency regulation is proposed, aimed at enhancing power system frequency stability.

    "abstract": "Anemia affects approximately one-quarter of the global population. While its diagnosis typically relies on hemoglobin (Hgb) measurement through venous blood draws, such methods require access to clinical infrastructure and trained personnel, limiting accessibility in rural and resource-limited settings. In addition, invasive blood sampling can cause pain, infection risk, and iatrogenic blood loss. Although noninvasive technologies have been developed, they often require expensive and bulky equipment, and their performance can be affected by skin tone variability across diverse populations. To overcome these limitations, we present a mobile health (mHealth) technology utilizing neural network models to noninvasively estimate blood Hgb levels based solely on red-green-blue (RGB) color values from smartphone photos of peripheral tissue. The palpebral conjunctiva (inner eyelid) is selected as a sensing site due to its easy accessibility, uniform microvasculature, and absence of confounding skin pigments. By optimizing neural networks with varying spectral partialities, we demonstrate that the proposed method can reliably predict blood Hgb levels using only limited RGB input, eliminating the need for complex and costly optical components. This study highlights how machine learning-powered mHealth technology can reduce dependence on clinical laboratories and hardware complexity, offering accessible and scalable solutions in resource-limited and home settings."

    "abstract": "Multimodal generative AI agents are increasingly deployed in dynamic real-world environments that demand constant contextual responsiveness, cross-domain generalization, and non-disruptive learning. However, current generative systems, predominantly reliant on static prompts, supervised fine-tuning, or reinforcement signals, struggle to adapt in real-time to implicit user cues, task drift, or failure patterns.This paper introduces the Embodied Meta-Adaptation Engine (EMAE), a novel architecture for generative agents that enables continuous, embodied learning through ambient, non-verbal feedback loops. Unlike traditional meta-learning models, EMAE does not require labeled data or formal rewards. Instead, it leverages environmental signals such as cursor behavior, document navigation flow, silent rejection patterns, or micro-interaction data to modulate reasoning strategies, switch generation styles, or reroute attention flows dynamically.The system is composed of four key components: (1) an adaptive controller, (2) a failure memory module, (3) a strategy-orchestration switchboard, and (4) a cross-modal integration layer. This architecture is designed to operate seamlessly across text, vision, audio, and tabular modalities. Through prototypes deployed in clinical documentation, legal contract summarization, and multilingual customer support, EMAE demonstrates increased user satisfaction, lower task latency, and higher error resilience without requiring retraining or explicit feedback.We present the full system design, cognitive architecture, experimental benchmarks, and commercial use case potential. EMAE represents a major shift in the paradigm of generative AI, from passively trained systems to actively adaptive agents."

To address this, we propose a mathematical model to solve the problem of anti-deception evidence fusion under such conditions, and employ Deep Q-Networks (DQN) for online training and decision-making to enable real-time processing. Through comparative analysis of multiple numerical experiments, the effectiveness of the proposed method in real-time dynamic environment is validated."

    "abstract": "The rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) applications across domains such as healthcare, smart cities, industry, and agriculture has intensified the need for secure yet lightweight cryptographic mechanisms. Conventional algorithms are often unsuitable for resource-constrained devices due to high computational, memory, and energy demands. This study presents a systematic review and performance evaluation of 39 lightweight cryptographic algorithms (LWC) implemented on the ESP32 platform. Key decision criteria—including energy efficiency, latency, memory footprint, and implementation cost—are analyzed. A multi-criteria decision-making framework using the TOPSIS method ranks algorithms based on performance tradeoffs. Results identify XTEA, SPECK, and TEA as top-performing candidates. The proposed framework serves as a practical guide for selecting efficient and secure LWC solutions in constrained IoT environments."

    "abstract": "Check-in data has been generated at an explosive rate in recent years due to the wide use of location-based social networks. To mine check-in data, a critical task is to learn a good check-in data representation since it is the foundation for downstream mining tasks such as location retrieval and recommendation. Established representation approaches tend to ignore the temporal information carried in check-in data, or treat spatial and temporal information separately. However, such strategy may be hard to reflect the reality. Beyond, the semantic information in check-in data is insufficiently exploited and enriched in existing approaches. In this paper, we propose a Space-Time-Semantic architecture for check-in sequence semantic representation, called STS, which spontaneously learns the spatiotemporal and semantic information carried in check-in data with a united framework. The basic idea is to learn check-in data representation as a bridge to connect location and time as a whole, by predicting the next check-in venue and time based on distributed vector representation and adaptive Hawkes process. Meanwhile, the semantics are directly embedded into the check-in distributed vector representation during the learning process. Extensive experiments on two real-world check-in data sets show that our proposed framework not only allows learning a good representation to capture the space and time information effectively but also has good performance of check-in data semantic enrichment."

Traditional monitoring methods are often limited by the lack of real-time tracking and automation, which can lead to medicine degradation and financial losses. This paper proposes an IoT-based system using an ESP32 microcontroller, RFID technology, and temperature sensors to monitor and track pharmaceutical conditions in realtime. The system continuously measures and transmits temperature data to a cloud platform, enabling remote supervision and immediate corrective actions when deviations occur. RFID tags help track medicine packages at key checkpoints, ensuring compliance with pharmaceutical regulations. An automated alert system notifies stakeholders of any temperature variations through SMS, email, or mobile applications. By integrating real-time monitoring, automated tracking, and cloud-based data storage, this system enhances medicine safety, regulatory compliance, and supply chain efficiency."

An Endfire antenna array is employed at the array ports to realize the radiation mechanism, enabling efficient control of the beam directions. Full-wave simulations confirm that the antenna achieves reflection coefficients below −10 dB at the operating frequency, validating the effectiveness of the feed network. The system successfully generates four directive beams oriented at approximately −11°, 11°,−49° and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$+49 \\circ$</tex>, covering a total scanning range close to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\pm 49 \\circ$</tex>.

In centralized operation, grid-current sensing alone suffices to regulate total system power; however, individual module currents cannot be independently controlled. Decentralized operation enables flexible power sharing and independent regulation but demands per-unit phase-current measurements, increasing sensor count and complexity. To overcome this limitation, a reduced-sensor current-reconstruction method is proposed, wherein each converter's AC-side phase currents are obtained as the average of two independent estimates - one derived from the DC-link current and the other from a plant model driven by measured grid voltages. Estimation accuracy is further enhanced through adaptive selection that prioritizes the model-based estimate during sector transitions, where DC-link-based estimation becomes unreliable. This approach reduces sensing to a single DC-side current sensor per converter. The proposed hybrid control and estimation framework, scalable to any number of converter units, is modeled and validated in PLECS with digitally implemented control blocks emulating real-time execution on a Texas Instruments TMS320F28379D microcontroller."

The main purpose is to help identify the eventual advantages of active rectifiers. The studies under consideration provide an appreciation of typical three-phase two-level PWM rectifiers and three-phase Vienna rectifiers with an additional stage based on buck DC-DC conversion, for electrolyzer application. The comparative analysis is based on the following metrics: the current ripple, the power factor, the total harmonic distortion, the active switch utilization ratio, and the complexity of the solution. A Simulink model corresponding to each topology was developed to obtain the performance values for the comparison. The procedure involved conducting a steady-state analysis of each topology through simulations to obtain the main waveforms and the values for each criterion. The scores for each technical solution were then calculated. The solution based on the Vienna 3-switch rectifier presented the best results overall."

This paper presents a novel model predictive control formulation for the energy management of multi-stack fuel cell systems. By integrating multi-objective optimization, lifetime adaptation, temperature dependency, and start-stop control, the proposed approach addresses the conflicting requirements of efficiency and durability. The simulation results span a Pareto surface in the three-dimensional objective space that shifts its position over the system’s lifetime. The proposed MPC formulation automatically adjusts operational conditions in response to this objective prioritization, as demonstrated through histograms. Additionally, the inter-stack power distribution is used to mitigate higher cell potentials and optimize overall efficiency. This paper motivates to focus operating strategies on minimizing stack degradation at begin of life, where the loss of active platinum surface area is most critical and emphasizes the necessity of adapting this prioritization throughout the system’s lifetime."

They incorporate non-volatility and in-memory computing, and parallelism to deliver low-power/high-performance alternatives. We also emphasize the emerging importance of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, not only to the power management optimizations, but also to direct the materials discovery and choice of fabrication processes of MOSFET and non-MOSFET devices. In comparative analysis, there are up to $95 \\%$ power saving, 60 percent efficiency increase with hybrid energy harvesting and high thermal reduction by using AI-enhanced cooling.

In this paper, a convolutional autoencoder (CAE) is employed to extract overcomplete features from EIS data. To capture temporal dependencies, obtained features from every five consecutive cycles are stacked into short sequences. These sequences are fed into a convolutional neural network (CNN) to estimate battery SOH. Extensive experiments are conducted on datasets from multiple cells operating at three different temperatures. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed CNN model, which incorporates temporal information, outperforms the baseline models by achieving lower root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) values as well as higher coefficient of determination (R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>) scores."

In this paper, we propose a deep learning model based automated classification system to classify different diseases of banana plants using image processing techniques. We use the CNNs to process the leaf images and to predict accurately the types of diseases. The approach consists of image preprocessing followed by feature extraction, then classification using proprietary and pretrained CNNs such as Custom CNN, InceptionV3, ResNet50 and EfficientNetB0. The developed system provides a scalable, precise, and fast resolution to detect diseases at an early stage, thereby facilitating in time intervention to reduce the crop damage.

    "abstract": "Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a powerful tool for process monitoring and fault detection. Its traditional form assumes precise measurements, which is rarely the case in real systems. Interval PCA (IPCA), such as Symbolic Covariance PCA (SCPCA), Midpoint and Raddi PCA (MRPCA), and Complete Information PCA (CIPCA) approaches were introduced to extend PCA and incorporate measurement uncertainty. However, when a constant-width interval variable is considered to describe the uncertainty, these methods often fail to capture the full variability contained in interval representations. This paper examines the robustness of IPCA methods in the context of sensor fault detection and diagnosis (FDD), using a greenhouse prototype system as a case study. Robustness is evaluated through False Alarm Rate (FAR) analysis, based on squared prediction error (SPE) indices including, <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$S P E_{L}, S P E_{C}$</tex>, and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$S P E_{U}$</tex>, computed at the lower, center, and upper points of the interval data in the testing phase, respectively. The results show that IPCA models predict well the center of interval data but have difficulties with the lower and upper bounds. This makes them less robust and increases FAR. These outcomes highlight the limitations of current IPCA methods and underscore the need for more effective approaches that can effectively address uncertainty to enhance fault detection in real-world systems."

However, various types of damage, such as computers that cannot turn on, screens that do not display images, or systems that frequently restart, still often occur. The process of diagnosing such damage is generally done manually, which takes a long time and the results are not necessarily consistent. To overcome this, this study developed an expert system for diagnosing computer malfunctions that combines a Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach and a knowledge base with the Forward Chaining (FC) and Certainty Factor (CF) methods. The main objective of this study is to help users and IT staff diagnose computer malfunctions quickly and accurately, simply by entering complaints in natural language. The NLP module applies keyword matching enhanced with synonym expansion and TF-IDF–based weighting to extract relevant symptoms from free-text complaints. The KB consists of 25 symptoms, 15 fault types, and 30 rules structured in IF– THEN format. The reasoning process is carried out using the FC method to trace possible causes of damage, while the CF method is used to calculate the confidence level of the diagnosis results. The system was tested using computer symptom and damage data collected from the FKIK ICT unit. Tested using 30 real laboratory cases, the system achieved 85% accuracy and produced diagnoses up to 10× faster than manual troubleshooting. These results indicate that combining NLP and hybrid reasoning improves consistency and efficiency in IT helpdesk workflows. For further research, the system will be developed into an interactive AI chatbot with continuous learning capabilities using machine learning algorithms so that it can automatically adapt to new cases."

Evaluated on noisy, in-the-wild transcripts from real classroom recordings, the fine-tuned model outperforms a zero-shot GPT-4o-mini baseline across four key metrics: turn-level classification (F1: 0.894), quote-level precision (0.831) and recall (0.804), detection of multiple OTRs within a single turn (F1: 0.776), and quote alignment, with 82.8% of extracted quotes exactly matching expert annotations. At the lesson-level, predicted OTR totals are highly correlated (r: 0.97) with ground truth, indicating consistent performance across varied teachers and contexts.

    "abstract": "This study introduces a hybrid artificial intelligence-based approach that uses adaptive thresholding and time-frequency features to detect high impedance faults (HIFs) in electrical distribution networks. To capture minor fault features, the suggested method makes use of statistical feature extraction in both the time and frequency domains and signal processing techniques like the Discrete Wavelet Transform. These characteristics, which are utilized to train and evaluate classification models in MATLAB, include wavelet energy, crest factor, standard deviation, and root mean square. Preliminary fault screening is improved by integrating a novel adaptive thresholding approach. Ensemble learning techniques are used for the classification, and a wide range of metrics, such as the confusion matrix, ROC curve, feature significance plot, PCA-based clustering, and ensemble accuracy tracking, are used to assess performance. With notable true positive and true negative rates, few false alarms, and efficient feature reparability between fault and non-fault classes, the results show a high degree of accuracy. The suggested model makes a significant contribution to enhancing the dependability and security of power distribution systems since it has great generalization capabilities and practical applicability."

Existing machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods provide promising results, but they often struggle with capturing complex dependencies in requirement data. This paper introduces a novel hybrid Quantum-Classical Machine Learning (QML) framework to improve the accuracy and reliability of requirement risk classification. The dataset was preprocessed using label encoding, Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), ANOVA F-test (SelectKBest) for feature selection, and feature scaling to enable quantum circuit integration. Strongly entangling quantum circuits were implemented using the Qiskit framework to generate quantumenhanced features, which were fused with classical features. Four hybrid models-RF + QML, LGBM + QML, LR + QML, and Q-Kernel + MLP-were trained and evaluated. Experimental results show that the proposed Q-Kernel + MLP model achieved the best performance with $97.76 \\%$ accuracy, $97.92 \\%$ precision, $97.76 \\%$ recall, and an F 1 -score of $97.77 \\%$, outperforming classical baselines by up to $4 \\%$. These findings highlight the potential of quantum-enhanced learning in software engineering, offering a scalable and robust solution for early risk detection and supporting more reliable project planning and software quality assurance."

    "abstract": "The growing use of large language models (LLMs) in industry demands new solutions for governance, compliance, and secure coordination across distributed AI agents. Existing agent frameworks lack built-in policy controls and assume a uniform environment, leading to risks from cross-border data flows and unmonitored information leakage. We propose a formal orchestration protocol that embeds jurisdictional rules, access controls, and auditability into every agent interaction. A central orchestrator decomposes complex requests into tasks, consults an Agent Registry (capturing each agent’s location, role, trust score, etc.) and a Policy Engine (enforcing laws like GDPR/HIPAA and security rules), and dynamically routes subtasks to eligible agents. Each agent has isolated memory shards and communicates a structured protocol with schema validation. A tamper-evident audit log captures every decision for post-hoc review. This ensures that sensitive data never crosses prohibited boundaries and every step is traceable. Unlike static LLM chains, our system constructs an on-the-fly task graph that adapts in real-time, enabling parallel execution and failover. Simulations show that this approach can reduce response latency while eliminating compliance violations. By combining policy-driven orchestration, memory isolation, and rigorous auditing, our protocol makes multi-agent AI workflows secure, compliant, and transparent in ways no existing framework has demonstrated."

    "abstract": "Traditional loss functions encounter difficulties in effectively segmenting medical image, specifically when classes in dataset are imbalanced. Furthermore, many of these loss functions require extensive hyperparameter tuning, which limits their adaptability to different segmentation tasks and datasets. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents a novel loss function, named α-aggregator SegLoss, which dynamically sets the Tversky index over a range of α values. The performance of the proposed α-aggregator SegLoss is evaluated for segmenting White Blood Cell (WBC) from microscopic blood smear images using two popular deep learning-based segmentation architectures, U-Net and Deeplabv3+. The αaggregator SegLoss demonstrates significant performance improvements. It improves the validation Dice coefficient by 0.39 – 5.01% and IoU by 0.68 – 9.01% over the traditional loss functions using the U-Net architecture. It achieves 0.16 – 3.42% increase in the Dice coefficient and -0.18 – 4.65 % increase in IoU using DeepLabv3+ architecture. Moreover, the F1 score achieved with the proposed loss is 82.20% and 81.05% for U-Net and DeepLabv3+, respectively. These findings confirm the effectiveness and generalizability of α-aggregator SegLoss in tackling challenges in medical image segmentation."

    "abstract": "Recommendation techniques have achieved notable advancements; however, conventional centralized learning paradigms and their heavy reliance on training datasets containing user-sensitive information pose substantial risks of privacy leakage and misuse. While federated learning presents a decentralized alternative to mitigate these concerns, it introduces ancillary challenges, including elevated communication overhead and performance degradation, particularly in terms of compromised model generalization capacity and diminished personalized recommendation performance at the client level. Furthermore, current recommendation models primarily focus on extracting users’ unique preferences while neglecting the critical influence of region-oriented cultural characteristics shaping collective user preferences, a factor integral to understanding behavioral patterns across distinct demographic groups. Motivated by the challenges, in this paper, we propose a Federated learning framework with Region-Oriented Cultural Knowledge distillation for recommendation applications, called FedROCK. FedROCK integrates region-oriented cultural knowledge through server-side aggregation and variational autoencoder (VAE)-based extraction, subsequently propagating this influence to client-side learning via parameter transmission mechanisms and layer knowledge distillation within the federated architecture. Meanwhile, to enhance client model personalization, we selectively synchronize only a subset of client model parameters during federated training. This dual mechanism—leveraging region-oriented cultural influence and adaptive client personalization—achieves an equilibrium between system-wide generalization and individually fine-grained recommendation precision. Extensive experiments on two real-world recommendation data sets demonstrate the excellence of the proposed FedROCK over the state-of-the-art methods."

Experimental results show that training exclusively with synthetic data yields suboptimal performance, with hand-crafted features achieving 70.75 % accuracy and ConvNeXt achieving 80.22 %. In contrast, adding real samples to the training set significantly improves performance: including 60 real images raises accuracy to 90.11 %, while including 600 real images increases it further to 95.05 %. These results suggest that synthetic data can complement real data effectively, enabling high-accuracy corrosion classification with limited real-world samples."

In this paper, fuel cells and solar PV arrays with battery storage are used although the MLI input sources are selected based on their availability at the microgrid location. Here, in this topology each source will act as a separate dc source. Because of this arrangement, the inverter does not require the usual input capacitors or voltage-balancing circuits found in conventional MLI designs. The existing systems can also be converted into this MLI setup, so adding or upgrading it is simple. Power sharing among the various sources is achieved by varying the duration of each voltage level, allowing accurate and efficient energy management. An automated control algorithm coordinates the operation of the energy sources and storage units to regulate power flow. Depending on the availability of the energy sources and the required power, the microgrid can operate in different modes, which are discussed in detail. The simulation results and analysis show that the proposed configuration provides better power control to integrate multiple energy resources into microgrids."

Secondly, in order to solve such problems, a distributed dynamic optimization algorithm based on neural networks is proposed to conduct economic scheduling analysis of the IES. This algorithm is based on the dynamic weight neural network model and can solve the problem of inseparable inequality constraints. This algorithm has the advantages of small computational burden, fast convergence speed and easy hardware implementation.

Conventional forms of remote training support environment has since been found not to add any value other than being stagnant general-purpose training, which is not aware of the real time variations in technician skill level and cognitive strain and training that happens to be considerate to variations of the environment. This unbending can lead to high levels of errors, extended classes and incompetence of the skills. Then, the remote guidance realization with the use of the experts and the visual instructions are more oriented on commercial XR-based training systems which do not suggest the possibility to monitor the physiology parameters, to fulfill the personalization. To eliminate these weaknesses, the paper is proposed to implement a pioneering AI-enhanced adaptive realtime Extended Reality (XR) training system that will include a contextual feed-back loop. The system is the initial to integrate wearable biometric sensors with both a system to constantly determine technician heart rate, skin conductance, and contact with the environment as well as AI algorithms capable of gauging cognitive load, emotional state and gauge the task performance of technicians in real time. Based on this information the contents of the XR instruction (visual overlays and auditory and haptic indicators) are provided dynamically according to the current capacity, stress and the rate at which the trainee is performing the skillsLong distance expert interface with real-time bio and haptic sensor feedforward makes the expert deliver his or her advice in a more explicit manner and experience unmatched sense of the situation and empathy. The 5G / 6G network with ultra-low latency and edges computing platform will provide a seamless interaction of both systems that is highly important as far as operational environments are concerned. Early testing will indicate that the human-AI adaptive training model has the capacity to reduce errors in training processes, reduce the time within which the trainees perform the training activity, and obtain large trust and satisfaction with the training process as compared to the conventional XR assistance gadgets. Personalization of the instruction and the real-time modulation of instruction through biometric and performance data provide transformative efficiency, scalability and security of the mammoth training needed in industry to unlock the potential of the technicians.

This paper proposes an automatic generation method for fixed-section power operation scenario sets tailored for stability control strategy analysis and verification. First, the strongly correlated generator sets and DC converter stations are identified based on the section-node transfer impedance matrix, and the transfer sensitivity of active power output changes at each generator and DC converter station node to the section power is calculated. Subsequently, the feasible adjustment region for these strongly correlated units is determined and discretized into a state space. A tree search algorithm incorporating heuristic pruning is proposed to efficiently generate candidate operation scenario sets. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using the IEEE 10-machine 39-bus system."

    "abstract": "Fuel cells are emerging as a vital component of sustainable power systems due to their high efficiency, clean energy output, and reliable operation. However, their nonlinear voltage, current characteristics often prevent them from operating at peak efficiency without advanced control strategies. This paper presents a novel architecture in which two fuel cells of different power ratings are connected to a common load via independent circuit breakers. These circuit breakers enable selective activation of each fuel cell based on load demand, operational strategy, thus providing flexibility, fault tolerance, and energy prioritization. Once a fuel cell is activated through its respective circuit breaker, a Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) algorithm is applied to ensure the extraction of optimal power. Two different MPPT techniques are studied and applied, each independently controlling one of the fuel cell stack. The resulting power from each MPPT controlled fuel cell is then fed into a DC-DC boost converter, which steps up and regulates the output voltage to meet load or system bus requirements. Simulation-based analysis is conducted to evaluate the performance of this dual-fuel-cell system under varying load and input conditions. The Paper provides a comparative study of the output obtained by the Perturb & Observe (P&O) MPPT Technique and Incremental and Conductance (I&C) MPPT Technique. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design in maximizing power extraction and enhancing operational reliability. This system is highly suitable for standalone or hybrid energy applications where reliability, adaptability, and efficiency are critical."

The adversarial attack samples are crafted from captured benign traffic using perturbation adversarial bounding (PAB), generative adversarial networks (GAN and WGAN-GP), and a hybrid PAB and WGAN-GP pipeline. These approaches produce realistic yet deceptive samples that preserve benign appearance while provoking misclassifications. We evaluate five widely used classifiers (CatBoost, XGBoost, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and MLP) under multiple testing scenarios and increasing adversarial volume. Results show that all techniques degrade detector performance, but WGAN-GP and the hybrid PAB & WGAN-GP are consistently most effective: evasion rates reach as high as 99.6-99.8% in adversarial-heavy tests and corresponding detection rates fall to single digits for several classifiers. Simpler GAN and PAB methods also reduce performance, though to a lesser extent. We further demonstrate that adversarial training on a balanced set substantially restores robustness."

To enhance interpretability, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values are employed, identifying num power loss as the most influential feature driving model decisions. The analysis of training-validation curves confirms model generalization without overfitting. The proposed approach effectively combines predictive accuracy with model transparency, offering a scalable solution for real time power loss mitigation in EV charging grids. This work contributes to smart grid research by integrating interpretable AI into data driven decision making for sustainable energy infrastructure."

    "abstract": "Dot-pattern Data Matrix (DM) codes engraved or printed on metallic surfaces are widely deployed in industrial inspection and traceability pipelines. However, reliably localizing their dot structures remains challenging due to specular reflections, surface roughness, machining artifacts, and local damage. We propose a hybrid deepgeometric localization framework integrating YOLOv10-based dot detection with subpixel geometric refinement and projective grid reconstruction. First, YOLOv10 robustly detects dot candidates under severe illumination disturbances. A sub-pixel refinement module further enhances geometric precision by combining intensity-weighted centroid estimation and Taubin circle fitting. To suppress false detections arising from scratches or metallic noise, a geometric consistency filter based on inter-dot distance statistics and density clustering is applied. Subsequently, a RANSAC-based homography estimation aligns the detected dots with an ideal DM template for global grid reconstruction. Missing dots caused by reflections or damage are recovered using a reprojection-driven completion strategy. Experiments on real-world industrial metal datasets show that the proposed method significantly improves localization accuracy, grid completeness, and decoding robustness compared with deep-learning-only and geometry-only baselines."

This paper presents a frequency regulation control strategy for a hybrid-MTDC system based on model predictive control (MPC) to enhance the frequency stability in the sending-end (SE) system. With the system prediction model, a disturbance observer is designed to observe and estimate the power disturbance in each system. Based on the objective function of the weighted minimum of local and interconnected receiving-end (RE) system frequency deviations, the optimization problem can be established and solved. By leveraging the rolling optimization and feedback correction mechanism, the optimal distribution of the output power of each converter station in the SE system can be achieved, and the influence of the frequency regulation process of the SE system on the frequency stability of the RE system is reduced. Finally, the simulations confirm the validity of the proposed strategy."

    "abstract": "The moment of inertia (J) of the rotor is a key performance metric, particularly for high-speed and precision position control applications, as it limits the maximum rate of speed rise for a given torque. Accurate knowledge of J is also essential for determining the frictional torque coefficient from the experimentally obtained mechanical time constant. This paper presents closed-form analytical expressions for estimating J of switched reluctance machine (SRM) rotors. Starting from first principles, the rotor is decomposed into two components: the yoke, modeled as an annular ring, and the poles, approximated as rectangular blocks for regular poles or trapezoidal blocks for tapered poles. The expressions are first validated on a 7.5 $\\mathrm{kW}, 30,000~\\mathrm{rpm}$ SRM rotor using computer-aided design (CAD) models. The influence of key dimensional parameters such as pole height, pole arc, and yoke width is demonstrated, with analytical predictions showing close agreement with CAD-derived values. Further validation on SRMs rated from $\\mathrm{7~N} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}$ to $\\mathrm{1 5 0~N} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}$ confirms the applicability of the method across a wide torque range. Additionally, the expression for tapered-pole rotors is derived and validated through CAD, extending the approach to more general geometries. The proposed expressions combine accuracy with computational efficiency, making them suitable for fast analytical design workflows."

The percentage composition is fixed at 10% for the channel and other epitaxial layers. The parametric study revealed a linear increment in the device’s electrical performance for AIN compositions ranging from 20% to 35%. The increasing drain current highlights the dominance of consistently increasing polarization charges, which consequently increase the 2DEG density before carrier mobility experiences a steep degradation, after which its saturation is inevitable. Beyond a 35% AIN composition, the drain current saturates, highlighting an eventual tradeoff between consistently rising carrier density and an ultimate, severely degraded, saturated carrier mobility attributed to alloy scattering. The research also benchmarks the AlGaN HEMT against an AlGaN/GaN epitaxial device, examining the HEMT’s limitations in achieving comparable electrical performance."

    "abstract": "Blockchain technology innovatively realizes data trusted verification and traceability through the chain structure. But meanwhile, the constant growth of blockchain causes a serious state bloat, becoming a critical challenge restricting the scalability of blockchain. The stateless blockchain, eliminating the necessity of storing the entire state by compressing it into a commitment, is a promising solution to address the state bloat problem. However, current stateless blockchains for unspent transaction output (UTXO) model suffer from poor performance and scalability. In this paper, we present TerseChain, a sharding stateless UTXO-based blockchain that can effectively balance storage, computation, and communication overhead. Specifically, TerseChain innovatively decouples the cross-shard transaction processing into local validation, global ordering, and parallel execution by stateless verification, improving scalability while guaranteeing security. More importantly, our enhanced algo rithms markedly increase the efficiency of stateless verification within each shard, necessitating only a constant overhead in storage. Through rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results, we demonstrate that TerseChain provides high processing capacity that scales favorably with the expansion of the network. TerseChain not only addresses the scalability issues of stateless blockchains but also provides a foundation for AI-enhanced blockchain scalability solutions."

Classical approaches rely on exteroceptive sensors and complex state estimation pipelines, which are often computationally expensive, not-precise, and unsuitable for stealthy or resource-constrained platforms. In this article, we propose a novel, frugal navigation paradigm based on stable cycles, inspired by biological navigation strategies observed in migratory animals. Our method enables a robot to follow and stabilize a predefined cycle in the environment without requiring explicit state estimation. A timed automaton is used to generate control inputs that drive the robot along a discretized cycle, which is then stabilized in the world frame using sparse environmental measurements. We formally describe this cycle-based control framework, provide a proof of its stability, and validate the approach experimentally on a real robot. This work opens a new direction for low-cost, low-observability robotic navigation in unstructured and GNSS-denied environments."

Since gradient updates may still expose sensitive information, a line of research has explored the use of local differential privacy (LDP) mechanisms to formally safeguard these updates. Under LDP, each client perturbs its gradients locally prior to sharing. However, LDP often leads to a significant degradation in model utility due to the addition of large noises. To enable a better balance between privacy and utility, an increasing trend is to leverage the shuffle model of differential privacy (DP) in FL, which introduces an intermediate shuffling operation on the perturbed gradients, enabling privacy amplification.

Thanks to HW-NAS, a 1D convolutional neural network (CNN) is tailored on the ISCX VPN-nonVPN dataset to meet strict memory and computational limits while achieving robust performance. The optimized model attains an accuracy of 96.60% with just 88.26K parameters, 10.08M floating-point operations (FLOPs), and a maximum tensor size of 20.12K. Compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, it achieves reductions of up to 444-fold, 312-fold, and 15-fold in these metrics, respectively, significantly minimizing memory footprint and runtime requirements. The model also demonstrates versatility, achieving up to 99.86% across multiple VPN and traffic classification (TC) tasks; it further generalizes to external benchmarks with up to 99.98% accuracy on USTC-TFC and QUIC NetFlow. In addition, an in-depth approach to header-level preprocessing strategies confirms that the optimized model can provide notable performance across a wide range of configurations, even in scenarios with stricter privacy considerations. Likewise, a reduction in the length of sessions of up to 75% yields significant improvements in efficiency, while maintaining high accuracy with only a negligible drop of 1-2%. However, the importance of careful preprocessing and session length selection in the classification of raw traffic data is still present, as improper settings or aggressive reductions can bring about a 7% reduction in overall accuracy. The quantized architecture was deployed on STM32 microcontrollers and evaluated across input sizes; results confirm that the efficiency gains from shorter sessions translate to practical, low-latency embedded inference. These findings demonstrate the method’s practicality for encrypted traffic analysis in constrained IoT networks."

    "abstract": "With the proliferation of cloud computing, the exponential growth of data amount requires continuous expansion of storage capacity to meet the storage demand, consequently resulting in higher energy consumption in data centers. However, many of the conventional data placement strategies strive to save energy by optimizing the distribution of data requests, while overlooking the impact of heat recirculation among data nodes. To bridge this gap, we propose a heat-recirculation-aware data placement approach, termed HRADP, designed to optimize data placement in data centers while reducing energy consumption. First, based on the extent of heat recirculation, HRADP places data to the upper limit of the disk allowance for each data node. Second, during energy allocation, HRADP further eliminates disks with high current workloads to prevent localized hotspots. Finally, during request scheduling, HRADP selects dormant data nodes according to the request size, minimizing the startup energy consumption caused by data nodes waking up with small requests. We implement the HRADP approach on a data center simulation platform, CloudSim, and its performance with state-of-the-art, including the Energy-efficient and Thermal-aware Data Placement (ETDP) algorithm, Thermal-aware file assignment technique (TIGER), Storage and rack-sensitive replica placement algorithm (SRS), and Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). The experimental results reveal that HRADP revamps the cooling supply temperature, total energy, and data throughput by averages of 0.08%-0.6%, 8.22%-53.03%, and 9.58%-64.59%, respectively."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a spatiotemporal (ST) fusion framework robust against diverse noise for satellite images, named Temporally-Similar Structure-Aware ST fusion (TSSTF). ST fusion is a promising approach to address the trade-off between the spatial and temporal resolution of satellite images. In real-world scenarios, observed satellite images are severely degraded by noise due to measurement equipment and environmental factors. Therefore, some recent studies have focused on enhancing the robustness of ST fusion methods against noise. However, existing noise-robust ST fusion approaches often fail to capture fine spatial structure, leading to oversmoothing and artifacts. To address this issue, TSSTF introduces two key mechanisms: Temporally-Guided Total Variation (TGTV) and Temporally-Guided Edge Constraint (TGEC). TGTV is a weighted total variation-based regularization that promotes spatial piecewise smoothness while preserving structural details, guided by a reference high spatial resolution image acquired on a nearby date. TGEC enforces consistency in edge locations between two temporally adjacent images, while allowing for spectral variations. We formulate the ST fusion task as a constrained optimization problem incorporating TGTV and TGEC, and develop an efficient algorithm based on a preconditioned primal-dual splitting method. Experimental results demonstrate that TSSTF performs comparably to state-of-the-art methods in noise-free cases and outperforms them under noisy conditions."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a method for identifying the source of the second traveling wave under breakage faults in the non-bounded VSC-HVDC grid with new energy access. Firstly, the line boundary structure of the non-bounded VSC-HVDC grid is introduced, and the voltage reflection coefficient of the line boundary is deduced. Then, the characteristics of the second voltage traveling wave at both ends of the line under breakage faults are explored based on the propagation process of the voltage traveling wave. It is found that for the unipolar breakage fault, the sign of the ratio of the second voltage traveling wave to the first voltage traveling wave can be used to identify the source of the second traveling wave, while for the bipolar breakage fault, there is no need to identify the source. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified in PSCAD/EMTDC. The results show that after applying the method, the sources of the second traveling wave can be accurately identified at both ends of the line in the non-bounded VSC-HVDC grid under various breakage faults."

    "abstract": "Music has always been a part of human civilization since ancient times. It not only greatly influences human emotions, but it is also proven that it can influence cognitive function, physical health, and even social behaviour. These benefits as well as overall user experience can greatly be enhanced with the combination of music and artificial intelligence. The surge of music streaming platforms like Spotify, Gaana, You Tube Music, etc. ends up frequently overwhelming the users with its extensive music libraries, which in turn ends up complicating the process of choosing songs that actually match their current feelings and fit their vibe. Traditional music recommendation systems that are mostly dependent on content-based or collaborative filtering often struggling with a cold start and a lack of proper emotional context. To address such issues, this study presents a better dynamic music suggestion system that specifically generates a tailored song recommendation by recognizing the users emotions in real-time. This system uses certain methods such as machine learning and computer vision, to assess and thoroughly understand the user's facial expression, eventually detecting user's emotions as well by utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction. The InceptionV3 architecture has been utilized to obtain and detect facial features, which is later on categorized using machine learning methods such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression. This system bridges emotional intelligence with personalized music experiences. The system recognizes the users emotions, and the recognized user's emotion is then associated with a thoughtfully designed music playlist provided through a hybrid recommendation method that merges the content-based filtering with emotion based sensitive context."

    "abstract": "The growing interest in intelligent surveillance systems has been mainly driven by the necessity to guarantee public security, control sensitive areas, and detect threats in a proactive and timely manner. Traditional surveillance systems that depend on the centralized backend cloud processing are restricted by large lags, bandwidth and scalability. To address the issues above, we introduce an intelligent surveillance system by combining CNNs, Fog Computing, and IoT together to achieve the real-time threat detection and decision making at the network edge level. They CNNs achieve the state-of-theart performance in object detection, anomaly detection and face verification under the context of complex visual scenes, as a result of deep learning based hierarchical processing of features. They are however computationally expensive and require distributed processing power which cloud-only services are not good for in terms of latency. Fog Computing is introduced in this architecture as an intermediate layer between the IoT edge devices and the cloud to overcome such shortcomings. Fog nodes are placed close to data sources (surveillance cameras or sensors) for processing computationally intensive CNN inference locally to achieve low transmission delay, offload cloud and improve situational response time. Through it, a network of heterogeneous sensors can be easily connected, and data can be collected, synchronized, and remotely accessed. Integrated with CNNbased analytics, FCFWD leverages the distributed fog nodes and the continuous data streams from the IOT devices not only to facilitate context determination and intelligent threat recognition but also to enable immediate automatic event triggering and alert notifications to the appropriate agencies. The efficiency of the design is verified by simulation and prototype under a smart city scenario including public transport centers, governmental precincts and city road crossroads. Our evaluation demonstrates orders of magnitude improvement in response time, accuracy and energy over cloud dominated paradigms. The integrated system also contributes to data privacy by local sensitive analytics, and sends only like stats to cloud. This work presents a scalable, low-latency, and intelligent surveillance model that closes the AI vision systems and the distributed edge computing. In the end, this solution gives those behind the operation real-time situation monitoring and the ability to proactively manage security in high-stakes environments."

    "abstract": "Considering the cases of increased numbers of twowheelers accidents it can be concluded that a major reason could be lack of proper warning systems, hence the focus of this study is to propose a Fast Moving System Warning (FMSW) designed particularly for two-wheelers. The FMSW will help to reduce the risk of collision as it will warn the riders of the presence of super-speedy vehicles approaching in their blind spot. Radar and camera sensors are some of the advanced sensors which the technology utilizes to sense the movement of an approaching car and gauge its speed and direction relative to the two-wheeler. The FMSW initiates a series of warnings in the form of visual displays on the dashboard and verbal messages via integrated speakers or activators attached to the helmet of the rider, in the event of a potential collision. Furthermore, sophisticated algorithms facilitate the equipment to differentiate between harmless traffic and dangerous threats, ensuring that only a warning is issued when it is necessary, in order to prevent false alarms and the related inconvenience of distracting riders. Besides, the FMSW can be connected with safety systems that are already in use, e.g., traction control, ABS, to improve response strategies and reduce the extent of impact. Numerous tests and simulations confirm the effectiveness of the FMSW in awaring the riders and reducing the chance of an accident. All considered, the FMSW approach is a key event in terms of the security technology of two-wheeler, offering a preventive measure to the issues of a fast traffic scenario besides enhancing the overall experience of riding."

Theoretically, a shorted patch antenna provides a unidirectional beam operating in the TM<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1/2,0</inf> mode. To lower the operating band from 4.50 to 4.15 GHz, two slots are introduced along the side edges of the patch. Further miniaturization is achieved with the aid of a thin, shorted metallic strip in close proximity to the patch's radiating edge. Accordingly, the operating frequency significantly decreases to 3.8 GHz. The final antenna realization has small dimensions of 0.12 λ × 0.11 λ and operating bandwidth of about 40 MHz. It is also worth noting that the cross-polarization of the conventional shorted patch antenna is typically high at approximately -7.5 dB. Meanwhile, the proposed antenna with a more compact size can achieve lower cross-polarization level of about -12 dB."

This paper introduces a comprehensive design and analysis of AI-based smart glasses which addresses the mentioned challenges. The model is designed to help a person who is blind/visually impaired. This model would assist a person to navigate and find objects in real time. This AI based smart glass is a tremendous help for blind people who are often frustrated because they have to be watched by others all the time. The proposed designed uses a Coral Edge TPU along with a Raspberry Pi Zero W to do efficient on-device processing to find obstacles, recognize traffic lights, and give vocal input through bone conduction speakers. A mathematical model is described that represents decision-making based on obstacle distance, classifying probability, and traffic light state.

The experiment utilises a hybrid simulation setup supported by MQTT publishing, CoAP server communications, and a CoAP-MQTT bridge to report real-time metrics such as latency, packet loss, jitter, and throughput. Isolation Forest is used for advanced anomaly detection, while statistical correlation and QoS scoring assess the efficiency of each protocol. To test resilience, experiments simulate network variability, introducing realistic conditions like variable bandwidth, packet delays, and loss profiles. Additionally, forecasting using time series decomposition, ARIMA, and LSTM models enables performance optimisation before issues arise. Insights into protocol behaviour are visualised through heatmaps, scatter plots, and stacked bar charts, providing actionable data. Results indicate that MQTT consistently outperforms in latency and anomaly detection."

    "abstract": "Dynamic current balancing of parallel MOSFETs involves the accurate matching of gating signals, particularly in high-speed wide-bandgap devices such as GaN and SiC. While conventional methods rely on drain current feedback for synchronization of the gate pulses, they often suffer from limitations related to sensing bandwidth, sampling limitations of the dynamic part of the drain current, and increased system complexity. This paper proposes a novel gate-voltage-based feedback approach to detect and compensate for gate pulse mismatches without relying on drain current measurements. The concept is investigated through a comprehensive LTspice simulation study analyzing the impact of asynchronous gate signals on switching behavior and current imbalance. A MATLAB-based model is developed to process simulated gate voltage waveforms, determine the delay mismatch, and propose a corresponding dead time correction strategy for microcontroller implementation. Further, it also explores the trade-offs involved in the various methods of feedback. This simulation-driven study presents a promising direction for future low-cost, scalable current balancing strategies in paralleloperated power devices."

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of quantum computing threatens the security of classical public-key cryptosystems widely used for secure communications in Internet of Things (IoT) and electric vehicle (EV) battery swapping networks. Existing methods, including traditional cryptography and some early post-quantum algorithms, often struggle with high latency, excessive energy consumption, and limited suitability for resource-constrained IoT devices, hindering their practical deployment. This paper proposes PostQ-SwapNet, a novel hybrid framework designed to secure IoT-based EV battery swapping stations against both classical and quantum cyber threats. The system integrates CRYSTALS-Kyber for quantum-resistant key exchange, Dilithium digital signatures for mutual authentication, AES-128 encryption for data confidentiality, and a BiLSTM-based anomaly detection module for real-time threat identification. Additionally, it leverages a private blockchain with smart contracts to ensure transaction immutability and traceability. The objective is to deliver a secure, efficient, and scalable solution compatible with current IoT hardware constraints. This framework reduces latency to $\\mathbf{1 2 0 ~ m s}$, energy use to $\\mathbf{1 5 ~ m J}$ and memory use to $\\mathbf{2 5 6 ~ K B}$ and still maintains a strong level of security. Python and TensorFlow were used for coding the AI side of the project. The results affirm that PostQ-SwapNet effectively balances security and performance, making it a practical solution for future-proofing EV energy networks against quantum and conventional cyberattacks."

By combining behavioral classification with spatiotemporal prediction, MPBS adaptively assigns tasks to the most suitable devices in real time. Experimental evaluations on the real-world GeoLife dataset demonstrate that MPBS significantly improves task completion efficiency and resource utilization.

This collection covers fifteen crop kinds and twenty-five illnesses across many agroclimatic zones. GACN's F1-score is 95.2 %, recall 94.9 %, precision 95.5%, and classification accuracy 96.8%. Because of this, it can consistently locate ill individuals in the real world. The GACN develops disease risk maps that predict disease locations with an accuracy of over 92 %, using weather patterns, soil moisture data, and satellite-derived vegetation indicators (NDVI and LST). This multimodal technique enables early illness identification and localization prediction. Agronomists and farmers can use the system's decision support platform on their mobile devices for real-time warnings, regional treatment recommendations, and interactive maps and visualizations.

This paper presents an Alpha Evolution Algorithm-Gated Recurrent Unit (AE-GRU)-based method for medium and long-term power generation assessment of offshore wind power considering volatility and extreme weather effects. Firstly, high spatiotemporal resolution historical meteorological data from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts fifth-generation reanalysis (ERA5) is obtained, including basic parameters such as wind speed, wind direction, and temperature. Secondly, derivative features including wind energy density, monthly variation index, and extreme wind conditions are calculated based on ERA5 data. Finally, a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-based power generation assessment model optimized by Alpha Evolution (AE) Algorithm is constructed to fit the nonlinear mapping relationship between meteorological parameters and power generation, thereby achieving medium and long-term power generation assessment for offshore wind power. Case studies demonstrate that: (1) The proposed hybrid model improves assessment accuracy by 42.8% in terms of Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) compared to traditional methods, with notably enhanced adaptability to extreme weather conditions; (2) The model effectively captures seasonal variations and interannual fluctuation characteristics of power generation by comprehensively considering multidimensional meteorological features and their derivatives, reducing the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to 29.49 GWh; (3) The introduction of deep learning and optimization algorithms further enhances the accuracy of medium and long-term power generation assessment for offshore wind power."

The current paper introduces an AI-enhanced IoT system that would automatize and optimize the process of coal loading in overlaying railways sidings. It combines an STM32F446RE microcontroller and a load cells collection consisting of Zemic H3-C3 with an HX711 ADC to measure weight accurately and an automated control system consisting of a conveyor belt. MQTT transmits real-time data to a cloud platform where it is monitored, anomalies are detected and operational insights are gained. An over-thecounter CNN model on the STM32 makes adaptive PID tuning and predictive fault detection possible, and can lead to better control accuracy across different loading conditions. Experimental trials proved an average loading efficiency of 99 % with less variance and throughput loss than manual techniques. The framework is cost-efficient, scalable, and smart in application to the Industry 4.0 practices and will be more reliable in coal logistics and use freight capacity more efficiently."

    "abstract": "Self-paced online learning demands strong self-regulation, a skill many learners lack, causing high attrition rates in this educational model. Learners need a means to assess their dynamic knowledge states to clearly understand their ability throughout the course learning. While knowledge tracing function in adaptive learning systems (ALS) helps, traditional models usually overlook the side information of metacognition and the consideration of learner control. To address these issues, our study introduces the Zone of Proximal Development-based Knowledge Tracing (ZPD-KT) model, a novel adaptive practicing framework for online STEM education. ZPD-KT integrates confidence-based assessment, dynamic ZPD, and traditional knowledge tracing principles to enable an AI-learner shared control approach. Through a large-scale simulation involving 8,000 synthetic learners, the ZPD-KT model was benchmarked against traditional Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT). Initial results show a significant increase in the effectiveness of adaptive practice when traditional KT algorithms are augmented with ZPD. Furthermore, the study highlights the critical role of metacognitive signals (e.g., self-reported confidence) in refining KT beyond binary correctness metrics. For smart education ecosystems, ZPD-KT offers a scalable, ethically grounded solution that balances AI-driven personalization with learner autonomy, advocating for systems that prioritize pedagogical equity and adaptability in self-paced online learning environments."

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) protects data privacy while enabling decentralized training across distributed clients. However, a primary challenge in FL is the presence of non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data among clients. This data heterogeneity, common in real-world scenarios, can lead to several issues such as degraded global model performance, slow convergence, biased local updates, and increased consumption of computational resources and network bandwidth. Effectively addressing non-IID data across distributed clients requires an accurate estimation of its degree in their local datasets.Despite the variety of statistical methods used in the FL literature for non-IID degree estimation, different studies often adopt diverse approaches and assert their effectiveness without clear justification. This lack of explanation has resulted in no clear consensus on the most accurate and effective non-IID estimation method. This paper aims to bridge this critical gap by systematically comparing and evaluating several widely used non-IID estimation methods. We consider eight popular statistical methods used to estimate the degree of non-IIDness in client data within FL. We conducted extensive experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset to evaluate each method based on its impact on global model performance, communication costs, and computation costs. The findings of this research are intended to guide future studies in selecting appropriate non-IID estimation methods and offer crucial insights into the efficiency of various estimation techniques. Furthermore, this work contributes to identifying the most effective and reliable non-IID estimation method for characterizing client data distributions."

Compared to lithium-ion batteries, it offers 40% lower kWh costs and improved safety, with no thermal runaway or dendrite formation. By also enhancing stability through HEA coating, which prevents corrosion and dendrite formation to improve the battery lifespan and efficiency, the coating is markedly beneficial. The innovation also offers a low-cost, high-density renewable energy storage alternative to provide uninterrupted power to solar and wind power systems at an appropriate power density. Other areas investigated are legal (such as intellectual property rights, safety certifications (UL, IEC, NFPA), environmental policies (EPA, REACH), and grid interconnection standards (IEEE 1547)). This paper proposes a blockchain-based energy certification system to provide transparency, compliance, and secure energy trading. Experimental results show that SolarSalt outperforms lithium-ion and conventional sodium batteries in terms of energy retention, safety, and cost-effectiveness. This research introduces a novel room-temperature, sodium-based SolarSalt battery that integrates liquid-solid phase change energy storage with HEA encapsulation and blockchain-enabled certification. The originality lies in uniting materials science, renewable energy storage, and digital compliance within a single scalable platform. This contribution advances both technical and regulatory dimensions of sustainable energy storage."

The proposed hybrid approach, which combines two CFAR processors using clutter estimates of both detectors in order to establish the decision rule, is an enhanced CFAR approach that dynamically adapts its threshold by analyzing surrounding cells while minimizing the effect of non-homogeneous elements. Detection Performances of (H-CFAR) are analyzed in both homogeneous and non-homogeneous environments under various assumptions such as: different clutter distributions and severe contamination by interfering targets. Simulations indicate that the proposed method offers improved detection performance and an enhanced robustness compared to conventional CFAR detectors, particularly in environments where clutter and interference are non-uniformly distributed."

    "abstract": "Accurate impedance estimation is essential for reliable battery diagnostics and modeling. Discrete Fourier transform (DFT)–based impedance estimation is widely adopted in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) for battery characterization due to its simplicity and computational efficiency. However, the influence of measurement noise on such DFTbased impedance computation remains insufficiently understood. This paper develops a statistical framework that analytically quantifies how zero-mean Gaussian noise propagates through DFT-based impedance estimation. A closed-form expression for the bias of impedance estimates is derived, and a rectangular pulse excitation signal is employed to evaluate its performance for fast EIS applications under this framework. Simulation studies on a two time-constant RC model of the battery reveal that measurement noise and excitation design jointly influence estimation accuracy. For pulse excitation, bias amplification occurs near the high-frequency spectral zero-crossings, where the excitation spectrum approaches zero magnitude. By excluding a guard-band of impedance estimates surrounding these zerocrossings, the peak bias in both real and imaginary components is reduced by approximately 70% at 60 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Furthermore, increasing the pulse ON duration from 10 ms to 100 ms reduces the low-frequency bias by about 55%, strengthening the low-frequency signal content and improving the overall estimation accuracy."

Unlike existing RL approaches that rely solely on tracking-error-based rewards, the proposed method integrates the Lyapunov stability condition directly into the reward formulation, ensuring stable learning and robust closed-loop performance. The control objectives are to regulate the flying capacitor voltage and inject a low total harmonic distortion (THD) grid current. The Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm is employed and trained in a MATLAB/Simulink environment under randomized operating conditions to enhance generalization. Simulation results demonstrate that the Lyapunov-based RL-C achieves stable operation with THD as low as 1.9 % and capacitor voltage error below 1 V across different current levels. Moreover, the trained agent exhibits strong adaptability to parameter variations and untrained operating points, confirming the proposed framework's robustness and suitability for real-time power electronics applications."

License-plate localization is performed by a dedicated IP core that applies thresholding on Y, Cb, and Cr channels and executes two-pass connected-component labeling followed by a white-pixel-density filter to isolate the plate region. The cropped 320x240 plate image is written to on-chip SRAM through a burst-mode Video DMA, then up sampled to 640x480 RGB for VGA display. Character segmentation and recognition are extracted via secondary thresholding and labeling, normalized to 16x32 frames, and classified through a parallel template-matching engine. All pixel-level processing is offloaded to hardware IP blocks synthesized with Intel Quartus II and Platform Designer under Nios II soft-processor co-ordination. Experimental results demonstrate accurate plate detection and recognition at 30 fps with under 40% logic and 50% BRAM utilization, offering a low-power, low-cost solution for embedded intelligent-transportation application."

    "abstract": "In this study, we present a method for generating a two-dimensional trajectory for a trolley that rapidly transports a suspended load under open-loop conditions with vibration control along various paths. This is achieved using a finite-time settling function composed of trigonometric functions with a period that divides the operation time by a half-odd integer for a 1DOF overhead crane moving on the XY horizontal plane. The trajectory for acceleration, deceleration, and curves is composed of a two-step vibration control acceleration/ deceleration operation. This consists of a first step of swinging up from a vibration control state and a second step of swinging down to the vibration control state, derived from the solution of a two-point boundary value problem of a linear 1DOF vibration system. Consequently, when the swing-up angle of the suspended load becomes large, the trajectory may deviate significantly due to the nonlinearity of the pendulum. Through simulations, we clarified how the swing-up angle of the suspended load affects the trajectory deviation when a twodimensional overhead crane transports a suspended load at various speeds with vibration control on a polygonal closed trajectory around an obstacle."

The methodology presents a series of steps to ensure the accuracy, reliability, and efficiency of the conversion process. The first step involves signal preprocessing, where collected PPG signals are subjected to techniques such as filtering and baseline correction to enhance signal quality. The feature extraction techniques are then employed to extract relevant information from the pre-processed signals. The core component of the methodology is the integration of a machine learning model, which learns the mapping between PPG and ECG signals. The Long-Short-Term Memory(LSTM) model is applied for the conversion of PPG signals to ECG signals. A Graphical User Interface(GUI) is created for user-friendly operation of our system. The functioning of the system is checked by measuring the real-time ECG reading and comparing them with the converted ECG output of the model. In the converted ECG signal we are able to visualize the peaks. This project aims to improve cardiac health monitoring by providing an alternative method of obtaining ECG signals through PPG measurements using an LSTM model."

In order to maintain semantic fidelity, the current experimental work studies a novel wardrobe retrieval system that allows users to look for specific fashion items using natural language queries like “black top” or “red jacket”. The two experiments are carried out. In the first, the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model from OpenAI works by converting text and images into 512-dimensional vectors and figuring out how similar they are cosine-wise. Although CLIP’s high-dimensional embeddings are good at capturing semantic alignment, they come with a hefty processing cost and could contain duplicate or irrelevant characteristics. To get around these restrictions, the other experiment combines CLIP features with Rough Set Theory (RST). RST reduces dimensionality while maintaining semantic fidelity using entropy-based feature selection. Based on similarity scores, this hybrid CLIP+RST model divides retrieved images into three groups: lower, upper boundary region, and outside upper approximation. Regardless of its relevance, this classification allows for multi-perspective retrieval to meet various user search thrusts and sustainable computing."

    "abstract": "A new method to automate helpdesk incident handling on a supply chain platform is proposed. We use a context vector retrieval-based technique to achieve high accuracy and timely resolution. The system uses a vector database with LLM. This LLM dynamically accesses new information rather than statically adapted. This project uses a RAG model specific to the logistics and procurement problems in the supply chain and not a general RAG. An examination of a real-life incident shows the extent to which resolution efficiency, throughput and cost efficiency have improved, offering insights for the best supporting interventions in complex logistics scenarios."

Given the critical importance yet inherent challenges of charge/discharge curve prediction—such as the limited physical interpretability and high training complexity associated with neural network approaches—we adopt a physics-based battery modeling strategy. The PyBaMM battery modeling platform was employed in this study, integrated with optimization algorithms and regression techniques to formulate a prediction methodology that maintains high accuracy (0.25% MAPE as validated on experimental datasets) while operating at relatively low computational cost. This approach endows the prediction framework with greater physical interpretability compared to neural network methods, and at the same time effectively reduces the computational complexity in contrast to traditional physical model methods."

Problems with data quality, security, and decentralised learning arise from the vast amounts of sensor data. In response to these issues, it provides BlockFLA, a FL hybrid architecture that incorporates blockchain technology. Data cleansing, removal of unnecessary information, and normalisation are all part of the system's first data preparation procedure, which is designed to guarantee high-quality inputs. By eliminating the need to share raw data, FL enables distributed and decentralised model training among sensor nodes, protecting user privacy. Smart contracts on the blockchain can identify and punish bad actors automatically, making the network more trustworthy. Results from experiments demonstrate that BlockFLA improves resilience and dependability without sacrificing the communication efficiency that is typical of classic FL systems. Our experimental findings show that the suggested model outperforms similar frameworks, reaching an impressive accuracy rate of 97.53%. Finally, a safe, scalable, and effective way for smart data processing in Smart Cities is to combine FL with blockchain in WSNs. By improving distributed learning performance and fortifying urban sensor networks generally, BlockFLA is a game-changer."

    "abstract": "Traditional microgrid control techniques are challenged to provide stable power sharing and frequency, especially in islanded mode. The primary issues are the inefficiency of traditional droop control methods in decoupling active and reactive power, as well as voltage regulation, caused by feeder impedance mismatches and low X/R ratios. Additionally, the absence of inherent inertia in inverter-based microgrids renders them highly sensitive to frequency fluctuations and transient disturbances. To overcome these issues, an overall solution is needed to enhance power decoupling, improve voltage control, and ensure a smooth transition between various microgrid operating modes. The Virtual Power Source (VPS)-based Virtual Impedance Control proves to be the best solution with a virtual power source combined with composite virtual impedance (negative resistance and inductance) to counteract impedance of feeder mismatches and realize accurate reactive power(Q) sharing and improved stability of the system. Incorporating this technique with the Virtual Frame Method also further improves voltage and frequency control, allowing seamless transitions in islanded modes. Virtual impedance control with VPS and the virtual frame method provides a better approach to overcoming the limitations of conventional microgrids, yielding stable, efficient, and strong microgrid operations. MATLAB-2024b Simulink programming is used to get voltage and frequency response for decentralised microgrid systems with the control strategy of the virtual impedance method and direct and quadrature voltage ($V_{d} \\& V_{q}$) and frequency(f) response for the virtual frame method."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Influencer marketing has become an essential block of online campaigns with the rapid development of social media. Nevertheless, brands are facing the current challenge of influencer marketing: it must be authentic, and the audience should be genuinely interested, since traditional indicators of power - such as followers, likes, and shallow interest - cannot possibly differentiate between actual impact and artificially promoted popularity. A disconnect between influencers and the brand, fake communication via bots, and distrust in the content result in wasted marketing resources and, in most cases, the loss of brand loyalty. We suggest an AI-based Influencer Analytics framework as a possible solution that can be implemented using multi-source social media data, natural language processing, sentiment analysis, network analytics, and machine learning to determine and test the authenticity of influencers. The system includes posts and comments, patterns of interaction, and demographics of the audience. It applies sophisticated NLP algorithms to examine the relationship between the sentiment of a post or comment and brand values, as well as the engagement relevance of the post or comment. Graph analysis can be used to identify genuine follower groups and differentiate genuine from spurious interactions. At the same time, machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest and XGBoost can be used to evaluate campaign performance based on the determined Influencer Authenticity Index (IAI). This is a weight-based metric that considers credibility, depth of engagement, and consistency. It can automatically detect suspicious behaviour through its detection systems, thereby avoiding potential brand risk. The relevance of the suggested framework, as demonstrated by the positive outcomes of the simulation studies using real data found on Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube, lies in the fact that the actual influence of an influencer can be predicted at 87 per cent, which is considerably better than baselines that are based on superficial analysis of engagement indicators. The technology-based solution will help brands simplify influencer identification, enhance trustworthiness, and achieve the highest possible ROI by providing actionable, real-time data on an influencer's campaign credibility and effectiveness. Overall, the framework presents a data-driven, scalable process that turns influencer marketing into something objective rather than subjective, so that digital campaigns do not lose their authenticity and, on the contrary, offer new, even greater, levels of engagement."

This paper presents a systematic analysis of several energy models, including the First-Order Radio Energy Model, the Free Space Path Loss Model, and the Two-Ray Ground Reflection Model. We have taken static and mobile sink scenarios where the static sink is placed at different locations, while the mobile sink moves with random and grid mobility. The key performance indicators of First Node Dead (FND) and Last Node Dead (LND) are analyzed for network stability and lifetime. The simulations consistently show that DCREA is superior to LEACH in all scenarios, in terms of both energy efficiency and network longevity. Performance improvements showed the greatest advantages for mobile sink scenarios and under truly representative propagation models like Two-Ray Ground Reflection. Most importantly, these results advocate DCREA as a valid contender for any real-world WSN applications that share a critical requirement on energy conservation under mobility of sink for a long-term lifetime."

Like humans, plants get affected by a suite of diseases caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses. An adequate and timely diagnosis of disease can avoid massive crop losses and stimulate agricultural production. In the study, an advanced deep learning-based approach using leaf images of plants is suggested for disease detection. Architecturally, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based model is implemented since it is best suited for image classification, and also enables one to extract strong representation features. Moreover, Image augmentation techniques are employed to enlarge the dataset, to improve the robustness of the model, and to reduce the problem of data scarcity. Additionally, the different architectures and parameters were tested. From all the models tested, the one with the best results was the MobileNetV2 model, which applies transfer learning, L2 regularization, and dropout with LeakyReLU activation function. These methods helped reduce overfitting and improve generalization performance. The model, equipped with the capability of detecting several plant diseases with very high accuracy, would thus pave the way toward smart real-time plant health monitoring systems in precision agriculture."

Anomaly detection plays an important role in safeguarding IoT networks against the diverse cyber threats, such as spoofing and data alteration attack. The proposed study introduces a complete model of machine learning of multi-class anomaly detection on the dataset WUSTL-EHMS-2020. This is done using a methodology that involves intensive preprocessing and feature selection of the data along Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to overcome the imbalance in the classes. Several different classifiers have been tested, and XGBoost has performed the best as it reached an accuracy of 99.96%, F1-score 0.9998 and Cohen Kappa 0.9997. The model also has good computational performance, it took 3.7-second training and 0.068 seconds to infer a single sample. In order to improve transparency and trust in the selective decisions made by the model, explainable AI approaches like SHAP and permutation importance were used. The suggested idea has a very good trade-off between accuracy, interpretability and computational cost, which makes it highly applicable to implement in the drastically constrained IoT systems."

To ensure secure data processing, techniques are proposed to protect data privacy. Therefore, we propose a novel data-driven model using the benchmark NSL-KDD dataset based on a randomized tree, which improves the performance of WSNs. The performance analysis of the proposed model has been analyzed by using different metrics, e.g., RMSE, MSE, MAE, R-Squared, training time, model size, and prediction speed.

To address this issue, this study proposes an EHAM-IES dispatch method based on the Constrained Diffusion Actor-Critic with Entropy Regulator (CDACER). This method takes the inverse process of the diffusion model as a policy function—leveraging the model’s capability to fit multimodal distributions to enhance policy expressiveness. It also reconstructs the optimal dispatch model into a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) and embeds Lagrange multipliers into the reward function (with constraints modeled as an opposing cost network) to improve the satisfaction of operational constraints. The method’s effectiveness is verified on the HRP-38 Bus Test System."

    "abstract": "Ground roll is a dominant coherent noise in land seismic data, characterized by low frequency, low velocity, and high amplitude. often overlaps with reflection arrivals, thereby reducing the reliability of seismic imaging and interpretation. Existing deep learning approaches exhibit inherent limitations in ground-roll attenuation, since Convolutional Neural Network-based models are constrained by local receptive fields, while standard Transformer architectures require large training datasets and incur substantial computational and memory costs due to their global self-attention mechanism. In this study, we propose a U-shaped Swin Transformer (U-Swin Transformer) for ground-roll attenuation. The proposed model replaces global self-attention with window-based self-attention, achieving linear computational complexity with respect to the input size and thereby significantly improving efficiency and scalability. Two near-surface field datasets acquired from the inland sabkha of Jayb Uwayyid (SJUW) in the Saudi Kingdom and the coastal sabkha of Abu Dhabi (CSAD) are used to evaluate the method under realistic geological conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed U-Swin Transformer effectively handles aliased ground roll and signal-noise overlap, which remain challenging for the U-shaped neural network (U-Net) and F-K filtering. Although the denoising performance of the U-Swin Transformer is comparable to that of the Vision Transformer (ViT) with similar mean absolute error, peak signal-to-noise ratio, and structural similarity index measure, it achieves this performance with significantly lower computational cost and GPU memory consumption. Furthermore, incorporating a transfer learning strategy enables efficient adaptation of the U-Swin Transformer across different sabkha seismic environments, substantially reducing training time compared to training the model from scratch."

    "abstract": "As the complexity of logistics scenarios continues to increase, numerous new challenges have emerged. In multi-depots pickup and delivery path planning (MDPDP) scenario, these challenges include cross-depot resource coordination, spatio-temporal dependencies of pickup-delivery pairs, and generalization across problem scales. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning framework with a Heterogeneous Collaborative Multi-Attention (HCMA) mechanism. The HCMA framework has three key features. 1) HCMA comprises a three-level heterogeneous attention architecture: an inter-depot collaborative attention module for cross-depot resource allocation, a pickup-delivery pairing attention module that explicitly learns sequential and pairwise relationships between task nodes, and a global attention module to capture long-range node dependencies. 2) HCMA dynamically integrates real-time vehicle status with multi-type node features through attention weighting to balance vehicle resource utilization across depots. 3) HCMA adopts multi-start training and instance augmentation strategies to enhance generalization capability and obtain the global optimal solution. Extensive experiments conducted on random datasets, benchmark datasets, and a real-world Shenzhen logistics dataset demonstrate that the proposed HCMA method outperforms state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms and deep reinforcement learning baselines, while exhibiting superior generalization capability.

However, a fundamental question remains: Can flying robots navigate in clutter using solely monocular RGB images? Given the prohibitive costs of real-world data collection, learning policies in simulation offers a promising path. Yet, deploying such policies directly in the physical world is hindered by the significant sim-to-real perception gap. Thus, we propose a framework that couples the photorealism of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) environments with Adversarial Domain Adaptation. By training in high-fidelity simulation while explicitly minimizing feature discrepancy, our method ensures the policy relies on domain-invariant cues. Experimental results demonstrate that our policy achieves robust zero-shot transfer to the physical world, enabling safe and agile flight in unstructured environments with varying illumination."

    "abstract": "Graph out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization enables Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to perform robustly in applications when confronted with new environments not encountered during training. For better realization of OOD generalization, current methods are increasingly focused on designing more complex causal inference models training from scratch, without considering the potential of existing pre-trained models, increased computational complexity. In this paper, we propose an efficient framework (EGOG), which uses prompt learning for pre-trained GNNs to extract causal subgraphs from input graph data, for enhancing the generalization ability of the pre-trained GNNs. Specifically, we design a graph causal prompt module to enhance the generalization ability of the pre-trained GNNs. First, we use graph prompt learning with a causal features generator that enables pre-trained GNNs to decouple causal features from spurious features in graph nodes. Then, considering that the structure of graph is also affected by distribution shift, we further design a causal structure generator, which reuses the pre-trained GNNs to analyze graph’s structure, decoupling causal substructures from spurious substructures. This approach enhances the pre-trained GNN’s ability to decouple causal subgraph from both the node and structure perspectives. Meantime, we employ gradient reversal layers and information bottleneck to encourage our method to more accurately disentangle causal subgraph from spurious subgraph. Experiment results show that EGOG can be applied to pre-trained GNNs to enable generalization ability. Compared with the state-of-the-art baseline, EGOG shows an average relative improvement of 2.73% on two synthetic datasets while using only average 4.38% of the trainable parameters."

While linear matrix inequalities are commonly used for optimal control of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), the absence of a universal state-space representation and suitable dual form prevents such methods from being applied to optimal control of PDEs. Specifically, for ODEs, the controller synthesis problem is defined in state-space, and duality is used to resolve the bilinearity of that synthesis problem. Recently, the PIE representation was proposed as a universal state-space representation for linear PDE systems. In this paper, we show that any PDE system represented by a PIE admits a dual PIE with identical stability and I/O properties.

    "abstract": "The Probe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) is a far-infrared (24– 261 μm wavelengths) probe class space observatory currently under Phase A study, which promises orders-of-magnitude improvement in mapping speed over its predecessors. PRIMA will field exquisitely sensitive (NEP < 0.1 aWHz−1/2) kilopixel arrays of kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs) for the Far-Infrared Enhanced Survey Spectrometer (FIRESS) instrument. PRIMA will orbit in space at the Sun Earth L2 point, where Planck found the energetic particle flux to be about 300/min/cm2 [1]. Thus, the possible effect of a high fluence of energetic particles on the detector sensitivity must be characterized. Previous work has suggested that bombardment of KIDs by ions can reduce the quasiparticle lifetime (Barends et. al. 2009 [2]), but the conditions of the experiment were not representative of a detector which is continuously held at sub-Kelvin temperatures in the energetic particle environment of L2 orbit. To better replicate the damage which would be produced by energetic particles in this environment, we developed a fully cryogenic irradiation experiment in which a stepper motor controls a screen which can block or reveal an alpha particle emitter. This setup can be used to irradiate aluminum KID arrays fabricated for FIRESS to well-controlled dose levels. In this work, we calculate the damage dose expected for a 5-year mission in L2 orbit, and we irradiate an array to approximately 62% of this level. Before and after irradiation, we measure the quasiparticle lifetimes, resonant frequencies, and quality factors of the detectors."

    "abstract": "In response to the rapid growth of e-commerce and the resulting operational challenges in urban last mile logistics, this study introduces the Multi-period Multi-depot Vehicle Routing Problem with Mobile Center (MPMDVRP-MC). The proposed model jointly determines, over multiple periods, which candidate depot sites to activate for deploying mobile centers, how to assign customers to the activated sites, and how to construct capacity-feasible delivery routes, while allowing mobile centers to be opened, closed, and repositioned across days to respond to time-varying demand.We develop a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation and a genetic algorithm-based heuristic tailored to this multi-period setting. Computational experiments on adapted Solomon benchmark instances [1] show that the heuristic matches or closely approximates MILP solutions on small instances and produces high-quality solutions on larger instances where the MILP frequently reaches the time limit or fails to prove optimality. Sensitivity analyses further reveal systematic trade-offs among travel, opening/operating, and repositioning costs, clarifying when the system behaves as a mobile, adaptive network versus a more static depot configuration. A case study using public parking-lot data from Seoul provides a proof-of-concept illustration of how repositioning can reduce travel costs under shifting demand patterns. Beyond cost efficiency, the mobile-center paradigm combined with light electric delivery modes has potential implications for reducing reliance on heavy vehicles in dense urban areas with fixed depot positions, which we discuss as a qualitative motivation."

The extracted matrix from Euler's dynamic equations, reflecting the actuator effectiveness, is of vital importance for ensuring accurate orientation and maneuverability of the spacecraft. A comparative study is conducted on five calibration approaches—Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Weighted Least Squares (WLS), Instrumental Variables with Filtering (IVF), Gradient Descent (GD), and Recursive Least Squares (RLS). Each of them is tested for its performance in terms of estimation, accuracy as measured by the Frobenius norm of the residual error, computing efficiency, and running time both on ground and on-board computer (OBC). These approaches have been implemented and validated in the context of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite applications. Results indicate extreme trade-offs between speed and accuracy, where RLS is found to be a balanced option in both implementation. The findings provide actionable insights for selecting the most suitable estimation algorithm for satellite control systems under real-world constraints."

To enhance the security and privacy of conventional federated learning, the proposed framework encrypts model weights during transmission among the collaborating nodes. We have used an Internet of Things (IoT)-edge-cloud paradigm, where smartphone sensors are used to collect data. The collected data are analyzed using the proposed framework, and the results show that ≥80% accuracy is achieved for our dataset and existing well-known datasets. The experimental results also demonstrate that the proposed framework has lower response time compared to the edge-cloud and cloud-only frameworks."

Two participants completed a post-course survey consisting of Likert-scale and open-ended questions. Results indicate that both educators recognized benefits such as enhanced creativity and planning efficiency, while also expressing concerns about information reliability, ethical boundaries, and over-reliance. The findings highlight variability in teacher engagement based on prior AI experience and emphasize the need for scaffolding, critical reflection, and ethical guidance in AI integration. The study underscores the importance of providing early orientation, scaffolded design tasks, and space for structured dialogue around ethics and pedagogical judgment when integrating GAI in teacher education. Situated within the broader discourse on AI in education, this case study contributes to the literature by offering a context-specific account of how educators explore and make sense of GAI during authentic planning tasks.

    "abstract": "Electric vehicles (EVs) are transforming world by reducing the greenhouse gas emissions by a lot, make us less dependent on fossil fuels. Power electronics are an important part of how EVs work. It controls how energy flows from the battery to the motor. In this context Inverters will play significant role to turn the DC power that batteries store into AC power which traction motors can use. Some of the challenges that classic twolevel inverters have to contend with are high switching losses, thermal stress, and limited voltage scalability. Multilevel inverters (MLIs) are a very promising technique to get reduce these difficulties. MLIs provides many advantages, including as better output waveform quality, lower Total Harmonic Distortion (THD), the ability to handle higher voltages, and better overall efficiency. All of these things are necessary for small, reliable, and strong EV power trains. This article explain about depth of alternative MLI topologies that work well for EVs, such as Neutral-Point Clamped(NPC), Flying Capacitor, and Cascaded H-bridge(CHB)designs. The study focused on recent advances in control and modulation techniques, how they could be employed in Electric Vehicle (EV) systems, and the increasing use of widebandgap semiconductor devices like Silicon Carbide (SiC) and Gallium Nitride (GaN).

    "abstract": "In the domain of spatial computing, WiFi devices present innovative solutions for human action recognition (HAR) and intelligent space applications due to their advantages of being contactless, device free, and minimizing privacy risks. However, HAR using channel state information (CSI) from commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) WiFi devices encounters several challenges that hinder accuracy, particularly in source and cross-domain scenarios. These challenges stem from the low resolution of COTS WiFi devices, which constrains the performance of deep feature extraction networks, environmental sensitivity induced by multipath effects, and the neglect of dynamic properties intrinsic to human action. To overcome these challenges, we propose a multimodal HAR framework named Wi-Flow. Our framework integrates the WiFi CSI based weighted phase-amplitude shift (WPAS) with pixel-level optical flow feature extracted from visual data. This fusion enables deep feature extraction and enhances the accuracy of action recognition. Using the complementary characteristics of the two modalities, Wi-Flow improves both the accuracy and the robustness of HAR. We evaluated our framework on a large-scale open source dataset collected from the real world, conducting both source-domain and cross-domain evaluations. Experimental results show that our framework achieves an action recognition accuracy that exceeds 96% and 90%, respectively."

Mechanical and electrical anomalies, as well as software errors, require prompt solutions; however, current centralised developments do not guarantee that time-sensitive interventions are taken at decentralised production lines. The study proposes an Edge-Integrated Hybrid Digital Twin (EI-HDT) solution to address these issues, which combines physics-based modelling of machines and processes via simulation with AI-based predictive analytics, etc., implemented on distributed edge nodes. The digital twin hybrid continuously mirrors the real-life processes, predicts the deviation, foresees the reduction of the equipment, and suggests the optimal behavior of control in real-time. This leads to the control policy implementation being a hybridized centralized-decentralized approach, where a central coordinator sets global goals, and localized decisions are made by edge nodes to achieve the goals without consultation among themselves. The federated learning FEDprox-based predictive models of heterogeneous edge devices are trained to minimize the model drift and to maintain constant the accuracy, adaptively combine models and 5G Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) in the delivery of control commands to the edge nodes and the actuators with a low degree of latency and accuracy. The system continually observes and categorizes faults as critical, moderate, and minor in severity, initiating the relevant proportionate correction actions to ensure production continuity. On heterogeneous devices, EI-HDT has been demonstrated to improve process efficiency (top 85 percent and fault response latency (by approximately 3 orders of magnitude) and predictive accuracy (high) when simulated and on experiment data. Solution can be extended and scaled and improves industry productivity, fault tolerance and Industry 4.0 and efficient channel to real-time optimization and processes in the modern smart factory."

To ascertain the maximum loadability limitations of both systems, we performed load flow analysis using the IEEE 14-bus model for the transmission system and the IEEE 33-bus model for the distribution system. The steady state and voltage at various load levels were analysed using the continuous load flow. By integrating PV model and wind turbine model into the transmission and distribution systems, detailed models of photovoltaic and wind turbine systems with the transmission and distribution were created. The system’s voltage status and voltage profile were improved by the active and reactive power transactions and contributions made possible by these renewable energy models. The load flow analysis was extended to systems. In order to evaluate the loadability limit and voltage stability, the continuation load flow analysis was extended to systems that were integrated with PV and wind turbine models. They show that since the system’s voltage profile is enhanced, the incorporation of renewable energy sources improves voltage stability. Additionally, we closely examined a number of reactive power mitigation techniques and addressed associated problems in transmission and distribution networks. Our thorough examination and analysis provide important new information about how well renewable energy sources may improve voltage profiles and maintain grid stability. Essentially, this increases the power system’s dependability while simultaneously fostering future resilience."

Given the immense importance of communication- the differently abled people often find themselves at a disadvantage- especially the deaf and mute community. This can be attributed to the lack of proficiency - o0r even knowledge- of sign language. This barrier often leads to social isolation, limited opportunities, and dependency (on interpreters). Here, we present a solution to this problem by the means of a real-time computer vision system that can translate ISL - Indian Sign Language gestures into text or speech. It will enhance the accessibility for such people. Our proposed solution utilizes a normal/regular camera set-up along with AI based object-detection models- like YOLO and SSD- to recognize hand signs. This approach is completely contactless, cheaper, and easier to scale in real-world settingswhich makes it different from previous approaches. When we tested the system on our custom ISL dataset, it was able to recognize about 85.5 % of the alphabets in real time. This work contributes to more inclusive communication technology for the hearing and speech impaired, while also paving the way for future research in multilingual and continuous gesture recognition."

    "abstract": "This paper presents the design of a compact bandpass filter in SIW (Substrate Integrated Waveguide) technology based on the integration of circular CSRR (Complementary Split Ring Resonator) resonators. The study deals successively with three configurations: a single-stage topology, followed by a two-stage version and finally a threestage architecture. The operating principle is based on the utilization of evanescent modes below the cut-off frequency of the waveguide, which allows the creation of a controlled bandwidth. The filter performance is optimized by adjusting the geometry and arrangement of the CSRR resonators, which reduces unwanted modes, improves selectivity, and increases out-of-band rejection. The design and simulation were carried out using CST Microwave Studio software. The results show that the three-stage configuration achieves a bandwidth of 630 MHz (at -3 dB), extending from 4.3 GHz to 4.93 GHz, which corresponds to a fractional bandwidth of 13.4%. At the center frequency of 4.7 GHz, the return loss reaches -20 dB, while the insertion loss remains below $-\\mathbf{0. 3 8 ~ d B}$. Outside the passband, the out-of-band rejection exceeds -55 dB. Furthermore, the proposed filter exhibits a 22.95% frequency miniaturization compared to a reference SIW filter operating at 6.1 GHz, highlighting its efficiency in achieving compactness without compromising performance. These features make this filter ideal for various applications, such as wireless communication systems and short-range radars."

To achieve accurate condition assessment of transformers and overcome the limitations of traditional methods in handling multi-source heterogeneous data, dynamic weight adjustment and assessment uncertainty, this paper proposes a systematic methodology for transformer condition evaluation. The method begins with preprocessing of multi-source monitoring data, followed by weight determination using an improved analytic hierarchy process, state mapping through nonlinear membership functions, and information fusion based on an enhanced evidence theory. Finally, alarm signals are incorporated to derive a comprehensive condition score. This results in a complete evaluation framework that follows a data-parameter-state-score pipeline. The proposed methodology provides a valuable reference for practical transformer condition assessment."

    "abstract": "Underwater naval mines are extremely hazardous to battleships and submarines. Therefore, naval forces around the world use mine countermeasures to protect their borders against such threats. One of the strategies employed in mine countermeasures is mine hunting, which requires a thorough search for all mines within a potentially hazardous region. This process is often segmented into four phases: detection, classification, identification, and disposal. In recent years, there has been growing interest in using underwater computer vision for inspection and monitoring purposes. In this paper, we conducted an experiment in a pool and collected a dataset of underwater naval mine-like target using an optical camera for classification. Here, we propose an Edge AI system, including an NVIDIA AGX Xavier device, for classifying custom underwater naval mine-like targets in images using the YOLOV5 deep learning object classification algorithm. We evaluated the model’s performance by analyzing the training loss, testing loss, and accuracy for 50 and 100 epochs. The results show that, for 100 epochs, the losses are minimal and the accuracy is >90%. Additionally, we analyzed the image processing time with the Edge AI device, averaging 216.7ms and 213.8ms for batches of 8 and 16 images."

    "abstract": "The influence of geometrically based single bounce circular channel model (GBSBCM) on spatial data focusing (SDF) is investigated in this work. SDF has been presented as a potential alternative to traditional power focusing techniques in wireless geocasting, as it achieves directionality by utilizing the transmitted data itself rather than relying on radiated energy. As such its beamwidth is defined as the data coverage region, i.e., the area within which data can be decoded as opposed to the classical half-power beamwidth used in power focusing schemes. Space-time channel models are constructed from the statistics of the space-time system field function for an arbitrary channel. This statistical characterization of the channel is subsequently expressed in terms of the space-time power spectral density of the given space-time system field function. The parameters characterized include time-of-arrival and the associated delay spread, angle-of-arrival and power of multipaths components. Using GBSBCM model, the spatial selectivity capability of SDF is analyzed. It is demonstrated that SDF performance is exclusively influenced by the corresponding scattering radius R, and that the corresponding BER increases with increasing R."

It is a common practice to operate at the rated voltage condition in the flux weakening region (FWR) of a drive. But this work shows that operating at the rated voltage in FWR, under light load conditions does not ensure minimum current operation. Instead, it results in higher current drawn for a given torque reference, reducing efficiency. A detailed theoretical analysis is provided, revealing that variable voltage operation in the FWR can achieve better current utilization under light loads. Simulation results support the analysis and confirm the limitations of fixed-voltage operation in FWR. This study emphasizes the importance of adapting voltage in the FWR to ensure optimal performance and highlights the need to revisit conventional assumptions about the rated voltage operation in FWR."

    "abstract": "The Industry 4.0 has exposed the manufacturing and transportation lines to large volumes of sensor and machine data, which needs to be processed real time. Nevertheless, the legacy manufacturing models continue to be plagued by the major issues of latency, bandwidth limitations, and the dangers of transferring sensitive manufacturing information to centralized clouds. These restrictions inhibit fast detection of anomalies, responsive actions to the process variations and resource optimization within the factory floor. As such, manufacturers suffer unjustified downtimes, energy wastages, and high cost of operation. To overcome these issues, this paper presents the Adaptive Edge-AI Orchestrator (AEO)-a distributed, edge-intelligent platform that is intended to be used in smart manufacturing to do real-time analytics and dynamic process control. Each edge node presents AEO as modular and containerized microservices with which low-latency inference is made possible, as well as workflow optimization with reinforcement learning, and the deployment of AI modules with no interruptions to production. Most prominently, AEO presents a peer-to-peer collaborative learning framework that is decentralized, in which edge nodes share learned knowledge instead of raw data, which guarantees privacy of data, generalization of models and continuous learning. AEO can be used to coordinate nearly in real-time through 5G-enabled mesh connectivity, thus decreasing the time response to anomalies, improving the product quality, and decreasing energy usage. It is also designed in a modular manner that enables it to integrate easily into the existing manufacturing infrastructures. In general, it can be stated that AEO is a paradigm shift in intelligent manufacturing-adaptive control, scalability, and real-time decision-making are being made available at the edge."

Fuel cells are very efficient, noiseless and pollution-free. An inverter will be able to supply power to AC loads even when the conditions are low-light/cold. Nevertheless, to be able to provide the appropriate voltage that such applications use, stepping up has to be enabled to reach such voltages. The effective boosting of a voltage must start with a step-up converter that has a wide range of input voltage and low stress on components. This paper presents a converter topology to use in the application of an electric vehicle.

The results show that positive sentiment is mostly caused by new ideas, new uses, and excitement about events like NFT launches. On the other hand, negative sentiment is linked to scams, price swings, regulatory uncertainty, and a lack of trust. Charts showing how people's feelings are spread out and word clouds show the common themes that shape how people feel. The study focuses on the marketing effects of making changes to campaigns in real time, using influencers to reach out to people, building trust, and promoting events. This study adds to both academia and industry by showing how sentiment analysis can help marketers make decisions that are in line with what the community wants and lower risks."

Within the framework of marine seismology, such EM emissions can perturb the electrical properties of the marine environment, leading to subtle variations in the conductivity of seawater in proximity to the seabed that may serve as reliable earthquake precursors. In this work, a mathematical model is developed to quantitatively investigate the variations in seawater conductivity and salinity associated with seismic processes, with salinity evaluated using the Practical Salinity Scale (PSS-78).

After resizing the images for uniformity, we converted them to grayscale for more straightforward processing. In reversible data hiding, increasing the capacity may lead to a decrease in the quality of the medical image, which is undesirable in clinical applications. To overcome this problem, filters are used to improve the image quality while reducing noise, and we use a neural network to reconstruct the images. The aim is to overcome the limitations of existing approaches by providing a comprehensive solution for a wide range of medical imaging requirements. The Sparse Autoencoder Deep Neural Network (SADNN) model autonomously recognizes critical visual patterns, effectively reduces noise, and improves image quality. SADNN introduces a promising methodology for improving image quality, providing valuable insights into healthcare decisions in the complex field of medical imaging. The proposed SADNN model has been evaluated using the BRATS CT dataset for performance metrics such as PSNR and SSIM. The proposed method achieves an impressive peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 64.31 dB and an outstanding structural similarity index (SSIM) value of 0.994, with a computational overhead of only 23.32 kb.

    "abstract": "Hydroponic lettuce cultivation in Indonesia suffers from unpredictable growth during the rainy season due to fluctuating temperature, humidity, pH, and nutrient levels, leading to inefficiencies and losses of yield. The classic approaches ARIMA and Prophet were unable to model nonlinear relationships, which for Prophet indicated MAE 1.475 and a lower RMSE 1.808 for identical 2024 NFT data. This research aims to merge LSTM and Random Forest in a hybrid model capable of providing precise and practical predictions for farmers. 344 daily values for data regarding months of Jan to May 2024 were prepared for training with time series creation, selection with a hole based on standard deviation values of less than 1.5, MinMax value normalization, and split data division based on seasons 1 to 3 for training and season 4 for validation. The hybrid model boasts LSTM for extracting temporal relationships and Random Forest for correcting nonlinear relationships for univariate and multivariate approaches. In several experiments based on differing data structures and other parameters, multivariate clearly outperformed others with MAE 1.256 and a lower RMSE 1.822 for 14.6 percent absolute improvement in MAE performance with 14.85 percent improvement in MAE values for identical data when compared with Prophet. This model clearly indicates major contributing factors for droughts in hydroponic systems for practical future creation of low-cost action rules for straightforward and immediate actions via existing IoT equipment for tropical hydroponic farming."

    "abstract": "Accurate forecasting of rooftop solar energy is essential for grid stability and large-scale Rooftop Solar (RTS) integrations. Many existing approaches are computationally intensive, limiting their suitability for real-world deployment. To address this issue, SolarPredict is proposed as a lightweight and scalable framework that integrates weather and temporal features with multiyear RTS data to deliver precise hourly predictions. A broad benchmark of 19 machine and deep learning models was conducted, where CatBoost, trained on an optimized set of 13 features, stood out by achieving state-of-the-art precision (RMSE = 0.0389, R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> = 0.9631, nRMSE = 0.0417) while maintaining high efficiency. Compared to LightGBM, the next-best model, CatBoost offered over twice the inference speed and required less than half the storage size, making it ideal for edge devices and large-scale deployments. RNN-based deep learning models, including LSTM and GRU, were also assessed. While GRU performed the strongest among them (RMSE = 0.0585, R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> = 0.9179, nRMSE = 0.0662), it came with a significantly higher resource footprint. The proposed framework has been deployed as a responsive web application to support real-time forecasting. These results confirm the practicality of SolarPredict for RTS optimization and smart-grid applications."

    "abstract": "The ever-growing spread of smart devices in safety-critical areas like healthcare, industry, and defence has accentuated the demand for safe, dependable computing platforms. In this paper, we propose ANCHOR-RV, a novel secure-by-design RISC-V ISA that incorporates embedded hardware Roots of Trust (RoT) to overcome the shortcomings of traditional security models. In contrast to the current solutions based on fixed trust anchors and inflexible boot mechanisms, ANCHOR-RV proposes an amazingly flexible and dynamic security system comprised of a Context-Aware Trust Engine (CATE), a Nonlinear PUF-Enhanced Identity Vault, a Secure DMA Isolation Bubble (SDIB) and a Trust-Aware Boot Chain with Mutation (TAB-CM). In combination, these modules can offer real-time threat monitoring, per-device identity verification, secure peripheral isolation, and highstrength boot integrity, and are enhanced by a custom RISC-V ISA extension (RV-TISA) to support more secure firmware-software communication. ANCHOR-RV enables the self-configuration of intelligent devices to dynamically changing threat situations with a minimal power and space footprint, making it particularly useful for prototyping and simulation in low-resource environments. The architecture is prototyped and simulated with the FPGA to test its security robustness, performance and efficiency. The experimental data convincingly show that ANCHOR-RV can deliver significant improvements in trust flexibility and attack resistance, and that it is more efficient than traditional constant RoT deployments in dynamic environments. Mutation of the boot mechanism employed in the architecture and context-aware trust management provides a new defence against side-channel attacks, persistent threats, and boot-time attacks. The work will lay the foundation for future resilient RISC-V-based computing systems, enabling a flexible, extensible, and resilient next-generation smart device platform. The subsequent steps will include an ASIC implementation, optimisation of the machine learning models, and integration with real-world smart device platforms."

    "abstract": "This paper presents an interpretable frequency-domain approach for fault classification in synchronous machines using a Sparse Fourier-based Convolutional Neural Network (SpFFT-CNN). The method extends a time-domain convolutional neural network by integrating learnable spectral weights that operate directly in the frequency domain. These weights adaptively emphasize the harmonic components that contribute most to class separation, allowing the network to identify discriminative frequency regions for different fault conditions. The model was applied to current signals containing healthy and eccentric faults under three preprocessing configurations: with DC (direct current) component, without DC, and without mean. The harmonic spectra learned in each case reveal consistent frequency patterns that remain stable across all the model variants, confirming that the network captures genuine spectral characteristics. The higher harmonics consistently define mixed eccentricity, the lower harmonics dominate dynamic eccentricity, and static eccentricity maintains an overlap that is more pronounced when DC is retained. The results demonstrate that the SpFFT-CNN not only achieves a perfect fault classification but also provides a transparent interpretation of the underlying frequency structure. This framework bridges signal-based analysis and deep learning by linking classification accuracy directly to harmonic interpretability."

    "abstract": "This paper presents the delta operator formulation to establish a decoupled design framework for periodic output feedback (POF) control. The traditional POF-based shift operator becomes numerically ill-conditioned with decrease in sample time. This leads to reduction in closed-loop efficacy and loss of controllability or observability. To overcome these issues, the POF problem is reformulated in the delta domain, and a decoupling strategy is employed that improves the design of controllers for multivariable systems. The decoupled design POF method reduces the complexity by allowing each input to receive feedback from fewer outputs, resulting in fewer feedback loops than the direct design for multivariable systems, which ensures stability of the closed-loop system, and the delta operator maintains structural properties during fast sampling that ensure system matrices are well-conditioned and the stabilization of poles. The proposed method is validated through a numerical example and simulated results."

Current systems predominantly rely on predefined motion primitives, exhibiting significant limitations in flexible interaction. The semantic reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models can provide robust task planning and decision-making support, while more accurate object pose estimation ensures execution precision and operational stability. In this study, we present LanPerAct, a Unified Framework for Language-Driven Perception and Robotic Manipulation. LanPerAct integrates large language models with pose-based grasping through a language-vision-action co-reasoning pipeline. Our approach first employs Deepseek to construct an end-to-end natural language instruction parser that generates structured task parameters. Subsequently, we utilize open-vocabulary object detection and instance segmentation to obtain object masks and corresponding point cloud data, followed by a two-stage point-matching algorithm for precise 6D pose estimation. Finally, the system executes zero-shot object grasping through generated code that interfaces with our multi-stage, multi-task pose-grasping framework, achieving both lightweight implementation and robust task execution. Experimental results in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate the advanced effectiveness of our method, showcasing its capability for efficient and precise execution of natural language-guided manipulation tasks. We believe this research provides valuable insights for real-world robotic behavior development."

The Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) are some of the ML techniques that have been employed to determine the impact of the potentially influential variables such as the workload, the frequency of communication, the quality of sleep, and the physical activity. The results indicate that XGBoost has the highest according with 92.3 percent with other models having lower accuracy in precision, recall, and F1-score. The approach that is suggested by applying ML and AI enables superior stress management functions that consequently enable individuals, teams and organizations to shield themselves against the adverse consequences of stress in their lives. The research might be used in the planning of digital health interventions, which are preventive and can establish a more productive and mentally healthier workplace."

The model selectively focuses on important aspects impacting insulin requirements at each meal by integrating attention mechanisms. The strategy seeks to lower the risk of hypoglycemia while enhancing glycemic control.

A detailed MATLAB/Simulink model is developed to analyze step-load variations and irradiance changes from 1000 to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$100 ~\\mathrm{W} / \\mathrm{m}^{2}$</tex>. Results show that balanced three-phase voltages and currents are preserved with low total harmonic distortion, while frequency deviations remain confined to 49.5-50.0 Hz during large disturbances. Active and reactive power are effectively shared without requiring external coordination, and system voltage and frequency deviations remain within acceptable limits even under reduced irradiance. These findings demonstrate the robustness and ride-through capability of droop-controlled, grid-forming conversion for reliable operation of PV-rich microgrids."

    "abstract": "With China's commitment to carbon neutrality and the urgent need for global carbon emission reduction, the electricity-hydrogen-methanol-ammonia (EHMA) multi-energy system has emerged as a promising pathway for deep decarbonization. However, traditional planning methods often neglect life-cycle environmental impacts and the flexible interaction among multiple energy carriers, leading to suboptimal configurations. This paper proposes a low-carbon planning and configuration method for EHMA multi-energy systems considering full life-cycle assessment. First, a comprehensive life-cycle model is established, encompassing the manufacturing, operational, and disposal phases of all system components. Then, a multi-objective optimization framework integrating economic cost, life-cycle carbon emissions, and energy efficiency is constructed to determine the optimal equipment capacities and operational strategies. The method analyzes various system configurations and operational modes. Case studies of a southern industrial park demonstrate that the optimized configuration achieves 59.6% carbon emission reduction with 0.62 CNY/kWh levelized cost and 78% renewable penetration, while life-cycle assessment reveals operational emissions dominate at 78.5%, highlighting the importance of comprehensive life-cycle considerations in low-carbon planning."

    "abstract": "The diagnosis of short-circuit faults in high-voltage transmission lines is crucial for ensuring the security and stability of power grids. Addressing the challenges posed by short-lasting fault signals, limited effective data, and similarities between different fault features, this paper proposes an intelligent diagnosis method based on fault feature identification and Case-Based Reasoning (CBR). Firstly, to tackle the scarcity of real fault data, a simulation model of a high-voltage transmission system based on a Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC) is established to generate fault data. Secondly, an intelligent feature extraction method integrating the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) with Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) is proposed. GWO is employed to adaptively optimize the penalty factor and mode number of VMD, enabling the optimal extraction of fault features, which are then quantified using Sample Entropy (SE). Finally, a historical case library is constructed based on SE feature vectors, and a retrieval mechanism using Euclidean distance-based similarity calculation is designed for the rapid and intelligent diagnosis of new faults. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an average diagnostic accuracy of 98.46% for 11 types of short-circuit faults with a diagnosis time of only 0.14 seconds, outperforming comparative models like Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and BP Neural Network. Testing on 30 sets of real fault data still yielded an accuracy of 87%, validating the method's effectiveness and practicality in real-world scenarios."

While large enterprises rely on advanced filtering systems, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) often lack the resources or technical expertise to counter increasingly sophisticated phishing campaigns. These risks are amplified by social engineering, zero-day exploits, and hidden payloads. This paper introduces LLM PhishGuard—a lightweight, prompt-driven detection framework that combines OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 with practical heuristics and optional OCR. The system analyzes linguistic cues, domain reputation, SPF/DKIM indicators, domain age, and data extracted from suspicious URLs. Evaluated on a dataset of 59 emails drawn from real-world and corporate sources, PhishGuard achieved 95% accuracy and delivered structured, explainable outputs in downloadable JSON and PDF formats. It is the first lightweight framework to unify LLM reasoning, heuristics, and OCR in a modular, cost-effective design tailored for SME environments. Each message is processed in 5.3 seconds at a cost of approximately $0.002, offering a practical and scalable solution for resource-constrained organizations."

    "abstract": "This work addresses a critical challenge of automatic target recognition in sonar by focusing on feature extraction and feature selection techniques. The inherent non-linear distortions prevalent in sonar echo returns, arising from complex acoustic scattering physics, waveguide propagation effects, and background clutter, severely limit the effectiveness of standard off-the-shelf machine learning classifiers applied to raw echo data. To overcome these limitations and extract highly informative target features, we propose using a non-linear feature extraction method to first separate the target signatures from the background distortions. Specifically, this method utilizes a cascade of wavelet filters combined with non-linear operators, yielding a set of features more amenable to linear classification. This non-linear wavelet transform is well-suited for sonar echo returns due to its highly localized time-frequency characteristics. Our method achieved a classification accuracy of 86.6% on a large sonar target dataset, representing a 13.9% improvement in performance compared to using only the raw sonar echoes. These results demonstrate the discriminatory power of the wavelet-based feature extraction techniques for challenging sonar ATR applications."

By eliminating the DC/DC power converter, the system structure is simplified, its energy losses, weight and cost can also be reduced. The feasibility of this architecture was validated at a small scale by directly hybridizing a stack of five proton exchange membrane fuel cells and a single lithium-ion battery under a (sub)urban driving cycle. Power and energy contributions of the fuel cell stack and the battery were determined. A natural power sharing was observed: the fuel cell provided a regular power output with very small fluctuations, as it would be with power converters, while the battery flexibly responded to rapid transients, allowing the hybrid power source to meet the full power demand. Moreover, the fuel cell provided more power than the mean load demand, with the excess mainly recharging the battery. This confirms the appropriate sizing of the hybrid power source: when coupled, the fuel cell recharges the battery while continuously supplying power to the load."

    "abstract": "The study explores how the type of banking system used affects financial outcomes, drawing data from ten years between 2013 and 2022, from 40 different banks across multiple countries. This study was conducted considering the global environment where Islamic and Conventional Banking systems operate side by side, creating avenues for differing financial performances. Using a quantitative methodology, the research looks at the financial performance through Return on Assets (ROA) and Return on Equity (ROE). The results from two-sample T-test indicate a marked difference in both ROA and ROE, with Islamic Banks outperforming their conventional peers. Along with this, strong positive correlations between ROE and ROA were observed for Islamic Banks (ρ = 0.869) and Conventional Banks (ρ= 0. 784) showing the interrelation of these measures for profitability. These insights give implications for financial institutions and policymakers, showcasing the importance of understanding the operations of each banking model."

    "abstract": "This technical note addresses the discrete dynamic estimation problem in switched linear systems using the model-based minimum distance method (MB-MDM). Prior work has shown that, for this method, the state vector must be sufficiently far from the origin to guarantee an accurate estimation of the discrete dynamic, thereby confirming inherent conflicts between discrete dynamic estimation and feedback control objectives in switched systems. To enhance the accuracy of the MB-MDM, this work focuses on characterizing the region of state vectors that enable exact discrete dynamic estimation, termed informative state vector (ISV). The contributions of this paper are twofold. Firstly, a necessary and sufficient condition based on linear matrix inequalities is derived to determine whether a state vector is informative, revealing that ISV must lie outside a specific ellipsoid. Based on this observation, an ellipsoid-based approach is then proposed to estimate the ISV region."

    "abstract": "Tensor-based multi-view clustering is a popular approach. It can enhance representation learning by exploring higher-order correlations among views. However, two key issues remain unsolved. First, minimizing the tensor rank is a complex multi-objective optimization problem, so finding a suitable optimization strategy is an open problem. Moreover, most tensor methods require two phases to obtain the consensus matrix, which usually leads to suboptimal performance. To address these issues, we propose a Tensorial Multi-view Clustering via Alternative Rank Minimization and Inter-view Alignment (ARIA), in which multiple low-rank matrices and the consistent matrix are jointly optimized in a unified framework. Specifically, we stack the representations obtained from different views into a higher-order tensor. Then, a non-convex alternative rank-minimizing regularization is introduced to achieve a tighter approximation of the rank function. Besides, we impose intra-view alignment constraints to establish a connection between inter-view and intra-view. Unlike the previous method, it is a one-step strategy to obtain the consensus representation. Notably, our approach requires only linear complexity, and thus it can be successfully applied in large-scale clustering tasks. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed method. The code for ARIA is publicly available at <uri xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">https://github.com/zskong/ARIA</uri>."

Measurements and technology computer-aided design (TCAD) simulations demonstrate that the SiC MOSFET experiences severe performance degradation below 200 K due to carrier freeze-out, which manifests as significant threshold voltage instability and pronounced C–V hysteresis. In stark contrast, the silicon IGBT maintains stable switching and robust gate integrity down to 150 K. These results define the low-temperature operational boundary and identify the carrier freeze-out mechanism as the root cause, providing essential guidance for the reliable application of wide bandgap (WBG) SiC devices in extreme cold environments."

    "abstract": "NVM provides a more generalized high-density memory media with DRAM-like performance and non-volatile nature to provide persistent data accesses to computing devices. Due to the poor write tolerance of NVM, wear-leveling strategies are essential in NVM. We find that the remapping table accesses become a neglected performance bottleneck when deploying wear-leveling strategies in NVM controllers, and contiguity-based CPU address mapping caching optimization strategies cannot be adapted due to the randomized mappings introduced by wear-leveling strategies. In this paper, we present RTCache, an efficient caching mechanism designed to accelerate access performance of the wear-leveling remapping table in NVM controllers. We propose a two-level mapping cache to enhance the cache utilization, consequently improving the cache hit ratio. Notably, RTCache incorporates a victim cache to improve the efficiency of RTCache for discretely accessed pages. Furthermore, RTCache adopts a cache-friendly remapping table memory structure, mitigating the challenges posed by access amplification due to RTCache misses. Experimental results show that RTCache can significantly improve the performance of NVM with wear-leveling strategies, and the negative impact on the system performance is reduced to an acceptable level."

Analysis shows that these surplus tie lines increase fills in the Jacobian factorization, which reduces realism and computational efficiency. The observations confirm that inter-area connectivity influences sparse matrix behavior. This work emphasizes the importance of incorporating modular structure into synthetic grid design."

This article proposes, for the first time, a multimode operation strategy for the composite continuum robot, enabling switching among high stiffness, high flexibility, and high precision modes. By adjusting the relative position between the concentric tube and the notched continuum, the robot achieves flexible transitions among these modes. A static model based on Euler–Bernoulli beam theory is established, where the bending moments from the concentric tube acting on the notched continuum segment are analytically integrated to reflect coupling effects. Algorithms are designed to achieve the mapping between the driving force and the shape, as well as the mapping relationship between the driving cable length and the robot shape. Based on the Kepler oval and the established static model, the inverse kinematics model of the robot is constructed. Simulations and experimental results show a modeling error of only 0.042 mm (0.084%), outperforming conventional models. The robot demonstrates convenient mode switching, showing performance characteristics, such as high stiffness, high flexibility, and high precision. This work contributes to improved modeling and control strategies for continuum robots."

First, the induced current under both open-loop and closed-loop conditions, as well as its effect on the AMB electromagnetic forces, is analyzed. Additionally, an online stiffness measurement method is introduced, which requires only adjusting the bias current without increasing the test weight or altering the speed, thereby ensuring practical applicability. Then, an optimized phase-shifted bandpass filter SVSC is implemented, whose parameters are dynamically tuned by the real-time values of the induced current and stiffness. Finally, experimental results at various speeds demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving vibration reduction of at least 3.5 dB and up to 18 dB compared to conventional SVSCs."

As a result, the performance of the DFF is temperature dependent. In D-Latch Design with Stacked Inverters, at a temperature of $27^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, the delay is 39.73 ps and 52.57 ps at $107^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$.

    "abstract": "SSI is a quickly appearing paradigm to secure and user-sovereign digital identity management. Nevertheless, existing implementations of SSI still have privacyprotection, interoperability, anti-fraud, and anti-cryptographic resiliency weaknesses. To tackle these issues, this paper presents a proposal of an AI-enhanced, blockchain-based protocol incorporating the use of Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP), Multiple Layer Decentralization (MLD) as well as quantumresistant cryptography. The framework uses AI to do dynamic Identity verification and real-time fraud detection, risk-based authentication and provides great advantage to traditional SSI models. The system proposed will utilize ZKPs to provide its users with privacy-preserving authentication so that one can confirm attributes but not reveal sensitive personal data. Multi-layer decentralized identity validation structure is developed to enhance the level of trust, reduce dependence on centralized authorities and enhances/supported interoperability across homogeneous systems. Ancillary, postquantum cryptographic schemes will also be incorporated to protect identities by mitigating the possible quantum computing attacks. Experimental evidence shows that our framework significantly enhances the accuracy of verification, the authentication latency and increases security in comparison to centralised and federated identity management solutions. The scheme is very flexible in financing sector, cross boundaries identity, e-governance portals and Web3 online portals. In the end, this study leads to an increment of a scaleable and privacy-sensitive digital identity system because it bridges existing security, usability and compliance gaps and opens pathways to robust and resilient SSI implementations into the future."

The more data is used, the more accurate the algebraic relationship becomes. Simple threshold, Logistic regression, Support Vector Machine SVM and K-Nearest Neighbors KNN were used to predict the received bit in the Binary Phase Shift Keying BPSK digital modulation scheme.

By designing the average simultaneous rate of adjacent stations and spatiotemporal demand gradient features, a short-term prediction method for the simultaneous rate of charging stations based on a hybrid model of K-means and LSTM-GCN is constructed. Furthermore, the Spatial Transfer Flag (STF) is combined with the Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework. This integration establishes a multi-objective rolling optimization model. The model uses forecast data to deploy regulation strategies in advance. Ultimately, it achieves collaborative regulation with three key goals, such as alleviate congestion, enhance revenue, and balance user costs. Experimental results show that the proposed strategy significantly reduces the congestion ratio in the experimental area by 43.6%. It achieves an effective balance between charging station revenue and user costs, verifying its effectiveness and practicality in complex scenarios."

The proposed method achieves DC power aggregation by serially connecting the rectified outputs of individual wind turbines, which increases the DC transmission voltage. This approach is particularly suitable for large-scale wind power integration. Additionally, it significantly reduces equipment usage in both wind farms and the associated transmission systems, thereby lowering capital investment. To validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed scheme, a simulation model comprising four wind turbines has been studied. Simulation results indicate that the proposed system and control strategies ensures stable operation under a range of operating conditions."

However, due to the strong nonlinearity of the aging process and complex operating conditions, traditional life prediction methods struggle to balance prediction accuracy with computational real-time performance. To address the issues of particle degradation and lack of diversity in particle filters (PF) for PEMFC lifespan prediction, this paper proposes an aging prediction model based on a gray wolf optimization algorithm (GWO)-enhanced particle filter (GWO-PF). This model utilizes the hierarchical collaborative mechanism of GWO to optimize the initial particle set and resampling strategy of PF. Experimental results under different training set ratios (50%, 60%, 70%) using datasets from various operating conditions demonstrate that the GWO-PF model can accurately track aging trends under both steady-state and dynamic conditions, exhibiting good prediction accuracy and robustness. Compared to the traditional Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) model, in steady-state conditions, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of GWO-PF is reduced by up to 25.26% compared to LSSVM, and the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) is reduced by up to 35.16%. In quasi-dynamic conditions, the GWO-PF model achieves a maximum reduction of 20.90% in RMSE and a maximum reduction of 29.41% in MAPE."

The CNN–LightGBM hybrid model achieved 73.33% accuracy and 73.59% F1-Score on one benign and five malware classes. This hybrid approach shows clear improvement compared to the CNN softmax classifier with an accuracy of 60.67% and an F1-Score of 61.37%. While the overall accuracy indicates room for further optimization, the findings successfully demonstrate that integrating LightGBM as a classifier for CNN-extracted features provides a performance boost over end-to-end CNN architectures for malware classification."

    "abstract": "With the large-scale grid integration of intermittent renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power, the power system demands significantly enhanced response speed and regulation accuracy for primary frequency regulation. Multi-flywheel energy storage matrices have emerged as the mainstream auxiliary form due to their advantages of rapid response and extended cycle life. This paper investigates the distributed deviation balancing issue in multi-flywheel energy storage matrices following primary frequency regulation, focusing on global balancing and local safety coordination scenarios under a strongly connected communication topology. A control model for multi-flywheel energy storage arrays is constructed, integrating the multi-flywheel communication topology, SOC deviation sensing after primary frequency regulation, and distributed consensus logic. This model innovatively resolves the SOC deviation issue following primary frequency regulation, overcoming the limitations of traditional single-flywheel regulation or centralized deviation balancing frameworks. Adaptability to complex multi-flywheel matrix operation scenarios is enhanced by establishing a local limiting mechanism incorporating SOC upper/lower bounds, power rating constraints, and SOC rate-of-change limits. The effectiveness and efficiency of the model and algorithm are validated through proportional consensus convergence analysis and hierarchical architecture stability verification."

With the depletion of traditional energy resources and their adverse environmental impacts, RES (renewable energy sources) are increasingly essential for reliable electricity generation. However, factors like Lightning storms, system faults, & the challenges of delivering power to distant or hilly areas necessitate robust techniques. Hybrid Energy Systems (HES) integrates many sources of energy. It is a viable approach to ensure uninterrupted & reliable supply of power. This research focuses on designing a HES comprising SPV, WES, & diesel energy sources using MATLAB/Simulink. To enhance system reliability, a diesel engine generator (DEG) is connected with the solar-wind setup as a backup source. This study evaluates the feasibility and stability of the recommended system designed to support a $50-\\mathrm{kW}$ load, of a mini-community. Optimizing the system is a crucial part of this research, aimed at maximizing performance and ensuring operational stability. To enhance the SPV system’s performance, the Proportional-Integral (PI) controller parameters are optimized via the Artificial Bee Colony Optimization (ABCO) algorithm.

    "abstract": "Indonesia's oil trade balance, which was in surplus in the late 1990s, has gradually moved into an extensive deficit. Crude oil exports fell drastically throughout time from USD 5.71 billion in 1996 to just USD 2.23 billion in 2024. Exports of crude oil have fluctuated although they are still less than imports. With a peak of USD 31.76 billion in 2012, imports of oil products increased from USD 2.08 billion in 1996 to USD 25.92 billion in 2024. This study forecasts trade values and identifies abnormalities using artificial intelligence (AI) and big data. Grid-searched ARIMA models and an automated data pipeline were used with the best models, ARIMA (0,2,1) for exports and ARIMA (2,2,1) for imports, showing short term corrections after sharp changes. Events like the 2008 oil price rise and COVID-19 decline in 2020 are the main causes of volatility, according to Z-score results of year-over-year analysis. This suggests that persistent instability is not the root source of volatility. The model's capacity to offer a more realistic long-term prognosis is demonstrated by the final projection, which predicts a major decrease in oil exports and a large trade imbalance by 2030 when compared to the Hybrid VAR-LSTM approach model. The results suggest opportunities to boost export recovery and reduce reliance on imports. Data-based routing and AI forecasting are applied for this. To increase energy security, recommendations include incorporating more detailed data such as including outside variables in forecasts as well as AI-assisted distribution and refining. To improve forecast accuracy even more, future studies might expand this framework by adding advanced deep learning architectures like Transformer models or bidirectional LSTMs."

    "abstract": "Although electric vehicles (EVs) have been vigorously promoted, the battery range issue has not been properly resolved. A feasible solution is to realize vehicle-tovehicle (V2V) energy mutual aid. However, the dual active bridge (DAB) Direct Current (DC) converter, as an intermediate converter, often suffers from unstable output voltage caused by unstable input voltage and sudden load change, making it difficult to operate with high efficiency. To this end, this paper proposes a voltage control strategy based on double integral sliding mode control, using the hyperbolic tangent function to suppress the chattering phenomenon of sliding mode control. First, a reduced-order model is derived based on the single-phase shift (SPS) power mechanism of DAB. Then, a double integral sliding surface including the first integral and the second integral is constructed, and the control law and stability analysis are derived. Finally, experimental verification shows that the proposed control strategy has better performance than the conventional sliding mode in terms of settling time, steady-state error, and robustness under parameter uncertainty."

A dual-objective goal modulates the trajectory's curvature based on dynamically varying Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) real-time communication data. The comparative simulation results indicate better performance than the traditional polynomial-only, Model Predictive Control (MPC), and Deep Q-Network (DQN) planners, with a minor trajectory deviation (I 0.2 m), lower lateral acceleration (I 0.18 g), and a stabilised yaw rate (I 5).

Typically, this process requires manual inspection to detect all damages and categorize them into specific categories, which is labor-intensive and prone to human error. In this paper, we propose an automated inspection process using anomaly detection techniques through computer vision, exploring various algorithms to address the task of detecting a variety of damages in chain link fences. Our approach includes evaluating several semantic segmentation models and analyzing the impact of design criteria such as edge detection, pre-processing, and post-processing. The results show that our proposed model utilizing the combination of IS-NET from Dichotomous Image Segmentation and Masked Autoencoder (MAE) outperforms the current approaches and effectively detects most of the defects in chain link fence images.

This monolithic integration was needed in such applications as ECG, EEG, and implantable telemonitoring due to the optimization of space and power consumption, and the quality of signals. The close range between the digital and analog domain is required to obtain a high SNR and the extremely large subsate noise can generally lower the signal integrity, and also lead to poor diagnosis or monitoring accuracy. Traditional types of fixed or statical isolation, such as fixed guard rings and substrate contact, have a disadvantage of being unable to accommodate dynamic noise, and have an area or power cost often. To reduce the constraints, the more advanced real-time adaptive substratebiasing isolation technique is proposed in this article. The plan exploits dynamical biased guard rings that have a frame maintenance by real-time substrate noise observation and in system machine learning predicting noise contributions based on circuit activity and environmental stimulus feed-back. This method is also useful since the massaging of isolation structures are anticipated in advance and therefore, it does not topographically increase any latency or overhead to whatsoever has been discussed on the reduction of periodic and transient substrate noise. As demonstrated using the simulation and the prototype performance, the specified approach would produce a significantly more desirable outcome when it comes to the noise suppression, relative to what the static schemes would present, perhaps by up to 35 per cent, judging by the signal-to-noise ratio. Moreover, the system has many opportunities of being produced with standard CMOS and possesses minimal extra-layout complexity, offering further procedures to apply the architecture to the following generation of medicine-related SoCs. One of the main breakthroughs of this adaptive isolation technique relates to the acquisition of signals, which should be reliable due to the ability to achieve reliance on real-time acquisition, in the circumstances when biology is vulnerable to noise."

    "abstract": "The prevalence of respiratory diseases is rising among the population, highlighting the need for greater attention to respiratory health. Lung sound classification is crucial for the diagnosis of respiratory diseases. Traditional lung sound classification methods often lack interpretability and typically focus solely on audio data, neglecting valuable metadata. To address this, we propose LungListener, a framework that bootstraps a large-scale audio-language model to integrate lung sound audio data and patient metadata for accurate lung sound classification. Specifically, we adapt the model to lung sound analysis by introducing joint reasoning over audio and metadata, and training it on a carefully constructed task-specific dataset, which significantly enhances its domain understanding. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to apply a large-scale audio-language model to lung sound classification, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the ICBHI respiratory sound database surpassing previous results by 0.28%. Additionally, we evaluate our framework on a dataset from Xiamen Maternal and Child Health Hospital, demonstrating good performance. Finally, we develop a home-based lung sound monitoring system, enabling users to conveniently monitor their respiratory health."

Therefore, a classification method based on images is needed. In this study, the EfficientNetV2B0 model of Attention-Based BiGRU is proposed for facial skin disease classification. EfficientNetV2B0 is used to extract spatial features, with the BiGRU attention mechanism capturing sequential relationships between patches, indicating related lesion features. To ensure that this method remains stable and effective on smaller datasets, token reduction, channel projection, and SE blocks are used to strengthen this approach. In addition, these methods are all relatively simple and widely used, making them reliable in essence. The experimental results show that with five varieties of skin disease as indicators The proposed EfficientNetV2B0 model with Attention-Based BiGRU achieves 79% accuracy, which is better than the best baseline (ResNet50, 74%) and improved the EfficientNetV2B0 model itself (67%).

    "abstract": "This work proposes a new high-speed, low-power analogue-to-digital converter (ADC) architecture, namely the Graphene-Plasmonic Interface Enabled Dual-Domain ADC (GPI-DDADC), specifically designed for terahertz (THz) signal processing applications. Even traditional ADCs are limited to high-frequency ranges in the THz range due to the inherent limitations of the charge-mode, including switching speed, heat dissipation, and silicon scaling. To address these issues, the proposed architecture relies on emerging material interfaces, combining graphene plasmonic modulators with opto-electronic quantisation layers of phase-change materials. This exotic hybrid system utilises graphene's ultrafast carrier mobility and Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) refractive index tunability to achieve high-speed analogue-to-digital conversion with a low energy overhead. It presents a dual-domain quantisation method that jointly encodes signal data in the electrical and optical domains, thereby doubling bandwidth utilisation and reducing conversion latency. Moreover, ferroelectric nanomaterials are utilised at the memory level to achieve zero standby power through remanent polarisation, thereby replacing conventional CMOS latches. Simulation data show a maximum sampling rate of 200 GS/s, a power consumption of less than 30 mW, and an effective number of bits (ENOB) of up to 8, which is more than 40 per cent faster and 60 per cent more energy-efficient than state-of-the-art THz ADCs. The suggested GPI-DDADC architecture has the potential to enable miniaturised, low-power, high-resolution ADCs for 6G communication systems, high-frequency biomedical imaging, and next-generation radar systems. The work represents a paradigm shift away from silicon-based solutions towards hybrid electronic-photonic ADCs that leverage new material science to meet the requirements of next-generation ultra-broadband systems. This work reports system-level performance of the proposed GPI-DDADC architecture, achieving an effective sampling rate of 200 GS/s with on-chip power below 30 mW. The corresponding energy-per-conversion is approximately 150 fJ/sample when normalized to the full system rate. Monte-Carlo PVT simulations confirm an ENOB of 8 ± 0.12 bits, with measurable SNDR and SFDR improvements under dual-domain arbitration. All performance metrics and statistical confidence intervals are detailed in the Results section."

To address the difficulty of online measurement of motor main insulation breakdown voltage, this paper proposes a hybrid model based on Continuous Hidden Markov Model (CHMM) and Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), named CHMM-GBDT. This model captures the dynamic state evolution characteristics of the insulation aging process through CHMM. It integrates the dynamic state features with four non-destructive observable quantities—insulation resistance, insulation capacitance, dielectric loss tangent, and maximum discharge magnitude—to construct enhanced features. Based on these enhanced features, the breakdown voltage prediction model is built using GBDT. The results demonstrate that this hybrid model achieves high accuracy in predicting breakdown voltage."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Depth estimation plays a vital role in various fields such as autonomous driving, 3D reconstruction, virtual reality, and robotics. Taking self-supervised monocular depth estimation as an example, existing methods commonly enhance multi-scale information transmission through dense cross-layer feature fusion techniques, such as skip connections and channel concatenation. However, these operations often lead to increased feature dimensionality and computational redundancy. Moreover, indiscriminate fusion of low- and high-level features tends to introduce noise, thereby degrading the edge sharpness and geometric consistency of the predicted depth maps. To address these issues, this paper proposes a general-purpose dynamic channel compression framework tailored for feature fusion. A task-oriented channel selection strategy is employed to reduce redundancy while preserving critical information. Specifically, the proposed framework includes a dynamic threshold generation network that determines sample-adaptive retention thresholds based on the distribution of channel-wise standard deviations. Furthermore, a probabilistic L0 gating mechanism is introduced, which relaxes the discrete channel selection problem into a continuous optimization via a hard shrinkage function. The design is attention-free and easily integrable into existing architectures. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our method achieves a 10%–30% reduction in parameter count across multiple depth estimation models, with accuracy degradation of less than 1%."

Our model incorporates two key innovations: the Fourier Implicit Enhancement Module and High-Frequency Residual Connection, which together enhance feature representation in the frequency domain. This approach effectively captures both structural characteristics and intensity information, enabling the decoder to reconstruct high-quality images with improved fidelity. Experimental evaluations on road spectral datasets spanning 400-1700nm wavelengths demonstrate superior performance compared to existing neural representation methods. Our approach achieves better results on standard image quality metrics including PSNR and MS-SSIM. Notably, the proposed method exhibits exceptional performance at low bit rates, making it particularly suitable for resource-constrained autonomous driving systems where bandwidth and storage limitations are significant concerns. The compression efficiency combined with high-fidelity spectral reconstruction capabilities addresses a critical need in autonomous driving applications, where accurate spectral information processing must be balanced with practical system constraints. Our results demonstrate that frequency domain enhancement provides an effective pathway for optimizing hyperspectral image compression while maintaining the detailed spectral information necessary for reliable autonomous driving perception."

    "abstract": "Focusing on the complexity of real-time scheduling for Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) due to source-load volatility and rigorous security constraints, this study develops a novel optimal dispatch approach employing the Temporal Fusion Transformer-Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TFT-DDPG) algorithm. Initially, a holistic optimization framework is established with the goal of minimizing the overall operating expenditure. This framework integrates the operating constraints specific to diverse resources, including distributed generation units, energy storage systems (ESSs), and demand response programs. The VPP optimal dispatch challenge is subsequently recast as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP). Subsequently, a hybrid intelligent solution algorithm integrating TFT and DDPG is proposed. This approach utilizes the TFT's strong ability to process multi-source time-series data and capture long-term correlations, significantly improving state perception for the scheduling agent. The DDPG, incorporating a Lagrangian dual function for constraint satisfaction, is used to optimize the continuous control actions. Furthermore, a new experience replay mechanism prioritizing temporal correlation is introduced to enhance training stability and efficiency. Case studies utilizing real operational data from a site in Qinghai, China, confirm that the proposed TFT-DDPG algorithm is capable of generating effective real-time scheduling decisions. This method offers a robust solution for securing the safe, economical, and operationally efficient management of VPPs in highly complex scenarios."

To afford intermodal feature extraction and synchronization, a Latent Space Alignment (LSA) Module is designed to ensure feature matching and synchronization using a Hybrid TransformerCNN Fusion Framework with a Cross attention mechanism. A self-supervised contrastive learning module is integrated to increase robustness and to allow feature discrimination with little supervision. Moreover, to embed the privacy of medical data in the training algorithms, the model applies multi-agent reinforcement learning for dynamic decisions in general and blockchain integrated federated learning for private, decentralized training across multiple healthcare institutions. Deployment of the Edge AI on the 5G enabled devices achieves real-time processing as it decreases the latency and the resource consumption in the wearable devices. The proposal results experimentally prove its superiority as a diagnostic approach in terms of accuracy, and speed of computations, as well as its security.

However, its performance is often constrained by the scene representation method. This paper proposes a dense reconstruction approach based on an improved 3D Gaussian representation, aiming to address the challenges of initialization in textureless regions and the inefficiency of optimization in existing methods. This paper incorporates a progressive propagation strategy into the densification process of 3D Gaussians. By integrating scene geometric priors with block-matching techniques, it dynamically generates Gaussian distributions with precise positions and orientations, thereby significantly enhancing reconstruction quality. Compared with traditional splitting and cloning strategies, the proposed method effectively handles textureless regions in large-scale scenes and enables efficient structured map expansion. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significant improvements in camera pose estimation, map reconstruction, and novel view synthesis."

Due to the lack of gaze tracking confidence ground truth, most existing methods can only provide an approximated confidence by estimating prediction uncertainty associated with gaze tracking prediction. In this work, we proposed a confidence-aware gaze tracking framework based on heteroskedastic regression to more accurately estimate prediction uncertainty for better confidence awareness. In addition, we also introduced a novel assessment metric based on the causal relationship between eye feature degradation severity and confidence drop to judge the performance of confidence awareness. This metric provides a fairer assessment of confidence awareness than the existing metric that depends on a spurious correlation between prediction error and confidence. With experiments from two open source gaze tracking datasets, we have demonstrated the potential of the proposed confidence-aware gaze tracking structure."

    "abstract": "Grid-forming inverter-based resources (GFM-IBRs) are playing a key role in realizing 100 % renewable energy-based power grid due to their inherent advantages, such as virtual inertia emulation, frequency regulation, and voltage support. However, the fault-ride through (FRT) and stable operation in post-fault conditions, particularly under asymmetrical faults, is a major challenge. The unbalance between phases induces negative sequence current, and if not effectively controlled, it leads to double-line frequency oscillations in output of GFM-IBRs. Moreover, the limited fault-current capability of GFM-IBRs necessitates an overcurrent limiting mechanism to protect the power-electronic based switching devices. Thus, this paper presents a novel control framework that ensures robust operation of GFM-IBRs during asymmetrical and in post-fault conditions. The proposed control scheme incorporates a fault detection module (FDM) to identify the start and end of asymmetrical faults, and a modified virtual impedance-based overcurrent limiter that suppresses the negative sequence current and restricts the fault current within safe threshold. The effectiveness of the proposed control for GFM-IBRs is validated through various cases and benchmarked against the conventional current saturation-based overcurrent limiting approach."

The electromagnetic transient process of a DFIG under three-phase short-circuit conditions is examined, and the rotor transiently induced electromotive force ( EMF ) is identified as the key factor leading to rotor overcurrent. By analyzing the coupling between stator flux linkage and rotor induced EMF, a feedforward compensation scheme is developed. In this method, the transient component of rotor control voltage derived from stator flux is implemented via the rotor side converter (RSC) to counteract transient EMF and minimize rotor current overshoot. In addition, considering timing constraints in the RSC control, a reactive power compensation target is superimposed during the fault period to provide effective voltage support at the grid connection point. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated using simulation studies carried out in MATLAB/Simulink."

However, transfer performance remains limited by two key issues: a) semantic relationships are often overlooked when exploring similarity between samples, and b) low-confidence pseudo-labels are not properly corrected, which affects subsequent iterations. To address these issues, we propose a method called Label Semantic and Sample Relationship Collaborative Learning (LSSRC), which consists of two core components: Composite Similarity Learning (CSL) and Consistent Neighborhood Pseudo-Label Refinement (CNPR). First, CSL measures the similarity between a sample and its neighbors by weighing feature similarity and semantic relevance, aiming to leverage class centers to rectify the learning of sample relationships. Second, CNPR introduces a correction strategy based on the semantic knowledge of target sample neighborhoods. It refines low-confidence pseudo-labels after each iteration, effectively reducing error accumulation. In addition, we introduce an Adaptive Neighborhood Reconstruction Embedding (ANRE) method to minimize reconstruction residuals when projected samples are represented by their neighbors, thereby enhancing the integration of cross-domain samples. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing advanced methods in terms of performance."

    "abstract": "In recent years, AI models have demonstrated a growing ability to interpret complex human behavior, including emotional states. While vision-language models (VLMs) have shown significant capabilities in this area, their application to group emotion recognition remains a challenging task. This challenge is compounded by the limitations of traditional evaluation metrics, which, due to their binary logic, fail to capture the nuanced semantic relationships between different emotional states. To address this evaluation gap, our work pioneers a systematic method for evaluating cohesive group emotion, moving beyond the simple aggregation of individual states. We achieve this within a <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">zero-shot paradigm</i>, establishing a lightweight baseline that eliminates the need for model fine-tuning.

Our results demonstrate that, when assessed with the GEM-AI framework, these models achieve high performance, reaching semantic accuracy of approximately 80%. This reveals a sophisticated comprehension of group emotion that is significantly underestimated by conventional metrics, which achieved only around 60% accuracy in our experiments."

    "abstract": "Large‐aperture antenna arrays promise fine angular resolution, but their dense layouts usually lead to prohibitive cost and design complexity. Sparse arrays present a compelling alternative, yet their design typically depends on computationally intensive and numerically unstable optimization methods that are prone to local minima. In this paper, we first propose a deterministic and region-partitioning algorithm, referred to as Quadrant-Amplitude Mapping (QAM), which recursively divides the aperture into quadrants and directly maps a given amplitude taper to element positions. In 30 independent trials, QAM reduces the standard deviation of the peak SLL by 67.4% relative to conventional density-weighted mapping, effectively eliminating stochastic variability. Building on QAM, we further develop a mapping-guided sparse-array optimization framework that embeds position selection within the amplitude-weight refinement loop. Compared with direct position optimization, the proposed framework achieves 9.9 dB lower sidelobes within 60 minutes of computation, and outperforms the existing weight-first mapping approach by 4.97 dB after 20 iterations. The proposed strategy offers a fast and robust solution for designing low-sidelobe sparse arrays. Moreover, it can be extended to the design of arrays with arbitrary or non-uniform apertures, offering a cost-effective solution for next-generation high-resolution sensing systems."

To improve flexibility in IoT service delivery, network function virtualization (NFV) has been integrated into the SON, where IoT services can be abstracted as service function chains (SFCs) comprising multiple sequential virtual network functions (VNFs). However, due to short satellite life, limited on-board resources, and diverse user demands, how to efficiently deploy SFCs in SONs still remains a great challenge. In this paper, we propose a cost-efficient SFC deployment (CE-SFCD) scheme to jointly optimize satellite battery life consumption, SFC latency, and resource consumption while guaranteeing a high SFC acceptance ratio during the process of SFC deployment. In CE-SFCD, the battery cost, latency cost, and resource cost are defined, and the SFC deployment problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. Considering the problem is NP-hard, heuristic algorithms are developed to realize the CE-SFCD scheme. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the flexibility and superiority of the CE-SFCD scheme in terms of SFC acceptance ratio, battery life consumption, latency, and resource utilization."

    "abstract": "In this article, the performance of an RF power amplifier placed inside a conductive enclosure with an aperture is investigated under irradiation by a high-power electromagnetic pulse (HPEM). HPEM, due to its high amplitude and pulsed nature, can cause significant disruption in the operation of electronic systems. To evaluate the protective role of the enclosure, the shielding effectiveness (SE) against a modulated Gaussian wave is calculated using the finite difference delay modeling (FDDM) numerical method. The results indicate that at the enclosure’s resonant frequencies, SE sharply decreases and even becomes negative, revealing the resonant behavior of the structure. Subsequently, the TB232 PolyFET power amplifier, which uses a GP2441 GaAs transistor, is assessed under high-power microwave (HPM) irradiation with a sine burst waveform. By employing Thevenin-equivalent models at the gate and drain terminals, the impact of the interference wave on output power gain is analyzed. The results show that at resonant frequencies, electromagnetic interference (EMI) can reduce the amplifier gain by up to 30 dB. Moreover, increasing the input RF power reduces the detrimental effects of the interference. This study clearly highlights the influence of enclosure resonance and the amplifier’s nonlinear behavior on its susceptibility to HEMP disturbances."

    "abstract": "Recently, backdoor attack, which aims to implant malicious logic into deep learning models (DLMs), has attracted so extensive research attention. Among them, the non-poisoning-based backdoor attack appears considerable development prospects owing to the posed threats against the DLMs-based artificial intelligence applications in cyberspace. However, previous non-poisoning- based backdoor attacks for DLMs are limited to the impractical attacking forms, resulting in certain weaknesses in both attacking complexity and attacking adaptability. To tackle the mentioned issues, this paper proposes a novel backdoor attack framework, namely the shell code injection (SCI), to perform backdoor attacks against DLMs with lower complexity and higher adaptability. Specifically, for alleviating the attacking complexity, we elaborate the logic-driven stealthy backdoor shell motivated by the biological behavior in nature, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">e.g</i>., the camouflage and attack strategy of crabs. By introducing the trigger consistency verification and short-circuit code packaging strategies, the SCI misleads the victim models to output wrong predictions without training requirements according to the preset poisonous decision logic. For enhancing the attacking adaptability, we design the LLM-assisted adaptive attacking target code generation that consists of the model concept detection module and the attack target adjusting module. Since the attacking goals could be generated dynamically according to the aware victim model information and appointed attacker preset instructions, the SCI could achieve more flexible attacking performance. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that the proposed backdoor attack framework appears awesome attacking ability (almost 100% ASR) under various settings. Additionally, we provide a case study on combining the cyber attack with SCI, which also exhibits certain space for imagination of new-type backdoor attacks."

A fundamental component of these systems is the perception module, which enables vehicles to understand and react to their surrounding environment. Object detection, in particular, is essential for identifying dynamic and static elements on the road, such as pedestrians, vehicles, traffic signs, and obstacles. In this work, we explore and enhance the capabilities of state-of-the-art deep learning-based object detectors within the YOLO (You Only Look Once) family, focusing on the latest versions: YOLOv10 and YOLOv11. We fine-tuned and optimized multiple variants of each model—namely, nano (n), small (s), medium (m), and large (l)—to improve detection accuracy and computational efficiency for real-time autonomous driving applications. The models were trained and evaluated on a diverse road object, and performance was measured using key metrics including precision, mean Average Precision (mAP), and Precision-Recall curves. Experimental results reveal that the fine-tuned YOLOv10n achieved a peak class-level precision of 1.00 at a specific confidence threshold (0.997), indicating that perfect precision was observed for certain classes under high-confidence conditions, while the overall mean precision and mAP metrics reflect more balanced model performance, while YOLOv11s attained the best result within its group with a precision of 0.91 at a threshold of 0.972. These findings demonstrate the potential of tailored YOLO architectures to meet the demanding requirements of real-world autonomous navigation systems."

    "abstract": "Six-dimensional object pose estimation is essential for robot grasping, inspiring the development of various advanced methods in this field. The latest research on 6-D pose estimation mainly focuses on training a neural network for a specific object and estimating its pose through a 3-D model. However, 6-D pose estimation faces challenges such as the lack of 3-D models and variations in shape, color, and texture between similar objects, which significantly affect the accuracy and generalization of 6-D pose estimation algorithms. In addition, training neural network models requires substantial time and computational resources, leading to increased algorithmic costs. To address these issues, this article proposes a single-shot visual prompt-based 6-D pose estimation network (SVP6D), which can efficiently reconstruct 3-D models for novel objects from an RGB-D image and perform 6-D pose estimation. In addition, a hybrid attention-based visual prompting method (HAVP) is proposed, which reduces the training cost of the network by adjusting the input image to make it more suitable for the backbone. Experiments show HAVP reduces training costs while maintaining accuracy, and SVP6D achieves state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, the real-world experiments show that SVP6D achieves superior robotic grasping performance, with an average grasping success rate of 82.8% in different scenarios."

First, color manipulation is performed by transferring the information of predominant color channels to the weak color channels using the color transfer method followed by the gray world algorithm. Then three derived inputs such as two versions of gamma corrected images with different gamma values and the unsharp masking are obtained from the color manipulated image for blending their advantages using multiscale image fusion. The experimental results show that the proposed approach substantially removes the darkness and maintains the naturalness of the image."

    "abstract": "Fires pose a significant risk to human life and economic stability, rendering early detection essential. Conversely, FAS often encounter false alarms and malfunctions due to defective sensors, leading to hazardous delays or unnecessary responses. Due of their inflexible schedules, conventional maintenance procedures cannot accommodate the present condition of these systems. This study proposes an innovative method for FAF anomaly detection by integrating fuzzy logic with convolutional neural networks to address this issue. The method commences with the purification of a high-dimensional dataset by data preprocessing and the selection of features based on correlation. The subsequent phase involves developing a Fuzzy-CNN model that employs fuzzy logic to dynamically train the CNN weights, enhancing the model's adaptability and mistake detection capabilities. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model surpasses conventional classifiers in identifying FAF, with an impressive accuracy of 99.40%. The results indicate that the Fuzzy-CNN architecture is reliable and effective in identifying outliers in fire detection systems. This integrated strategy may yield enhancements in industrial safety and operational efficiency, along with a more responsive and precise method for monitoring FAS, potentially transforming fire safety system maintenance."

This paper investigates the potential clamping effect caused by multi-point grounding faults and its impact on no-load current characteristics. A 3D electromagnetic field simulation model of the transformer was established using the finite element method. Various scenarios of single and multi-point grounding faults at different core locations were systematically simulated. Results show that the fault location significantly influences the no-load current, with amplitude variation rates ranging between 2.7 % and 19.7 %. This circulating current causes a substantial increase in root mean square (RMS) value and waveform distortion of the noload current. The study provides theoretical and data support for using no-load current as a characteristic parameter in early online diagnosis of multi-point grounding faults."

    "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation is most commonly used to combine large language models with an external knowledge base in an attempt to ground them. This significantly improves the performance in terms of factual information, but sometimes these pipelines can also expose sensitive information if not handled properly. In this work, SecureRag a framework is presented which is designed to reduce the leakage of sensitive information in these systems. Synthetic datasets were created for six domains including legal, financial, healthcare, government, and e-commerce using Python Faker Library. To implement the SecureRag system, filtering layers were implemented that redacts confidential content before it reaches the large language model. The implementation began with regular expression based filters which were later enhanced with Microsoft Presidio based filters. The implementation was evaluated with multiple tests and large language models including MiniLm, Gemini Flash 2.5, BERT-QA. The RAG system was tested against various scenarios of adversarial attacks such as prompt injections, Base64-encoded data, and needle-in-the-haystack challenges. The results show that SecureRag can effectively prevent sensitive information leakage in RAG pipelines while keeping the retrieval performance intact, this offers a safer approach for RAG pipelines."

    "abstract": "Rehabilitation therapy is particularly important in the treatment and recovery of people with physical injuries, neurological disorders, or post-surgical damage. Classical rehabilitation techniques, despite being clinically efficient, are challenged by high economic costs, the necessity of continual monitoring, and by a limited patient compliance. In order to overcome these issues, this work presents a new framework for real-time feedback and health monitoring during rehabilitation by means of Wearable Internet of Things (IoT) nodes embedded into Virtual Reality (VR) environments_ESCAPE_PUNCT, which is addressed to aforementioned problems. By combining immersive VR recordings with wearable health sensors, the proposed system improves patient motivation, and it makes personal treatment possible, as well as remote monitoring opportunity for healthcare providers. This system is primarily composed of a network of wearable IoT devices, monitoring physiological and biomechanical measurements, such as the heart rate, muscle activities, the alignment of the posture, and the joint angles. These points of data are sent in real-time to a cloud connected VR platform which a virtual therapist or customized exercise simulator uses to direct the patient in completion of rehabilitation exercises. The VR therapy is engaging and useful to patients and enables accurate adherence to exercises, with real-time visual, auditory, and haptic feedback. In addition, recorded data can be processed by machine learning algorithms to assess the patient's improvement or progression, and to tailor therapy and recovery forecasts. The use of VR in such a system makes it easy to create controlled, safe, and interactive environments that contain tasks similar to those seen in the real world. Patients may be gradually challenged according to their performance, and their adherence and improvement may be supervised at distanced. That decreases reliance on physical therapy centers and improves access, particularly for those in rural or underserved areas. And, the system is configured to identify abnormal readings, such as heart rate or posture anomalies, to issue alerts and avoid self-harm during unsupervised sessions. Simulation and prototype testing demonstrate a 35% improvement in patient compliance, 28% rehabilitation precision, and 40% decrease in supervision hours. The convergence of wearable IoT and VR typifies a strong cooperation and turns the traditional rehabilitation into a data-centric, interactive, and patient-oriented operation. This work proposes a scalable and modular design that can be adapted to a variety of rehab domains such as orthopedic rehabilitation, neurological rehab, post stroke therapy. Ultimately it provides an intelligent pathway to remote models of rehabilitative care, in the home, using real-time biofeedback and engaging interactivity to improve results and cost effectiveness."

    "abstract": "The increasing use of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) in smart grids has enabled sustainable energy optimization while exposing critical weaknesses in cybersecurity and energy efficiency. Conventional security models fail to address the energy limitations of IIoT edge devices, or instead utilize inflexible Zero Trust solutions, which cannot be easily explained and adapted to a particular situation. The work introduces ZeroTrustEdge, a new generation, modular security paradigm that combines the Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and energy- aware robust access management to secure IIoT-enabled smart grids. As opposed to a more static security solution, ZeroTrustEdge is context-sensitive and can dynamically adapt security policy and ensures operational efficiency by monitoring the behavior of devices, context and energy states. Explainable AI models also make the decisions related to threat detection and access control clear and interpretable to the operator of the system, which would promote trust in automated defense. The results of experimental assessments of the simulated environments show that ZeroTrustEdge exceeds the conventional IIoT security models by enhancing the rate of detecting attacks by 26.4%, minimizing unnecessary energy consumption by 19.7%, and improving the explainability of the decisions made by 31%. ZeroTrustEdge creates a new paradigm addressing critical tradeoffs between resilience, transparency, and energy sustainability in future cyber- physical systems."

    "abstract": "Taxes constitute a vital source of government revenue, underpinning national development and the provision of essential public services. Nevertheless, ensuring tax compliance remains a persistent global challenge, with numerous countries grappling with administrative inefficiencies, inadequate enforcement, limited technological capacity, and declining public trust in tax institutions. These structural constraints hinder voluntary compliance and present significant governance concerns. In the Indonesian context, motorized taxpayer compliance continues to be an area of concern, particularly as regional governments strive to modernize tax administration through digital innovation and improved public communication. This study examines the combined effects of four key dimensions social media influence, penalty removal, tax sanctions, and payment digitalization on taxpayer compliance behavior. Guided by deterrence theory and digital government frameworks, the research employed a quantitative approach with data collected from 300 respondents using accidental sampling. The data were analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling with the Partial Least Squares (SEM-PLS) method. The results indicate that digital payment systems have a strong, statistically significant positive impact on compliance, highlighting the importance of user-friendly, accessible, and efficient tax payment platforms. In contrast, penalty removal policies exhibit a significant but negative influence, suggesting that leniency may unintentionally weaken tax discipline. Neither tax sanctions nor social media influence yielded a significant direct effect in this study. The findings offer practical insights for public sector decision-makers, digital system designers, and tax policy planners, emphasizing the need for a balanced approach that combines digital service expansion with effective psychological and regulatory strategies to enhance tax compliance in emerging economies."

A dataset of twelve structural parameters was extracted from real garments, and two prompt strategies, non-parameterized and fully parameterized, were used to generate images via the Grok-3 model. Accuracy was assessed using a weighted relative error formula, designed to evaluate the precision of image generation under different strategies of structural input. Results show that including structural parameters in prompts improves generation accuracy from 84.7% to 92.4%. Further analysis identified key parameters for each decade, and simplified prompts containing only these features achieved a high average accuracy of 91.4%. These findings validate the feasibility of using minimal yet meaningful input for historically accurate fashion image generation. The proposed 2.5D digital twin framework provides a scalable and interpretable approach for AI-assisted fashion reconstruction and digital heritage applications."

Data augmentation techniques, including horizontal flipping and brightness adjustment, were applied to enhance model generalization. Hyperparameter tuning was performed using GridSearchCV with 5-fold cross-validation. Experimental results indicate that LSTM outperformed CNN1D, achieving an accuracy of 98.41% compared to 87.73%, demonstrating its superior capability in modeling temporal dependencies in sequential gesture data. Horizontal flipping improved both models’ performance, whereas brightness adjustment adversely affected LSTM accuracy. The findings highlight LSTM’s potential for real-time, high-accuracy SIBI recognition systems, which could significantly reduce communication barriers for the deaf community in Indonesia."

    "abstract": "Facial emotion identification is at the forefront of affective computing, but finding balance between high accuracy and scalability remains challenging. A self-adaptive ensemble framework inspired by reinforcement learning is proposed in this work which is capable of dynamically assigning weight for multiple classifiers for robust facial emotion classification. Deep features take from facial images are used to train multiple base classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random forest and Naïve Bayes) in a distributed manner. The base model’s probabilistic outputs are then fused dynamically by a neural ensemble model that outputs weights for each classifier and is trained using a reinforcement inspired loss value which in cooperates an reward function that maximizes the excepted reward based on the correctness of the ensemble predictions. This approach improves accuracy and robustness by allowing the ensemble to dynamically emphasize the most reliable models. In contrast to the conventional fixed-weight ensembles, the results using the proposed method demonstrates the potential of integrating adaptive decision-level reinforcement learning inspired techniques with feature-level deep representations for next-generation emotion-aware computers. Utilizing the Extended Cohn-Kanade dataset (CK+) and Japanese female facial emotion (JAFFE) dataset, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is assessed. For the CK+ and JAFFE datasets, the accuracy attained across K-fold for the proposed ensemble model is $99.39 \\% \\pm 0.38$ and $99.06 \\% \\pm 1.15$, respectively.

The importance, influence direction, and potential interactions of these features are visually interpreted through bar plots and SHAP summary plots. To address issues of redundancy and noise in the feature selection process, a SHAP-based feature optimization strategy is introduced, which improves computational efficiency while maintaining model accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the rational selection of high-contribution features significantly improves inversion precision, reduces overfitting, and enhances the model's generalization capability on unseen data. This approach not only improves the interpretability of the model but also provides data-driven decision support for pipeline defect detection in engineering practice."

Conventional schematic diagrams have long been used to show power grids; however, these often fail to convey key operational aspects such as segmentation into nominal voltage zones and the directional nature of real power flows. These limitations reduce their effectiveness for grid operators who require clarity for network monitoring and decision-making.

    "abstract": "This study proposes the Geographically Weighted Log-Logistic 3-Parameter Regression (GWLL3R) to analyze stunting prevalence data across 81 districts/cities in Sulawesi Island, utilizing the 2023 dataset obtained from the National Food Agency (BAPANAS). Addressing the limitations of global models in handling spatial heterogeneity and skewed data, the model employs a Fixed Gaussian kernel weighting function. Parameter estimation was conducted using the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) optimized with the Berndt-Hall-Hall-Hausman (BHHH) algorithm. The results demonstrate that the GWLL3R model with an optimum bandwidth of 13.1043 achieves the best fit, yielding the lowest AICc value of 582.2952 compared to other kernel functions. Furthermore, model comparison tests confirm that the spatial model significantly outperforms the global LL3R model. The analysis identified four distinct spatial clusters, with poverty percentage and health worker ratio emerging as the most robust determinants significantly affecting stunting across all locations, while other variables such as education showed localized effects. These quantitative findings validate the GWLL3R’s superiority in capturing location-specific factors, providing a precise basis for targeted regional health interventions."

    "abstract": "The classic methods of training firefighters, which could be delivered in a physical structure or be in the form of stationary extended reality (XR) training, are very restricted in terms of realism, flexibility, as well as in terms of scale. Physical training facilities are highly costly to maintain, non-particularly readily adjustable, and can be hazardous during actual training. In the meantime, the applications of the stationary XR modules are not usually dynamically responsive to the user input and, thus, are not capable of supporting the real-time decision-making or the simulation of the realistic stress. The creation of the first adaptive XR training system specific to the readiness of the firefighters is introduced in the research. It integrates AI-based adaptation of the situation with real-time intervention by the instructor to create a high-fidelity training that reacts to trainees. The system maintains a consistent record of actions, responsiveness, and coordination of a team as trainees deal with the varying fire circumstances, and hence, balances the hazard intensity such as spread of fire, smoke density, and structural support of the edifice. The fact that there is no control in real emergencies can be simulated by instructors interjecting the scenario in real-time in order to alter, introduce new problems or offer suggestions based on their assessment, which can be guided feedback. In order to evaluate the quality of the system, the scientists compared the system with the traditional XR modules regarding the effect on the participants (60) divided equally between the control and experimental groups. Measures such as accuracy of the procedures, time of response to the hazards, consistency of decision making as well as one week retention were used. The results showed that trainees who studied adaptive system were 24 per cent faster, the error rates critical were reduced in 40 per cent and the level of retention was 19 per cent higher than those who studied fixed XR. In addition, there was a high score on the engagements with greater user immersion and the sense of realism. The results validate the adaptive XR as a game changer in educating firefighters and possibilities to scale, differentiate, and introduce a safer learning environment, one which responds to the needs of the real world."

This study explores the use of machine learning algorithms to predict and optimize checkout page performance with an extensive dataset of 7,400 user sessions across 16 behavioral and contextual variables. The research uses five individual classification models that are Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machine, and K-Nearest Neighbors to forecast successful checkout achievement. The results show that Support Vector Machine has the best accuracy of 98.45% with precision and recall scores of 98.80% and 96.69% respectively.

    "abstract": "With the rapid growth in electric vehicle usage, retired electric vehicle batteries (EVBs) create significant recycling demands and safety challenges. Efficient and rapid recycling of EVB is a fundamental requirement for reducing storage costs and ensuring safety and stability. Network design, recognized by scholars as crucial for determining the EVB recycling process, has been extensively studied. However, previous studies rarely explore the impact of timeliness on recycling network design. From a fourth-party logistics perspective, an EVB recycling network design problem is formulated, which explicitly incorporates timeliness constraints to ensure that essential recycling phases are completed within specified durations. To effectively capture strategic network configuration choices and manage operational responses in an uncertain environment, a stochastic two-stage framework has been developed. To solve this model, Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) and sampling average approximation (SAA) are integrated to propose the LHS-SAA method. Numerical experiments and a real-world case illustrate that enforcing timeliness constraints improves recycling rates, lowers expected penalties for uncollected EVBs, and enhances network responsiveness. Based on the experimental analysis of demand uncertainty effects, design guidelines for time-sensitive recycling networks for retired EVB are provided."

Consequently, achieving vibration-suppressed transport requires the simultaneous control of multiple modes.

The proposed trajectory is a finite-time settling function combined with half-odd-integer trigonometric functions. We evaluate the residual vibration of the string using this trajectory through numerical simulations. While the method demonstrates effectiveness in suppressing dual vibration modes simultaneously, its performance depends on the selection of the parameter p, the specific vibration modes targeted, and the operation time."

It is an indispensable part of modern energy systems. System integration and control strategy play important roles in the efficiency, reliability, and economy of the PEMFC-CHP system. Firstly, system architecture analysis is conducted based on application scenarios and operating conditions. Secondly, the membrane humidifier is removed from the air supply subsystem.

Thirdly, the thermal storage tank stores the heat generated by the stack and supplies hot water. Finally, the electrical subsystem and energy management strategy ensure efficient and stable power supply. The results show that the PEMFC-CHP system has good steady-state and transient performance, meeting the electricity and heat needs of residential buildings. Under rated operating conditions, the hydrogen utilization efficiency is 98.66%, the electrical efficiency is 44.72%, the thermal efficiency is 47.90%, and the CHP efficiency is 92.62%.

Existing methods struggle to balance inspection cost reduction, dismantling cost control, and profit maximization, limiting adaptability in complex production environments. To address this, we propose a planning-based multi-stage decision model covering inspection, dismantling, and defective product treatment across pre-production (spare parts screening), in-production (assembly), and post-production (after-sales and recycling). Firstly, an optimized parts inspection scheme based on the binomial distribution and central limit theorem determines the minimum sample size, reducing inspection costs. Then, a simulated annealing algorithm optimizes inspection and dismantling decisions to improve production efficiency. Additionally, a multilayer perceptron enhances decision-making intelligence, while a multi-stage expectation model integrates substandard product recovery. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively reduces inspection costs, enhances profitability, and adapts well to diverse production environments, providing a feasible decision optimization framework for electronic manufacturing enterprises."

First, a 3D node expansion architecture using hierarchical temporal windows enables simultaneous path-temporal optimization through dynamic collision matrices, reducing spatial conflicts by 78–92% compared to single-space planning approaches. Second, our hybrid search algorithm integrates adaptive congestion models with prioritized replanning, achieving 95.3% path efficiency while the auction-based path planning reduces total travel distances by 18–25% compared to random allocation algorithms, through synergistic optimization of movement coordination and temporal sequencing. Finally, the virtual-real synchronization platform establishes a closed-loop verification system demonstrating 93% deadlock reduction in high-density operations through predictive traffic simulations, resolving a critical scalability limitation in existing multi-robot architectures. Validation across 6–20 robot scenarios confirms real-time responsiveness with 2.3s average replanning latency, while enhanced auction mechanisms improve task allocation fairness by 38–65% compared to traditional bidding systems. These innovations collectively advance both theoretical models of spatiotemporal constraints and practical implementations of digital twin verification for industrial automation."

    "abstract": "Bridges are critical components of national infrastructure, enhancing connectivity, supporting economic development, and ensuring access to essential services. Globally, many countries face increasing challenges in managing aging bridge stocks, particularly those constructed during rapid economic growth. In Japan, over 50% of bridges are over 50 years old, with projections indicating that more than 75% will exceed this age within the next two decades. These trends highlight the urgent need for efficient, predictive, and cost-effective maintenance strategies. This study proposes an integrated framework that combines displacement monitoring utilizing digital twin technology based on Building Information Modeling (BIM) and the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) with the aim of improving the lifecycle management of long bridges. BIM enables detailed and data-rich modeling and promotes collaboration between multiple disciplines, while GNSS enables continuous, remote acquisition of high-precision 3D displacement data, enabling real-time structural health assessment. The current implementation supports near-real-time monitoring, future developments will incorporate edge computing and bidirectional feedback to achieve true real-time digital twin synchronization. This framework has been applied to Oshima Bridge (a long-span plate truss bridge) in Yamaguchi Prefecture, which experienced a ship collision accident in 2018. This case demonstrates the value of continuous monitoring in anomaly detection and resilience planning. Rooted in existing technologies, this research provides an operational bridge management model and outlines a path toward complete digital twin system."

Since peel colour of the banana changes rapidly during ripening, this work focuses on colour-based feature extraction supported by accurate fruit segmentation. The proposed approach begins with K-means clustering on the saturation channel, followed by morphological closing and GrabCut refinement to handle common imaging and fruit surface issues like bruises, fungal spots and uneven lighting. After isolating the fruit region, colour features from HSV, LAB and YUV spaces are extracted and used to train machine-learning models for ripeness prediction. Experimental results show that certain colour channels exhibit a strong correlation with ripening stages, leading to more consistent and reliable classification. These results strengthen our claim of the creation of a non-destructive models for estimating banana ripeness, benefiting everyone involved in the supply chain."

However, both face scalability, dynamic adaptability, and policy complexity limitations in heterogeneous and resource-constrained IoT environments. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of access control models for IoT, emphasizing the evolution and integration of hybrid RBAC-ABAC approaches. We critically evaluate recent models, including HyBACRC, HyBACAC, BlendCAC, and DHACS, and analyze them across key dimensions such as scalability, trust, delegation, and policy decision latency. Furthermore, we identify prevailing challenges and propose a forward-looking framework that incorporates emerging technologies-such as machine learning, reinforcement learning, lightweight cryptography, and edge/fog computing-to enhance adaptive security and real-time policy enforcement. Our findings underscore the potential of standardized hybrid access control paradigms as foundational components for future-proof, secure, and intelligent IoT ecosystems."

Recent studies have focused on leveraging output fusion techniques and attention mechanisms to improve segmentation performance using the U-Net architecture. However, challenges remain in fusing segmentation results without information loss, as well as in capturing the relational dependencies between downsampled feature maps of different dimensions. In this paper, we propose Info Fusion Guidance U-Net (IFG-Net), which is a multi-dimensional channel-associated fusion guidance segmentation model. Specifically, in IFG-Net we first design a novel strategy called Entropy preserved Channel info Mixture (ECM) to improve the fusion of output feature maps while optimizing information utilization, which is an adaptive weight generator that preserves information entropy. Furthermore, we propose a novel mechanism called Dimension Scale Attention (DSA), which is capable of capturing long range, cross level dependencies between encoder features of varying dimensions in IFG-Net. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IFG-Net achieves superior segmentation performance across multiple datasets. Compared to the state-of-the-art EDAE-Net, IFG-Net shows improvements in all selected evaluation metrics on the DRIVE, CHASE_DB1, and STARE datasets, which may benefit for the automated diagnosis and treatment of retinal diseases."

The framework is designed to respond in real-time for large-scale geospatial applications. The addition of a Fog layer reduces latency and speeds up processing of data from the data source. This reduces reliance on distant cloud infrastructures and enhances responsiveness for end-users. The significant contribution of the paper is the formal verification of Fog layer, that assures accuracy, consistency and robustness of the model-based analysis. Formal methods are considered in the planning process to make the system more reliable and lower the risk of errors in distributed geospatial applications. A preliminary implementation aimed at Sustainable Development Goal #4 illustrates the applicability of GeoFC-NIRF, demonstrating how the framework improves intelligent educational services, decision-making for both students and policymakers, and advances fair access to geospatial learning resources.

A dedicated test rig was developed, enabling independent control of oil flow rate and rotor speed. Temperature measurements were primarily obtained using a thermal imaging camera, with thermocouples employed for calibration. The corresponding heat transfer coefficients (HTC) were determined under various operating conditions. Results demonstrate that HTC increases rapidly under high oil flow rate conditions, while it remains nearly constant at low flow rates. These findings offer valuable insights into the thermal characteristics of oil-jet cooling and provide practical reference for the design of future cooling systems."

    "abstract": "In response to the growing complexity of cyber threats, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) serve as a foundational pillar for securing digital infrastructures. This literature review analyzes their historical transition from conventional rule-based methods to modern paradigms based on Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), encompassing host-based IDS (HIDS), network-based IDS (NIDS), and hybrid approaches. Major innovations reviewed include detectors using DL techniques, ensemble methods, Federated Learning (FL) techniques, explainable AI (XAI), and the integration of blockchain. The discussion also focuses on model generalizability using benchmark datasets, while pointing out current limitations: managing false positives, detecting zero-day threats, and resilience against adversarial attacks. The conclusion identifies necessary orientations for developing next-generation IDS that are more intelligent, efficient, and interpretable."

    "abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence and healthcare systems for neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease need a responsible and trustworthy framework to ensure fairness, legality, authenticity, and social welfare. This paper proposes a structured AI governance alliance in four categories namely, functional AI, legal AI, ethical AI, and philanthropic AI. These categories are analyzed in terms of their nature, evaluation metrics, and impact on healthcare stakeholders. Moreover, five essential parameters are discussed for implementation of Responsible <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$A I$</tex> in Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. These parameters are fairness and bias mitigation, transparency, explainability, security and safety, and human-centered design. The different challenges to achieve the task are data bias, model interpretability, patient data security, and alignment with clinical workflows. These issues are categorized in practical challenge in which a small dataset is used to train the black-box nature of deep learning, and adversarial challenges. The possible solutions are diverse dataset curation, explainability tools, and robust monitoring systems. Furthermore, this paper presents measurable metrics such as accuracy disparity across subgroups, decision-making ability of model, clinical comprehension rates, and community feedback, used to enable consistent and transparent evaluation of each Responsible AI component. The ethical compliance is emphasized without compromising functionality or efficiency. The presented framework aims to develop the AI models that are transparent, secure, and socially aligned, along with high accuracy, for responsible Alzheimer's disease detection and diagnosis."

    "abstract": "The fast digitalisation of the education sector has produced tremendous amounts of heterogeneous data in online learning sources, including click stream logs and discussion forum activity, biometric data, and audio-visual signals. Traditional learning analytics dashboards often fail to utilise the richness of multimodal data, typically displaying delayed, disaggregated, and static information that cannot support timely interventions or provide helpful feedback. These constraints limit educators to the whole learning experience and prevent students from receiving practical advice, particularly in large and diverse learning settings. To fill this gap, we recommend Big Data Visualisation Using Multimodal Learning Feedback Analysis (BDV-MFLA). This advanced framework integrates multimodal data streams into a single, real-time, adaptive visualisation ecosystem. The system utilises deep multimodal fusion models to process textual, behavioural, and physiological inputs, leveraging large-scale data pipelines that offer scalability and low latency. The knowledge is translated into interactive visual dashboards that enable educators to identify engagement levels, predict performance, and offer individualised feedback in real-time. The framework was tested on three large-scale educational datasets comprising over $\\mathbf{1 5, 0 0 0}$ learners across multiple domains. It achieved predictive accuracy of $87.4 \\%$, precision of $89.2 \\%$, recall of $85.7 \\%$, and an $\\mathbf{F 1}$-score of 86.5, which is better than current dashboards by more than $15 \\%$ in all three measures. ANOVA and paired t-tests accepted the value of these improvements as statistically accurate ($\\mathbf{p}\\lt $ 0.05). In addition, six-month longitudinal research studies found that engagement and academic persistence among students with BDV-MFLA feedback remained $\\mathbf{1 2 \\%}$ higher than those of controls. The key value of the study is to integrate the representation of big data with multimodal learning feedback to build an intelligent and scalable, adaptable analytics system capable of not only enhancing the interpretability of the analysis but also influencing the behaviour of students over time and positively impacting their performance."

    "abstract": "This study investigates the performance variations of deep learning classification models by combining GAN-generated images and adversarially perturbed data using the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) on the MNIST dataset. First, a ResNet-18 model trained on the original MNIST dataset achieved a test accuracy of 98.87%, but its performance significantly dropped to 51.59% under FGSM attacks with <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}= 0.2$</tex> [1]. Next, when trained on a mixed dataset that included GAN-generated images, the model's test accuracy improved to 99.15%; however, its accuracy further decreased to 35.18% when FGSM attacks were applied to the generated images. These results indicate that although data augmentation with GAN-generated samples can enhance general classification performance, it may also exacerbate the model's susceptibility to adversarial perturbations [2]. Therefore, future deep learning frameworks that rely on generated data should incorporate robustness-enhancing defense mechanisms to mitigate adversarial vulnerabilities [3]. By quantitatively analyzing the interaction between GAN-generated data and adversarial perturbations, this study provides foundational insights for developing data augmentation and defense strategies aimed at building robust and reliable artificial intelligence systems."

    "abstract": "In the field of deep learning, traditional attention mechanisms face significant challenges related to high computational complexity and large memory consumption when processing long sequence data. To address these limitations, we propose Opt-GPTQ, an optimized Gradient-based Post Training Quantization (GPTQ) combining the Grouped Query Attention (GQA) mechanism with paging memory management, optimizing the traditional Multi-Head Attention (MHA) mechanism by grouping query heads and sharing key-value vectors. Optimized GQA (Opt-GQA) effectively reduces computational complexity, minimizes memory fragmentation, and enhances memory utilization for large-scale models. Opt-GPTQ is optimized for Data Center Units (DCUs) and integrated into the vLLM model to maximize hardware efficiency. It customizes GPU kernels to further enhance attention computation by reducing memory access latency and boosting parallel computing capabilities. Opt-GQA integrates Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi) to reduce overhead and enhance long-sequence processing. Experimental results show that Opt-GPTQ significantly reduces computation time and memory usage while improving model performance."

    "abstract": "Fifth-and sixth-generation (5G/6G) wireless systems demand robust spectrum awareness and adaptive waveform control, where Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) plays a pivotal role in enabling cognitive radio, interference mitigation, and non-cooperative signal identification. However, existing AMC approaches, particularly deep learning-based methods, often rely on synthetic benchmarks that fail to capture real-world complexities such as Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) effects, hardware impairments, and variable framing. This paper identifies these simulation-to-real gaps and proposes a lightweight Convolutional Block Attention Module– Transformer (CBAM–T) architecture that fuses multi-view representations—I/Q with phase pre-correction, amplitude–phase, and short-time spectrum—through attention mechanisms and a compact temporal Transformer. Using a MATLAB-generated dataset with realistic impairments, we achieve an average accuracy of 70.47% for CBAM-T, comparable to CNN-T (70.47%) and MCMBNN-T (71.07%), while maintaining low complexity (500K parameters) for edge deployment. The solution enhances robustness at mid-to-low SNRs and clarifies boundaries among high-order Quadrature Amplitude Modulations (QAMs). We provide a detailed training recipe, deployment guidelines, and actionable inferences."

A frontend multi-sensor fusion architecture is introduced to address challenges caused by irregular obstacles. LiDAR is the primary perception sensor, while an RGB-D camera provides complementary visual and depth information. The fusion core integrates semantic perception and depth refinement: semantic segmentation is applied to RGB images to generate binary and human-region masks projected onto the corresponding depth images. The refined depth maps are downsampled and aligned with LiDAR data to produce pseudo-LiDAR representations, capturing essential spatial features beyond LiDAR's vertical field of view. These fused observations are then fed into a decisionmaking network. Furthermore, to enable dynamic obstacle avoidance under partial observability without relying on a global prior map, a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is incorporated into the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) framework, allowing temporal information encoding across sequential observations. Extensive experiments conducted in both simulated and realworld environments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization capability of the proposed approach, achieving robust performance in scenarios with irregular and dynamic obstacles."

Analysis reveals that GFL control exhibits strong stability under strong grid but weak stability under weak grids, while GFM control demonstrates the opposite stability characteristics. Leveraging this complementarity, the method dynamically switches control modes based on grid strength to suppress oscillation. To address power transients and waveform distortion during switching process, a seamless strategy is developed by analyzing control dominance under different time scales and implementing reference signal inheritance. Simulation results demonstrate that the approach significantly improves wind turbine adaptability to wide grid strength ranges, effectively suppresses oscillations, and eliminates power shocks during the process, enhancing equipment safety and power quality."

This study proposes a machine learning framework to estimate Time-To-Failure (TTF) during sustained isometric contraction using surface electromyography (sEMG) signals. Raw EMG signals were segmented into sliding windows and transformed into physiologically relevant features across time, frequency, and nonlinear domains. Four regression models—Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Neural Network (NN), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Random Forest (RF) were trained and evaluated on their ability to predict remaining TTF in real-time. The results show that GPR outperformed other models with the lowest Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) (4.75 s), highest R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> (0.92), and a relatively unbiased residual distribution. Residual analysis revealed consistent underestimation by SVR and RF, while GPR maintained symmetric residuals across fatigue stages. Statistical comparisons using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test confirmed significant differences (p < 0.05) between most model pairs, establishing the superiority of GPR over both conventional and ensemble-based approaches. The proposed framework enables interpretable and continuous fatigue estimation using minimal sensor input, highlighting its applicability in ergonomics, neurorehabilitation, and sports science. Unlike previous studies limited to fatigue classification, this regression-based TTF prediction offers finer granularity and real-time deployability, especially when integrated into wearable EMG systems. Future work will extend this approach to dynamic tasks, subject-independent generalization, and feature-level fusion with neuromechanical variables to enhance robustness and clinical translation."

For a 10% step load perturbation (SLP), the analysis is initiated, and at the same instance, to reveal the TIDF efficacy, the comparative study is made with the other controllers in literature. Later, the DADSPS is incorporated with the supplementary control technique, and the analysis is performed under the proposed secondary control of IFFA-tuned TIDF. The superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) is injected in the control areas, and the tie-line is penetrated with the Thyristor-controlled phase shifter (TCPS) to get the DADSPS stability improvement. The simulation work demonstrated the significance of employing the SMESTCPS in getting the dynamic stability enhancement. At last, the DADSPS, under the supervision of secondary and the adopted supplementary technique, is subjected to load deviations, and the analysis confirmed the ability of the suggested control mechanisms in ensuring the system’s stability even under unexpected load fluctuations."

Our system augments bisect traversal with structured chain-of-thought reasoning, enabling commit-by-commit analysis under noisy conditions. We evaluate multiple open-source and proprietary LLMs for their suitability, and fine-tune DeepSeek- Coder-V2 using QLoRA on a curated dataset of semantically labeled diffs. We adopt a weak-supervision workflow to reduce annotation overhead, incorporating human-in-the-loop corrections and self-consistency filtering. Experiments across multiple open- source projects show a 6.4-point absolute gain in success rate (from 74.2% to 80.6%), leading to significantly fewer failed traversals and—by experiment—up to 2x reduction in average bisect time. We conclude with discussions on temporal reasoning, prompt design, and fine-tuning strategies tailored for commit-level behavior analysis."

The theory of an electric dipole moment is used to characterize the symbol constellation for MAPSK as an analogy. Each symbol is treated as an electric charge in the configuration. The law of equilibrium is then applied on the moment of force of the inner ring and the outer ring to compute the radius ring-ratio. Since there are M points on the constellation, the amount of variance, $\\sigma^{2}$ among the symbols is estimated through conventional biased variance estimated from a sample population as $\\sigma^{2}=\\frac{M}{M-1}$. Validation tests for different ring-ratios for the radii are carried out through the analysis of symbol error rate (SER). The two-ring constellation is implemented as a toroid for 8-, 16- and 32-APSK under Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel. Applications for higher order PSK is found in Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB- S2) with M = 8 and Single-Carrier Frequency Division Multiple Access (SC-FDMA) in Long-Term Evolution (LTE) with $M=16$. Visible Light Communication (VLC) is another candidate for APSK system.

Evaluations on CIFAR-10 revealed clear privacy-utility trade-offs: stronger privacy mechanisms progressively reduced accuracy while improving protection. Our sequential approach outperformed simultaneous application in learning stability, while HE demonstrated superior resilience to data heterogeneity compared to hybrid methods under non-IID conditions.

Automated classification of fundus images, however, is challenging due to heterogeneous disease patterns, class imbalance, and limited availability of annotated datasets. To address these issues, we propose SEE-FuseNet, a Stage-Enhanced Multi-Level Feature Fusion framework for robust eye disease classification. The architecture employs EfficientNet-B4 as the backbone for hierarchical feature extraction, while a novel Multi-Level Feature Fusion (MLFF) module—comprising Stage Enhancers, Lateral Reduce, Fuse Mix, and Unify Channel operations—refines and harmonizes multi-scale representations. The fused features are further enhanced using a Transformer encoder and an MLP classifier to capture global dependencies and improve discriminative power across ten eye disease categories. Extensive experiments were conducted on both original and augmented datasets to compare SEE-FuseNet against several baseline backbones. Among the baselines, EfficientNet-B4 consistently demonstrated superior performance, validating its effectiveness as the backbone choice. SEE-FuseNet further improved upon this, achieving 0.9003 accuracy, 0.9015 F1 Score, and 0.8897 MCC on the augmented dataset, and 0.8091 accuracy on the original dataset. These results confirm that SEE-FuseNet effectively integrates spatial and semantic features with global contextual information, achieving superior robustness and generalization for automated eye disease classification."

Changes to visual content on Deepfakes can spread false information, violate privacy, and make people less likely to believe proof. The growth of deepfakes is due to the wider availability of generative models, such as autoencoders and GANs.

This work proposes a GRU-CNN hybrid deep learning framework that integrates multimodal medical imaging with clinical data to classify AD’s progression. EfficientNet-B7 and 3D CNNs are employed for spatial feature extraction from 2D and volumetric scans, respectively, while Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) capture temporal dependencies from longitudinal data. Attention-enhanced CNN modules further refine feature selection. A Softmax-based multi-class classification approach outputs stage probabilities, with performance evaluated using AUC, accuracy, F1-Score, precision and recall. Results demonstrate the model’s robustness and potential for clinical integration in aiding early AD diagnosis and progression tracking."

    "abstract": "Assessing exercise capacity is essential for man-aging chronic diseases like heart failure. Traditional methods, such as cardiopulmonary exercise testing, are accurate but confined to specialized settings. Recent advancements in wear-able technologies provide new opportunities for remote and continuous health monitoring. This study introduces a dual-modality smart shoe system integrating inertial and pressure sensors, designed for health assessment during the six-minute walk test. In a primary study involving 18 heart failure patients, we validated the system’s accuracy in estimating the six-minute walk distance (6MWD) using a drift-resistant foot orientation-based turn detection algorithm. The proposed system achieved a mean error of 1.36 ± 3.21 meters for 6MWD estimation. Additionally, novel plantar pressure features were developed to assess left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), a critical cardiac function indicator. Incorporating these features into a machine learning framework achieved 2.65% mean absolute error and 3.11% standard deviation error in leave-one-out cross-validation. This study demonstrates the feasibility of dual-modality smart shoes for accurate 6MWD estimation and preliminary LVEF evaluation in heart failure patients. Future research should explore the clinical scalability of this approach in larger, multi-center studies."

To treat a patient with most appropriate drug on the basis of physiological and biochemical patterns suggesting a drug or classifying them are considered most critical. In this study, we classify the drugs on the basis of specific problem which can reduce the human efforts and increase the efficiency. A structured dataset of 5000 entries was used; data was preprocessed and analyzed in order to classify the appropriate the drugs. The contribution of this work is state-of-the-art in drug classification records. Personalized medicines are depending mostly on data-driven decision support systems. In this work variety of traditional machine learning models are compared to see what model performs well on the classification based data and patient level data.

In the present era, cybercriminals provide a wide range of strategies to access confidential data. With the growth of the Internet, new threats emerge -mainly viruses and worms. Most, however, exploit vulnerabilities as are exposed in discussions regarding a variety of approaches such as password-cracking and interception of unencrypted data. Thus, security measures are effected to prevent systems from unauthorized access. Firewall technology is the most popular type of the defense mechanism to try to protect private networks from other types of attacks on the outsideIDS plays a significant role in network security, healthcare applications, credit card fraud detection, and insurance sectors. The main goal of research to be conducted within this study is a comparative analysis of DDoS detection, based on the different machine learning and deep learning models described above. Some machine learning approaches, including Random Forest (RF), SVM, and Gradient Boosting (GB), are used to develop IDS with realtime datasets such as DDoS attack detection set and the UNSW datasets for attacker networks. Gradient Boosting, which is an effective classification algorithm that performs complex interactions of multiple independent variables in relation to one or several categorical target classes, mostly is the choice behind this approach. In this approach, decision nodes are assigned adaptive weights, with greater weight assigned to the attributes that highly influence a given node, whereas less impactful features exert little influence on the prediction outcomes. The accuracy and performance evaluation metrics will be the basis for validation of the proposed system, implemented in Python."

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, grid-tied solar photovoltaic (SPV) system integration has grown significantly, aiding in the global shift to renewable energy, which results in the requirement that utility operators update grid codes to maintain the grid’s quality and dependability. Several different flexible power point tracking (FPPT) techniques have been put forth in different works of literature. Enabling grid-tied solar systems to function adaptively under changing irradiance and load conditions is the main goal of the FPPT algorithm. This ensures optimal energy consumption while adhering to grid support standards. Variations from the maximum power point (MPP) could result from this interference, reducing the efficiency of the PV system. In spite of that, FPPT makes PV systems more grid-friendly and reliable. There are major technological issues brought about by the growing integration of PV generation into traditional power networks. Excessive power injection under high solar irradiation can cause unanticipated overloading and a spike in voltage in the distribution network, which could result in sensitive electrical equipment malfunctioning or being damaged. The simulation analysis presented in this paper aims at analyzing the impact of grid-tied SPV panels by evaluating the system’s overall performance in varying load and irradiation scenarios under two techniques, i.e., PV Voltage Control and Current Limiting Control (CLC) of Power Limiting Control (PLC) strategy. The study explores scenarios based on these variations and discusses their implications in detail."

    "abstract": "In the sensorless control system of permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSM), the traditional sliding mode observer (SMO) exhibits significant estimation errors. To improve the accuracy of rotor position observation, a fast super-twisting sliding mode observer (FST-SMO) based on hill climbing method for position error compensation is proposed. First, an FST-SMO based on the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">d-q</i> coordinate system is designed using an improved fast super-twisting algorithm, which enables the estimation of rotor speed and position while reducing chattering and ripples in the estimated back electromotive force (EMF). Second, to eliminate phase fluctuations and drifts in the observed position angle, a phase-locked loop (PLL) is constructed to extract estimation information, avoiding the use of low-pass filters and the reconstruction of position errors, thereby enhancing dynamic performance and observation accuracy. In response to non-ideal factors such as control delays, installation errors, and parameter variations, an intelligent hill climbing control method is employed to optimize and compensate for the observed error angle, further improving observation accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that this method achieves accurate speed and rotor position observation with excellent performance."

    "abstract": "Driveability is a key criterion for vehicular longitudinal motion control. Traditional adaptive cruise control (ACC) systems employ separate speed and range control, which injects unnecessary disturbances when switching between the strategies thus degrades the driveability significantly. This paper proposes a unified manifold-based architecture that integrates two key concepts: d-field control, which generates a control action based on the state’s distance to kernel function, and a-field control, a nonlinear kinematic accelerating/braking strategy. By unifying these approaches into a single continuous control law, the proposed manifold-based ACC (mACC) eliminates the switching. This not only enhances the single-vehicle driveability but also provides an intrinsic mechanism for alleviating platoon-level disturbances. System stability is formally proven using the Lyapunov principle, and a novel phase-portrait analysis offers a holistic assessment of global performance. Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) testing further validates the controller’s superior performance as well as the real-time feasibility. This work therefore establishes a foundation of developing an unified control strategy for the robust and stable multi-vehicle systems."

    "abstract": "Surgical lasers are becoming increasingly prevalent in minimally invasive procedures, as laser fibers are thin and flexible, allowing for precise targeting. The use of surgical lasers spans tissue manipulation, energy delivery (in laser interstitial thermal therapy), imaging (optical coherence tomography), and tumor identification. There are two primary methods for steering surgical lasers: fiber steering and free-beam steering using galvanometers. In practice, however, lasers must first traverse through complex anatomical structures, then the laser must be steered with high precision while the tool body avoids critical anatomy. In this paper, we develop a steerable surgical tool that combines both fiber and free-beam steering, the Tendon-Actuated Galvanometer Robot (TAGR). The proposed ball-chain (BC) robot can bend in 3D space, then utilizes a 2-DoF tendon-actuated galvanometer (TAG) at the end-effector to steer the laser on a surface while the robot body is static. Both BC kinematics and 2-DoF TAG laser kinematics models are presented and validated. Closed-loop PID control is implemented in both robot and laser steering, resulting in RMSE values of less than 2.5 mm and 3.7 mm for independent and hybrid steering, respectively. The novel hybrid laser steering system is then demonstrated within a phantom rib-cage model to showcase how novel hybrid laser steering can impact minimally invasive laser surgery."

The IK solution emerges as the equilibrium of this system, corresponding to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of the original problem. To ensure the stability of the discrete-time forward simulation, we adopt the passive midpoint integrator (PMI) [1], which enforces a discrete-time passivity. This allows the proposed method to converge to an equilibrium without the need for line search. The resulting solver is lightweight, scalable, and suitable for real-time inverse kinematics computation in high-degree-of-freedom (DOF) systems, while satisfying joint limits, obstacle avoidance, and other task-specific constraints. The efficacy of the algorithm is validated and demonstrated through extensive simulations on various robotic platforms."

Experimental results on the IEEE-33 bus system demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a 12.4% improvement in cost reduction compared with traditional forecasting methods. Furthermore, the proposed approach significantly improves training efficiency compared with other decision-focused baselines.

    "abstract": "The rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) is a critical metric of power system frequency security. Post contingency nodal RoCoFs are not identical across a power system, with spatial characteristic significantly related to the fault size/location, network connections and parameters, as well as the system's inertia distribution state. However, most traditional security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) strategies typically rely on aggregated frequency models, lacking necessary granularity to differentiate disparities among nodal RoCoFs. Consequently, certain generators may suffer from extremely large RoCoFs, potentially triggering unexpected pole slip protection and trip operations, even if the system's RoCoF estimated by an aggregated model remains within the allowable range. To address this issue, a nodal RoCoF security constrained unit commitment is proposed considering N-1 contingencies of any single generator trip in this letter. First, unified boundary conditions of generators are established to depict their disparate inertia response behaviors in online/offline states. Then, nodal RoCoF security constraints are further derived and embedded into an optimization problem for SCUC scheduling. Following the proposed SCUC strategy, nodal RoCoF security can always be guaranteed in any single generator trip contingencies, which is further verified by simulation results of the South East Australia Power System in different scenarios."

Our findings highlight the need for platform-level support and coordination between computing and networking components to achieve transparent, efficient, and secure service continuity at the serverless-operated edge.

Traffic signs situated far away occupy only a few pixels in the images captured by the cameras of the autonomous vehicle, which presents a challenge for TSR methods to give accurate and reliable results. In this paper, we propose a panoramic active visual system (PAVS) for distant traffic signs recognition. It combines the advantages of the active pan-tilt-zoom(PTZ) camera for long-distance viewing and the advantage of the panoramic camera to have a large field of view. The traffic signs will be preliminarily detected and tracked in the panoramic image and the objects with confidence lower than the threshold will be further detected by the active PTZ camera to get more reliable results. The proposed PAVS are tested with different state-of-the-art (SoTA) TSR networks in real traffic scenes and the experimental results show that, compared to the passive visual system, the performances of the proposed PAVS improve 8.5% in F1-score, 5.3% in mAP, and 60.2% in mean first detection distance (mFD) in traffic sign recognition tasks."

    "abstract": "Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) has emerged as a cornerstone technology in intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and autonomous robots, finding widespread applications in various scenarios and multiple platforms autonomous driving tasks. However, in environments with weak textures and motion blur, achieving efficient and robust visual-inertial SLAM remains challenging. Current research utilizes line features to enhance SLAM performance in such environments, but incurs difficulties in line extraction, structured scene representation, and computational overheads involved in joint optimization. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel SLAM framework with both high pose estimation accuracy and high back-end computational efficiency. Firstly, an intelligent spatial line integration method is proposed to effectively reduce data redundancy in joint optimization by leveraging the remarkable stability of long line segments in structured scenes, thereby enhancing the spatial consistency of structural lines. Secondly, to combat low-light and high-speed motion environments, an optical flow tracking accuracy verification method is designed to bolster the system’s tracking performance and robustness in complex scenarios. Finally, to relieve the substantial computational overhead arising from high-dimensional optimization parameters in bundle adjustment (BA), a multi-mechanism marginalization strategy is presented to enhance the accuracy and computational efficiency of BA, while also preventing scale explosion. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art algorithms on both the EuRoC MAV and TUM VI benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves localization accuracy and joint optimization efficiency."

    "abstract": "Bushfire detection using satellite imagery plays a critical role in mitigating ecological and economic damage. Traditional deep learning models perform well on specific satellite data but often fail when applied to imagery from different satellites due to differences in resolution, spectral bands, and calibration. This study addresses these cross-sensor challenges by proposing a supervised domain adaptation framework based on Deep CORrelation ALignment (Deep CORAL). A lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained on Landsat-8 imagery and adapted to Sentinel-2 data by jointly optimizing source classification loss, CORAL alignment loss, and supervised classification loss on labeled target samples. Results show that baseline model performs poorly on Sentinel-2 (fire-class F1-score = 55%, overall accuracy = 49%), while the domain-adapted model achieves a F1-score of 97% and overall accuracy of 97% in initial experiments. Further experiments across six spectral band combinations revealed that SWIR inclusion enhances cross-domain performance, with R-G-B-NIR-SWIR achieving 99.29% accuracy and 99.30% F1-score on target domain. Analysis of feature distances and PCA plots demonstrates that the latent representations are well aligned across sensors. A comparison with previous studies also confirms the superiority in performance for our proposed method. The proposed framework significantly improves cross-sensor generalization, leverages labeled data from both domains, and provides a scalable, near-real-time solution for large-scale bushfire monitoring using heterogeneous satellite sources."

    "abstract": "Mega-constellations of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites are envisioned to deliver global broadband and direct-to-cell services, requiring seamless handovers (HOs) to ensure uninterrupted connectivity. Conventional break-before-make HO protocols, although supported by inter-satellite links, suffer from beamforming delays due to the high orbital velocities of LEO satellites. To address these limitations, we propose an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)-assisted HO (ISAC-HO) protocol that enables make-before-break HOs via ISAC-enabled ground terminals (GTs). A novel ISAC design capable of generating a three-dimensional (3D) beampattern under realistic conditions allows GTs to sense approaching LEO satellites without significantly compromising communication with the currently serving LEO satellite. The design problem is highly challenging due to its non-convexity and mixed-integer nature. To tackle these challenges, we propose an approach that leverages Riemannian manifold optimization and closed-form solutions. For multi-GT scenarios, we introduce a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning framework that mitigates sensing collisions and ensures quality-of-service under shared spectrum constraints. Numerical results confirm that the proposed ISAC design significantly improves the communication–sensing trade-off, enables smooth HO, and remains robust in the presence of imperfect channel state information."

We identify two fundamental issues necessitating such extensive labels: (1) <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">insufficient image diversity</i>, where high within-class similarity in synthetic images requires extensive augmentation, and (2) <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">insufficient supervision diversity</i>, where limited variety in supervisory signals during training leads to performance degradation at high compression rates.

    "abstract": "Helically corrugated waveguides are critical components in many high-power microwave systems. However, theoretical analysis of their dispersion characteristics within the overmoded regime—essential for developing devices operating at high frequencies (terahertz band) or handling high power (megawatt level and beyond)—remains challenging for conventional two-mode coupling dispersion models. To address this limitation, a comprehensive multimode coupling dispersion model is developed, based on a generalized dispersion equation derived from vectorial coupled-wave equations that simultaneously account for interactions between an operating mode and multiple companion modes. The model is then applied to a fivefold helically corrugated cylindrical waveguide operating in a high-order mode. Within the target dispersion region, the multimode predictions show excellent agreement with full-wave simulations and experimental measurements, establishing the model’s validity in capturing the dispersion behavior that the two-mode model fails to reproduce. Furthermore, multimode dispersion analysis of an overmoded helically corrugated coaxial waveguide derived from the fivefold cylindrical prototype demonstrates that compressing multiple strong couplings into a narrow frequency band produces a single, sharp dispersion curve inflection. This strategy effectively overcomes the traditional “sparse mode spectrum” constraint, producing a superior monotonic group velocity profile over a wide bandwidth that significantly outperforms the original cylindrical structure. The proposed model provides both theoretical insight and a practical design tool for developing next-generation high-power microwave devices that employ overmoded helically corrugated waveguides."

    "abstract": "For firms committed to environmentally friendly (green) innovation, the launch strategy—particularly the choice of timing and product portfolio—critically affects both market opportunities and reliability risks. We develop a two-period model to examine how early launch decisions, mixed-product strategies, and proactive regulatory compliance interact under potential recalls. Our findings indicate that early launch is viable only when sufficient reliability is ensured, and that retaining mature products mitigates recall-related losses through a “risk-sharing effect”. Additionally, contrary to the traditional view that government regulation acts as a constraint, our study reveals that the “reliability assurance” aspect of government regulation can actually incentivise the firm to launch green innovative products earlier. Furthermore, the extension not only confirms the robustness of our model but also constructively suggests that strategic partial market withdrawal can internally motivate a firm's green innovation. These insights provide both theoretical and practical guidance for designing green product launch strategies that balance speed, performance, and risk."

    "abstract": "As a kind of low-dimensional visual structural feature, edge helps to highlight the basic information of the image, playing the key role in the pre-processing of subsequent advanced visual tasks. Edge detection models with VGG16 as the basic framework can achieve excellent performance through transfer learning, but such models suffer from problems such as large number of parameters and high computational costs. To address the challenge of the coexistence of accuracy and lightweight, an edge detection network inspired by the characteristics of biological visual receptive fields (BVRF-Net) was proposed in the paper. In the Global Pathway, the ON/OFF type convolution kernel was constructed by simulating the ganglionic ON/OFF centroid type receptive field, initializing the convolution kernel by pixel difference value. Meanwhile, simulating the sparse suppression property of complex neurons, the sparse surround suppression convolution kernel with center periphery adjustment was constructed to suppress the texture noise. In the Local Pathway, the asymmetric orientation selectivity convolution kernel was constructed by simulating the orientation selectivity and asymmetric surround suppression characteristics of primary visual cortex neurons, which helps to quickly optimize the orientation features and enhance the contrast features by giving the convolution kernel a priori knowledge, achieving the precise extraction of local detail features. Taking BSDS500 dataset, NYUD-v2 dataset and Multicue dataset as experimental objects, BVRF-Net can achieve competitive results with only 0.358M parameters required. The excellent performance proves the effectiveness of incorporating bio-vision characteristics to construct neural network models, promoting the development of biomimetic computational vision."

Most box-wing satellite targets are equipped with symmetrical solar pannels. Their repetitive textures and visual ambiguity pose significant challenges for local feature detectors, which is the foundation of downstream perception tasks. Additionally, constraints of computational resources remain persistent issues in this field. To address these challenges, a cascaded symmetry-aware network for component segmentation of satellites is proposed to provide semantic contexual information for local descriptor. Specifically, a two-stage learning strategy which mimics human intuition by inferring symmetric regions from asymmetric regions. To enhance regional awareness, a contrastive learning based auxiliary module is designed, enabling the network to learn spatial relationships and distinctive boundaries across images. The predicted symmetric component information is inserted to the discription vector to improve the feature matching result on box-wing satellites. In comparative experiments and application validation, our method demonstrated superior symmetry recognition capability across different targets and viewing angles and significantly improved the stability and accuracy of the 3D reconstruction."

While current fall detection systems are mostly reactive, only acting to respond to events after they have occurred, proactive prediction strategies are necessary. In this research, an innovative fall prediction system is introduced based on the integration of inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors and vital monitoring technologies to predict and mitigate fall risks. The IMU placed on the foot tracks gait and movement patterns, and the wrist-worn device monitors health metrics like heart rate and oxygen saturation. The system uses a two-stage predictive framework that first analyzes data from IMU sensors and vital monitors independently to detect anomalies and combines these results using Multimodal Fall Prediction Algorithm (MFPA) to enhance accuracy. Users receive timely warnings and are alerted in real time, using a smart stick with an actuator that alerts users before they fall. The proposed system, with an accuracy of 95.2% using GRU for vitals and an accuracy of 99% using GRU for IMU, shows that integrating biomechanical and physiological data strongly improves the accuracy and reliability of fall risk prediction."

This paper presented an AI-driven approach for metadata-agnostic classification of encryption techniques applied to Regions of Interest (ROIs).

ROIs were encrypted with three chaotic map–based methods: (i) AES with Logistic Map permutation, (ii) Arnold Cat Map with Sine Map scrambling, and (iii) Sine Map with Logistic Map modification. The resulting dataset of encrypted ROIs was then used to train multiple Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), including ResNet18, VGG11, and EfficientNet-B0. Experimental results demonstrated high accuracy in distinguishing encryption techniques, validating the feasibility of AI-assisted cipher classification. The proposed framework enhanced privacy-preserving medical image communication in scenarios where metadata was unavailable or unreliable, bridging AI, cybersecurity, and healthcare."

Small improvements in digital analysis can significantly impact decision-making processes, especially in profit-driven fields like business, by helping identify trends. One feature increasingly examined is skin tone, used in medical diagnostics and personalized services like recommendation systems on e-commerce platforms. To perform effective digital analyses, various intelligent models are used. However, selecting the right model is critical due to the need for accuracy and the challenges posed by the dataset. Therefore, this study compares the performance of machine learning and deep learning models (SVM, CNN, SwinTransformer T) on a single classification task using RGB and HSV color analysis methods, providing guidance for choosing suitable models and techniques for skin tone classification. Results indicate that deep learning models perform better, with the SwinTransformer based on SwinT achieving a good recall rate (0.70). Although the HSV technique is more consistent in class separation, with a macro average score of 0.94, the RGB method excels at selecting target cases. This advantage is especially evident when facial features such as hair, eyes, and brows are removed, resulting in an over 33.57% improvement in model performance (RGB-Swin average score across four measures, estimated with a relative improvement formula)."

    "abstract": "The rapid pace of growth in online learning environments has made it more difficult for learners to find courses that are tailored to their individual learning needs and goals. Typically, recommender systems rely on centralized data processing, which raises considerable concerns around user privacy and the heterogeneity of user data. This research presents a hybrid recommender system with Federated Learning (FL) characteristics to provide personalized recommendations to users while protecting their data. The recommender system creates four primary recommendation frameworks: Content-Based Filtering (CBF); Popularity-Based; Collaborative Filtering (simulated); and a novel Federated Learning approach that hybridizes on the three other recommended/first ranked approach, whose performance is evaluated with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter that provides real-time recommendations to chosen users and comparisons amongst the four recommended approaches using multiple performance measures. The assessment of the systems' efficacy used seven typical evaluation metrics: Hit Rate, Precision@5, Recall@5, F1@5, Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG@5), and Coverage. The bar charts demonstrated that while the Popularity-Based recommendation approach had the highest hit rate respectively and highest precision, it had very low coverage of recommending courses to learners. On the other hand, the Federated Learning-based approach produced a comparable hit rate and precision, while also achieving comparable F1 scores and coverage (86 %). This study emphasized the benefits and practicality of using Federated Learning to build contextually scalable, safe, and effective course recommender systems, and further emphasized the benefits of combining or hybridizing the two approaches for maximum robustness and quality of recommendations, especially for the educationallyfocused digital sphere."

    "abstract": "The runaway development of Industry 4.0 has brought very interconnected, intelligent, and automated production systems in place, but conventional robotics based on rules cannot react to dynamic production conditions, unpredictable working processes, and real-time disruptions, which tend to result in lower efficiency, time delays, and bottlenecks in the work process. Among common challenges faced by factories are inefficiencies in task allocation, the absence of collaborative coordination among robots, poor predictive maintenance, and vulnerabilities in data exchange during interactions. To address those issues, this research proposes AI-Powered Multi-Agent Collaborative Robotic System (AI-MACROS), a highly sophisticated industrial automation system integrating swarm intelligence, reinforcement learning, digital twin simulation, and blockchain-based security. AI-MACROS allows teams of robotic agents to work together, learn dynamically based on environmental interactions, optimize task distribution and deal with unexpected events in the real world. Through digital twins, it provides virtual replicas of robots and work processes, with which to monitor the system in real time, preemptive maintenance and simulate scenarios without disrupting the existing processes. Also, blockchain protocols guarantee integrity and safety of communication and data across the industrial network. Compared to a typical rulebased robotics, one may observe that AI-MACROS is executed by the high performance score (i.e. higher efficiency, accuracy, recall, and F1-scores), and the coordination and energy efficiency is additionally simplified with the help of particle swarm optimization, genetic algorithms and deep reinforcement learning. The proposed solution addresses the disadvantages of the traditional automation, making the operations more resilient in addition to improving the security and scale, not mentioning that it is deemed as not only a potential game changer but also as a next-generation smart factory solution. In a clever synergy, predictive analytics and safe decentralized information processing, AI-MACROS creates high-performance prototype of adaptable, fruitful and credible automation of production under realistic production scenarios."

    "abstract": "Edge machine learning demands lightweight representations to balance accuracy with computational efficiency on resource-constrained devices. Quantization from 32-bit floating-point (FP32) to 4-bit integer (INT4) is key, but stochastic rounding (SR), which introduces randomness to reduce error accumulation, remains computationally expensive without dedicated hardware. This work introduces a compact RISC-V custom instruction extension for hardware-accelerated FP32→INT4 conversion with SR. Integrated into the PicoRV32 core via the PCPI coprocessor interface, it uses a lightweight Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) for randomness, avoiding the overhead of a full floating-point unit. Evaluated on cycle counts, hardware area, and rounding-error distributions, the extension achieves 4.2× speedup over an optimized software routine (54 cycles baseline) and 24× over full software FP emulation (316 cycles). Compared to deterministic rounding, SR improves error variance by up to 30% in simulated ML workloads. This low-overhead extension enables practical stochastic quantization on edge processors, facilitating accurate ML inference with negligible added cost. It demonstrates how targeted ISA enhancements can enable advanced ML techniques for IoT and embedded systems."

With this knowledge, electrical system managers can predict changes in demand, make the best use of resources, and stop system overloads from happening. It is difficult to achieve adequate precision due to large flows in energy demand but the uncertainty introduced by RES makes it even more challenging. Previous efforts to address this situation have typically not been satisfactory. Our goal is to develop technology that is further advanced. This article provides research that looks at the ability of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve forecasting of load in smart grids. These studies include forecasting for the short term, medium term, and long term, whereas most review papers focus only on short term forecasts. AI is able to handle various types of data, perform precise calculations, and provide computational efficiency for each type of data. The Paper presents information about many current developments and innovations in the development of sustainable and reliable energy systems. This approach focuses primarily on research that has the ability to respond to instantaneously changing variables which workforce models may struggle with including economic data as well as social events, such as weather forecasting. Given the presence of uncontrolled variables their results indicate that intelligent systems may provide a more accurate prediction of energy demand. The researchers suggest that Hybrid models may improve predictive accuracy. Historically, this article drives home the work that ultimately needs to be more prevalent in the management of smart electricity systems given the adoption of AI smart grids."

    "abstract": "We consider the model of a networked energy harvester for ambient dispersed vibrations, based on coupled mechanical resonators and a piezoelectric transduction mechanism. The networked harvester is equivalent to a mechanical filter that can be optimized for broadband energy harvesting. Using mechanical-to-electrical analogies, we derive an equivalent circuit model for the energy harvester, and we calculate the transfer function, output voltage, average harvested power and power efficiency in the frequency domain. We discuss the problem of the energy harvester optimization. Because analytical formulas for the objective function and its derivatives are not available, we apply a gradient-free method, based on Particle Swarm Optimization, to find the network parameters that maximize the scavenged energy. We show that, after proper optimization, the networked energy harvester collects significant more power than a single degree-of-freedom energy harvester."

    "abstract": "Load and mutual inductance are critical parameters for ensuring optimal matching in wireless power transfer (WPT) systems. The precise identification of these parameters is fundamental for ensuring interoperability between diverse charging devices. This paper presents an online method for identifying both mutual inductance and load parameters, utilizing the port impedance of the transmitting coil in an LCC-compensated WPT system. Initially, an analysis of the WPT system's network characteristics is conducted, deriving the relationship between port impedance, load, and mutual inductance. The load and mutual inductance identification processes are then decoupled. By introducing a fictitious ratio, the complex load identification equation is simplified into a quadratic form, enabling the inverse determination of mutual inductance from the identified load. A simulation model is created at the end to verify the proposed approach. The results reveal that, under different coupling and load scenarios, the maximum errors in identifying the load and mutual inductance are 6.8% and 4.8%, respectively. Importantly, the proposed method does not depend on resonance approximations or real-time communication, showcasing its practicality and robustness for wireless charging systems."

This study delves into the possibilities of using big data and ML techniques to improve customer behaviour analysis, offering a thorough framework for companies to comprehend and foretell consumer behaviours. Online interactions, purchase history, and social media activity are just a few examples of the many consumer touchpoints that organisations may analyse to find trends and patterns that traditional approaches miss. Customers can be better profiled and targeted marketing campaigns can be fine-tuned with the use of machine learning algorithms, especially supervised and unsupervised learning models, which enable real-time decision-making, dynamic segmentation, and predictive analytics. Research on the use of advanced analytics to the development of tailored consumer experiences that increase happiness, devotion, and engagement over the long term is also underway. The research shows, via case studies and empirical analysis, how ML and big data may be utilised effectively across many industries. This gives practical insights for companies that want to remain competitive in a data-driven market.

Although the degree of coronary stenosis can be identified through invasive coronary angiography, it is often difficult to correctly identify many angiograms by the naked eye. Therefore, we propose a novel classification model based on graph neural network for coronary artery stenosis. The network defines multi-head attention mechanisms, residual blocks, and graph convolutional networks, which are combined with many layers. Through a series of processing input signals, the model ultimately yields classification results. We conducted experiments using a dataset provided by Zhongshan Hospital affiliated with Dalian University, achieving a recall rate of 0.806 and an F1 score of 0.754. These performances offer certain reference value for doctors in diagnosing coronary diseases, enabling better resolution of issues that are imperceptible in angiograms even to the naked eye, which significantly improves the accuracy of coronary disease recognition."

Firstly, on a county/district scale, the daily effective utilization hours of each wind farm within the county/district are statistically summarized across different time intervals and daily average wind speed ranges. Secondly, based on the one-sided T-test theory, a mathematical benchmark unit is established to compute the upper and lower output limits for each time interval and wind speed range. Finally, with the benchmark unit as a reference, the presence of wind curtailment in each wind farm is assessed, and further, the upper and lower limits of wind power utilization rate for each wind farm and even the entire county/district are computed. Applying the proposed method, data from 13 centralized wind farms in Y County of S Province in northwest China are selected as a demonstration case, and the lower limit of wind power utilization rate in this county for 2024 is estimated to be 91.4%."

    "abstract": "Crowd surges in open public spaces remain one of the most pressing safety risks, often leading to life-threatening incidents. This paper presents a zone-based real-time infrastructure for crowd forecasting and alerting, utilizing passive WiFi probe request data. Minute-level device counts are captured across three spatially distinct zones and enriched through multidimensional feature engineering-including temporal flags, lag sequences, rolling statistics, growth rates, frequency-domain attributes (FFT), and adaptive spike indicators. For each zone, deep learning models such as LSTM, GRU, and BiLSTM are trained independently to perform short-term predictions. These models maintain low prediction errors, with mean absolute errors (MAE) ranging from 6 to 7 devices and root mean square error (RMSE) between 10 and 20. The system enables timely detection of crowd surges using a dynamic thresholding approach based on rolling trends and local deviations. Once a surge is identified, real-time SMS alerts are dispatched via the Twilio API. Experimental results show that the proposed zonewise framework outperforms global forecasting baselines by 15–25% on surge detection tasks, achieving an F1 score as high as 0.90. The framework is lightweight, privacy-conscious, and scalable-making it well-suited for deployment in worship sites, transit stations, and other high-density urban environments for enhanced crowd safety."

Common pest control methods largely rely on workers' exhaustive visual inspection and overuse of chemicals, not only rendering them ineffective but also ecologically questionable. IoT sensors and advanced image processing techniques are proposed in an automated pest control system. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) advanced model, which incorporates multiple techniques, was designed to identify pests in real-time images with an accuracy of 93.6%, a false positive rate of 3.2%, at a processing time of 0.9 seconds. The environmental conditions are detected through fitted wireless sensor networks and through automated actuated application of the pesticides when required. The model was evaluated using a conditioned pest data set and proofs through MATLAB-Simulink and Node-RED simulations. The findings demonstrate a robust and flexible system appropriate for precision agriculture use. This method significantly reduces labor and pesticide overspray, and improves detection accuracy and comprehensive system efficiency."

With legacy offerings, financial data is presented only in static dashboards that leaves space for problems in terms of engagement and trust. To mitigate those gaps, we developed a proof of concept (PoC) banking application utilizing Unity and ARCore/ARKit with secure banking APIs. The technical aspects of latency time, frame rate and tracking stability were measured to assess the system's capability. Trust, ease of use and behavioral intention were some of the features used to measure the adoption by user. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore the AR approach with present larger-scale experimental datasets (400 subjects) and task-based experiments, in combination with surveys that experimentally demonstrate its effectiveness. The results resulted in an average latency of 85 ms, a stable track, and a mean SUS score well over 80. Structural Equation Modeling confirms that usability enhances trust, and trust is an important driving factor of system adoption. The paper presents an AR bank architecture, the empirically validated one and design principles for future realisation."

We propose that neurodivergent and neurotypical users may engage with DTs in fundamentally different ways, revealing latent benefits that have yet to be systematically explored and mapping to vulnerabilities not apparent at the design phase. By exploring atypical interaction patterns, future research can uncover hidden dimensions of value and lead to more adaptive evaluation methods.

The growing complexity of software makes manual detection methods less efficient and error-prone. SVM has proven to be effective in detecting defects through the classification process, but its performance is largely determined by the optimal hyperparameter settings. This study proposes a novel optimization approach by applying the Random Walk mechanism to the hybrid Grey Wolf Optimizer-Whale Optimization Algorithm (RW-GWO-WOA) to optimize SVM parameters. The main contributions of this study include: (1) replacing hold-out evaluation with k-fold cross-validation to enhance model generalization reliability; (2) developing the RW-GWO-WOA optimization method, which combines the exploratory capabilities of GWO with the local exploitation of WOA enhanced by the Random Walk mechanism; and (3) conducting a comprehensive evaluation by comparing performance without oversampling, SMOTE, and BorderlineSMOTE. Experimental results show that the RW-GWO-WOA method achieves competitive performance with the highest average accuracy of 97.86% on the PC2 dataset without using PCA or oversampling. The k-fold cross-validation was able to provide a more reliable evaluation and reduce the possibility of overfitting compared to the hold-out approach."

MLIs are often used in EV drive systems because they can produce high-quality output voltage with reduced harmonic distortion, lower switching losses, and more efficiency. This work makes models and runs simulations of 5, 7, and 9-level cascaded H-bridge (CHB) configurations. We examine each setup’s performance for total harmonic distortion (THD), the quality of the output voltage waveform, and how well it works with EV traction systems. The results show that more levels mean less THD and a smoother output voltage. This makes motors perform better and rides more comfortable. The 9-level inverter offers the finest harmonic performance, but it is also harder to make and use. This comparison shows the pros and cons of different MLI setups, which will help you choose the optimum inverter design for future electric vehicles."

    "abstract": "In flow battery management systems, the state of charge directly affects operational safety and cycle life. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, an essential tool for characterizing internal battery states, is closely related to state of charge; however, its application in flow batteries remains limited. In this study, we propose an LSTM-TCN neural network model that accurately estimates battery state of charge using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy data while accounting for varying operational conditions. Additionally, an equivalent circuit model for flow batteries is established to analyze the functional relationship between state of charge and derived impedance parameters. electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurement results reveal that ohmic resistance, charge transfer resistance, diffusion impedance, and Warburg coefficient are highly correlated with state of charge (|R| > 0.95). By incorporating ECM-derived impedance features into the neural network, high-accuracy state of charge estimation is achieved (MAE, RMSE < 0.01). This work presents a robust and stable EIS-based state of charge estimation approach for flow batteries, offering valuable insight for intelligent battery management."

    "abstract": "Face super-resolution (FSR), or face hallucination, is a specialised image restoration task that poses challenges due to prevalent degradations like occlusion, shadow, blur, and abnormal illumination. In real-world scenarios, low resolution often coexists with occlusion, making the recovery of such faces critical. A reasonable strategy involves initially addressing the occluded areas, followed by the use of super-resolution techniques to the restored low-resolution images. We propose Face Completion Super Resolution utilizing Contextual Position Relation Networks (CPRNet), a two-stage framework consisting of face completion followed by face super-resolution. In the face completion stage, global facial priors guide the reconstruction of degraded patches by adaptively retrieving substitute information from structurally correlated regions. This non-local modeling enables the recovery of missing details and produces an unoccluded LR face. Subsequently, in the following stage, a super-resolution module improves the unoclluded LR image, generating a high resolution (HR) Reconstruction with greater structural fidelity and perceptual distinctiveness quality. Detailed investigations conducted on the CAS-PEAL-R1 validate the efficiency of FCSRCPRNet, with distinct algorithms surpassing a number of recent-state-of-the-art."

Traditional methods often face challenges, particularly those related to log parsing complexities that can lead to information loss and consequently high false positive rates. While detection identifies issues, understanding them is also vital. Existing workflow-based approaches offer some explanation by comparing anomalous sequences against normal patterns. There is also a lack of semantic-level anomaly diagnosis capabilities. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named HybirdLog, which focuses on the detection and diagnosis of log anomalies. It introduces heterogeneous semantic collaborative training, integrating anomaly features extracted by LLMs, jointly encoding semantic information and anomaly tendencies. Our approach achieves low-resource cross-domain anomaly detection and interpretability of anomalies. Experimental validation on two public datasets demonstrates the leading performance of our proposed method, offering an efficient and interpretable solution for analyzing logs from software systems."

To solve the problem, the regularity of voltage at the rectifier during the commutation failure is analyzed. Then based on the grid-connected control strategy and output power expression of wind turbine, the key parameters of voltage ride through control that affect the voltage state are identified.

    "abstract": "In modern power distribution networks, especially at the single-phase level, inductive loads introduce significant reactive power demand, leading to poor power factor (PF) and increased transmission losses. Traditional fixed or semi-automatic capacitor-based compensation systems often fail to maintain PF under dynamic loading conditions. This paper presents a cyber-enhanced, Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled Automatic Power Factor Correction (APFC) system that dynamically manages VAR compensation using a modular capacitor bank and a cloud-hosted logic engine. The proposed architecture employs a discrete set of six 500 VAR capacitors, each selectively switched based on real-time PF measurements computed within a MATLAB Simulink environment. These measurements-voltage, current, real power, and PF-are transmitted to a ThingSpeak IoT platform at 0.5 -second intervals. A cloud-hosted logic engine evaluates the incoming data and responds with optimized capacitor-switching commands via a feedback channel, thereby ensuring responsive and minimal-reactive-error compensation. Three models are evaluated to validate the system’s performance: (1) a fixed-load model with static compensation, (2) a variable-load model with static capacitors, and (3) a dynamic, IoT-integrated model with adaptive capacitor control. Results demonstrate that while fixed methods can offer PF improvements from 0.80 to 0.95, the IoTenabled system consistently maintains PF above 0.97 under varying loads. Real power remains stable, and the system dynamically adjusts apparent and reactive power with minimal overshoot or delay. Additionally, the IoT integration enables remote visualization, event logging, and scalability toward predictive and AI-enhanced control strategies. This work illustrates a low-cost, modular, and cyber-resilient solution for improving grid power quality and efficiency, particularly relevant for residential, commercial, and microgrid applications."

Automatic cooling system in solar panel was designed using a wiper mechanism based on the Internet of Things (IoT), utilizing an ESP32 microcontroller. This system is equipped with temperature, voltage, and current sensors that monitor panel conditions in real-time via an I2C LCD display and the Blynk application, while also recording data to Google Spreadsheet. The cooling motor activates automatically when the temperature reaches 42°C and stops when it falls below 37°C, with movement direction controlled by an infrared sensor.

In this paper, the authors examine the application of lightweight large language models (LLMs) as post-processing correction layers to enhance the accuracy of recognition in atypical speech contexts. Some of the models like Phi-2, TinyLLaMA, Mistral-7B, and Gemma-2B are compared in terms of how well they can improve noisy transcriptions from speech-to-text systems. For checking performance, parameters such as BLEU, ROUGE-L, and BERTScore are evaluated together. Experimental findings point to an accuracy vs. computational tractability trade-off, especially when the hardware used is consumer-grade with limited GPU memory. Smaller instruction-tuned models like Flan-T5 and Phi-2 are able to achieve real-world efficiency without sacrificing competitive correction quality, while larger models become increasingly accurate but require hybrid GPU–CPU execution strategies. The results show that LLM-enabled correction is a highly efficient method for improving ASR for atypical speech, enabling more inclusive and accessible speech technology."

    "abstract": "Capacitor voltage sorting of submodules is essential for voltage balancing and stable modulation in modular multilevel converters (MMCs), yet its computational latency under high submodule counts (N≥200) has become a critical bottleneck for real-time control. Conventional bubble sort, with O(N<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>) complexity, can exceed 150 μs for N=300—far beyond the typical 50 μs PWM period. This paper proposes an adaptive sorting framework that integrates non-recursive merge sort (NRMS), guaranteeing strict O(NlogN) complexity, with a dual-threshold triggering mechanism based on voltage variation rate (dV/dt) and bridge-arm energy deviation. This approach dynamically relaxes the sorting execution frequency: during steady-state operation, sorting is performed only once every several PWM cycles; during transients, it reverts to highfrequency activation. By decoupling sorting from the fixed control cycle, the method maintains effective voltage balancing performance without compromising control accuracy, while reducing the average computational overhead by 20 to 50 times, depending on submodule count and operating conditions. This significant efficiency gain liberates substantial processing resources for advanced functionalities such as grid-forming control and multi-terminal coordination. Simulations across 240– 400 SM configurations demonstrate the proposed framework’s scalability, real-time feasibility, and compatibility with highperformance MMC applications."

This paper describes a novel hybrid approach that uses both quantum and classical computers to tackle inventory problems structured as Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO). Each choice variable, such as restocking a product, is represented in binary form, with related costs and penalties built into the objective function. Business constraints are communicated indirectly using adjustable weights, allowing the model to remain unconstrained while discouraging unrealistic conclusions. Optimization is carried out using both classical methods like simulated annealing and quantum solvers such as D-Wave and QAOA, where a hybrid strategy selects the most viable solution. The results indicate that the hybrid system consistently produces lower total costs and better constraint compliance compared to individual solvers, especially for complex, high-dimensional datasets. To ensure secure, automated execution of these optimized decisions, a blockchain layer is introduced. Inventory actions—such as placing orders or updating stock—are carried out through smart contracts that provide tamper-proof, verifiable enforcement. By employing a lightweight Proof of Authority (PoA) mechanism, transaction validation remains fast while maintaining transparency across all nodes in the network. This integration of quantum optimization with blockchain automation enables a responsive and trustworthy framework for modern inventory management."

As WPT emerges as a viable solution for contactless energy delivery in microgrids and renewable-powered infrastructures, ensuring power quality and system observability becomes critical. The proposed model, developed in MATLAB/Simulink, simulates a three-phase inductive WPT system with embedded PMU tracking of voltage and current phasors at the secondary coil. Using an algorithm based on the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and synchronized to a 60 Hz reference, the PMU enables real-time extraction of phase angle, frequency, and magnitude, even in the presence of harmonic distortion and switching transients. Simulation results demonstrate minimal ripple in DC output and accurate phasor tracking, validating the feasibility of PMU-assisted regulation. Furthermore, phasor data can be used for dynamic compensation, grid stabilization, and input to maximum power point tracking (MPPT) in PV systems. The study concludes that phasor-aware WPT architectures offer a promising approach to enhancing efficiency, controllability, and sustainability in distributed energy networks. Future extensions will explore adaptive compensation strategies and wide-area PMU coordination for next-generation smart grids."

    "abstract": "Climate and weather extremes remain a major challenge for crop yield prediction modeling. Accurately capturing the complex interactions between climatic variability and stress conditions such as drought continues to be an active research focus. A cumulative neural network architecture called Nested Sequential Feed-Forward Neural Network (NSFFNet) was recently proposed to model the cumulative effects of climatic factors on crop yield. This approach has demonstrated strong capability in learning long term climate impacts and improving prediction accuracy. However, modern crop production introduces mediating factors, particularly irrigation, that influence stress responses by reducing drought intensity and regulating temperature. To investigate these effects, this study evaluates the performance of NSFFNet using irrigated paddy yield data. The temporal yield analysis revealed substantial variability in responses during drought years, where one drought affected year resulted in very low yield while another drought year produced comparatively high yield. This variability significantly affected the model’s generalization ability, particularly when drought-affected samples appeared only in the test set but were underrepresented in the training set. Cross-validation confirmed this limitation, and comparative analysis against benchmark models including RNN, 1D CNN, LSTM, GRU, and Transformer architectures showed the same generalization pattern. These findings indicate that while cumulative modeling approaches are essential for capturing long term climatic impacts, they must also account for mediating factors that modify the impact of climate on crop yield."

However, the complexity of the HAD coefficients tuning and the issue of introducing the non-minimum phase system by digital delay are the deficiencies in the HAD strategy. To solve the proposed deficiencies, a method of the HAD coefficients tuning is put forward based on the minimum phase system. Finally, the proposed HAD strategy and the capacitor voltage feedforward approach are compared through simulation, and the results verify the feasibility of the proposed method."

The principal aim of this investigation is to enhance power extraction from PV panels for efficient operation in a water pumping system (WPS) the boost converter is employed to implement maximum power point tracking (MPPT), while the PMSM ensures optimal utilization of the power produced by the PV modules, consequently enhancing the system's reliability.

    "abstract": "Lithium-ion batteries have become the dominant energy storage technology in electric vehicles and renewable energy applications. However, as the usage time increases, the performance of lithium-ion batteries significantly declines, which may indirectly lead to equipment performance degradation or failure. Accurate estimation of the state of charge (SOC) is essential for effective battery management. In this study, a novel SOC estimation approach is developed by integrating the pied kingfisher optimizer (PKO) algorithm with the hybrid kernel extreme learning machine (HKELM) to enhance the estimation accuracy of lithium-ion batteries under diverse operating conditions. The PKO-HKELM method is verified using the University of Maryland A123 battery dataset under DST, FUDS, and US06 conditions, and compared with the HKELM, KELM, and ELM methods. The experimental results show that the PKO-HKELM method outperforms traditional SOC estimation methods under different working conditions."

    "abstract": "Time series anomaly detection plays a crucial role in a wide range of fields, such as healthcare and internet traffic monitoring. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) offers new opportunities for detecting anomalies in the ubiquitous time series data. Traditional approaches struggle with variable-length time series sequences and context-based anomalies. We propose Soft Prompt Enhanced Anomaly Recognition (SPEAR), a novel approach to leverage LLMs for anomaly detection with soft prompts and quantization. Our methodology involves quantizing and transforming the time series data into input embeddings and combining them with learnable soft prompt embeddings. These combined embeddings are then fed into a frozen LLM. The soft prompts are updated iteratively based on a cross-entropy loss, allowing the model to adapt to time series anomaly detection. The use of soft prompts helps adapt LLMs effectively to time series tasks, while quantization ensures optimal handling of sequences, as LLMs are designed to handle discrete sequences. Our experimental results demonstrate that soft prompts effectively increase LLMs’ performance in downstream tasks regarding time series anomaly detection."

This paper presents a novel system designed to address these issues. The Real Time Transit Tracking (RTTT) framework comprises two key components. First, an affordable, privacy-preserving Internet of Things (IoT) device that utilizes a fusion of a pressure mat and infrared (IR) sensors to achieve high-accuracy passenger counting. Experimental validation of the hardware prototype demonstrates an overall counting accuracy of 90.4% with robust performance across real-world scenarios. Second, we architect a hybrid SARIMA–LSTM forecasting model to leverage seasonal structure and non-linear exogenous effects (weather, holidays, events). Implementation and empirical evaluation of the forecasting model are reserved for future work. The developed hardware and proposed framework offer a viable and powerful tool for transit authorities to optimize fleet deployment, mitigate overcrowding, and enhance service reliability."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a \"Large-Diameter Spiral Drilling Construction Method for Specific Strata\" aimed at addressing the challenges of constructing large-diameter pile foundations under complex geological conditions. The method is an improved and innovative spiral drilling technique characterized by high-efficiency slag discharge. Through the rotary cutting action of the spiral drill rod, it enables stable drilling in soft soils without collapse or in strongly weathered strata, and in unstable geological environments with a construction slope of less than 25°. This technique significantly improves borehole quality and reduces the risk of collapse. Compared with traditional drilling methods, it offers greater adaptability—particularly advantageous in special construction environments such as mountainous power grid projects and urban confined spaces. The equipment features a compact structure and flexible operation, effectively minimizing construction vibration and impact on surrounding facilities, thereby enhancing construction safety. Moreover, by replacing manual excavation piles with mechanized operations, it greatly reduces safety risks and labor costs while shortening the construction period and improving project efficiency. The method has demonstrated excellent economic and operational performance in multiple engineering applications and is suitable for foundation construction in wind power, photovoltaics, power transmission, and bridge projects. Experimental results show that this method effectively enhances construction quality, safety, and efficiency, indicating broad application prospects."

This paper presents a performance analysis of a standalone DC source used with an electric vehicle charging system. The study explores the possibility of using isolated renewable energy-based DC sources, such as solar photo-voltaic (PV) systems or rechargeable Li-ion batteries with series-parallel combination, to power EV chargers without relying on the utility grid. A detailed system model is created, which includes a standalone DC source, a DC-DC converter design, and a battery charge controller. Simulation results show that the dedicated DC bus charging system is able to achieve $\\boldsymbol{\\gt} \\mathbf{9 0 \\%}$ charging efficiency with negligible voltage and current ripple, even down to varying solar illuminance. These results demonstrate the system ability to ensure a safe battery operation, since the control action on battery charging and discharging is stable and robust. This article demonstrates the technical viability as well as the economic benefits of adopting independent DC power sources for EV charging, providing a scalable, green approach in case of off-board or supplemental charging infrastructure.

    "abstract": "Cutaneous tactile feedback is essential for robotic manipulation, particularly when interacting with deformable objects with limited visual sensing. Learning-based approaches are increasingly adopted but rely on large volumes of tactile data. To meet this demand, Sim-to-Real strategies are widely used to generate synthetic high-resolution tactile images. However, in many tactile servo tasks, force information is more critical than the tactile image. Electronic skins (e-skins) offer direct force sensing, but remain underutilized in Sim-to-Real approaches due to the difficulty of simulating their output signals. Force-centric interpretations across real and simulation domains can facilitate the application of learning-based methods to e-skin sensing. We propose a framework that combines a soft-body simulator with a 10×10 piezoresistive e-skin. A shared feature encoder and dual-headed decoder enable bidirectional interpretation between e-skin normal force mapping readings and simulation normal stress fields. This framework supports both high-resolution stress field reconstruction and virtual tactile sensing data generation. Experiments show that the framework reduces the spatial discrepancy between real and simulated data, enhances multi-frame gradient consistency, and reconstructs edge and feature details, achieving an SSIM of 0.79 in cross-domain interpretation."

This paper presents a human-in-the-loop muscle sensing and control system based on capacitive microphone sensors (CMS) that capture subtle mechanical muscle vibrations preceding observable motion. CMS signals were shown to occur 20–30 ms earlier than IMU-based kinematics, enabling anticipatory intent detection and feedforward assistive control. A five-sensor CMS array positioned over major thigh muscles is combined with a two-stage control strategy that integrates threshold-based pre-assist triggering and machine-learning-based torque refinement. Experiments across walking, stair ascent, sitting, and standing achieved over 90% classification accuracy under both non-fatigued and fatigued conditions with low latency. Robustness evaluations demonstrate stable CMS performance under realistic wearable perturbations, including perspiration and attachment variation. Extended experimental sessions (1-2 h) and preliminary feedback from five participants indicate comfortable wear and natural interaction. These results highlight the potential of CMS-based anticipatory sensing for practical wearable exoskeleton deployment in daily scenarios."

Specifically, we design a global semantic interaction graph to capture the complex interactions between words, generating a comprehensive textual semantic representation. We also employ an entity-noun relationship graph to mine deep semantic associations, enhancing the model's understanding of fine-grained textual deep meanings. Additionally, we develop an adaptive graph convolutional network to effectively extract and aggregate feature information from different graph structures. Finally, we introduce a fusion module to integrate both global and local fine-grained semantic information, forming a rich composite semantic representation, thereby improving the effectiveness of fake news detection. Extensive experimental results on three public benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness and superior performance of MgSAN, outperforming state-of-the-art detection models."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a joint beamforming design for optimizing integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems under imperfect channel state information (CSI), leveraging a simultaneous transmission and reflection reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS). Owing to the deployment of large-scale antenna arrays and high carrier frequencies, the Rayleigh distance can extend to tens or even hundreds of meters. This expansion leads to a fundamental paradigm shift in electromagnetic field characteristics, transitioning from the conventional far-field regime to the emerging near-field regime. As a result, the propagation characteristics experienced by users and the target may differ. Accordingly, we consider a practical scenario in which users and the target are situated in distinct fields. However, this hybrid-field model increases the system’s sensitivity to channel estimation errors (CEE). To this end, we propose a robust design that jointly optimizes beamforming for base station (BS) and STAR-RIS, aiming to maximize the achievable sum-rate of the nodes while satisfying the constraint of sensing requirements. Under a statistical CEE model, we derive the interference covariance matrix and reformulate the maximization problem as an equivalent weighted mean square error (MSE) minimization problem. Subsequently, the transformed problem is decoupled into multiple sub-problems using a block coordinate descent (BCD)-based algorithm. The algorithm capitalizes on semidefinite relaxation and Gaussian randomization to obtain an effective solution. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed robust design. Compared with the baseline schemes, the proposed algorithm achieves a higher communication sum-rate and illustrates how various parameters affect the performance."

    "abstract": "E-commerce platforms adopt differentiated delivery strategies for various products, where the application and investment of digital technologies play a vital role in shaping delivery services. We consider a hybrid product market in which the platform sells standard products and competes with manufacturers of augmented products that require value-added processing, such as engraving or printing. The platform may provide only basic delivery services for augmented products while applying digital technologies to enhance the delivery of standard products. Alternatively, it may establish value-added processing centers to support a unified delivery strategy and adjust its digital investment accordingly. Counterintuitively, our analysis shows that even when product value and service fees are high, the platform may still refrain from establishing value-added processing centers. Moreover, the adoption of these centers can stimulate further digital investment and enhance coordination, benefiting manufacturers through improved delivery and wider market reach. While customer surplus may decline due to weakened competition, overall welfare can increase through better alignment of processing and delivery decisions. We further demonstrate the robustness of these findings through two model extensions (i.e., asymmetric processing costs and heterogeneous product valuation) as well as numerical verification of the analytical results. This study contributes to the engineering management literature by explaining how platforms align digital technology investment with the establishment of value-added processing centers and how this alignment reshapes delivery strategy, platform-manufacturer interaction, and market outcomes. —"

We present an edge intelligent finance framework that combines shallow neural models with symbolic, rule-based reasoning to make real-time, transparent loan decisions in the wild over low-cost edge devices. Trained via federated learning on popular benchmarks (German Credit, LendingClub, FICO), the framework achieves competitive discrimination performance (AUC ≈ 0.83) while reducing inference latency to 50ms and energy use to 0.3J/inference compared to their centralized deep models. An interpretable validation layer is proposed to encode fairness constraints and regulation rules, which outputs the interpretable rationales and group-gap metrics (<0.05). Under bandwidth constraints, stress tests indicate that accuracy and response times remain stable, as inference is performed locally. Our results demonstrate that under edge AI, efficient lending workflows and peer-to-peer ecosystems can be enhanced with privacy, fairness, and compliance through a series of information yellow-red-green cycles. We also address scalability, rule complexity, and deployment recommendations for financial institutions and regulators."

    "abstract": "In recent years, vision transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated excellent performance in computer vision tasks, but their large computational complexity and memory overhead seriously hinder efficient deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. Although researchers have conducted studies to optimize ViT through sparsification, existing methods often rely on static pruning or artificially predefined sparse patterns, and lack the ability to adaptively sense the input semantics, resulting in loss of accuracy or limited hardware efficiency. To this end, we propose a semantic-aware mixed-granularity dynamic pruning co-design architecture—DSPViT for efficient acceleration of ViT inference. We first adopt a semantic-aware dynamic grouping approach to group tokens and evaluate group importance before the attention module; then we use token-wise, block-wise, and element-wise pruning within different groups, which adequately removes redundant tokens as well as redundant connections between tokens in ViT. In addition, we implement token grouping unit on FPGA through counters, adder trees, and DSPs, and we implement row-configurable PE arrays through customized selectors. Compared with existing ViT pruning studies, DSPViT can improve the accuracy of ImageNet dataset by 0.3%-0.5% at lower computational cost; for various widely used ViTs such as DeiT-T, DeiT-S, and DeiT-B, DSPViT can achieve 30%-65% computational reduction. Compared to the baseline hardware accelerators, our DSPViT implementation on U250 achieves an end-to-end acceleration ratio improvement of 3.58×-61.9× and an energy efficiency ratio improvement of 3.15×-36.73×."

    "abstract": "Zero-shot navigation enables embodied agents to perform tasks in unfamiliar environments without specific training by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with structured spatial representations. This approach effectively addresses the semantic limitations of traditional methods like Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). While LLMs provide generalized knowledge, translating this into actionable perception and path planning relies on suitable spatial representations. Current challenges include knowledge transfer, perceptual uncertainty, multimodal fusion, and decision interpretability. Our contributions include: (1) a systematic analysis of LLM applications in zero-shot navigation; (2) a comparative evaluation of spatial representation techniques; and (3) a novel hybrid paradigm integrating universal spatial representations with continual learning and human-robot collaboration for improved generalization in real-world scenarios."

    "abstract": "Digital overlays in composite baseband systems provide a means to integrate new services while maintaining compatibility with existing structures. This paper presents a comparative study of Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) and Differential Phase Shift Keying (DPSK) when used as digital subchannels at 57 kHz within a four-component composite framework. The system study is done using MATLAB simulations. The composite signal consists of (i) an analog baseband signal, (ii) a 19 kHz pilot tone, (iii) 38 kHz sin/cos subcarriers, and (iv) a 57 kHz digital channel carrying random binary data. The design and evaluation of a digital transmission system inspired by the FM stereo Radio Data System (RDS) architecture is used here. Unlike the traditional RDS protocol, which follows fixed group structures, our study focuses on transmitting arbitrary digital data using an FM stereo-like multiplexing framework. The composite signal is modeled with additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. At the receiver, the composite is bandpass-filtered around 57 kHz, down-converted to baseband, and digital demodulation is done. Analytical and simulation results confirm that BPSK outperforming DPSK at low error rates, while DPSK offers reduced synchronization requirements at the expense of error performance. The study demonstrates the feasibility of extending the FM stereo framework for arbitrary digital communication in broadcast."

The study explores the impact of different masking parameters on model performance, evaluated using aggregated F1-score metrics across ten cross-validation folds. The results indicate that applying masking augmentation on Mel-spectrogram features yields the highest F1-score of 98%, outperforming MFCC features and non-augmented data. However, the study also finds several things that can lead to performance degradation attributed to low and high ranges of certain parameters, such as the number of mels or coefficients used to generate the features and the masking coverage on the augmented data."

    "abstract": "Road traffic accidents remain a persistent public safety concern in the Caraga Region. This study analyzes and forecasts road traffic accidents in the Caraga Region by integrating dimensionality reduction, comparative clustering, and seasonal time-series modeling. A dataset of 18,568 incidents (2019–2024) from the Philippine National Police Caraga was preprocessed and transformed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), retaining ≈100% of variance (PC1 = 51.80%, PC2 = 48.20%). Four clustering algorithms, The Divisive Analysis (DIANA), Agglomerative Nesting (AGNES), K-Means, and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) were compared using the Silhouette Score and Davies–Bouldin Index (DBI). DBSCAN achieved the highest Silhouette Score, while K-Means obtained the lowest DBI (0.813) with competitive cohesion, and was selected for downstream forecasting due to its balanced performance and interpretable severity-based clusters (Low, Moderate, High). Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) models were trained on 2019–2024 data to generate a five-year outlook (2024–2029). Forecast accuracy, measured by Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), was 41.37 for Low, 48.97 for Moderate, and 65.75 for High severity clusters. Results reveal seasonal peaks holidays and rainy months, persistent high-volume low-severity incidents, and volatile high-severity spikes. These findings inform a cluster-specific intervention program combining targeted enforcement, seasonal operations, and infrastructure upgrades. This work constitutes the first documented application of comparative clustering techniques integrated with SARIMA-based forecasting in the Caraga Region, establishing a novel, data-driven framework for localized accident prediction and the formulation of evidence-based road safety interventions."

This study proposes the integration of the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) distance function into the K-Means algorithm for conformational clustering. Using a dataset of 54 flexible conformers, we conducted a comparative analysis between atom-based geometry clustering and RMSD-based clustering. Evaluation was performed using the silhouette score, visualization, and computation time, implemented in Python (utilizing scikit-learn and RDKit libraries). The results demonstrate that incorporating RMSD significantly improves clustering quality, effectively doubling the silhouette score from 0.3 to 0.6 and reducing misclassification by 40%. While computation time increased by 15%, the precision achieved was twofold higher. Consequently, RMSD-based K-Means offers a more stable and accurate solution for molecular systems comprising fewer than 500 atoms, presenting strong implications for fields such as drug discovery and molecular simulations."

    "abstract": "DC overvoltage of the modular multilevel converter-based high voltage direct current (MMC-HVDC) caused by grid faults can lead to itself blocking and compromise AC system stability. Existing methods typically activate the energy dissipation device (EDD) based solely on the DC voltage level, without considering the fault duration, which may result in unnecessary EDD operations. Such unnecessary activations impose additional stress on the AC/DC system and lead to excessive energy waste. In this paper, a security region for the inverter is established, and its contraction characteristics are analyzed. Furthermore, the concept of the critical fault clearing time (CFCT) and its calculation method are introduced. By comparing the main protection operating time with the CFCT, an adaptive EDD control strategy is designed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively ensures both AC current and DC voltage security while minimizing unnecessary EDD."

This study proposes an integrated Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)–based IDS framework that combines feature selection (FS), data imbalance handling, and efficient learning design to enhance detection capability and adaptability. The hybrid Information Gain (IG), Chi-Square (CS), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) methods were employed for FS, while K-Means SMOTE was applied to address class imbalance in the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 dataset. A stacked LSTM-based DRL model was then trained to learn sequential network behaviors and optimize detection policies. Experimental results show that the PSO-based feature selection achieved the best trade-off between detection performance and computational efficiency, reaching a macro-F1 score of 91.62% with stable convergence. The K-Means SMOTE technique yielded the most balanced data distribution, improving overall generalization and stability. The confusion matrix revealed minor misclassifications between Bruteforce and Benign classes, attributed to their similar network traffic patterns. Although the hybrid IG + CS + PSO configuration achieved the lowest computational cost across all efficiency metrics, it reduced accuracy to 89.20%. In contrast, the PSO + K-Means SMOTE combination provided the most reliable balance, maintaining high detection capability with reasonable complexity. These findings highlight the potential of the proposed DRL-based framework as a foundation for developing adaptive and efficient IDS models suitable for real-time deployment."

    "abstract": "The autonomous and edge agricultural systems are providing a refreshing change in precision farming. The old methodologies of smart farming have paid a lot of attention to the real-time streaming and responsive processes such as pesticide spraying or irrigation of a certain specific process. However, these approaches disregard the higher order biotic news ones, and are more likely to disregard deep, interplay, the implications of which biotic interactions could have on the health of the plant, particularly dynamic interactions between the plants and the microbiome that surrounds them. The article provides a novel, real-time plant health optimization engine that has been designed to execute fully at the edge. Unlike those that are dependent on clouds, the root-zone microbial community will automatically be adapted to local and multiparametric data of biosensors in the proposed system. The system can detect both biotic and abiotic stress earlier on set and this has been possible by being able to gain insight into some plant physiology, alterations in soil chemical conditions and activity of the microbes. Once identified, it offers particular biological healing, in lure of the discharge of probiotic microorganisms, or pH; by a progressing situation of the plant. As it is a closed-loop feedback system, one can continuously learn and optimize decisions and therefore can respond to change in crop health condition or a change of the environment in real-time. It is important to note that the system will not need the common cloud infrastructure, thereby, making it to be exceptionally reliable and responsive, even in an area of the globe, where connection is limited. The performance of clustering-based intervention in terms of stress detection, time and energy efficiency, and yield are considerably improved compared to the performance of conventional systems through experimental evaluation in a wide variety of agricultural settings. The biological smart farming development will commence with the framework. It can support scalable, sustainable and autonomously operated precision agriculture ecosystem, which is founded on edge intelligence and microbiome-guided intervention."

The dynamic nature and multifaceted ness of space vehicles also leads to the large volumes of telemetry created as the space vehicles are operating through the interaction of different sub systems. Rigorous fault detection techniques such as model-based and classical machine learning-based have very low scalability and cross-subsystem dependency modelling problems and are not sensitive to the changes in the type of faults. It is on such weaknesses that they cannot be feasible in real-time applications in the environment in the onboard setting that will require fast and precise fault prognostic responses to outlaw cascade-like failures and the reality that autonomous remedial measures can be executed without the assistance before ground before ground. This system suggest of such a solution to such issues a Hybrid Adaptive Transformer-Graph Neural Network model (HAT-GNN) that is capable of identifying and localising faults in commercial spacecraft systems in real-time by itself. We have a research advantage which consists of an advantage called Interdependencies are expressly represented in our solution which means that it considers the spacecraft subsystems and sensors as a grab base system with dynamic edge connection implying dependencies. The trends in technical sensor telemetry amongst timeseries are detected timely by a lightweight Transformer encoder with the ability to identify temporal abnormalities. The Graph neural Network module condenses and disperses explicitly the information amongst the adjacent subsystem nodes and thereby allows fault localization and inter-subsystem diagnosis to be perfect."

Meanwhile, the factors influencing power load are numerous, diverse, and changeable, and the data of these factors are dispersed across varying temporal scales. When making predictions, it is essential to consider the interdependencies among multi-scale data. Only by comprehensively and fully utilizing data from different time scales can achieve accurate, stable, and dependable medium and long term load prediction. This study introduces a multi-layer recurrent neural network architecture based on LSTM units, which integrates climate data from different time dimensions, historical load data, and regional economic data into the prediction model. A case study utilizing actual operational data demonstrates that the proposed stacked long short-term memory recurrent neural network model achieves no less accuracy than single neural network architectures and outperforms stacked support vector machine models in load forecasting precision."

In order to overcome this difficulty, this work presents the Dynamic Activation Sparsity Mechanism (DASM), whose main goal is to lower memory and computational expenses without appreciably sacrificing accuracy. This approach dynamically reduces the number of activated neurons during inference to maximize activation sparsity. This method, when tested on benchmark datasets such as CIFAR-10, results in over 40% memory and computational cost savings with only a slight loss in accuracy.

In this study, we investigate the effects of network-induced delays on teleoperation using a controlled setup featuring a Rokoko Smartglove and a Shadow Robot Dexterous Hand. Through our experiments, users control the robotic hand in real-time while receiving visual feedback either directly or via a VR headset, delivering an immersive, metaverse-oriented experience. To introduce controlled delays, we utilize an Ingress Delay Mechanism for precise latency application. A user study involving 33 participants was organized to evaluate the impact of latency on user experience in terms of responsiveness, naturalness, control, and level of frustration. Results show that VR-based teleoperation is more sensitive to delays than direct HRI. In particular, perceived responsiveness decreased significantly with an additional 200 ms of delay, while frustration levels showed a significant increase with 150 ms of additional delay. These findings provide valuable insights towards optimizing future immersive teleoperation systems."

    "abstract": "Due to increased globalization and international travel, there is a growing demand for secure and private identity verification systems at border entries. Reliance on databases controlled by only a few hinders quick, safe, and easy border crossings for travelers. The paper proposes a system utilizing blockchain technology that would enable individuals to verify their identities in real-time when traveling internationally. The system suggested for travelers utilizes selfsovereign identity technology, allowing them to manage their verified IDs on their devices through wallets based on blockchain technology. Once biometric details, such as facial recognition, fingerprints, and iris scans, are collected from each individual, they are linked together on the identical federated, permissioned blockchain by the nation's and border agencies. With the help of smart contracts, it is possible to control entry such that only approved agencies verify traveler documents, and zero-knowledge proofs ensure that only essential attributes about a person's identity are disclosed. Simulations prove that the system reduces verification time to under two seconds, significantly outperforming traditional systems, and prevents nearly 90% more identity fraud. Additionally, since blockchain is decentralized and secure, it ensures that audit records are transparent and there are no single points of failure. The work introduces a manageable and compatible system that enables people to travel more efficiently while facilitating collaboration between border officials and countries. The next step is to do significant pilot deployments, connect to current travel technology, and face rules and differences among countries and regions to make sure air (/land) mobility grows for everyone."

Traditional models struggle to balance accuracy and generalization in knowledge fusion and semantic representation. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a Hierarchical Embedding-Based Attention Framework (HEAF) for power system knowledge fusion. This model constructs a multi-layer semantic embedding framework, categorizing power knowledge into entity, relationship, and scenario layers to achieve hierarchical semantic representation. It introduces a cross-layer attention mechanism to dynamically allocate feature weights, thereby strengthening structural associations and semantic consistency. Experiments conducted on multi-source power knowledge datasets encompassing dispatch, operation and maintenance, and safety supervision data demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms mainstream methods in accuracy, semantic consistency, and robustness, achieving an overall performance improvement of approximately 6%–10%. The findings indicate that integrating hierarchical embedding with attention mechanisms effectively enhances power knowledge understanding and intelligent reasoning capabilities, providing novel technical pathways and theoretical support for operational analysis, risk early warning, and knowledge-driven decision-making in power systems."

    "abstract": "A three-phase multilevel inverter was previously introduced and proposed with a generalized formula of output voltage to establish the conditions for reduction or elimination of specific harmonics. This multilevel inverter was particularly suitable for fixed speed/frequency applications, significantly reducing switching losses by having inverter switching devices operate at only a single line frequency. However, many applications benefit from variable speed/frequency operation, necessitating switching at much higher frequencies and multiples of the fundamental line frequency. This study extends previous work by analyzing the performance of the three-phase three-level multilevel inverter for variable speed control. The switching scheme of the previously proposed fixed-speed inverter is also modified to enable pulse-width modulated variable speed/frequency control. The performances of the multilevel inverters connected to permanent magnet motor machines are examined through simulation to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed concepts. The proposed control schemes do not necessarily require the use of rectifier front end to supply DC bus voltage to the inverter, thereby eliminating the need for capacitors and capacitor voltage balancing used in some conventional drives. The proposed concepts can offer additional benefits for enabling compact designs and capabilities for standalone operation. The proposed inverter-motor drives are very suitable for Renewable Energy (RE) and Electric Vehicle (EV) power systems supplied from an array of dc voltage sources."

    "abstract": "Electric trucks are subject to demanding overload events during operations such as kerbstone climbing, where the inverter operates at low output frequency and high current, leading to significant thermal stress on power semiconductors. To prevent exceeding the junction temperature limits, standard practice often involves limiting torque output or oversizing the power stage, resulting in reduced acceleration performance or increased system cost. This study investigates the use of Active Thermal Control (ATC) to improve inverter operation during such overload conditions, enhancing performance without exceeding thermal limits. Three ATC strategies are evaluated: increase of gate voltage, reduction of switching frequency, and the application of Discontinuous PWM, as well as selected combinations of these strategies. The study quantifies the thermal, lifetime, and waveform quality impact when applying these ATC strategies. Results demonstrate that the junction-to-ambient temperature difference can be reduced by up to 26%, and the number of safe mission repetitions can increase by a factor of five. Alternatively, for a fixed thermal limit, the deliverable output current can be raised by approximately 20%, enhancing acceleration capability without requiring converter oversizing. These findings confirm the potential of individual ATC strategies to enhance inverter robustness and dynamic performance, while showing that their combination enables even greater improvements in demanding electric drive applications."

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of the new energy vehicle industry, lithium-ion batteries have become its mainstream power source, and accurate estimation of the State of Charge (SOC) is crucial for the lifecycle management of power batteries. For the traditional Dual Extended Kalman Filter (DEKF) algorithm, the challenge of correcting SOC estimation errors caused by capacity degradation has long been a focal point of industry research, particularly evident when the battery charge is low. To address this, this paper proposes a battery SOC estimation method that integrates Incremental Capacity Analysis (ICA) with DEKF. Firstly, an equivalent circuit model of the battery is constructed, and a dual-time-scale DEKF algorithm is employed to estimate the available capacity on a macroscopic time scale and the SOC on a microscopic time scale. Subsequently, an ICA-DEKF interactive updating mechanism is established, leveraging the coupling relationship between ICA characteristics and available capacity to create a numerical linkage, thereby providing the DEKF algorithm with initial values for the available capacity. The results indicate that the combined ICA-DEKF algorithm achieves an average SOC estimation error of 1.01% under the UDDS driving cycle, and the SOC estimation error is 0.83% under low SOC conditions. This provides a novel approach to solving the state estimation challenges associated with the aging of power batteries."

    "abstract": "Dynamic vehicles and pedestrians, as well as motion-blurred scenes, pose challenges to the localization accuracy and mapping stability of traditional Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). To this end, this paper proposes a real-time dynamic filtering SLAM algorithm that combines a 3D optical flow error model with deep learning features. The algorithm takes stereo or RGB-D images and IMU data as input, extracts SuperPoint feature points, limits the optical flow tracking range within the target semantic area through instance priors, and accurately identifies potential motion features based on the 3D optical flow error model. In the localization stage, static features are retained for pose estimation and optimization. In the mapping stage, potential motion features are removed to ensure that a purely static point cloud map is generated to support loop closure and relocation. Verified by multiple datasets, the algorithm is superior to existing mainstream methods in terms of real-time performance and localization accuracy. In particular, the localization accuracy of the real vehicle experiment is improved by 96.68% compared with the basic algorithm."

    "abstract": "Workplace accidents often lead to fatal or serious injuries if workers don’t wear personal protection equipment (PPE) in a proper way. In the very recent years, the deployment of object detection systems has seen a great improvement in different domains. In particular, many of these systems are being applied in dangerous workplaces, used to detect PPEs worn by workers. Although many studies have reached good results with classical techniques such as YOLO or Faster R-CNN, the usage of Large Language Models (LLM), more specifically the Vision Language Models (VLM), are increasingly recognised as a viable alternative. VLMs are gaining interest due to their flexibility and adaptability to different scenarios. These are models that integrate both visual and textual information. They can perform different tasks such as extracting features from images and elaborating them to give a proper answer to specific questions, using the power of the most recent LLMs integrated in them. The focus of this study is to analyse and compare these two paradigms: on one side a classic algorithm like YOLO, while on the other side different VLM models. The purpose is to use them to perform an object detection task on different kinds of PPEs. Furthermore, the objective is to improve the detection of PPEs through testing models on specific datasets. Results show that while working with restricted computational capacity, classic techniques, like YOLO, maintain their leading position in terms of speed and efficiency. Although with the proper computational power, generative models show great scalability and versatility. Moreover, these models can analyse complex scenarios without task-specific fine-tuning, thanks to their ability to extract features from the textual part."

To address issues of crop loss and quality control, this study investigates the application of advanced deep learning methodologies to automate the detection and classification of tea plant diseases. An extensive dataset of 5,445 images was utilized, divided into 2,777 training images (51%), 820 validation images (15%), and 1,848 test images (34%). Seven distinct Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models were rigorously evaluated. The experiments demonstrated highly promising results, with models such as Inception V4, DenseNet169 and YoloV11 achieving peak accuracies of between 97%, 96% and 95%. respectively. Most of the other models also yielded robust average accuracy above 90%. While classification performance varied for specific diseases, particularly Red Spider Infestation and Red Rust, the study conclusively shows that these deep learning models can provide a highly effective and accurate means of automated disease identification. This work establishes a strong foundation for future research, which could expand to include a wider variety of more diverse and complex plant diseases to further enhance agricultural resilience"

This article presents an assessment study to determine the impact of optimal allocation of multiple photovoltaic distributed generation (PV-DG) and DSTATCOM in a reconfigured radial power distribution network. To determine ideal feeder reconfigured network and multiple PVDG & DSTATCOM unit allocation under deterministic load conditions, a novel hybrid Marine Predator-Jellyfish Search optimization algorithm (MPJSA) is suggested. The method maximizes the net economic gain from enhanced voltage regulation and loss reductions while minimizing real power losses and voltage variations. Here, results of IEEE 118-bus radial distribution network under various constraints are used to validate the methodology after comparing it with the published results. The analysis clearly reflects that coordinated optimization greatly enhances the voltage profile and reduces active power losses with improvement in technical performance and financial gains. The study offers an economical method for raising operational profitability and distribution network efficiency."

This research paper proposes a multi-inductor-based active cell modelling in which a shared inductor is used for redistributing the energy among cells actively within a battery pack. A 48 V battery consisting of 13 Li-ion cells connected in series, each rated at a nominal voltage of 3.7 V, is to be employed. The imbalances in the voltages of the 13 cells are to be ascertained and rectified using inductor-based active cell balancing. The simulation is demonstrated in MATLAB software, and the simulations were carried out for different State of Charge (SoC) to study the time frame of the cell balancing. The inductor configuration reduces component count, contributing to a simplified, faster, and cost-effective design."

The approach is meant to handle different grid conditions as well as inherent computational and PWM delays, and also avoiding hidden oscillations typical of discrete implementations. Additionally, it considers the regulation of converter output currents under varying grid scenarios and uncertainties introduced by auxiliary components. The controllers are implemented as a structured state-feedback scheme. Its design balances robustness, by minimizing the <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$H_{\\infty}$</tex> norm of the sensitivity function, dynamic response, by imposing a given dominant pole, and noise effect limitation, by constraining the range of gain values the controllers can take. Controller gains are obtained by solving an optimization problem described by a sequence of Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMI) combined with the inclusion of the Completion of Squares technique to improve the problem computation. Simulation studies are included to compare the proposed method with conventional PI controllers augmented with decoupling and feedforward structures. These demonstrate a better performance in different grid scenarios, showing the method's success in enhancing stability, robustness, and overall dynamic behavior."

This study compares the effectiveness of two imbalance handling techniques, SMOTE oversampling and cost-sensitive learning, applied to Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and XGBoost using the public Kaggle stroke dataset. Three experimental scenarios were evaluated: baseline, SMOTE, and cost-sensitive learning. The results show a significant improvement in minority class recall, especially for SVM, although this improvement is accompanied by a decrease in overall precision and accuracy. Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC shows that cost-sensitive learning provides the best balance between sensitivity and discrimination performance. Further SHAP analysis revealed that age and hypertension were the most influential predictors. Although these findings are promising, limitations related to dataset size and the risk of overfitting remain. Further research should explore hybrid imbalance handling methods and validation on larger and more diverse datasets to improve clinical applicability."

Five HP laptop models were tested using the TriField TF2 EMF meter, with measurements recorded at fixed distances ranging from 0 to 25 cm under two power conditions (charging and noncharging) and three usage modes (airplane, browsing, and video playback). A total of 30 test scenarios were analyzed. EF intensity was plotted and fitted to theoretical decay modelsnamely inverse-square and exponential functions-with goodness of fit assessed via $\\mathbf{R}^{\\mathbf{2}}$ and RMSE metrics. Results show that EF emissions decrease with distance, generally following exponential attenuation. Charging consistently resulted in higher EF values, with several models reaching or exceeding the TF2’s upper detection limit of $1000 \\mathrm{~V} / \\mathrm{m}$ at $0-2 \\mathrm{~cm}$, whereas noncharging emissions remained below $20 \\mathrm{~V} / \\mathrm{m}$ across all modes. Among the laptop tested, the EliteBook Folio 9480m exhibited the highest emissions, attributed to its compact design and legacy power architecture. Curve fitting demonstrated strong model alignment, particularly under browsing mode ($\\mathrm{R}^{2} \\geq 0.99$). While all observed values fall within ICNIRP and IEEE C95.1 public exposure guidelines, the elevated emissions during charging raise ergonomic concerns for close-contact users. The study recommends maintaining a minimum distance of $20- \\mathbf{2 5 ~ c m}$ during laptop charging to mitigate near-field EF exposure. These findings contribute to EMF safety discourse and support the development of informed usage practices and shielding-conscious device designs"

They can integrate memory-based hardware (HW) FFT accelerators, with additional silicon area being traded for energy and latency improvements. This trade-off is modulated by the radix of the FFT accelerator. Moreover, a fixed-point representation with a fixed wordlength is generally used, which limits the signal-to-quantization-noise ratio (SQNR) and requires a data scaling method to avoid overflows. Higher accelerator radices reduce the scaling method SQNR and increase its area overhead.

They provide estimates of surface soil moisture (SM) and L-band vegetation optical depth (L-VOD) approximately every 2-3 days at the equator, with a spatial resolution of ∼40 km for a local overpass time of 6 AM/PM. Integrating the AM and PM TB observations from SMAP and SMOS satellite missions can reduce the revisit time to about 1 day over the equator, thus helping to address fast-response hydrologic processes that cannot be addressed with the 2-3 day revisits. This will allow the capture of the SM conditions more often and hence capture the rate of decline due to drainage and recharge to groundwater. This occurs early during dry down after storms. The integration of SMOS measurements also works to fill temporal gaps caused by missing data due to SMAP instrument outages. This paper details the integration of the SMAP and SMOS observations to achieve a combined SM and L-VOD product. The SMOS TB observations interpolated to 40° incidence angle were first relatively calibrated (RC) to generate SMAP-like SMOS TB (RCTB), making the combined TB records consistent spatially and temporally. The SMAP baseline SM and L-VOD retrieval algorithm was then applied to the RCTB records. We showed that after relative calibration (ARC), the bias between the SMAP and SMOS TBs was reduced from 0.5 K to -0.03 K for TB H and from 2.6 K to 0.014 K for TB V in the AM cases. For the PM cases the mean value of differences was reduced from 0.82 K to 0.27 K and from 2.88 K to 0.19 K for TB H and TB V respectively. The comparison of the core validation sites (CVS) in-situ SM to the retrieved SM from the combined TB record showed an unbiased root-mean-square-difference of 0.039 m3/m3 for both AM and PM cases and the retrieved L-VOD demonstrated consistency with independent biomass and tree height estimates. We also showed an improvement in temporal coverage and that the global mean number of visits to each grid went up from 283 (SMAP only) to 446 (SMAP+SMOS) when both AM and PM overpasses are considered."

However, LLMs do make mistakes, and worse, they make mistakes confidently. In this article, we take a close-up examination of LLMs with symptoms of code smells. Enlightened by the data-driven approach and observable software engineering, we provide supplementary evidence and practical takeaways to help practitioners know their LLMs. Our reminder is simple: manage your context, log the AI-usage traces, and engineer observations for LLMs—because software quality rarely speaks for itself."

    "abstract": "Quantization is a neural network compression technique that effectively improves the deployment performance on inference hardware. Fixed-point quantization methods use the same bit-width for all layers in the network, which leads to difficulties in balancing compression rate and accuracy loss. Therefore, mixed-precision quantization has recently been proposed. The major challenge of the mixed-precision quantization is to select the quantization bit-widths of each layer in network to simultaneously meet the requirements of minimizing accuracy loss and hardware resource consumption. In this paper, we present a Single-Step Hardware-Aware Quantization (SHQ) method. It can calculate the resource consumption of hardware such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) before actual deployment and find effective quantization schemes by just single step, different from common software-hardware two-step approaches with large workload and time-consuming. Genetic algorithm is combined with SHQ to search quantization schemes with low hardware resource usage and high accuracy. In addition, the correlation between hardware resource cost and qualitative indicators of proxy signal has been analyzed to bring computer-aided design insights of neural network accelerators. Experiments of full-pipeline accelerator deployment on FPGAs platforms show that our approach saves 39% of Digital Signal Processors (DSP) and 59% of Block Random Access Memory (BRAM) usage on MobileNet compared to full 8-bit quantization, while the accuracy drops by only 0.56%.

    "abstract": "The transferability of adversarial examples across different models has drawn considerable attention recently, particularly in targeted transferability. Prior research has empirically shown that optimizing adversarial perturbations at neighboring points with the highest loss value improves transferability. While effective, such a method requires multiple iterations to reach the local maxima and disregards the local minima of the input loss landscape. In this paper, we theoretically show that enhancing adversarial transferability is attainable by flattening the input loss landscape. This is accomplished through the perturbation optimization at both local maxima and minima. Moreover, we propose the <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">C</b>ost-efficient <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">L</b>andscap<bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">E</b> <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">F</b>lattening (CLEF) attack to consider local maxima and minima around current inputs in a cost-efficient way to flatten the loss landscape and improve adversarial transferability. Specifically, we reuse the gradients of the previous attack step to assist current inputs in reaching local maxima, and employ probabilistic modeling to learn the distributional representations of perturbations that assist current inputs in reaching local minima. This probabilistic modeling can be pre-trained on dozens of images from other domains, enabling us to directly sample this type of perturbation from the pre-trained distribution when attacking. Experimental results demonstrate that integrating local maxima and minima into targeted transferable attacks can significantly flatten the loss landscape of the crafted adversarial examples, resulting in improved adversarial transferability."

To ground this discussion, we conducted a linguistic analysis, covering phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, lexicon, and pragmatics, which uncovers robust MGT signatures, such as lower perplexity and simpler morphology. We then consolidate the state-of-the-art by reviewing 30 benchmark corpora, totaling over 4 million text samples, and 44 empirical studies, including outcomes from six major shared tasks. Detection approaches are grouped into five broad classes: classical machine learning, deep learning, transformer-based architectures, commercial AI detectors, and statistical tools. Transformer models achieve near-perfect accuracy (≈100%), while human evaluators peak at ≈77% accuracy. This survey also highlights common evaluation setups and the core performance measures used to assess model effectiveness. Future MGT detectors can become truly fair, scalable, and effective across languages and domains by expanding corpus diversity and innovating resource-efficient, adversarially robust methods."

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of the Internet of Energy (IoE), peer-to-peer energy trading has become an important mechanism for decentralized energy balancing and distribution-network relief. However, prior works have focused mainly on single platforms or isolated communities, offering limited insight into coordinated operation across multiple communities within a unified IoE ecosystem. This work proposes an IoT-enabled hierarchical trading framework that manages both intra- and inter-community energy transactions through decentralized area platforms and a central coordinating platform. A mixed-integer programming model is formulated to maximize the daily profit of energy-trading operators by optimizing household charging and discharging decisions, supported by distributed renewable generation and battery storage. The framework incorporates a dynamic IoT-driven pricing mechanism that adapts buying and selling prices using real-time measurements from smart meters and local IoE communication networks, ensuring responsive and data-driven market operation under varying conditions. Because the optimization problem is NP-complete, a simplified harmony search (SHS) algorithm is adopted to efficiently generate high-quality solutions. Experiments across 20 system configurations show that SHS outperforms several widely used metaheuristic baselines in both solution quality and run-to-run stability. Results further indicate that larger communities yield higher profits, with the maximum observed when each community contains 25 households. Eliminating the central trading platform causes a drastic reduction in operator profit, confirming its essential role in enabling scalable coordination and equitable energy allocation across heterogeneous communities. These findings highlight the effectiveness of the proposed hierarchical IoE architecture and underscore the importance of centralized coordination in next-generation smart energy systems."

However, achieving optimal trade-off between analytical accuracy and real-time performance for edge video analytics in bandwidth-constrained conditions poses a critical challenge. To address this problem, this paper proposes a joint semantic compression and massive multiple-input and multiple-output (massive-MIMO) transmission scheme for edge video analytics. Specifically, we design a task-oriented performance metric named task reliability, jointly evaluating the stochastic delay bound of intelligent task transmission and the accuracy of intelligent task execution. By optimizing pilot sequence length, pilot power, data power, and semantic compression ratio jointly, we maximize the weighted sum task reliability. Furthermore, we propose a power and semantic compression ratio allocation (PSCRA) algorithm, which utilizes maximum entropy multi-agent reinforcement learning to balance exploration and exploitation. Numerical results demonstrate that our resource allocation scheme achieves superior system utility compared to baseline methods, while the PSCRA algorithm outperforms conventional multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms."

    "abstract": "Clinical machine learning (ML) models often achieve strong performance on clean test sets yet remain fragile at deployment, where measurement noise, hospital-specific distribution shift, surrogate-feature drift, label noise, and unstable explanations can lead to silent failure. Existing clinical ML benchmarks provide limited ability to probe these failure modes in a controlled, reproducible, and clinically interpretable manner. In particular, domain-style benchmarks (e.g., WILDS-like multi-environment evaluations) largely rely on pre-collected environments without mechanism-level control, while prior synthetic stress tests typically target only a narrow subset of stressors. We present a synthetic-first, perturbation-aware benchmarking framework that evaluates deployment-relevant model integrity along four complementary dimensions: <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Reliability (R), Robustness under shift (S), Calibration Stability (C)</i>, and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Explainability Stability (E)</i>, combined into a composite RSCE index. The benchmark comprises seven analytically specified synthetic clinical “worlds” that emulate common deployment scenarios, ranging from clean in-distribution evaluation to hospital skew, measurement noise and missingness, surrogate corruption, strong nonlinearity, and label noise. These worlds are constructed via explicit perturbation operators with tunable severity ranges under a known structural data-generating process that inject controlled distortions while preserving an underlying physiological structure, enabling mechanism-isolating stress tests beyond domain labels alone. Using this testbed, we evaluate a diverse set of linear, tree-based, kernel, neural, and ensemble models across more than 15,000 model–world–perturbation configurations, and conduct external stress tests on NHANES and a MIMIC-IV hospital mortality cohort. The results reveal systematic trade-offs between discrimination, calibration, robustness, and explanation stability: models with similar AUROC on clean data can differ markedly in their behavior under realistic perturbations. Tree-based ensembles form a consistent integrity frontier, whereas several widely used models degrade sharply in calibration or attribution stability despite strong in-distribution performance. Integrity patterns learned from synthetic worlds transfer qualitatively to NHANES and MIMIC-IV, supporting RSCE as a practical pre-deployment screening and diagnostic tool. The proposed framework is fully reproducible and extensible, and is intended to serve as a synthetic-first reference benchmark for developing and vetting clinically trustworthy ML systems prior to large-scale real-world deployment."

This article introduces a high-level fashion recommendation system, which uses graph neural networks (GNNs) and vision transformers (ViT) to provide recommendations, that are visually as well as contextually relevant. Vision Transformers are employed to gain the highest visual level that is deep in the clothing objects, thus they gather the intricate design elements going beyond the capability of the traditional CNN. These features are then used to establish a similarity graph where the nodes stand for the items and the edges correspond to the feature-based cosine similarity. The graph is first converted to a graph neural network, then the GNN learns the associations and the co-relations of the objects in order to give accurate recommendations. Experimental results show that the model can provide an accuracy of 92.4% in diverse fashion recommendations, thus the advantage of combining ViT and GNNs in recommendation tasks is emphasized."

In this research, we delve into the performance of multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradients (MAD-DPG), a tailored algorithm for multi-agent scenarios, in the context of a cooperative navigation OpenAI environment involving three agents. Through extensive experimentation, we investigate the impact of various hyperparameters and action exploration strategies on MADDPG's performance. Moreover, we propose enhancements to MAD-DPG to overcome its main weakness, which lies in its limited scalability to more significant numbers of agents. Our findings demonstrate that MAD-DPG outperforms singleagent policy gradient approaches significantly. Furthermore, our innovative improvements to MAD-DPG effectively tackle its primary limitation, allowing the algorithm to scale more efficiently to accommodate larger numbers of agents while only minimally impacting its overall performance."

Here, the job remains in the home station until there is space in this case, which shows that a major impact on the functioning of the system and needs a keen modelling in order to establish an exact picture of the performance of the system. In order to address the issues that blocking generates, approximation method is applied to achieve impossible states in underlying state space to be normal. The method allows you to estimate the transfer blocking probabilities without listing all the possible system configurations. This technique allows us to estimate that such significant network performance measures as the average number of jobs at each station, the average station occupancy and the total network throughput. Different numerical tests are done on systems employing three and four service stations respectively. These case studies provide a numerical demonstration of the influence of routing probabilities, server multiplicity and network size on system performance. The findings indicate that the proposed approximation procedure is effective and also provides valuable recommendations in the design and testing of computer communication systems as well as distributed service infrastructures with a large number of multiserver queueing and blocking."

Traditional models such as Decision Tree, Linear Regression, Exponential Smoothing (ETS), and SARIMAX were applied as benchmark models. A feature-engineered framework was created to include time-related, promotion-related, and competition-related variables, as well as K-Means store clustering, to capture heterogeneity at the store level. Results show that the tuned TabNet model achieved top performance (RMSE = 746.54, MAE = 524.11 and R2 = 0.94), achieving a greater prediction accuracy than all benchmark models. TabNet's attention mechanism improved interpretability by indicating which predictors are most important including variable Promo, Month, Competition Distance, and Store Cluster. Overall, we find that attention-based deep learning can provide superior predictability and interpretability with structured retail data. This research shows that TabNet could potentially be an interpretable AI forecasting framework to help improve data-driven decision-making in the retail sector."

Technologies that are emerging make things simple and effective by facilitating correct predictions. Since educational institutions want to enhance student scores and aid high performers to achieve their goal results, our model makes grade predictions based on essential factors like past grades, attendance, and study hours. Using the Linear Regression method, the model predicts the value of one variable from another with a model accuracy of 90.55 %. For example, the model predicted the final grade of 84.24 % for a student who studies for 6 hours a day, has a previous grade of 78 %, has completed 80 % of homework, and sleeps for 8 hours. With this model, students are able to see their predicted scores and areas for improvement, e.g., study longer hours or be regular in attending classes. We used the Linear Regression model because it is simple to implement and extensively used in business and science for forecasting and data analysis. The test data set (20 % of the data) tests the model after the training data set (80 % of the data). Observations show high precision for low to mid-range scores, although there are minor variations at the upper end, as with a student's actual grade of 100 % predicted as 90 %. The general aim is to enhance student success rates for both teachers and students."

As healthcare data grows progressively formless and huge, Natural Language Processing (NLP) has appeared as a critical tool for extracting meaningful clinical information from electronic health records, medical literature, and patient accounts. However, the black-box nature of many NLP-driven systems increases concerns about transparency, trust, and interpretability, making Explainable AI (XAI) important for developing clinician confidence and regulatory compliance. This review provides a comprehensive investigation of the current landscape of NLP and XAI techniques in the context of Clinical Decision Support (CDS), examining their methodologies, applications, and limitations.

    "abstract": "Planning of autonomous mobile robots in unpredictable and dynamic environments in real time is a significant challenge. Conventional techniques, including A, DLite, RRT and Velocity Obstacle (VO) techniques, either assume the world is statically known or are reactive in nature. Global planners can be effective in constant conditions, but not able to preserve their approach in the shifting ones, whereas reactive local strategies such as Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) and Artificial Potential Fields (APF) are quicker but tend to create unstable or oscillating paths. Such computationally intense control methods as Model Predictive Control (MPC) also increase the load on onboard processing, restricting speed and safety. In order to overcome these drawbacks, a hierarchical hybrid path planning algorithm based on Dynamic Wavefront Decomposition (DWD), and Predictive Local Replanning Module (PLRM) is presented. DWD actively separates the environment, and calculates parallel costmaps to ensure continuity of world paths, whereas PLRM anticipates motion of obstacles, to produce smoother and adaptive local paths. Experimental findings indicate that DWD-PLRM framework decreases the time of replanning by 65.9 percent over <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$D^{*}$</tex>-Lite and 66 percent over A+ and still ensures latencies of less than <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{1 0 0 ~ m s}$</tex>. It has a 92 % obstacle avoidance success rate which is more than 10 times better than the existing methods. The suggested solution provides the computational efficiency, predictive, and adaptability to realtime autonomous navigation and manages the global optimality of structured planners and the flexibility of reactive systems to guarantee reliable multi-robot operations."

Therefore, this paper establishes the impedance model to assess the stability of the sending-terminal while the receiving-terminal converter is simplified as a constant DC voltage source. The frequency sweep verification shows excellent agreement with impedance derivation, validating modeling accuracy. Based on the impedance model, the sub/super-synchronous oscillations (SSSOs) in sending-terminal are studied and the calculated oscillation frequencies are corroborated by time-domain simulation analysis. Moreover, the simplified impedance model which disregards MMC’s DC dynamics is compared with the comprehensive impedance model, indictaing the simplified model may lead to erroneous stability assessment for the sending-terminal system."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven transformative advancements in recommender systems through their superior semantic understanding and logical reasoning capabilities. However, the fairness risks embedded in implicit feedback within LLM-based Recommender Systems (LRS) remain understudied—recommendation homogeneity induced by similar behavioral patterns may amplify societal biases, leading to systematic marginalization of disadvantaged groups. To address this challenge, we propose a fairness enhancement framework integrating counterfactual reasoning and dynamic adversarial learning. By constructing counterfactual text intervention scenarios, we uncover implicit causal dependencies between user-sensitive attributes and recommendation decisions. Furthermore, we design a hierarchical gradient blocking mechanism that adaptively suppresses sensitive information propagation pathways during adversarial training, achieving balanced optimization between recommendation fairness and utility. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework effectively mitigates implicit feedback bias at both group and individual levels across multiple benchmarks, significantly improving recommendation equity while maintaining personalized recommendation quality. This study establishes a novel paradigm for LRS that harmonizes semantic understanding with fairness constraints, paving new avenues for ethical alignment in generative recommendation system."

This paper first reviews the limitations of traditional robotic manipulation methods—specifically, their heavy reliance on precise environmental modeling and the scarcity of training data—and explores the potential advantages of end-to-end large models for robotic control. We systematically categorize existing VLA approaches into four major classes: classic Transformer-based architectures, diffusion model-based methods, autoregressive prediction methods leveraging pre-trained large language models (LLM) or vision-language models (VLM), and hierarchical hybrid architectures that integrate LLM with specialized action experts. We highlight the architectural characteristics, strengths, and limitations of each category, trace the trend from monolithic end-to-end systems to layered dual-system designs, and propose key future research directions, including multimodal integration, expert routing mechanisms, and adaptive subtask decomposition for open-world scenarios."

    "abstract": "An Electrically Steerable Passive Array Radiator (ESPAR) is presented. Passive patch antennas are reactively loaded using varactor diodes and the phase shift induced by the change in the varactor capacitance causes a shift in the directivity of the main lobe of the antenna array. The steering effect is induced electrically and the increase in directivity is caused by the mutual coupling of the microstrip patch antennas. A nine ($3 \\times 3$ cell) patch antenna array is simulated and the far field radiation pattern and directivity is shown. A Chebyshev steppedimpedance feedline is presented to provide sidelobe suppression for multi-antenna patch arrays. The use of microstrip enables the ESPAR antenna to be easily manufactured using a PCB etching process, incorporated into a PCB Surface Mount Technology (SMT) assembly, and easily miniaturized into an embedded system. Microstrip fabricated ESPARs present a low-to-medium microwave frequency alternative to Antenna-in-Package (AiP) antennas - the latter of which requires a semiconductor lithographic and packaging process but is more suited to higher microwave and terahertz frequencies. The antenna array presented operates in the ISM band with a center frequency of 2.436 GHz."

In order to tackle this problem, the proposed research would construct an interpretable machine learning model that could predict tumor focality (unifocal vs. multifocal) using only non-invasive preoperative clinical and lifestyle data. Three hundred eighty-three patients were employed as a balanced sample set for training the classifiers XGBoost, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression. Logistic Regression was the best model when compared to other models, with the most excellent recall (70.4) and ROC-AUC (0.726), both of which were substantially different (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathrm{p}&lt;0.05$</tex>). The HAP-based analysis found that the most relevant predictors were age, smoking history, and physical examination. The concept may be applied in outpatient clinical settings as it is straightforward to learn, particularly in institutions without access to histology or imaging. This paper indicates that tumor focality is foreseeable using easily accessible data, enabling a trustworthy decision-support tool for early treatment planning in the treatment of thyroid cancer."

    "abstract": "Predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) is critical for their stable operation and industrial application. However, due to the strong nonlinearity of the aging process and complex operating conditions, traditional life prediction methods struggle to balance prediction accuracy with computational real-time performance. To address the issues of PEMFCs lifespan prediction, this paper proposes an aging prediction model based on a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)-enhanced Bayesian Optimization (GPR+BO). Experimental results under different training set ratios (400h, 450h, 500h, 550h, 600h, 650h, 700h, 750h and 750h) using datasets from various operating conditions demonstrate that the GPR+BO model can accurately track aging trends under both steady-state and dynamic conditions, exhibiting good prediction accuracy and robustness. Compared to the traditional Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model, in steady-state conditions, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is reduced by up to 48.06%, and the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) is reduced by up to 46.22%. Compared to the traditional GPR model, in steady-state conditions, the RMSE of GPR+BO is reduced by up to 53.36%, and the MAPE is reduced by up to 32.68%. Compared to the traditional LSTM model, in quasi-dynamic-state conditions, the RMSE is reduced by up to 28.95%, and the MAPE is reduced by up to 36.66%. Compared to the traditional GPR model, in quasi-dynamic-state conditions, the RMSE is reduced by up to 30.33%, and the MAPE is reduced by up to 33.54%."

The physical principle is based on the excitation of longitudinal section magnetic modes in waveguides containing H-plane slabs of lossy dielectrics that gives rise to non-monotonic evolution of attenuation as a function of the filling factor. In this paper, it will be shown that the attenuation frequency slope over the frequency band can be controlled (positive, null or negative) as a function of the filling factor. This phenomenon will be applied to design a 10 dB attenuator in the X-band."

This paper introduces a new way of using MAS and DRL to allow autonomous security orchestration in cloud-native architectures. Dynamic access graph and agent-based architecture in the proposed system make threat detection, policy adjustments and searching for secure services possible. We tested out many agent ideas in multiple cloud environments by monitoring results using accuracy in detection, response time, consistent policies and false alerts. MAS-based security orchestration performs better than old methods of security, increasing detection success by 12% and lowering average response time by 58%. This design approach helps the system grow, withstand different issues and cope smoothly with moving threats. Besides offering a detailed security model, this paper prepares the way for future cloud-native defense systems to include federated learning, distributed trust models and hybrid DRL strategies.

    "abstract": "Within the master-slave game framework, operators can optimize system economics through rational guidance. However, as the autonomy of diverse entities in energy markets grows, the traditional \"leader-follower\" relationship increasingly struggles to fully unleash the potential of all participants. It may even trigger cooperative conflicts due to uneven benefit distribution. To address this, this paper constructs a system-wide cooperative alliance encompassing the Integrated energy system Operator (IESO), Integrated energy system Aggregator (IESA), and diverse user loads. It introduces a dynamic alternating bidding game mechanism based on peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture. Within this framework, the game dynamics undergo a fundamental shift: participants engage in multiple rounds of bidding and response on an equal footing, gradually converging toward optimal allocation strategies through bilateral negotiations. This process ultimately achieves equilibrium between individual rationality and collective optimality, maximizing the system's total surplus. To validate the proposed model's effectiveness, this chapter conducts a case study based on real-world energy system data. Simulation results demonstrate that the constructed P2P dynamic game mechanism not only enhances overall system economic efficiency but also effectively stimulates participation enthusiasm among diverse entities while ensuring allocation fairness. This provides theoretical foundations and methodological support for the collaborative optimization of new energy systems."

In this project, health information from individuals is collected to estimate the probability of a heart attack or cardiac arrest. The data is processed through supervised learning techniques, which include cleaning and preprocessing to ensure reliable input for the prediction model. Among the tested algorithms, Gradient Boosting offered the most balanced performance in terms of accuracy and recall on the selected dataset. To protect sensitive medical information during deployment, secure access control is used so that patient records can be viewed only by authorised users. The system generates both a risk score and a confidence score, helping in the early identification of high-risk cases and supporting timely medical intervention."

    "abstract": "In this paper, an enhanced dung beetle optimization (EDBO) method is suggested for the solution of optimal power flow (OPF) problem. The EDBO method draws inspiration from the reproductive, ball-rolling, dancing, foraging, and thieving behaviours exhibited by dung beetles. By considering both local and global exploitation, the proposed method possesses the qualities of a rapid convergence rate and adequate solution precision. Along with equality and inequality constraints, the total generation cost, emission, active power loss, and magnitude of voltage deviation are considered as objectives in this paper. The efficacy of the proposed method is evaluated utilising the IEEE 30bus system. This paper employs a penalty-based constraint handling approach to effectively handle equality and inequality constraints inherent in the OPF issue. The outcomes obtained by the EDBO are contrasted with the basic dung beetle optimization (DBO), artificial hummingbird algorithm (AHA), and grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithms. From results it is evident that the EDBO exhibits superior performance with regard to convergence rate, solution accuracy, and stability as compared to other algorithms."

    "abstract": "Anemia remains a major global health challenge, particularly in under-resourced settings where access to laboratory testing is limited. Non-invasive detection methods using computer vision provide a scalable alternative, but many existing approaches either rely on full-face analysis, require manual preprocessing, or depend on computationally heavy architectures unsuitable for real-world deployment. In this work, we propose ConjAnNet, a two-stage deep learning framework that combines U-Net-based segmentation of the conjunctiva with MobileViT for anemia classification. This end-to-end pipeline ensures clinically guided feature extraction and enables deployment on mobile and edge devices. Experimental evaluation on a balanced dataset of conjunctival images from Kaggle demonstrates strong performance, achieving a Dice coefficient of 0.8612 and IoU of 0.7815 for segmentation, and $96.5 \\%$ accuracy with an ROC-AUC of 0.987 for classification outperforming baseline CNN and MobileNet models. While these results highlight the potential of conjunctiva-specific analysis for automated anemia screening, the dataset’s lack of demographic diversity and acquisition details represents a limitation. Future work will focus on validation with clinically acquired, diverse datasets and extension toward multiclass anemia grading."

A 32 -bit Ladner-Fischer adder was synthesized and implemented with Xilinx ISE tool with a Spartan 3 family FPGA (xc3s1000) in mind. The resultant implementation provided a highly reduced propagation delay which is crucial in high-speed arithmetic operations. The design reflected an overall delay of 25.627 ns, of which 12.870 ns and 12.757 ns was the logic and the routing delay respectively. The use of hardware adoption made use of minimal target device footprint. The architecture used only 95 slices or 7680 and 1674 input LUTs or 15360, or 1% of each. Power consumption of the design also was a first order consideration. The total electric power load on-chip was measured to be 0.098 W, most of which is the static (quiescent) power and the dynamic power consumption was insignificant. The sparseness of the resources used and the little value of power consumption together with the speed at which it works renders this new-fangled way of the Ladner-Fischer adder design very efficient. The study offers a good reference point on further studies in optimizing high-speed arithmetic circuits in resource-constrained embedded systems."

    "abstract": "Pinching antennas (PAs), a special class of leaky-wave antennas (LWAs), have recently emerged as a promising technology to mitigate blockage and reduce large-scale path loss. However, PAs suffer from performance limitations due to their passive radiation characteristics and mechanical actuation. To overcome these limitations, we introduce reconfigurable LWAs (RLWAs), which enable RLWA beamforming through electronic control of both radiation amplitudes and phases. By integrating RLWAs into the existing PA systems (PASS), we propose a hybrid PASS (H-PASS) architecture, which combines mechanically reconfigurable PA beamforming with electronically reconfigurable RLWA beamforming. Given that PAs in H-PASS can be deployed in discrete-position or continuous-position manners, H-PASS comes in two variants accordingly, and we formulate weighted sum-rate maximization problems for them, respectively. For the discrete-position case, we propose a penalty-based two-loop joint analog and digital beamforming algorithm. For the continuous-position case, we propose an alternating-minimization-based joint position optimization and beamforming algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that H-PASS can increase the sum-rate of the existing PASS by up to 33%, reduce the performance loss caused by phase quantization in discrete-position PAs by up to 69%, and mitigate the performance loss caused by position errors in continuous-position PAs by up to 90%. Overall, H-PASS significantly improves the performance of existing PASS by leveraging the strengths of RLWAs while mitigating the limitations of PAs."

A machine requires much time and data processing to identify what object is present. In order to detect an object inside the image, there are various ways to achieve using computer vision techniques. Although there have been a large number of studies that thoroughly explored various types of methods for object detection.

The proposed filtering antenna basically incorporates periodic longitudinal slots on the broad wall of each resonator in an iris coupled bandpass filter. Transition to microstrip technology is adopted at the input and output ports. To verify the proposed concept, a filtering leaky wave antenna is designed, simulated and fabricated at a center frequency of 3.5 GHz. The measured return loss is better than 15 dB in the entire frequency range with a peak realized gain of 7.5 dBi.

In this work, we first analyze the differences between our work and previous work from the perspective of probability theory. Then, we concentrate on data augmentation and propose innovative Cross-Modal Mixup methods designed to enhance the model's cross-modal reasoning and classification capabilities, as well as its overall generalization. Specifically, based on dimensions match or not, the Cross-Modal Mixup methods comprise two forms: Cross Mixup (CM) for data augmentation with features of the same dimension, and Cross Expand Mixup (CEM) with features of different dimensions. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of our CM and CEM."

    "abstract": "With the integration of renewable energy sources (RES), electric vehicles (EVs), and smart loads, modern power systems are evolving into complex, multi-source data-driven systems. Accurate prediction of operating states (e.g., voltage magnitude, frequency, active/reactive power flow) is critical for ensuring grid stability, optimizing dispatch, and reducing outage risks. However, traditional prediction models (e.g., ARIMA, support vector machines) struggle to handle the high-dimensional, time-varying, and heterogeneous nature of big data generated by smart meters, phasor measurement units (PMUs), and RES. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a Hybrid Big Data-Driven Prediction Model (HBDPM) that integrates Spark-based big data preprocessing, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) with an Attention Mechanism (AM) for feature extraction and prediction, and a Bayesian Optimization (BO) module for hyperparameter tuning. The HBDPM first processes multi-source data (including historical operating data, meteorological data, and RES output data) via Spark to eliminate noise, fill missing values, and normalize features. Then, the CNN layer captures spatial correlations between grid nodes, while the GRU layer models temporal dependencies of time-series data; the AM adaptively emphasizes critical features (e.g., peak load periods, sudden RES fluctuations). Finally, BO optimizes key hyperparameters (e.g., CNN filter size, GRU hidden units) to enhance model generalization. Experimental validation is conducted on two datasets: the IEEE 30-bus system (simulated data) and real-world data from a 110 kV regional grid in Jiangsu, China. Compared with benchmark models (ARIMA, single LSTM, CNN-GRU without AM), the HBDPM reduces the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\text{1 8. 2 \\%} - \\text{3 2. 7 \\%}$</tex> and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) by <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\text{1 9. 5 \\% - 3 4. 1 \\%}$</tex> for voltage and frequency prediction.

Energy storage systems (ESS) have become vital in addressing these challenges due to their rapid response capabilities. However, their high capital costs and uncertain profitability necessitate a deeper understanding of their economic behavior under different coordination frameworks. The coordinated optimization models are developed to investigate the impact of the ESS operational revenues under provincial and regional electricity markets. The results indicate that regional coordination enhances overall power system flexibility but simultaneously reduces the scarcity of flexibility resources. This reduction in scarcity decreases the marginal value of flexibility services, leading to lower ESS revenues relative to localized operation. Therefore, price signals reflecting flexibility contribution should be designed to maintain investment incentives for the ESS."

The success of eye color prediction from genomic data is strongly influenced by the choice of algorithms and how the genotypes are encoded. This study was conducted by comparing six classification algorithms (Histogram Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machine, Extra Trees, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression K-Nearest Neighbors) and five SNP encoding schemes (additive, dominant, recessive, additive+dominant, and one-hot genotyping). The dataset used was obtained from a source validated in related studies and consisted of 456 multipopulation subjects. The dataset used 17 SNP features with three eye color phenotype classes (blue, brown, and intermediate). The main metrics used were balanced accuracy and macro F1, as well as accuracy and ROC-AUC OvR. To ensure biological consistency, features were restricted to a specific panel of SNPs associated with eye color. This study contributes to the selection of classification algorithms and encoding methods that have varying degrees of suitability in predicting eye color. Histogram Gradient Boosting showed the best accuracy with a value of 0.913. Analysis of the encoder methods showed that the additive, dominant, and additive+dominance methods performed well and consistently in predicting eye color. Meanwhile, the one-hot recessive and genotype methods showed low performance (accuracy ~0.42–0.46) due to overly stringent assumptions and dimensionality jumps. Feature/coefficient importance analysis aligned with known pigment loci associated with eye color."

The proposed method incorporates a fast-converging twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm for transient security optimal dispatch (DDPG-TSOD) to enhance training efficiency and policy stability. By embedding critical corridor flow rewards and overload penalties into the scheduling objective function, the agent can actively recognize and avoid the risk of corridor flow violations during the learning process. Moreover, prioritized replay of failure samples and a two-stage training strategy are employed to improve sample utilization, thereby accelerating convergence and reducing reward fluctuations. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, comparative experiments with different ablation configurations were conducted on the IEEE-39 standard test system under a three-phase short-circuit fault. The results demonstrate that the combination of DDPG-TSOD with corridor rewards achieves a 100<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">%</sup> control success rate within fewer training steps, and outperforms other schemes in terms of convergence speed and reward stability.

It works via a Photovoltaic technology that directly transforms the energy from sunlight into electrical energy using PV panels. The Electricity obtained from this source can be available anywhere in the world, depending on the temperature and the sunlight available. Factors such as shading will affect the sunlight's amount reaching the PV panels, which will reduce the overall system's efficiency. Conventional maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithms, such as the perturb and observe algorithm, have addressed this challenge. However, they show limitations such as low convergence speed and sensitivity to shading conditions. This paper introduces a particle swarm optimization (PSO) based MPPT method to increase the total system performance of solar photovoltaic panels across different shading conditions and overcome the limitations presented by the other algorithms. The simulations were undertaken using MATLAB/Simulink with 4 “Tata Power Solar Systems TP250MBZ” modules connected in series; the results obtained from the comparative analysis between the PSO and the P&O algorithms are satisfactory and showcase the efficacy of the proposed approach."

The recovered spectra of multiple secondary users are compared against a cooperative reference spectrum, and users are dynamically ranked according to their KL divergence. Since KL divergence acts as a surrogate for effective signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), users with large divergence values—indicative of poor channel quality—are excluded from cooperation. This selective participation mitigates the impact of noisy contributors (which arise from the erroneous bin positions) and strengthens detection reliability. Simulation and software-defined radio (SDR) experiments confirm that the proposed approach yields substantial gains in sparse signal recovery for small-scale networks, particularly under adverse noise and interference conditions."

The Birds of Prey-Based Optimization Algorithm is applied to the proposed optimization problem to identify the LM."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes an efficient three-stage framework for N-1 Stability-Constrained Optimal Power Flow (SCOPF), focusing on the effective generation of dynamic stability constraints. First, an unconstrained Optimal Power Flow (OPF) identifies an economic optimum. Second, a gradient-based search strategy efficiently guides the system from potential instability to a critical stable operating point that is close to the stability boundary. Third, we introduce the Multi-Model Disagreement Active Learning (MMDAL) strategy, which leverages the predictive disagreement among heterogeneous models to strategically select the most informative samples, thereby minimizing costly dynamic simulations. These samples are used to train a high-fidelity linear Support Vector Machine (SVM), whose decision boundary serves as a surrogate constraint for integration into the final OPF. Validation on the IEEE-39 system demonstrates MMDAL’s superiority, achieving a fully feasible and economic solution at a modest 1.5% operational cost increase."

While existing Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) methods have achieved substantial performance improvements, their effectiveness often degrades under real-world low-frequency sampling conditions. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel compressed sensing-assisted NILM framework for low-frequency environments. The approach incorporates an analog-to-information converter into smart metering infrastructure, facilitating compressed data acquisition and transmission via compressive sampling principles. A deep dictionary learning mechanism is subsequently employed to extract appliance operational states from the compressed measurements. Experimental findings verify the feasibility and efficacy of the suggested methodology, exhibiting promising performance in scenarios with low sampling rates."

    "abstract": "Early-stage insulation faults in distribution power cables exhibit faint and intermittent transient signatures that conventional monitoring techniques struggle to detect and localize. Such incipient degradation is a precursor to catastrophic failures and constitutes a significant threat to power system stability. Because transients are sporadic and low in magnitude, traditional schemes often fail to provide timely warning or accurate fault location, making the development of reliable early-stage detection and localization methods essential for preventing fault escalation, shortening outage durations, and enhancing supply reliability. This paper reviews the state of the art in early insulation fault detection and location for distribution cables, critically analyzing the strengths and limitations of existing approaches. Building on this analysis, a novel method that integrates multi-source information, including high-frequency partial-discharge signals, synchronized transient earth-voltage/current waveforms, and distributed temperature data, is proposed. Laboratory and field experiments demonstrate that the proposed fusion framework detects incipient faults at their emergence stage and pinpoints their positions with sub-meter accuracy. The results provide a practical and effective tool for condition assessment and intelligent O&M of distribution cable networks."

In this paper, a structured review of the literature is done to analyze how AI is integrated in corporate communication, the opportunities it provides, challenges it presents, and the strategies that can be used to support effective integration. Drawing on the contributions of antecedents in relation to AI in business communication-based functions, the study compares the existent strategies and maps the gaps in research. It lists key opportunities and challenges and offers strategic suggestions specific integration strategies to particular problems. Experimental applications of AI, like natural language processing, chatbots, predictive analytics and automated content generation, supplement operational and stakeholder interactions and decision making on data. However, organizations face high costs of implementation, lack of skills, ethics and governance issues, resistance to change and uncertainty about the regulations as well as integration challenges. The results highlight the notion that AI-inspired business communication should be theorized as a socio technical system whereby technology, individuals and institutional background are harmonized.

    "abstract": "Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) systems are vital for reducing the damage caused by earthquakes by providing seconds of warning before strong shaking begins. A key challenge in EEW is the rapid and accurate detection of seismic waves, particularly the initial P-wave, along with precise identification of P and S-wave arrival times. This study presents a novel time-frequency based signal processing method termed the Median Frequency Inflation Rate (MFIR) technique for improved real-time seismic event detection and phase picking. Utilising a large, strong-motion accelerogram dataset from Japan’s K-NET seismic network and non-earthquake data from NCR, India, the MFIR approach examines spectral density changes across multiple frequency bins in earthquake accelerograms. MFIR effectively detects sudden changes in median frequency that correspond closely with P and S wave arrivals. By tuning detection thresholds, the method achieves a high true positive rate (TPR) of approximately 98% for P-wave events with a threshold of 0.7, while maintaining a low false alarm rate of 5% on non-earthquake data. Additionally, the S-wave detection TPR exceeds 90%. Additionally, MFIR offers low latency, with median phase arrival detection delays under one second for both P and S-waves, demonstrating its capability for real-time applications."

    "abstract": "In Indonesia, certified motorcycle emission testing equipment costs IDR 40–80 million, creating accessibility barriers for individual owners and small workshops. Existing IoT monitoring systems typically address gas emissions or noise separately without regulatory classification capability. This study presents an integrated portable system combining MQ-7, MQ-135, MAX4466 sensors with ESP32 microcontroller and deterministic classification based on Indonesian Ministry of Environment regulations No. 8/2023 & No. 07/2009. The device simultaneously measures CO, HC, and exhaust noise, classifying results as Safe, Needs Attention, or Dangerous. Validation against government-certified analyzers (baseline: 0.28% CO, 194 ppm HC, 73 dB(A)) through five calibration iterations achieved 21% CO error (0.06% absolute deviation) and 85% classification accuracy in the final iteration. The embedded classification executes under 5ms without cloud dependency, contrasting with computationally intensive ML approaches. However, MQ sensors exhibit humidity-induced cross-sensitivity (±15% at 60-90% RH) and temperature drift (±0.5%/°C), while MAX4466 lacks IEC 61672-compliant A-weighting, causing ±3 dB deviations. Combined with 10-15% annual sensitivity degradation, these limitations position the device as a screening tool rather than regulatory-grade equipment. At IDR 500,000 (~$32)—1% of certified equipment cost—the system maintains functional accuracy for pre-inspection diagnostics. Key contributions include synchronized emission-noise sensing, on-device classification eliminating network latency, and validated cost-effectiveness under resource constraints, supporting Indonesia's SDG 11 and 13 objectives through democratized emission monitoring access."

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the key issue of energy management in Fuel Cell-Battery Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) to improve efficiency, performance, and component lifespan. In real-world driving, inefficient energy distribution increases fuel cell tension and impulsive battery degradation. Conventional strategies, such as the PI (Proportional and Integral), frequently struggle with the complex, nonlinear energy interactions. To overcome these limitations, the study proposes an advanced dual-layer Energy Management System (EMS) integrating Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Sliding Mode Control (SMC). MPC provides robust predictive optimization for global energy management under future load conditions. To minimize state of charge (SOC) limitations, maintain smoother conversions, and reduce energy loss. SMC, chosen for its adaptability to system disturbances, improves the performance of MPC by allowing real-time correction of the state of charge (SOC), thereby improving overall system stability and maintaining flexible tracking of energy requirements. To improve system flexibility under dynamic driving conditions, establishing better performance compared to conventional methods, the integrated MPC-SMC is proposed. MATLAB Simulink results show the MPC-SMC maintains the DC link voltage at desired voltage level improving the battery SOC slew rate. A comparative analysis between the PI and MPC-SMC control is presented with measured parameters comparison."

Yet the capacity and lifetime of their battery solutions are the most critical obstacles in terms of user adoption and satisfaction and environmental impact. conventional BMS Control strategies according to rule-based and model-based approaches, which are lacking the ability of dynamic adaptation to real-world uncertainties including changing driving schedule, environment temperature and grid loads. This work examines a novel method for battery charge and discharge management based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) which is a branch of machine learning able to learn through interaction with the environment. The studies aim to apply state-of-the-art RL methods, such as DQN and PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization), to online learning of adaptive SoC stabilized charging policies with the objectives of minimizing SoC deviation, maximizing the cycle life of a battery, and maximizing power efficiency when being charged. The RL agent is developed within a simulated EV environment that is representative of real-world driving conditions, energy consumption behavior and grid interaction. The reward function has been formulated to compromise between then trade-offs of battery health, energy usage and operation readiness. Experiments show that the battery management system that is based on RL has better performance results when it adjusts the charging and discharging level, the operating threshold dynamically to the un anti-reset windup scheme basing on the input. The most important parameters, such as charge cycle life, thermal behavior and SoH retention is much better. And without damaging battery life it allows V2G (vehicle-to-grid) integration, which will provide great value for the smart grid. This research also serves as a proof point to the general intelligent transport systems field of showing that Adaptive AI can be leveraged to tackle complexity in the context of EV battery dynamics. The new approach not only prolongs battery life and enhances performance, but also paves the way for smarter, energy-efficient mobility services. The effects are immense, ranging from bringing down the total cost of ownership (TCO) of EVs to negatively impacting their environmental footprint."

    "abstract": "Wind turbine operational behavior is complex, influenced by dynamic weather conditions and internal control strategies, making performance monitoring and fault detection challenging. While traditional power curve analysis provides a baseline, it often fails to capture nuanced operational modes. This study conducts a comparative analysis of three unsupervised clustering algorithms—K-Means, Agglomerative Clustering, and Fuzzy C-Means (FCM)-to automatically identify distinct operating regimes from wind turbine SCADA data. Using measurements of wind speed, active power, and theoretical power of 10-minute intervals, we evaluate the algorithms based on silhouette scores and the Fuzzy Partition Coefficient (FPC) for FCM. K-Means and FCM (with m=1.5) demonstrate strong performance (Silhouette Scores of 0.560 and 0.559, FPC of 0.906 for FCM, respectively), effectively partitioning the data into four interpretable clusters representing states such as low-wind standby, ramp-up, rated power operation, and potential underperformance. Agglomerative clustering also identified similar regimes, albeit with a slightly lower silhouette score (0.514). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) projections and feature-pair scatter plots provide clear visual separation of these modes for each algorithm. This research underscores the utility of applying and comparing multiple clustering techniques to enhance the understanding of turbine behavior, offering a robust approach for advanced condition monitoring and operational analysis beyond conventional methods."

By integrating the network description matrix with the fault information matrix, precise fault section localization is achieved. PSCAD simulation results demonstrate that this method reliably selects and locates faults even under transition resistances as high as 2000 ohms.

    "abstract": "Choosing the wrong region size in a regional election can result in electing a candidate that is not preferred by the majority of the population. We propose a method of conducting regional elections where the election is conducted several times on the same sample, but with different region sizes considered. A candidate is then elected if more than half of the regions vote for them. This approach has the benefit of increased stability present in regional elections, but also mitigates the chance of choosing an inappropriate region size. Our proposed model offers a formula for calculating the stability of an election with multiple region sizes, and with a set amount of blocks of concentrated noise of different sizes."

    "abstract": "This research introduces a new way to personalize education in real time by combining fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) with dynamic learner behavior analytics. The suggested method uses data from ongoing user interactions, such how accurate their answers are, how long they take to think about something, their patterns of engagement, and their content preferences, to adaptively fine-tune LLMs so they can provide individualized learning material and assistance. Our technology changes learning pathways in real time based on behavioral signals, which is different from standard static recommendation systems or rule-based adaptive learning platforms. This makes sure that training is both contextually relevant and cognitively aligned. This provides a unified architecture that takes in real-time behavior cues and sends them to a lightweight fine-tuning pipeline to adjust the model's outputs on the fly. The system has been tested with both simulated and actual learners, and it has been shown to greatly enhance learning speed, user happiness, and retention rates. This research sets a new standard for scalable, smart, and context-aware educational systems that change as the student does, laying the groundwork for future uses in customized digital education."

However, uneven power loss among power devices leads to inconsistent junction temperatures, making high-temperature devices more prone to failure. By analyzing the loss distribution under different operating conditions, a switching period-based loss balancing strategy is proposed. This strategy switches between different commutation schemes on a per-switching-period basis. Results show that it not only achieves effective loss balancing but also reduces junction temperature fluctuations."

    "abstract": "The new digital ecosystems are being based on cloud environments but they are highly vulnerable to the shifts in cyber threat, which can take advantage of the stationary trust models, loose access rules and encryption functions that hangs in the air with the advent of quantum computing. The traditional models of perimeter based security fail to operate in highly dynamic cloud environments with insider based mauling, cross-lateral mauling and the zero day mauling bypassing the traditional security models. In this work, A Self-evolving Zero-Trust Model of Adaptive Cloud security with AI-based Threat Mitigation and Quantumresilient Encryption is introduced and is capable of addressing these emerging problems. AZTEM eliminates the implicit trust, validating and permitting all user, device, and microservice relations through the utilization of a contextsensitive trust engine that is reinforced by reinforcement learning algorithms. To counter the rapid adaptations of attack vectors, the system relies on the deep-learning-based anomaly detection methods such as LSTM-based sequence classifiers on cloud workload telemetry, network flow logs, and publicly accessible datasets (UNSW-NB15 and CICIDS2018). An adaptive policy controller is the basis of dynamic orchestration of mitigation strategies and uses AI-based response mechanisms to quarantine, reroute, or restrict malicious sessions in real time. Besides, the model includes quantum-resilient encryption that extends the protection of both data-at-rest and data-in-transit by using lattice cryptography to secure quantum decryption threats where confidentiality is ensured at the long-term scale. An initial deployment of AWS on Kubernetes clusters demonstrated that threat detection accuracy and false positives decreased by 27 percent and 34 percent respectively over a baseline zero-trust deployment, and performance overhead is less than 8 percent. Its application in adversarial context was assessed through measures such as precision, recall, F1-score and confidence intervals and proved it to be qualified. The architecture is not only making the cloud more resilient to the present, and the infrastructures of the quantum age impervious to the threats of the quantum age, but it is also providing businesses, governments and hard-to-secure areas in need of cloud security without a trade-off an ethical and scaleable and deployment-ready path."

    "abstract": "Accurate depth detection is crucial for underwater navigation systems such as Doppler Velocity Logs, echo sounders, and autonomous underwater vehicle guidance systems. Traditional envelope-based technique detects the arrival time of the echo by extracting the signal envelope. Although this method is simple to compute, it often lacks accuracy and results in more false echo detections at low Signal-to-Noise Ratios, especially in conditions of high signal attenuation. Correlation-based processing assesses the similarity between transmitted and received signals. However, this method can be complicated and sensitive to frequency shifts in the received waveform caused by the relative motion between the transducer and the target. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a Correlation-based Time Delay estimation technique that combines frequencydomain information with a two-stage cross-correlation approach to provide accurate and efficient depth estimation. The proposed method reduces noise and frequency mismatch effects by correlating the received signal with simulated reference waveforms. This improves robustness in low-Signal-to-Noise Ratio conditions. A systematic comparison between the Echo Envelope Thresholding method and Correlation-based Time Delay estimation technique is conducted using a laboratory setup that includes a waveform generator, signal attenuator, receiver module, data acquisition system, and Graphical User Interface to simulate a realistic acoustic channel. Simulation, laboratory experiments, and field trial results show that the Correlation-based Time Delay estimation technique consistently performs better than the Echo Envelope Thresholding method in challenging underwater situations, offering high depth accuracy, and stable performance while maintaining an acceptable computational load."

    "abstract": "We review several of the key elements responsible for driving advanced logic CMOS scaling. At the transistor level, we are entering the nanosheet (NS)-based device era with the focus first placed on single-level NS field-effect-transistors (FETs) consisting of several vertically stacked NS per device. These can evolve into 3D stacked configurations like the so-called complementary FET (CFET) with potentially different materials/crystal orientations used for the stacked channels. The trend toward using both wafer sides, triggered by the move of on-chip power distribution to the wafer’s backside (BS), enables new connectivity schemes and also opens up new opportunities for further BS functionalization, e.g., using 2D materials and oxide semiconductors. Together with advances in 3D interconnect technologies, this is paving the way for CMOS 2.0. The latter allows functional partitioning of the system-on-chip (SoC) by stacking multiple technology layers on top of each other, with the devices and interconnect schemes used in each layer optimized for a given, targeted application. The paradigm shift from CMOS to CMOS 2.0 offers great potential, but it is also a complex technological change, a de facto revolution, requiring innovations at various levels and increased interdisciplinary synergies."

This paper proposes a lightweight blockchain-assisted group authentication framework that integrates post-quantum cryptography with decentralized trust management. The scheme leverages CRYSTALS-Kyber for secure group key distribution, CRYSTALS-Dilithium for message authentication, and zero-knowledge proofs to achieve conditional anonymity and unlinkability. A permissioned Hyperledger Besu blockchain logs encrypted group keys and dynamically updated roadside unit reputation scores, enabling scalable and accountable authentication without monetary transaction overhead. Formal security analysis under the Dolev–Yao adversary model demonstrates confidentiality, authentication, replay resistance, and unlinkability based on standard post-quantum assumptions. Performance evaluation using OMNeT++ and SUMO shows up to 52.7% reduction in communication overhead and a group key update latency of 1.2 ms in dense traffic scenarios, while maintaining high throughput and effective Sybil attack detection. These results highlight the practicality of the proposed framework for post-quantum secure VANET authentication."

    "abstract": "Turn-by-turn (TBT) navigation systems are integral to modern driving experiences, providing real-time audio instructions to guide drivers safely to destinations. However, existing audio instruction policy often relies on rule-based approaches that struggle to balance informational content with cognitive load, potentially leading to driver confusion or missed turns in complex environments. To overcome these difficulties, we first model the generation of navigation instructions as a multi-task learning problem by decomposing the audio content into combinations of modular elements. Then, we propose a novel deep learning framework that leverages the powerful spatiotemporal information processing capabilities of Transformers and the strong multi-task learning abilities of Mixture of Experts (MoE) to generate real-time, context-aware audio instructions for TBT driving navigation. A cloud-edge collaborative architecture is implemented to handle the computational demands of the model, ensuring scalability and real-time performance for practical applications. Experimental results in the real world demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces the yaw rate (the proportion of vehicles deviating from navigation routes) compared to traditional methods, delivering clearer and more effective audio instructions. This is the first large-scale application of deep learning in driving audio navigation, marking a substantial advancement in intelligent transportation and driving assistance technologies."

    "abstract": "Inline code comments provide contextual information within source code, potentially enhancing readability and maintainability. However, suboptimal commenting practices, commonly referred to as comment smells, can obscure code intent, reduce maintainability, and increase the likelihood of defects. Automated detection of these smells remains challenging due to their diverse manifestations and the interplay between code and natural language. In this paper, we present a model that leverages CodeBERT embeddings to detect and classify multiple types of inline comment smells. The method incorporates systematic preprocessing of code comment pairs, class balancing to mitigate skewed label distributions, and contextual representation learning to capture semantic and syntactic aspects of the code. The proposed approach is evaluated on a publicly available benchmark dataset comprising 2,189 manually annotated code–comment pairs extracted from open-source Java and Python projects. Evaluation on a benchmark dataset shows that <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">CodeBERT</i> consistently outperforms traditional machine/deep learning classifiers in accuracy and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), establishing a new state-of-the-art for multi-class comment-smell detection. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of pre-trained, code-aware language models for detecting inline comment smells in a software project. These findings highlight the promise of code-aware transformer models for automated assessment of inline comment quality in real-world software systems."

Therein, a novel gain self-adjustment state observer (GASO) is constructed for estimating the disturbance and process states, thereby completing GASO gain update and maintenance as well as the accommodation of environment variation. To constrain sustained performance decay and steady-state evolution performance, a two-stage performance function with transient response and steady-state convergence is developed. An activation instruction based on the correntropy criterion is designed to detect faults and enable the guaranteed performance control scheme in the postfault operation scenario. Then, the proposed GASO-based PSrC framework is established to realize the scheduled process regulation level. Extensive experiment validations are accomplished on a micro-wastewater treatment process, and the regulation results on the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration illustrate that the proposed control strategy can guarantee the user-defined performance requirement while mitigating the detriment of faults and disturbance."

In order to understand and govern real-time stochastic communication, this research suggests a novel Edge-Optimized Agentic AI framework. Using a distributed Multi-Agent System (MAS) architecture, we present autonomous decision-making, lightweight stochastic inference (using Markov/Poisson processes), and localized sensing carried out by specialized agents placed on edge devices. The integration of TinyML techniques (quantization, pruning) for on-device stochastic model execution under extreme computational constraints, communication-efficient agent coordination protocols that minimize overhead, and agent-driven adaptive tuning of model parameters to handle non-stationarity are some of the major innovations. Tested using an NS-3-based edge emulator, our approach outperforms cloud-based AI in terms of decision latency by 42% and resource use by 35%, while retaining <90% prediction accuracy in the face of stochastic bursts and network dynamics. The results validate enhanced fault tolerance, scalability, and flexibility, allowing for autonomous optimization in dynamic edge contexts such as industrial networks and the Internet of Things."

An elliptic resonator along with suppression cells is used to realize the low-pass response, effectively eliminating unwanted harmonics and extending the stopband from 2.3 GHz to 20 GHz achieving an attenuation of −20 dB. At the operating frequency of 2.1 GHz, the power divider exhibits good performance, with an in-band isolation of −43 dB, a return loss of −36 dB, and an insertion loss of −3.2 dB. The suggested design is well suited for modern communication systems, where compact size and effective harmonic suppression are critical requirements."

To address this issue, a novel control algorithm integrating DPCC with a sliding mode observer is designed. The algorithm estimates the system perturbations in real time and compensates the estimation results in predicted currents and voltages generated by DPCC. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared with conventional control algorithms, the proposed method achieves superior robustness and control effectiveness during motor switching process."

To address this, we formalise the Inverse Discrete Kinematics (IDK) problem and propose a hybrid solution combining discrete metaheuristic search with a local refinement step using Discrete Gradient Descent (DGD). The method optimises joint configurations within a quantised space to minimise end-effector error while maintaining energy efficiency. Experiments on 5-DOF and 6-DOF manipulators demonstrate sub-millimetre accuracy and improved robustness over brute-force and naive rounding approaches, establishing IDK as both tractable and practically significant. Statistical analysis was performed on each of the runs to determine significant differences and equivalence before and after the DGD process."

The input neurons of the model are activated with two inputs; month of the year and hour of the day. The trained artificial neural network models are tested under two cases, in the first case, the predicted values of the neurons are compared with the actual values (for entire data). In second case, predictions of the model are extrapolated by extending the inputs beyond the training values."

The traditional ones consume high energy, while magnetic latching relays are favored for their energy - saving feature. This paper focuses on magnetic latching relays. Considering the influence of coil parameters on magnetic field distribution and the inadequacies of existing research, simulation - based analysis is conducted. It is found that by changing the frequency of the rectangular pulse current input, the coil magnetic field changes slowly in a rectangular - pulse shape at low frequencies, and oscillates with a relatively stable peak value at high frequencies.

    "abstract": "Automated leukemia detection from microscopic blood cell images plays a crucial role in hematological diagnostics, enabling early and accurate disease identification. Traditional deep learning (DL) models primarily rely on single-view feature extraction, making them susceptible to variations in staining intensity, illumination, and imaging artifacts. These limitations hinder classification robustness and generalization, posing challenges in real-world clinical applications. To address these issues, this work introduces a multi-view feature fusion framework that integrates raw images, optical density (OD) transformed images, and anisotropically diffused images to enhance feature representation. A cross-attention mechanism is incorporated to adaptively refine salient features while suppressing redundant information across views. Experimental results on a high-resolution leukemia dataset demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a test accuracy of 97.90%, significantly outperforming single-view approaches. Furthermore, an ablation study confirms the impact of OD transformation and anisotropic diffusion in improving classification robustness. The confusion matrix and ROC analysis validate the model’s effectiveness, while LIME-based visual explanations enhance interpretability. These findings highlight the potential of multi-view learning in hematopathology, paving the way for more reliable AI-assisted leukemia diagnostics."

    "abstract": "With the rapid growth of the global pet industry, intelligent behavior monitoring has become increasingly important for animal welfare and early health management. Abnormal canine behaviors—such as limping, vomiting, or bleeding—often indicate potential health issues but remain difficult to detect accurately and efficiently on resource-limited devices. To address this challenge, we propose YOLO-PetX, a lightweight YOLOv11-based framework for abnormal dog behavior recognition in intelligent pet care. YOLO-PetX replaces the original YOLOv11n backbone with the EfficientViT-SAM architecture to enhance global-local feature extraction and contextual awareness, and introduces a Decoupled Head and MPDIoU loss to improve task separation and bounding-box regression. Experiments on a self-constructed dataset of ten normal and abnormal behaviors show that YOLO-PetX achieves a mAP50-95 of 72.3%, exceeding the YOLOv11n baseline by 3.9 percentage points while maintaining a compact size (2.74M parameters) and fast inference speed (1.86 ms per image). These results confirm the effectiveness of YOLO-PetX for real-time embedded deployment, offering a practical solution for intelligent pet monitoring and early anomaly detection."

    "abstract": "As urban areas grow and transportation networks become increasingly complex, accurate large-scale traffic forecasting is essential for Intelligent Transportation Systems. Graph Neural Networks-based traffic prediction models, such as the Diffusion Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks (DCRNN) model, treat the traffic flow as a diffusion process on the graph, effectively capturing the propagation of the traffic conditions through the network. Unlike linear statistical models, GNNs inherently capture non-Euclidean spatial dependencies via graph structures. However, training GNNs on large-scale graphs is resource-intensive and time-consuming. This paper aims to study the impact of graph partitioning tools on accuracy and scalability in training GNN-based traffic prediction models. This paper integrates the Adaptive Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (AGCRN) with a domain-specific graph partitioning tool for transportation networks—the Buffoon-optimized Karlsruhe High-Quality Partitioning (KaHIP). The partitions are trained on an NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU. Tests on the California highway network dataset show that the Buffoon-optimized KaHIP framework produces higher-quality partitions, resulting in higher forecasting accuracy. We also show that the AGCRN-KaHIP integration outperforms DCRNN-METIS and baseline statistical methods. The integration achieves lower prediction errors and more stable forecasts."

The proposed framework integrates AI-powered elderly vehicle monitoring for proactive risk detection, real-time traffic analytics through decentralized edge-fog computing, and adaptive intelligent traffic lights that respond dynamically to the mobility needs of older drivers and pedestrians.Leveraging decentralized edge intelligence, blockchain-enhanced privacy safeguards, wearable health-monitoring integration, and AI-driven analytics, the system provides ultra-low-latency, resilient, and adaptive mobility services. The architecture emphasizes latency mitigation, human-centered interface design, dynamic risk evaluation, and policy-aligned cybersecurity strategies. Analytical comparisons demonstrate that local data processing combined with predictive threat modeling can substantially reduce transportation-related health risks, improve decision-making efficiency, and foster inclusive urban mobility.

While the focus of this paper is on the dashboard designs, this research is part of a larger project that uses artificial intelligence to (1) verify and depict the usefulness of the information presented with respect to its impact on student success, failure or dropout likelihood and (2) recommend alternative behaviour patterns for students and instructors to increase student success. The resulting dashboards are useful tools that allow students and instructors to self-monitor, encouraging behaviour changes that could lead to greater learning success."

Nevertheless, the current research, however, has limitations in terms of conversion efficiency, latency, flexibility, and cybersecurity, especially when putting active load and dynamic solar conditions. To overcome such problems, this paper suggests a 5G-interconnected edge intelligence architecture of hybrid inverters and smart solar battery charging. It involves deep learning-based adaptive control in controlling the inverter, edge computing in the realtime decision-making process, and cybersecurity-minded anomaly detection to defend the threats. The system model utilizes 5G ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC) to maintain an uninterrupted interaction among PV modules, hybrid inverters and storages. Experimental testing revealed efficiency of the inverters of maximum 97%, battery charging/discharging efficiency of 94% and a significant lower latency of 30-55 ms compared to conventional schemes. The suggested system offers a flexible, smart, and robust kind of next generation smart energy infrastructures."

The tickers used in this study is BBCA, BBRI, and BMRI, the top three financial companies in the LQ45 index. To mark anomalies, LSTM and CNN autoencoders were fitted and is tasked to predict the to-be-marked subset of data. Percentile-based thresholds of reconstruction errors from when the model predicts the subset is then used to mark anomalies. Following the detection phase, we correct the marked anomalies using two approaches: linear interpolation and rolling median. Evaluation shows that rolling median provides stable improvements on most percentiles while linear interpolation, especially on lower thresholds, becomes too aggresive when correcting the anomalies. Thus, degrading the predictive model performance. To help validate the tests performed, we used statistical validations such as paired t-tests, Wilcoxon tests, Cohen’s d, and bootstrap confidence intervals. These tests help confirm that mild, structure-preserving correction methods such as rolling median provide the most stable and reliable improvements. These findings show the importance and the potential improvements anomaly handling is able to provide for stock price forecasting."

There are four main variables of the study that are the NIFTY 50 stock index, the historical gold price, the price of crude oil and the price of natural gas which represent important sectors of the Indian economy. The paper demonstrates that the AI models outperform the conventional econometric models (such as ARIMA and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression), significantly in terms of accuracy of predictions, sensitivity to volatility, and the ability to fit non-linearity in the actions of variables. LSTM reduced the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) by more than 50 percent in stock market forecasts when compared to ARIMA and the machine learning model improved the prediction performance of credit default by 17 percent compared to the logistic regression model. This research uses a mixed methods design, an Integrative survey, blending model-based performance evaluation with the qualitative contributions of 100 stakeholders in the Indian financial institutions, fintech affiliates, and regulatory authority. These findings reveal a wide optimism in terms of AI to enhance risk management and make the operations more efficient and also highlight the consistent concerns about data protection, clean governance and institutional readiness. The paper concludes by calling on the urgency of explainable AI systems (XAI), effective regulatory strategies, and industry synergies so that ethically and sustainably AI should be applied in the financial sector of forecasting, particularly in the emerging economies, such as India."

    "abstract": "To address the challenges of difficult coordination and low profitability for a Virtual Power Plant (VPP) participating in multiple electricity markets, which arise from rule discrepancies, resource fluctuations, and coupled decisions, a hierarchical multi-agent deep reinforcement learning strategy for cross-market trading is proposed. First, a two-level collaborative framework that integrates bidding prices and declared quantities is constructed. In this framework, each resource aggregation unit of the VPP is treated as an agent. The revenues from multiple markets, such as spot, ancillary services, and demand response, are integrated with factors like network security and operational stability into a unified reward function, forming a two-level finite Markov Decision Process (FMDP). In this process, the upper-level agents cooperate within the reward mechanism to recommend an optimal bidding price strategy. Simultaneously, the action-decision output from the upper-level network is incorporated into the state considerations of the <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>lower-level multi-agents. Based on the updated state information, the lower-level agents devise the multi-market declared quantity allocation. Furthermore, the Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) algorithm is introduced to achieve collaborative and game-theoretic optimization for the multi-agents in cross-market trading. Finally, the proposed strategy is validated through simulations. The case study results indicate that the proposed method significantly improves the matching degree of declarations, thereby enhancing the cross-market profitability and flexible regulation capabilities of the VPP."

The system continuously monitors trunk angle deviations and provides immediate haptic feedback through a vibration motor when posture falls outside the optimal range of 70° to 110°. Additionally, the device integrates with the Blynk cloud platform to deliver real-time alerts to mobile applications. Experimental validation demonstrates accurate posture detection with response times less than one second and sustained operation exceeding eight hours on a single battery charge.

    "abstract": "Individuals who are visually impaired will utilize all of their remaining sensory capabilities to perform daily necessities, such as; navigation, identification of objects or individuals, recognition of people and/or printed material. This dependence on their other senses can negatively impact people's independence and their quality of life. For many, switching to alternative assistive devices such as walking canes or guide dogs provide some assistance, but fail to be real-time with their contextual information. This paper describes an artificial intelligent-powered set of smart glasses developed to be a personal assistant to visually impaired people. The glasses apply the latest machine learning algorithms to recognize objects, identify people by name, identify currency, read text, and give spatial information. The smart glasses operate using voice commands and provide a 180-degree view along with personalized sound feedback delivered stereo through a discreet speaker for ease of use and privacy as they navigate their environment. This work reflects a creative conception of how artificial intelligence can lead to versatile, multi-dimensional assistive devices that can enable greater independence and promote more inclusion for disabilities in our technologically advancing society. Future work will focus on expanding to a 360-degree view and improving environmental adaptation"

This paper investigates general magnetic field modulation theory for different kinds of magnetic transmission actuators. The coaxial magnetic gear (CMG) can transmit torque and rotary speed according to the magnetic field modulation. Extending this idea to linear topology, the concept of magnetic lead screw (MLS) is proposed. It can convert rotational motion into linear motion and vice versa, by helical magnetic field, and significantly improve thrust force. The capability of energy conversion is a key part of the magnetic transmission. To achieve better energy conversion, the magnetic field modulation theory is investigated. Afterwards, the electromagnetic performance, such as magnetic field modulation effect, and torque/thrust characteristic are analyzed. Finally, in order to facilitate manufacturing, a segmented manufacturing method is proposed."

    "abstract": "Most existing studies on grid-connected converters (GCCs) ignore the coupling effect introduced by the DC-side impedance and typically assume an ideal DC voltage source, which limits the accuracy of small-signal stability analysis. This paper develops a comprehensive full-sequence impedance model for three-phase voltage source converters (VSCs) that explicitly incorporates the coupling between the AC and DC sides. First, unified small-signal linearized models of the current inner loop, DC-link voltage outer loop, and phase-locked loop (PLL)) are established. Based on a two-port network representation, nine associated transfer functions are derived. Subsequently, DC-side small-signal models under constant-power source (CPS) and constant-current source (CCS) conditions are formulated and embedded into the impedance-coupling framework, resulting in complete sequence-domain impedance expressions that fully reflect AC–DC interaction. Finally, a frequency-sweep simulation platform is constructed in MATLAB/Simulink to validate the proposed model under three scenarios: ideal DC source, CPS, and CCS. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model exhibits strong agreement with frequency-sweep responses and accurately reveals the impact of DC-side dynamics on the AC-side impedance characteristics of the VSC."

A total of 9,221 YouTube comments were collected using the YouTube Data API and preprocessed through case folding, stopword removal, and tokenizing. Using a lexicon of 1,996 Indonesian profanity words, each comment was labeled as \"Friendly\" or \"Unfriendly,\" resulting in a highly imbalanced dataset (8,983 friendly and 238 unfriendly). Two transformer-based models, IndoBERT and IndoBERT-Lite, were fine-tuned for sentiment classification and evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score. IndoBERT achieved superior performance with 99.55% accuracy and an F1-Score of 95.88%, while IndoBERT-Lite achieved 99.27% accuracy and an F1-Score of 93.74%. These results indicate that both models effectively identify child-friendly and unfriendly comments, with IndoBERT offering higher precision and IndoBERT-Lite providing a more efficient alternative for real-time or resource-limited applications."

    "abstract": "The Finite Element Method (FEM) is a useful numerical tool for evaluating the electrical machine performance in two and three dimensions (2D and 3D), such as for the Axial Flux Machine (AFM), where the magnetic flux paths are distributed in 3D. However, as is well known, FEM is sensitive to the chosen space and time resolution (choice of mesh density and time step), and the sensitivity is highly dependent on the calculated parameters. This paper aims to quantify the considerations needed specifically when calculating the loss in Permanent Magnet (PM)s, the loss in the stator core, and the characteristics of the torque. The results show the threshold levels of mesh density and time resolution beyond which further refinement has an insignificant impact. Furthermore, this study demonstrates the selection of mesh density and time step resolution in electromagnetic transient simulations during the early stage modelling of AFMs. To validate these selections, a detailed analysis of losses and torque was conducted for a 2D, extruded 2D, and a 3D model. It was found that at no-load, the (cogging) torque in the 3D model is very sensitive to the mesh density, while at rated conditions, all models show less than 5% deviation of the average torque compared to the results with mesh and time discretization of a chosen trade-off point. Average core loss sensitivity to mesh is less than 1% when improving the mesh from medium to fine, for the 2D and 3D models, and sensitivity to time-steps is below 7% in 3D and 1% in the 2D AFM models. Magnet losses are sensitive to varying mesh density and time steps with a difference of 10% in 2D models and up to 3% for 3D models."

This study presents a comparison of three object detectors—YOLOv9, SSD, and Faster R-CNN—for computer vision-based adaptive traffic light control, followed by operational simulations that translate visual counts into dynamic green durations. The models are trained/validated on a public vehicle dataset and evaluated using CCTV footage of Jakarta intersections. Accuracy is measured with mAP@0.50 on the held-out set: YOLOv9 achieves 0.6310 (LR=1e−2), SSD 0.7531 (LR=1e−3), and Faster R-CNN 0.7776 (LR=1e−4). The best model (Faster R-CNN) is then applied to a decision window approximately 5 seconds before the end of the red phase to count the number of vehicles per class in the count zone, which is then mapped to an adaptive green duration with minimum–maximum operational limits. Day–night testing highlighted the challenges of occlusion, motorcycle crowding, and low-light/glare conditions, yet the dynamic policy consistently improved performance: vehicles served increased from 291 to 313 per cycle (≈7%). These findings demonstrate that the off-the-shelf detector-based green detection, count and scheduling pipeline is capable of delivering measurable throughput improvements without the need for additional roadside sensors."

    "abstract": "Global supply chains deal with large volumes of essential products, and failure to track them back, whether in fake ingredients and slow recall, or faked records of certification, represents a huge challenge to the finances, policies, and even personal safety. The inability to provide real time checks between distributed stakeholders is characterized by fragmented systems, poor interoperability, and a failure to ensure scan-free audit trails on scale. The available strategies seek to fill these gaps but fail in critical aspects. The centralized ERP/MES systems do not enhance the entire visibility but introduce one-point systems of failure and poor data provenance. Public blockchains are not only immutable, but also have the disadvantage of having high transaction costs, high response time, and no data privacy. There is a better permission control, but there is no smooth fusion of the heterogeneous networks by Consortium blockchains. In the meantime, separate AI-powered risk detection systems are able to anticipate abnormalities, but are not incorporated into the execution layer to promptly institute remedial measures into the supply chain process. This paper proposes a privacy-preserving AI-integrated Layer-2 blockchain traceability framework that leverages Layer-2 rollups for scalable, low-cost event validation and AI-powered smart contracts for autonomous compliance and anomaly response. The design integrates IPFS-based off-chain storage, cross-chain interoperability, and decentralized identity verification (DID) to ensure privacy, scalability, and trust. Results demonstrate a <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$&gt;99 \\%$</tex> reduction in transaction cost and sub-minute counterfeit detection, establishing a scalable model for global, high-value supply chains. Smart contracts that use AI carry out compliance through automatic performance in case of risk identification. Constant retraining pipelines and sharding-based scaling also ensure more flexibility of the system and its ability to fasten over the long term. Product traceability is brought out as scalable, auditable and privacy intended with this integrated design. It shows an innovative architecture that minimizes verification latency, enhances detection of frauds and does not have single point of failure. Combining real-time risk analytics with fully automated, completely independent enforcement, the proposed framework will provide end-to-end visibility needed in global, high-value, and safety-sensitive supply chains."

    "abstract": "Karana is a surveillance system driven by artificial intelligence (AI) that can identify threats instantly and react safely in ever-more complicated settings. Designed for industrial facilities, smart cities, and defense zones, Karana integrates edge AI, multimodal sensing, and post-quantum cryptography (PQC) into a single, intelligent platform. Because they rely on manual oversight, cloud inference, and monomodal inputs, traditional surveillance infrastructures are susceptible to cyberphysical breaches, spoofing, and lax reaction times. Even while AI-based systems improve visual analytics, many of them are still only capable of single-sensor streams and lack reliable, on-device decision-making, which makes them useless against threats from autonomous drones, GNSS jamming, and encrypted RF spoofing. By combining radio frequency (RF), infrared (IR), radar, and red-green-blue (RGB) video data, Karana fills in these gaps. An edge AI engine that runs Swin Transformer, You Only Look Once version 8 (YOLOv8), and a suggested quantum-inspired classifier processes these. Rapid, context-aware threat mitigation is made possible by this approach, which also removes reliance on external processing. CRYSTALS-Kyber and Dilithium2, two PQC protocols that comply with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), are used to strengthen security. A policydriven rule engine automatically chooses graded non- lethal actions, including alarm broadcasts, lockdowns, or signal jamming, based on the type and origin of the threat. Karana maintained an average inference latency of 52.9 milliseconds across multimodal inputs and obtained an F1 score of 90.0 when validated with simulation workflows. These findings validate realtime performance in hostile, low-light, and spoofing scenarios. Future stages will include adversarial robustness testing and hardware optimization."

This paper proposes a hybrid RA framework fusing Digital Twin (DT) and Machine Learning (ML) to address the trade-off between assessment accuracy and computational efficiency. First, a high-fidelity DT model of the DN is constructed to realize real-time mapping of physical system states (e.g., load fluctuations, DG output, and equipment health) via 5G-edge computing. Second, a long short-term memory-gated recurrent unit (LSTM-GRU) hybrid model is designed to predict key fault parameters (fault duration, affected range) by leveraging historical fault data and real-time DT feedback. Third, an improved Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) algorithm is proposed to prune low-probability fault scenarios based on DT-realized system states, reducing computational redundancy while ensuring assessment precision. The framework is validated on IEEE 33-bus and 123 -bus test systems, with results showing that compared to traditional MCS and single ML methods, the proposed approach reduces SAIDI (System Average Interruption Duration Index) and SAIFI (System Average Interruption Frequency Index) prediction errors by <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{1 5. 2 \\% - 2 0. 3 \\%}$</tex> and shortens computational time by <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{3 2. 6 \\% - 4 1. 8 \\%}$</tex>.

The results show that PFH has good compatibility with single-crystal silicon, PCB boards, and bakelite, and the fluorine content will decrease after compatibility with fluorine-containing substances such as fluoroceramic rings.

It is a phenomenon that machine learning models deployed in communication networks generally face. However, frequent retraining is one solution that can help resolve this problem, but it also incurs high costs and consumes high resources when deployed to large-scale real-world networks. To address this problem, this paper proposes two complementary approaches: a cost-aware retraining strategy and a few-shot retraining strategy, which enable machine learning models to stay accurate even if applied to a highly dynamic environment. The proposed approaches are applied and tested on the SOFI dataset [4]. Additionally, a comparative analysis is conducted with a baseline method. Experimental results demonstrated that our proposed models maintain a competitive accuracy under drift while reducing the frequency of retraining and adapt effectively in the scenario of limited data."

The study explores the usage of speech as an additional modality to overcome the challenges posed and enhance the performance of NER models by providing prosodic and acoustic cues that help in the disambiguation of the entities. A robust aligned data pipeline is first prepared by converting an existing text only dataset to a text and speech dataset and extracting the desired features. These along with the textual features are then fed to the model encompassing layers involving a Bidirectional - Long Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) encoder and a gated fusion mechanism that dynamically blends the two modalities together to produce the result. The results revealed a 2.36% relative improvement of the F1-score over the text-based baseline model. These findings validate the idea of the efficacy of a multimodal NER model involving textual and acoustic features and allow for the exploration of the technique in future research avenues."

Existing methods often suffer from high latency, limited local processing capabilities, and inefficient resource allocation, resulting in delayed responses and increased maintenance costs. This study proposes an Adaptive Edge-Driven Control Optimization framework that integrates lightweight predictive models deployed at edge nodes with advanced sensor fusion techniques to enable real-time data analysis and decision-making. The main goal is to bring messages across as fast as possible, ensure accurate predictions, improve constant operation and do so with as little upkeep cost as possible. AEDCO is unique because it uses a flexible way to assign resources at the edges combined with effective controls, allowing reliable and efficient operations in factories. The experiment has shown that these innovations result in a latency of 35 ms, high accuracy in predictions at $96.4 \\%, 98.5 \\%$ of system uptime and a $32 \\%$ cut in maintenance costs compared to traditional cloud solutions. Thanks to LSTM for forecasting and MQTT for live data transmission, the overall system can work with large amounts of data while being robust to errors. On the whole, using the method proposes a useful method for efficient and inexpensive smart industry automation with the help of intelligent edge-based processing."

    "abstract": "The processing of speech in acoustic cluttered environments (such as the cocktail party problem) continues to be an extremely difficult problem to the artificial auditory system. In this case, the human listeners excel at isolating and parsing speech through the use of biologically efficient neural networks, as opposed to conventional digital signal processing systems which are characterized by latency, energy dissipation and poor performance in multitalking or noisy conditions. In order to overcome these inadequacies, neuromorphic computing has emerged as one of the new radiant approaches by simulating the biological auditory pathway with respect to its structure and functionality. The framework that integrates a biologically-inspired cochlear front-end, attentional spiking neural units, and attention-directed temporal fidelity that has recently been proposed in this paper is called the Attention-Gated Spiking-FullSubNet (AGS-FSN). To achieve localization and separation of sounds, Cochlear unit performs this frequency decomposition in a neuromorphic filter bank whose phase and timing representations are crucial to sound localization and separation. Events Implemented and Gated spiking neuron, event-driven paradigm reduces computational cost and is very energy-efficient. FullSubNet-Like attention mechanism permits the selective amplification of the pertinent parts of the speech of the background speech interference to the side. Extensive experiments on noisy real world datasets reveal that AGS-FSN demonstrates state-of-the-art hearing enhancement and recognition capability, easily surpassing the conventional deep learning models by a large margin in terms of accuracies, and power consumption. The design is aimed at the neuromorphic hardware devices such as field-programmable gate arrays and event-based silicon processors, which offers a reasonable path to low-power and real-time edge AI via audition. AGS-FSN is a new milestone of robust/scalable and biologically-inspired speech processing in diverse acoustic conditions."

Although existing studies have explored the issue of EVB raw material procurement from various aspects, the impact of disruptions from cross-border material suppliers on procurement decisions is rarely analyzed. In this paper, a new stochastic resilience and sustainability winner determination model is proposed, aimed at solving the supplier selection problem in EVB raw material procurement, and integrates risk mitigation strategies such as multi-source procurement, fortification, reservation, and emergency procurement. To enhance the efficiency of solving the model, a heuristic algorithm based on reduced scenario and relaxation technique is developed. Numerical experiments based on problem analysis are carried out to confirm the validity of the designed model and algorithm. Results show that the designed algorithm achieves better performance than traditional solving methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Sensitivity analysis reveals that the maximum fortification investment budget and key parameters for emergency procurement significantly influence the selection of disruption mitigation strategies. The research results, which provide a theoretical basis and managerial insights for the sustainability and resilience of global EVB raw material procurement, especially in high-risk environments where energy supply fluctuates significantly."

    "abstract": "Most clinical data remain unstructured in the form of scanned laboratory reports, which hinders retrieval, integration, and analysis. This unstructured nature also increases physicians’ workload by requiring extensive manual review, thereby reducing efficiency and delaying decision-making. This paper presents a pipeline that extracts structured content from hematology and hemogram scanned medical reports using vision–language models (VLMs) and standardizes outputs into HL7 FHIR for interoperable exchange. A task-specific flat JSON schema and a standardized prompt guided three state-of-the-art VLMs (Qwen2.5–VL–72B, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT–5), each evaluated across three independent trials per report. Extraction performance was measured using Micro-Accuracy, F1-score, Per-Type Accuracy, and Latency under both Strict and Loose normalization modes. On hematology, Qwen2.5–VL–72B achieved the highest MicroAcc (0.83 Strict, 0.89 Loose) and F1 (0.79, 0.88); Gemini was competitive and fastest (46–56s), while GPT–5 exhibited slower processing (170–189s). On hemogram, Qwen reached the highest MicroAcc (0.92 Strict/Loose) and Gemini achieved the top F1 (0.93). Loose normalization improved accuracy by +0.05–+0.08 over Strict, demonstrating robustness to typographic variation. The best-performing outputs were mapped into HL7 FHIR R5 Bundles with integrated LOINC terminology and validated using the official FHIR Validator, confirming semantic and structural compliance. These results demonstrate that VLMs can effectively transform scanned laboratory reports into validated, machine-readable FHIR resources with minimal post-processing, providing a foundation for interoperable medical data digitization. Future work should address generalizability across diverse report formats and privacy considerations through on-premise deployment of open-source models."

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenges of voltage regulation in a long-chain looped network in a certain region of Xinjiang, where the grid is predominantly integrated with renewable energy and lacks stable power sources. In such a network, the multi-path characteristics of power flow frequently lead to issues such as voltage limit violations, reverse reactive power flow, and line overloads. Although the Static Var Generator (SVG) can serve as a dynamic reactive power compensation device to effectively support node voltage, multiple SVGs operating independently based solely on local information are prone to reactive power compensation conflicts and voltage fluctuations, making global optimization difficult. To tackle this issue, this paper establishes a multi-objective optimization function based on the continuous power flow algorithm, taking into account the stochastic nature of renewable energy generation. A coordinated operation strategy for three SVGs is proposed to achieve optimal allocation of reactive power resources and coordinated voltage control, thereby enhancing the stability and economic efficiency of system operation."

    "abstract": "Deep learning has completely transformed plant disease detection by making it possible to classify leaf conditions automatically, accurately, and efficiently. CNNs have been the most common approach to this problem so far, but they can be restricted by their local feature extraction in capturing the global contextual information of an image. This current study looks into the potential of Vision Transformers (ViTs) in classifying potato leaf diseases to go beyond these limitations. ViTs use the self-attention mechanism on images by considering them as rows of fixed-size patches. This makes the model able to learn global relations throughout the whole image, thus increasing its capability to recognize the faint and scattered patterns that are symptomatic of the various diseases. Here, the ViT model is being re-trained on a multi-class classification task of potato leaf conditions. The architecture based on the transformer model enables it to place its focus on the most suitable sections of the image in a flexible manner; hence, the model is more interpretable, and robustness is increased. ViTs, which have less reliance on inductive biases as compared to CNNs, are capable of generalizing better if they are fed with enough training data. The model set a new record by achieving a test accuracy of 99.82%. These results indicate that Vision Transformers can act as an impactful aid for plant disease classification and, therefore, are the initial phase towards more reliable and extensible solutions in precision agriculture."

This work presents AquaFed, a decentralized system for real-time monitoring and forecasting of water quality parameters and freshwater snail populations—key indicators in schistosomiasis transmission. AquaFed leverages Federated Learning (FL) in combination with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to enable predictive modeling across distributed IoT sensor kits. By training models locally and sharing only model updates, AquaFed significantly reduces communication bandwidth during both training and inference, while stabilizing local updates and accelerating global convergence, in addition to enabling scalable deployment in resource-constrained environments. Experimental evaluations conducted in a schistosomiasis-endemic region of Burkina Faso demonstrate that AquaFed achieves forecasting performance on par with traditional centralized learning approaches, while reducing the utilization of the communication bandwidth. These findings underscore the potential of AquaFed as a robust, communication-efficient platform for real-time risk assessment and proactive schistosomiasis control."

    "abstract": "India's unique electric mobility transition, dominated by two-wheelers and constrained by its distribution grid, requires a tailored charging ecosystem to sustain market growth. This paper reviews India's charging infrastructure, focusing on connector standards and their technical implications compared to global electric vehicle standards. It evaluates indigenous protocols like Bharat AC-001 and Bharat DC-001 against global systems such as the Combined Charging System (CCS), comparing operating voltages, power levels, and interoperability. While Bharat standards offer low-cost, gridsensitive solutions for light EVs, CCS provides scalability for high-power fast charging. The study also examines India's current EV market, highlighting the coexistence of diverse standards, battery types, ratings and emerging capabilities like Vehicle-to-Load (V2L) and Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G). A key opportunity lies in V2G, where an aggregated fleet of enabled vehicles could function as a distributed energy resource, providing crucial grid stabilization services and helping to cater to peak demand, thereby mitigating stress on the distribution network. The paper concludes that aligning domestic standards with international protocols, while considering local constraints, is critical for building a robust, future-ready charging infrastructure that can fully leverage these advanced V2G capabilities for India's EV ecosystem."

    "abstract": "Because biometric templates kept in databases can be stolen and misused, Face Recognition technologies now have significant security vulnerabilities. Accurate recognition is often compromised by traditional template protection techniques. Strong solutions that maintain high efficiency while guaranteeing template security are required due to the increasing use of face authentication. This study proposes a deep learning-based architecture that uses InsightFace and ResNet100 to extract features while safeguarding cryptographic templates. To protect biometric data, the system employs revocable transformations, random projection, and dynamic salting. L2 normalization standardizes feature magnitudes, enabling consistent similarity comparison while maintaining the irreversibility of transformed templates. After MTCNN based face identification, the pipeline extracts 512-dimensional embeddings and performs L2 normalization. AES-256 encryption and XOR-based revocation are used to protect the features after they are projected into a 400-dimensional space and binarized using a median threshold. The protected templates are matched using cosine similarity. With EERs of 0.00% and 6.80%, respectively, the evaluation reveals with VGGFace2 and LFW datasets 99.98% and 93. 23%, respectively. The method outperforms BioHashing with an accuracy of 11.5% in VGGFace2 and offers reversible templates. It achieves 400-bit security with less than 2% FRR in a spoken dataset, which is very viable in the real world and offers a better balance between security and performance than existing methods."

More specifically, the proposed method introduces a real-time updating parameter, transforming the nonlinear motor system into an equivalent incremental linear system, which achieves the adaptive control effect and only requires the input and output of the control system. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed control method has fast convergence ability, bounded input-output stability, and has great advantages over traditional PI controllers."

A nanogrid installed at the BVRIT academic campus in Narsapur, India, can support a load of approximately 300 watts independently from the utility grid. The system comprises six LED lamps, a streetlight, and a ceiling fan, powered by two 12V, 150 Ah batteries and a 24 V, 1500 VA, 1200 W inverter. A timer controls the operation of the loads, switching them ON at 6 PM and OFF at 5 AM. Initially, two IoT modules, each equipped with a Pzem004T and a NodeMCU, were deployed to conduct a feasibility study on real-time energy data extraction. The collected data was automatically logged into a Google spreadsheet. Over three days, the energy data was collected under varying load conditions, and battery voltages were recorded manually before and after load disconnection. The inverter efficiency was evaluated under three distinct loading conditions, yielding values of 51.72%, 43.22%, and 51.90% respectively. Future work aims to expand the Nanogrid system on campus, contributing to sustainable development goals."

The problem stated in this paper is the challenge of finding an effective dialogue policy that reflects efficiency, accuracy, and user satisfaction for task-oriented dialogue systems. This paper provides an analysis on the use of reinforcement learning techniques for dialogue policy learning for customer service applications. For taskoriented dialog systems, particularly customer service, learning a dialogue policy is crucial for creating natural and efficient interactions between human users and automated agents. Rule-based systems do not have the ability to cope with the complexity and variability of customer interaction and tend to introduce stiff and non-optimal conversations. The purpose of the study is to explore and implement advanced reinforcement learning methods for dialogue policy learning with a purpose of improving customer service dialogues in terms of responsiveness, personalization, and user experience. Based on comparative analysis and experiments, the paper compares the performance of numerous reinforcement learning methods, including policy gradient methods & deep Q-learning, in real-world customer service scenarios. The results project the potential of these methods to enhance dialogue systems to be more natural, efficient, and user-focused conversations. This paper aims to bring about the enhancement of intelligent customer service solutions prioritizing user satisfaction and interaction."

We address the problem of noisy CSI data by applying a Hampel and Savitzky-Golay filter as pre-processing, followed by segmentation of data to extract significant features. The segmented data are classified with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Residual-CNN networks. The results from the experiments exhibit high accuracy classification of 98.75% for human presence detection and 97.78% for crowd counting in differentiating between 0–5 persons. Notably, for presence detection and crowd counting experiment, the data is obtained from three rooms of varying occupancy loads and different transmitter–receiver distances, and the models performed equally well in these varied test settings. Further, The model is tested on an external dataset not used during training and 95.60% accuracy proves its robustness and generalizability across different device placements and environmental conditions. After classification the output is sent via UDP from PC to IoT device which then sends the message to authorized user devices for notification or control. This shows the capability of combining signal processing and deep learning for human presence detection and counting in real world scenarios."

To address the challenges posed by deception attacks in small time delay batch processes, prior studies on iterative learning control have overlooked the possibility that the successive characteristics of batch processes might obscure the patterns of deceptive attacks. Moreover, relying on offline iterative learning control gains leads to significant system state deviations over time. To overcome these limitations, we propose an iterative learning robust security predictive control approach, which introduces robust security set to constrain the system state within a safe range and enhance robustness. Meanwhile, the iterative learning controller integrates deception- attack related data from previous batches, which can continuous optimization and improve control performance. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method."

MediLink enables consultation within a low-bandwidth setting through integrated secure electronic health record (EHR) administration in the setting of adaptive streaming and artificial intelligence (AI) syndromic analysis. It involves the continuous use of care and offline synchronization frequents to be certain the safety of patient data by means of AES-256 encryption. The platform creates awareness on preventative healthcare and enhances cooperation between tertiary institutions and the Primary Health Centres (PHCs).

Eavesdroppers can use AI-based analysis to detect and reconstruct transmitted signals, leading to serious leakage of confidential information. In order to protect data privacy at the physical layer, we redefine covert communication as an active data protection mechanism. We propose a new parasitic covert communication framework in which communication signals are embedded into dynamically generated interference by generative adversarial networks (GANs). This method is implemented by our CDGUBSS (complex double generator unsupervised blind source separation) system. The system is explicitly designed to prevent unauthorized AI-based strategies from analyzing and compromising signals. For the intended recipient, the pretrained generator acts as a trusted key and can perfectly recover the original data. Extensive experiments have shown that our framework achieves powerful covert communication, and more importantly, it provides strong defense against data reconstruction attacks, ensuring excellent data privacy in next-generation wireless systems."

Conventional metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) gas sensors suffer from poor selectivity, and reliable multigas identification with a single device remains challenging. Here, we report a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) gas sensor that integrates two transduction mechanisms, enabling single-sensor gas identification. We demonstrate this innovative approach through the simultaneous measurement of chemiresistive response and temperature change of the sensing layer. Due to gas-specific catalytic exothermic reaction and distinct redox rates on the MOS surface, and maintaining stability under humidity, the relatively independent resistive and calorimetric signals allow robust classifications of H<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub> and CO gases across humidity conditions using linear discriminant analysis (LDA).

    "abstract": "Multi-user semantic communication enables multiple users (such as mobile devices) to collaborate on intelligent tasks, reducing communication load while enhancing efficiency. However, it is vulnerable to backdoor attacks due to the absence of auditing mechanisms for mobile users. In such attacks, malicious attackers can inject carefully crafted samples to implant backdoor neurons into the target model, which can be triggered to mispredict the target class based on the attacker's intent. Most existing defense methods for backdoor attacks are inadaptable to semantic communication systems, post-analysis, and are unable to respond timely. To address these challenges, we propose Reject-BD, a contrastive training-based defense mechanism tailored for multi-user semantic communication systems. Firstly, Reject-BD can actively apply test gradients to local semantic encoders. Then, contrastive training is used to amplify the differences in the updated test gradients of different clients to predict the credence degree of each client. Finally, the global semantic decoder is dynamically updated according to each client's credence degree. Experimental results demonstrate that Reject-BD effectively reduces the success rate of backdoor attacks while maintaining relatively high classification accuracy of the semantic decoder compared to five baseline methods."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a simplified ultra-wideband tightly coupled antenna (SUTCA) array that achieves unprecedented bandwidth without lossy materials or frequency selective surfaces. The proposed design features a remarkably streamlined architecture comprising only four components: a monopole‑type radiator, a tapered balun, a ground plane, and a PTFE superstrate. A key innovation lies in directly connecting the balun ground line to the coupling plate rather than to radiator ground arms, a fundamental departure from conventional tightly coupled dipole arrays (TCDAs). This new scheme eliminates the low-frequency loop resonance that has historically limited TCDA bandwidth, enabling ultra-wideband operation while maintaining structural simplicity. The superstrate serves as a quarter-wavelength transformer, optimizing impedance matching at lower frequencies. The simulated array unit-cell can achieve a bandwidth of 12.13:1, from 0.75 GHz to 9.10 GHz, with simulated active VSWR less than 2.64 across the whole band. Since neither lossy materials nor lossless frequency selective surfaces are employed, the proposed array radiating element maintains high radiation efficiency (>98%) and excellent co/cross polarization ratio (>52 dB) across the whole band when scanning to the broadside. The array profile remains low at 0.40λhigh without the superstrate (0.97λhigh including the superstrate). To validate the proposed design concept, a 10×10 antenna array prototype was fabricated and tested. Comprehensive measurements, including active VSWRs, radiation patterns, and realized gain, validate the simulated performance. Measured active VSWR is less than 2.82 at broadside and less than 3.46 when scanning to 45° in E-, H-, and D-planes. The synthesized array realized gain implies total efficiency higher than 80% and co/cross polarization ratio higher than 20 dB across most of the band. Simulated and measured patterns agree well for broadside and 45° scanning. This work represents the first reported tightly coupled array achieving bandwidth exceeding 10:1 while simultaneously maintaining high efficiency and good polarization purity."

    "abstract": "Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) generate vast amounts of learner interaction data, enabling predictive models to identify at-risk students. However, most existing approaches stop at prediction, offering limited guidance on which interventions should be applied to improve outcomes. This paper proposes a Causal-AI–driven reinforcement learning (RL) framework that transitions from prediction to prescription by integrating causal effect estimation with policy optimization. Specifically, uplift modeling is employed to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects of candidate learning actions, and these causal signals are embedded into an Actor–Critic RL agent through causal regularization. The resulting framework prescribes adaptive intervention policies that are both data-driven and causally grounded. We evaluate the approach on the OULAD dataset. Baseline predictive models achieve strong accuracy (AUC = 0.795) and calibration, while uplift distributions reveal heavy-tailed heterogeneity across learners. Off-policy evaluation demonstrates that the causal-RL policy consistently outperforms the observed behavior and standard RL baselines (Greedy Uplift SNIPS ≈ 0.619 vs. baseline 0.589). Subgroup analysis highlights disparities across age and gender, motivating fairness-aware extensions. A case study further illustrates how adaptive recommendations can redirect learner trajectories toward success. These findings demonstrate that causal-RL integration enables prescriptive, interpretable, and equitable personalization in MOOCs."

To address these challenges, this paper proposes a self-healing scheme tailored for distribution networks integrated with DG, based on the self-healing capabilities of microgrids. For the off-grid islanded operation scenario of a microgrid, an optimal configuration model for microgrid energy storage is established, considering both load outage losses and the cost of additional energy storage allocation. Furthermore, an improved dung beetle optimization algorithm incorporating chaotic initialization and a variable spiral strategy is proposed to solve the model efficiently. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method enhances the utilization efficiency of energy storage resources and the economic performance of microgrid off-grid operations, while effectively reducing the overall loss during the distribution network's self-healing process."

By allowing accurate adjustments and fine-tuning of signal values, division helps ensure that processed signals closely match the original, reducing errors and maintaining quality. Despite growing advancements in ternary logic implementations using carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (CNTFETs), ternary restoring division lacks systematic exploration. This work advances the field by proposing a ternary restoring division algorithm and a novel designed circuit architecture, adapting binary division principles to ternary logic. Novel modules for division specific subtraction and control logic are introduced, complemented by optimized reuse of existing ternary combinational circuits. The proposed architecture demonstrates inherent scalability for 2n/n digit divisions through modular replication. Functional correctness of the circuit is verified via exhaustive HSPICE simulations for 6/3 and 8/4 division operations."

Dynamic pricing, a core feature of RoD services, has received substantial attention for its role in demand management and its influence on travel behavior. Although GPS data and dynamic pricing in RoD services offer valuable insights for urban application research, their public release poses privacy concerns. In this paper, we introduce DynPrice-MG, an innovative framework designed to examine the influence of dynamic pricing on GPS data synthesis and to generate high quality synthetic dynamic pricing. By integrating the Mamba-2 network, which employs a selective SSM mechanism for dynamic data weighting, with Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), the proposed method generates high-quality synthetic GPS data and dynamic pricing. Experimental evaluations on real-world urban datasets demonstrate that dynamic pricing is essential for synthesizing high-fidelity trajectory data. Moreover, DynPrice-MG outperforms existing approaches in generating trajectory datasets that support urban data mining tasks while preserving data privacy."

Conventional monitoring approaches, while effective, are slow, labour-intensive, and unsuitable for large-scale surveillance. With the rapid progress of deep learning, real-time object detection models now offer a promising alternative. In this paper, we present an extensive comparative evaluation of nine state-of-the-art YOLO object detection models, from YOLOv5 to the latest YOLOv13. The models are benchmarked across Precision, Recall, F1-score, mAP, Inference Speed, and Model Size. The results provide comprehensive insights into the trade-offs among different YOLO versions, offering practical guidance for selecting models suited for scalable, real-time COTS detection – contributing to enhanced coral reef monitoring, protection, and conservation."

This paper proposes a hierarchical virtualization architecture based on a hypervisor to achieve the integration of multi-platform vehicle network functions. Specifically, a network function abstraction layer across different virtual machines is constructed using hardware-assisted virtualization technologies (VirtIO/SR-IOV), and the security boundary is strengthened by combining the dynamic packet filtering of virtual switches with VLAN isolation policies. Experimental verification demonstrates the comprehensive advantages of the framework in terms of low communication latency, high throughput, and security protection, providing a scalable technical path for the evolution of intelligent vehicle systems."

Unfortunately, the actual energy and financial savings of the implemented policies are substantially lower than what was anticipated. Although this is a complex issue, the major root cause is the lack of considering human factors, which has been pointed out in several previous studies. In this paper, we provide an overview of existing studies on occupant energy behaviors and how to incorporate such behaviors in building energy modeling in the context of retrofit. Furthermore, we propose a data-driven surrogate-based approach to developing optimal retrofit policies.

With the increase in the reliance of IoT ecosystems on real-time edge intelligence data processing, the static traditional architectures are challenged immensely in terms of energy costs, latency, and flexibility. ANEMIA overcome these constraints by using a flexible, aware context model that combines neuromorphic processing and pipeline modules of signals. It has five key elements such as a Neuromorphic Signal Encoder (NSE) where spiking neural networks extract features in an energy-efficient manner; Modular Power-Aware Pipelines (MPAP) that activate only the signal processing units needed by the workload; an AI-Driven Reconfiguration Agent (AIRA) which optimizes hardware configurations using in real-time a lightweight meta-learning framework; an Edge-Aware Quantized Learning Core (EQL-Core) that supports low-power AI inferences by enabling ultra-low precision models; and an Hybrid Data Compression It has been experimentally demonstrated that ANEMIA is capable of saving a significant amount of power, as much as 43 percent when compared to state-of-the-art methods with competitive accuracy, latency and throughput. Its framework is also typified by the great scalability and flexibility of the heterogeneous IoT settings. The ANCEMIA is developed by reconfiguring hardware dynamically at the border, controlled by AI, hence it is an important step to create intelligent edge computing systems to be sustainable.

In response to the current issues of large size and high cost of superconducting current limiters, as well as severe losses and the need for additional cooling devices in solid-state current limiters, this paper innovatively proposes a hybrid DC current limiter that combines the advantages of low power loss in the rated current-carrying state of mechanical switches and the fast action speed of solid-state current limiters. This article first conducts theoretical and simulation analysis of the current limiting process under fault conditions, sequentially simulating and analyzing the impact of parameters such as current limiting inductance, time constant, and fast mechanical switch breaking time on current limiting characteristics.Subsequently, based on the simulation results and combined with the circuit results, various components of the current limiter were designed, and a prototype of a DC900V/1000A hybrid DC current limiter was developed. Finally, a test circuit was set up to conduct a test on the fault current limiting characteristics with a DC voltage of 900V, a time constant of 1ms, and an expected peak value of 13kA. The fault current was quickly limited to approximately 7kA within 1ms, and the current value after steady-state limiting was about 6.2kA. The test results showed that the designed DC limiter can quickly and effectively limit the fault current to the set value required by the system, providing a new technical solution for rapid protection of DC system faults."

In this paper, we present a post-quantum framework for steganography which is resilient to conversion, ensuring imperceptible and secure data-embedding which is invariant to conversions within a digital environment. The framework outlined here utilises a reversible color-space transformation (YCgCo-R) in order to maintain pixel consistency during format conversion, DWT (Discrete Wavelet Transform) for fast multiresolution compression and a hybrid Mceliece + AES encryption scheme, which ensures both quantum resistant and fast symmetric security. Further adaptive deep embedding is performed using a 3D-RCNN-based hiding and revealing network designed for spatiotemporal feature preservation. This enhances plate capacity and imperceptibility. In addition, a novel index will be suggested, the Conversion Robustness Index (CRI), which will provide a numerical value for the recovery characteristics of image data over the recovery of colour space and compression indices. The framework demonstrates its performance on COCO and DIV2K benchmark datasets, yielding PSNR > 57 dB, SSIM ~ 0.999 and a Conversion Robustness Index (CRI) > 0.98, showing significantly enhanced robustness with color-space and format conversions. The proposed system offers a strong launch point for future secure multimedia communications in the quantum age."

This study introduces an emotionally responsive co-regulation framework that positions AI as a collaborative partner to support student engagement, emotional well-being, and teacher decision-making. Drawing on socially shared regulation of learning (SSRL), the framework reconceptualizes AI not as a replacement for instruction, but as a tool to aid real-time reflection and emotional co-regulation. Using a Design-Based Research (DBR) approach, the study engaged 12 teachers and 240 students across two urban K-12 schools to co-design, implement, and refine an AI-supported instructional model. A custom dashboard captured engagement signals and emotion-based cues, offering real-time feedback to teachers. Mixed-methods data, interviews, observations, system logs, guided iterative refinement of both the model and the AI tool. Findings suggest that emotionally aware AI systems can enhance teacher reflexivity and student agency when designed transparently and ethically. The study proposes design principles for affect-sensitive AI tools and provides policy recommendations for ethical classroom integration. Ultimately, this research contributes to a more human-centered vision of AI in education, where collaborative intelligence enhances, not displaces, relational learning practices."

    "abstract": "In multi-site collaborative photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting, a central challenge is posed by the modeling and exploitation of cross-site correlations. Conventional approaches typically rely on graph structures, such as the construction or learning of adjacency matrices and message-passing aggregation. however, these approaches are sensitive to topology design and noise coupling, often leading to over-smoothing and amplification of spurious correlations. To address these limitations, a unified framework termed COD-TCNet (Correlation Orthogonal Decomposition based Trend–Cycle Network) is introduced for multi-site PV forecasting. First, eigen-orthogonal decomposition is applied to the inter-site correlation matrix, yielding a set of mutually uncorrelated cooperative modes that project the original cross-site coupling into an orthogonal mode space for effective decoupling. Then, dedicated subnetworks are employed to model slow-varying trends and intra-day cycles/fast disturbances separately. A composite loss function, incorporating energy preservation, frequency consistency, and reconstruction error, is optimized in an end-to-end manner. Finally, site-level predictions are reconstructed through inverse projection. Experimental results demonstrate that, in comparison with representative graph neural networks and Transformer-based baselines, the proposed framework consistently achieves lower forecasting errors across diverse scenarios while exhibiting enhanced robustness to variations in site number and meteorological perturbations."

    "abstract": "Building energy consumption in severe cold regions, particularly in Northeast China, is a significant concern. Existing residential buildings often exhibit poor thermal performance in their building envelopes, with long heating seasons and high energy consumption for heating. This study addresses these issues by selecting a typical non-energy-efficient residential building from the 1990s in Changchun, Jilin Province as a case study. Using the building energy simulation software BESI, a physical model of the building was constructed to identify key envelope material parameters influencing energy consumption. Based on this model, the optimal economic thickness of insulation materials was determined, and a balance between retrofit investment and operational energy cost was analyzed. The findings aim to provide technical support for the energy-efficient renovation of existing residential buildings in the severe cold regions of Northeast China."

This method introduces physics-informed convolutional layers that embed power system governing equations directly into the CNN architecture, enabling the model to learn both data-driven patterns and physical constraints simultaneously. The proposed CNN-GNN hybrid architecture leverages the spatial-temporal feature extraction capabilities of CNNs while incorporating the topological awareness of GNNs to capture complex power grid interconnections. Furthermore, a causal attention mechanism is integrated to identify critical system variables and their causal relationships during transient events, providing unprecedented interpretability beyond traditional visualization approaches.

On this basis, the collision velocity derived from the dynamic calculation is utilized as the initial boundary condition to establish a refined contact model in ANSYS Workbench, allowing for the numerical solution of the transient stress field distribution at the instant of collision.

Traditionally, image-based approaches struggle under poor lighting or weather conditions. However, radar-based classification has emerged as a promising alternative by observing drone and bird RCS and Doppler signatures. In this work, we explore raw 60 GHz millimeter-wave radar analog-to-digital converter (ADC) signals for binary aerial target classification using multi-input one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D-CNNs). In this paper, three architectures are designed and evaluated on the ADC data: a 2-input CNN (amplitude + phase), a 3-input CNN (amplitude + real + imaginary), and a 4-input CNN (amplitude + phase + real + imaginary). Each proposed model employs parallel convolutional streams for feature extraction and then feature-level fusion to capture complementary signal characteristics. Experimental results show that the 3-input 1D-CNN achieves the best performance with an accuracy of 96% when trained on longer sequences. Moreover, the 2-input 1D-CNN provides stable and computationally efficient performance. Finally, the 4-input 1D-CNN suffers from reduced generalization due to redundancy despite incorporating richer modalities. These findings demonstrate the potential of raw radar signal learning for robust drone-versus-bird classification and provide practical insights for developing accurate and efficient real-time airspace surveillance systems."

    "abstract": "The recent development rate of electric vehicles (EV s) and their penetration into renewable-driven smart grids has posed a high need of efficient and variable power conversion systems. This proj ect presents three levels of CLLC resonant bidirectional DC-DC converter that can help in the reliable transfer of energy between EV batteries and DC microgrids. The system has a large voltage window of 100 V to 700 V and can therefore support the various EV battery capacities and dynamic grid conditions. In contrast with the classical unidirectional converters, the suggested system will allow grid-to-vehicle (G2V) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) operation. The converter in G2V mode provides charging power in the microgrid in a regulated manner and at high efficiency to the EV battery. On the other hand, during V2G working, it allows feeding the battery energy to the grid, thereby assisting in the peak load regulation and the power balance of renewable energy. It is a two-way functionality that can improve the role of EV s as active participants of the contemporary energy systems instead of passive loads. It is a converter topology that relies on two three-level full-bridge circuits in conjunction with CLLC resonant components. This arrangement guarantees a soft-switching operation through the large range of load and voltage values, and this greatly minimizes switching losses and electromagnetic interference (EMI). Following this, the converter is more efficient, attains a long life of the component and lower thermal stress as compared to traditional hard-switching converters. Further improvement of system functionality is done by the use of Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC). The FLC is dynamic and adaptive as opposed to a classical Proportional-Integral (PI) controller, which uses constant tuning parameters. This is improved voltage regulation, faster transient response to power outage, more stable power trade in rapid changing micro grid or EV charging environments. Besides, FLC will contribute to the development of a more elegant silhouette of a battery charging and the efficient and productive state-of-charge (SoC) development that will prolong the battery life and enhance the content of a user"

    "abstract": "Rice leaf diseases are a persistent challenge to crop productivity, and early detection is vital for preventing severe yield losses. Manual diagnosis by experts, although effective, is time-consuming, subjective, and difficult to scale in field conditions. This work introduces a Harmony Search-guided multi-backbone ensemble framework for automated rice disease recognition. The framework combines three complementary deep networks - ResNet50V2, ConvNeXt-Small, and Xception, through a two-stage fusion strategy. At the intra-architecture level, predictions from different optimizers are aggregated to stabilize backbone performance, while at the inter-architecture level, Harmony Search adaptively determines fusion weights, leading to more reliable ensembles than simple averaging. The method was evaluated on three standard rice disease datasets covering diverse disease categories and imaging conditions. Using 10-fold cross-validation, rigorous statistical tests including Friedman, Nemenyi post-hoc, Wilcoxon signed-rank, and Cliff’s delta confirmed the significance and stability of the observed improvements. These results demonstrate that adaptive fusion can enhance both accuracy and consistency, offering a robust approach for practical deployment in precision agriculture."

Coulomb counting is prone to additive error over time, despite the fact that it allows high-resolution, real-time SoC measurement. We try to find out exactly what is the rate of discharge for a Li-ion battery. Constant current (CC) control, however, is still unable to track changing load conditions even though it is accurately calibrated. This study presents a hybrid method in which in combination of CC control and CV approaches, the precision and reliability of SoC calculation are closely monitored by coulomb counting and accumulated errors are corrected from time to time by CC control for lithium-ion batteries. Our simulation results indicate that the hybrid strategy reduces the prediction errors and improves the system robustness, thus being ideal for implementation on applications such as electric vehicles."

    "abstract": "Choosing healthier milk products is challenging because labels vary widely and marketing can be misleading. Many items sold to the public as milk are actually dairy-flavored beverages with little real milk content, and a substantial share contain high levels of added sugar. These factors are linked to obesity and a higher risk of early-onset type 2 diabetes in children. To solve this problem, we propose a recommendation algorithm that formulates milk selection as a learning to rank task and employs CatBoostRanker to prioritize lower sugar while preserving beneficial nutrient composition using OCR-extracted, open, and scraped label data, so it can help parents choose suitable products for their children. The data was collected from three resources: (1) images of real packages via OCR(Optical Character Recognition) using Tesseract, (2) open data, and (3)web scraping. A comprehensive dataset of 11,318 milk products from 65 brands, compiled from OCR, open data, and web scraping, and standardized. The process includes unit standardization between per 100 g and per serving, text standardization, and plausibility checks so that products can be compared fairly. We then pose product selection as a learning to rank task that prioritizes lower sugar while preserving beneficial composition, such as adequate protein with controlled saturated fat and salt. An optimized CatBoostRanker learns preferences within relevant groups, such as brand or category. The model was evaluated using ranking metrics NDCG@k, which achieved 99.66% on the 355<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">th</sup> iteration. The system consistently surfaces lower sugar items without sacrificing desirable nutrient profiles. In future research, we will explore personalization and preference learning for different age and health profiles and extend the approach to other nutrition-sensitive product categories."

We use its features (TF-IDF) along with baselines such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or LightGBM, and try to extract local semantic features with CNN. The central contribution is to fine tune a transformer-based model on DistilBERT which uses selfattention to understand contextual relationships.

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is among the leading causes of cancer related deaths, mostly stemming from being poorly detected and diagnosed in the early and treatable stages. Conventional techniques, including X-rays, CTs, and biopsies, tend to result in late stage detection with poor prognosis. This study proposes an integrated approach to the early diagnosis of lung cancer using image processing and machine learning techniques. This paper investigated several classification algorithms such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM) optimized through Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) applied on CT and MRI imaging modalities. Publicly accessible datasets, namely the TCIA PET-CT-Dx collection and Kaggle's MRI dataset, have been utilized for evaluation. Experimental results showed that deep learning models like CNN in particular were not superior to classical machine learning algorithms for classification when used with advanced preprocessing and optimization. Random Forest reached an accuracy of 88.17%, whereas the SVM-PSO reached 87.80%. The CNN, conversely, did have great generalization and robustness across different imaging modalities, with an accuracy slightly lower than 86%. These conclusions may indicate, probably depending on some particular AI algorithms, on how an AI driven diagnostic system can help the radiologist to improve accuracy and timing of lung cancer diagnosis in the clinical setup. However, some other challenges are still hindering its large scale deployment, such as data highly varying in nature, model overfitting, a limited number of annotated samples."

Validation techniques included structural equation modeling (SEM) to verify relationships and measures such as entropy, predictive accuracy, and robustness to compare network structures. LLM-generated BNs demonstrated lower entropy than expert-elicited and statistically generated BNs, suggesting higher confidence and precision in predictions. However, limitations such as contextual constraints, hallucinated dependencies, and potential biases inherited from training data require further investigation."

    "abstract": "Through experience, operators and engineers obtain mental models of the technical processes and systems under their control. These mental models can be made explicit using, e.g., concept maps or graph representations. Aligning these representations with data analysis is challenging due to the disparity in formal rigor required for representing mental models compared to mathematical data analysis models. Data analysis is, however, considered a key enabler to improve production processes. The integration of ever more sensing capabilities in manufacturing processes may further complicate the alignment of mental models and data analysis results. This requires robust frameworks to integrate operator knowledge and data analysis with an explicit focus on application in an assistance system. We propose one such framework that centers around a three-layered knowledge graph that captures the structure of mental models, enriches it with data analysis results, and incorporates information required for the presentation to the operator in a graph-based assistant system. The approach is evaluated using cause-effect graphs and data analysis models that have been developed for quality prediction in an industrial stretch foil production use case. Using the proposed framework, all aspects are brought together in a single, systematically structured knowledge graph that is visualized in an assistance system for product quality monitoring."

    "abstract": "Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is still a major factor that leads to vision loss all over the world, especially among people who have had diabetes for a long time. Detecting diabetic retinopathy at an early stage and identifying its severity levels are crucial to intervene in time and prevent damage that cannot be reversed. This research introduces a decision support system based on deep learning that classifies diabetic retinopathy into five different levels of severity from retinal fundus images. We built and experimented a tailor-made Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) along with sophisticated pretrained architectures like EfficientNetB0 and DenseNet121. We used the Kaggle EyePACS dataset for training and testing the model. We also measured its accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate its performance. The DenseNet121 model was the closest to the real situation in the classification of instances with a classification rate of 83%. The EfficientNetB0 model (81%) and the custom CNN model (76%) were not as accurate. A confusion matrix and accuracy/loss charts gave us further information about how the model worked and where it went wrong. To make it easier for doctors to understand and trust, explainable AI features like heatmaps that show important parts of the retina were added. Streamlit was used to set up the system, which made it possible for people to interact with the model in real time using a web browser. This methodology shows a dependable, scalable, and clinically relevant way to automate DR screening, and it could perform well in healthcare locations that are far away or don't have many resources."

To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel prediction model for the electric vehicle charging simultaneity factor that integrates multi-source features within a federated learning framework. This proposed approach leverages federated learning to safeguard data privacy and enable collaborative model training across distributed sites. It employs the sparrow search algorithm to optimize the parameters of variational mode decomposition , which effectively decomposes complex simultaneity factor time series and mitigates nonlinear interferences. Furthermore, the model integrates multi-source features including temporal, meteorological, and historical simultaneity factors data, into a Transformer-based architecture to capture long-term temporal dependencies and cross-modal correlations.Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed model."

In the paper, the author introduces the Live Workplace Mirror, a next-generation XR-powered platform that integrates continuous skills enhancement into the natural workflow. By combining real-time AI, speech and sentiment analysis, and wearable XR devices, the system will enable capturing the team's dynamics at a given moment and providing subtle, personalised micro-coaching without interfering with the work process. It acknowledges the communication, emotion, gesture, and cooperation models and makes immediate and contingent individualised statements to foster empathy, individuation, and interpersonal performance. The platform is based on the principles of cognitive-behavioural learning and organisational psychology. It shifts the traditional post-modern vision of training in soft skills into a continuous learning and development framework. We present the theoretical framework, technical design, educational strategy, and implementation plan for the system, which demonstrate how the Live Workplace Mirror helps close the gap between remote training and real-world application.

This paper proposes a methodology for an optimisation analysis on transmitter power and channel delay under DSRC V2V and 5G V2I to determine the minimum required V2V and V2I communication processing distance in a rural LOS driving scenario. The methodology has been built up via simulating the maximum delay from respective Packet Error Rates between DSRC and 5G to analyse the minimum Communication Processing Distance under the worst case scenario. From the analysis, it is demonstrated that 5G V2I exhibits a lower Packet Error Rate and delay which allows for a shorter communication processing distance than DSRC V2V. This shorter communication processing distance determines that 5G V2I requires lower transmitter power than DSRC V2V for processing a safe and smooth connected braking in rural LOS scenarios."

    "abstract": "In Internet of Things (IoT) systems, embodied intelligent agents serve as a crucial bridge between the physical environment and digital services. In environments with weak textures, agents are unable to extract rich features through visual means. Additionally, traditional methods for creating high-precision maps result in significant storage overhead, which is unsuitable for agents with limited storage capacity, thereby affecting navigation tasks. Inspired by human cognitive mechanisms that leverage reasoning and selective information retention for environmental understanding, this paper proposes CogMap, a cognitive mapping strategy. By integrating topological structures with semantic information, the environment is categorized into corridors and rooms, with corresponding nodes created in real-time. These nodes, combined with odometry, enable localization and the construction of a occupancy map, thereby facilitating the development of CogMap. Leveraging the constructed map, we further design a room-to-room navigation method for validation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms mainstream topological maps in storage efficiency, navigation performance, and node sparsity, confirming its effectiveness as a lightweight semantic mapping solution for agents in weak texture environments."

    "abstract": "Occlusion-aware prediction remains a critical challenge in autonomous driving due to the inherent uncertainty of unobserved regions. Existing approaches either overestimate risk based on reachable states or struggle to predict accurate trajectories under high occlusion uncertainty. To address these limitations, we propose a unified risk map modeling and learning framework for partially observable environments. Our method integrates traffic flow risk and collision risk through spatiotemporal modeling, enabling fine-grained assessment of occlusion-induced hazards. To address the scarcity of scenarios involving occluded interactions, we introduce a diffusion-based scenario generation framework that produces realistic yet adversarial scenarios. We integrate the modeling and learning of a unified risk map into a framework that supports risk-aware planning under partial observability. Experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art occlusion-aware baseline, improving minimum time-to-collision by 0.78 times and average time-to-collision by 1.67 times. The proposed framework offers a comprehensive and practical solution for risk-aware planning in partially observable environments."

    "abstract": "Optical Frequency Domain Reflectometry (OFDR) has extensive application prospects in structural health monitoring, but faces technical challenges in simultaneously achieving high-precision continuous strain monitoring and large strain monitoring capabilities. This study proposes a novel OFDR machine learning approach targeting the requirements of structural health monitoring, aiming to develop a model with high-precision capabilities for both continuous strain and large strain demodulation. Based on the characteristics of OFDR local spectra, the proposed sequence exchange augmentation and coefficient scaling augmentation methods help the model focus on intrinsic spectral variation patterns rather than surface intensity fluctuations, enhancing generalization capability and prediction stability. The PCA dimensionality reduction method provides a novel interpretive perspective for spectral data, abstracting time-correlated spectral data into principal component feature information and extracting novel spectral features and variation patterns. This method achieves a 90% reduction in dimensions while preserving over 99% of the cumulative explained variance, providing machine learning models with a more structured and information-dense feature space. The weighted ensemble capability of the AutoGluon framework can integrate different high-performance models, maintaining excellent demodulation performance in both continuous strain and large strain scenarios by synthesizing the predictive capabilities of various models. Furthermore, the framework’s automated processing and multi-layer stacking architecture efficiently explore model combinations, significantly improving training efficiency and providing researchers with more comprehensive model performance perspectives and data evidence. The trained weighted ensemble model achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 2.4 in continuous strain measurement and an MAE of 16.4 under 3000μϵ large strain conditions, simultaneously possessing high-precision demodulation capabilities for both continuous varying strain and large strain scenarios. This study provides a new technical paradigm for the deep integration of OFDR with high-performance machine learning algorithms, offering efficient and effective solutions for the entire OFDR machine learning pipeline from data augmentation to data processing, model training and optimization. The approach meets structural health monitoring application requirements and provides technical support for OFDR system applications in this field."

    "abstract": "Modern grid codes require wind power plants to provide sufficient reactive-power capability at the point of common coupling (PCC) to maintain voltage security. Meeting these provisions is challenging because plant-level reactive support depends on converter limits, operating voltage, and network constraints. This paper proposes a two-part approach: a multi-objective genetic algorithm co-optimizes the placement and MVAr ratings of shunt capacitor and reactor banks in the collector system, and a supervised classifier enables rapid compliance screening without solving a power-flow problem for every new operating point. Candidate designs are assessed by AC power-flow analysis under turbine voltage-dependent P–Q limits, bus-voltage bounds, and branch-loading limits; a reactive power deviation metric quantifies how closely the PCC envelope tracks the required curve across voltage and active-power levels, and a knee solution is selected to balance low losses with near-boundary compliance. Using labels derived from these evaluations—infeasible, feasible with increased losses, and feasible with reduced losses—classifiers (artificial neural network, support vector machine, decision tree, bagged trees, k-nearest neighbors) are trained on only the operating condition and compact device descriptors. The classifier provides near-instant compliance screening without per-case power flow and achieves 98.7% accuracy on a stratified holdout, with residual errors concentrated near class boundaries. A case study aligned with Turkish grid-code practice shows that minimally compliant device sizes can satisfy the PCC capability curve while keeping losses low, enabling fast pre-selection of feasible operating scenarios and informed siting/sizing of reactive support."

Passive RIS are limited by multiplicative path loss, while active RIS implementations introduce uncontrolled noise amplification and significant power consumption. To overcome these dual constraints, we propose a hybrid active-passive RIS (HRIS) architecture. The proposed design synergistically incorporates a minimal number of active amplifying elements within a passive structure to maximize the secrecy rate (SR). The problem of SR maximization is tackled by jointly optimizing the base station beamforming vectors and the HRIS reflection coefficients. To address the non-convexity of the optimization problem, we decompose it into three subproblems of optimizing the transmitter beamforming, phase shift coefficient and amplification coefficient. These sub-problems are solved iteratively within an alternating optimization framework. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed design effectively balances secrecy performance and power consumption, providing a resource-efficient solution for secure MIMO communications."

    "abstract": "Recent developments in few-shot out-of-distribution (OOD) detection have yielded remarkable performance, benefiting from large pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs). Our prior work focuses on using in-distribution (ID) knowledge as references to learn richer knowledge beyond the textual semantics of class labels, which is prone to cause the model overconfidence and results in a limited score gap between ID and OOD data. In this paper, rather than treating ID knowledge as references, we propose Prompt Learning with Neutral Knowledge (PLNK) to better differentiate ID from OOD data. Our key insight lies in leveraging diverse neutral knowledge to improve ID discrimination while alleviating the inherent model overconfidence on OOD data induced by ID knowledge, thereby capturing the notable discrepancy between ID and OOD data. By introducing neutral knowledge with a balanced degree of similarity to both ID and OOD data, we amplify the discrepancy between the learnable prompt and the references (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i.e</i>., diverse neutral knowledge) for ID data, while reducing it for OOD data. In this way, the simple yet effective PLNK framework brings a notable score gap between ID and OOD data, thereby improving OOD detection. Moreover, we incorporate the visual neutral prompt with richer semantics alongside the original text-only reference. Comprehensive experiments show that our method consistently surpasses current state-of-the-art methods. The codes will be released publicly."

However, The applications of LMMs to railway defect detection remains challenging due to domain-specific knowledge gaps and limitations in fine-grained visual reasoning. To address the above challenges, we propose an innovative multimodal prompt learning approach for railway defect detection, named RailDefect-MPL, which generates detailed textual descriptions of exceptions based on LLM and replaces generic exception labels with specific prompts. The descriptions are embedded into text templates to enhance text-image alignment. For localization, Grounding DINO provides preliminary location and a Split Resize Module (SRM) to refine high-resolution anomaly regions. The fused visual-textual features enable the LLMs to generate accurate anomaly detection and support dialogue. Extensive experimental results on a real-world railway dataset demonstrate that the proposed RailDefect-MPL achieves state-of-the-art performance with 93.1% AUC in image-level defect detection, while maintaining robust performance in few-shot scenarios.

This study proposes a structured framework for designing generative pre-training transformer (GPT)-based conversational agents to optimize the delivery of corrective feedback in second-language (L2) speaking tasks.

The framework specifies prompt engineering strategies, error detection mechanisms, and task sequencing protocols grounded in L2 acquisition theory while acknowledging the current limitations of GPT technology in educational contexts. Unlike existing generic chatbot approaches, the proposed framework (1) provides systematic feedback differentiation based on the error characteristics and learner proficiency levels, (2) outlines realistic implementation scenarios specifically tailored for language education, though it has yet to be tested with actual learners, and (3) offers concrete implementation guidelines, including robust prompt templates; evaluation metrics for complexity, accuracy, and fluency; and ethical protocols for learner data protection.

A Stackelberg game formulation is used to model the interaction between the ESO and user aggregators. The framework incorporates renewable energy uncertainty modeling using Markov Monte Carlo (MMC) and hierarchical clustering, detailed equipment modeling for energy production, conversion, and storage, as well as incentive-based demand response and a tiered carbon trading mechanism.

    "abstract": "Bird species identification is a prerequisite to biodiversity tracking, ecological studies, and wildlife conservation. Clearly identifying the species of birds enables researchers to monitor populations, detect changes in habitats, and inform effective conservation measures. However, the classification carried out traditionally by bird experts is usually time-consuming, laborious, and subject to human error, necessitating the use of strong automated mechanisms. In this research, we present a framework based on the use of deep learning techniques to classify bird species based on convolutional neural networks (CNN). VGG19 and EfficientNet-B3 were used, implemented, and analyzed on a dataset comprising 200 bird species with diverse visual features, totaling 2,400 images. Detailed experiments were conducted to determine the output of the competing models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. VGG19 achieved an accuracy of approximately 79.70 percent, while EfficientNet-B3 delivered superior performance with 98 percent accuracy, demonstrating the benefit of optimized compound scaling and efficient feature extraction. Our results indicate that birds can be automatically recognized very effectively based on the use of deep CNN-based models, representing important instruments used in ecological research as well as biodiversity conservation. This framework is capable of being used to support the conduct of largescale monitoring programs as part of developing smart wildlife management systems. The significant performance gap between the two architectures highlights the importance of model selection in fine-grained classification tasks. Both VGG19 and EfficientNetB3 were fine-tuned using ImageNet pre-trained weights, so as to leverage the transfer learning for better performance on the bird dataset. Such initialization helped the models to retain rich low-level visual features learned from large-scale natural images and accelerated the convergence on our limited dataset. By transferring these generalized representations, the networks required less training samples and resulted in significantly higher accuracy on fine-grained bird species recognition."

    "abstract": "Powering a DC load from a single-phase system requires a cascaded two-stage configuration, which includes a Power Factor Correction (PFC) front-end, typically a boost PFC, followed by a point-of-load (POL) DC-DC converter. Elevated boost PFC output voltage increases the voltage stress of the POL converter. Moreover, the PFC DC-link voltage exhibits second harmonic voltage ripples, which are filtered out by bulky electrolytic capacitors. This requires a huge space and results in compromising with the power density. The use of electrolytic capacitors increases the hold-up time and energy support; however, the overall system life expectancy of the system is shortened. To address these issues, this paper proposes a structure by integrating a buck PFC with a shunt ripple cancellation converter (RCC). The inherent step-down capability of the buck PFC eliminates the high stress on POL, whereas RCC significantly absorbs the <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{1 0 0} \\boldsymbol{/} \\mathbf{1 2 0 ~ H z}$</tex> load voltage ripple with a reduced amount of bus capacitance. Moreover, to control the RCC, a simple control structure is proposed, which consists of a single PI controller and a feedforward DC bus voltage sensing loop. Simulation and experimental results indicate that the proposed structure and the control mechanism significantly reduce the DC-link voltage ripple and effectively minimize the output capacitor size by a factor of five."

    "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones, are increasingly used across diverse domains, including logistics, agriculture, surveillance, and defense. While these systems provide numerous benefits, their misuse raises safety and security concerns, making effective detection mechanisms essential. Acoustic sensing offers a low-cost and non-intrusive alternative to vision or radar-based detection, as drone propellers generate distinctive sound patterns. This study introduces AUDRON (AUdio-based Drone Recognition Network), a hybrid deep learning framework for drone sound detection, employing a combination of Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) spectrograms processed with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent layers for temporal modeling, and autoencoder-based representations. Feature-level fusion integrates complementary information before classification. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that AUDRON effectively differentiates drone acoustic signatures from background noise, achieving high accuracy while maintaining generalizability across varying conditions. AUDRON achieves 98.51% and 97.11% accuracy in binary and multiclass classification. The results highlight the advantage of combining multiple feature representations with deep learning for reliable acoustic drone detection, suggesting the framework’s potential for deployment in security and surveillance applications where visual or radar sensing may be limited."

    "abstract": "In the age of cloud computing and big data analytics, how to protect the privacy of sensitive information in the computation is a severe problem. Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is an interesting proposal to this problem as it allows performing computations on encrypted data without the need to decrypt it. Most known FHE schemes to date are however public key based and have a prohibitive computational and storage overhead, thus not useful in practice. In this paper, we propose efficient symmetric key based fully homomorphic encryption scheme which reduces computation complexity drastically without compromising the high level of security. The proposed scheme has its advantages of faster encryption, decryption, and evaluation time than the conventional public-key FHE systems by using lightweight symmetric key primitives and optimizations of homomorphic operations. The scheme can support additive and multiplicative homomorphism and therefore well-suited to many privacy-preserving tasks, such as secure cloud computation, encrypted data search, and private machine learning. The discussed symmetric FHE model is a good candidate to be used in practice in the cases when it is required to provide security and efficiency in computations."

This work evaluates multimodal architectures that utilise various BERT text encoders with CNN image encoders to detect depressive expression in tweets. Our dataset consists of manually collected Twitter posts that were labeled by experts and crowd annotators. The best-performing model, RoBERTa+ResNet50, as per the accuracy, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

The proposed topology introduces asymmetric dual PM excitation, which simultaneously generates both second-order harmonic magnetomotive force (MMF) in the primary excitation (PE) and second-order harmonic permeance in the secondary excitation (SE). The paper first outlines the machine topology and operating principles under dual PM excitation. The main working principle is analyzed based on analytical modeling and further validated through finite element analysis (FEA). Finally, the electromagnetic performance of the DPMLM is evaluated and compared with other PMLMs. It is shown that the proposed DPMLM can achieve approximately 138% of the conventional PMLM's thrust force density while using merely 71% of the rare-earth PM volume over a 10-meter travel distance."

Treatment requires early diagnosis; however, normal methods involve a physical examination and bone mineral density tests may overlook early bone defects. It is a customized VGG19 deep learning model that predicts knee osteoporosis with X-ray images. The VGG19 model that has a high performance in the image classification was altered into binary (healthy versus osteoporotic) classification with the help of the transfer learning. The model with both the Healthy and Osteoporosis category was trained and tested on a dataset of knee X-rays consisting of 1,258 training images, 315 validation images, and 472 testing images. The model performed excellent with a high level of recall, F1-scores, and accuracy of 97.5, which is extremely good with a high level of precision of 0.97. The general training and good generalization were observed in the generalization and confusion matrix with only 12 false negative and no false positives with the confusion matrix reveling the true validation loss although sporadic variations were observed in the training and validation loss. The document confirms the capability of deep learning models particularly VGG19 to automatize the detection of knee osteoporosis and, therefore, improve diagnostics accuracy. This plan can significantly enhance patient outcome since it provides physicians with a powerful tool of early diagnosis."

While deep learning has shown promise in improving diagnostic accuracy, its deployment on low-power edge devices remains a significant challenge due to computational constraints and interpretability issues. In this study, we propose a robust and interpretable deep learning framework for multiclass skin cancer detection, specifically optimized for resource-constrained environments such as rural clinics. The framework leverages an ensemble of lightweight CNN architectures-MobileNetV2, EfficientNetB0, and DenseNet121—combined via a feature fusion strategy to enhance classification performance. Advanced preprocessing, data augmentation, and class-balancing techniques are applied to improve generalizability on the HAM10000 dataset. Grad-CAM is integrated to provide visual explanations of model decisions, enhancing clinical trust. The proposed model achieves an accuracy of 98.25% with an inference time of 0.01 seconds on Raspberry Pi 5, demonstrating its feasibility for real-time, portable, and reliable skin cancer screening. This approach holds promise for democratizing dermatological diagnostics and improving early detection outcomes in underserved healthcare settings."

    "abstract": "Equivalent-circuit models (ECMs) are widely used to represent the electrical behavior of Li-ion batteries in battery management tasks for state estimation and control. A common approach for parameterizing an ECM is to perform pulse-relaxation tests and estimate model parameters from the recorded current-voltage data. This paper presents an improved two-stage least-squares (LS) estimation framework for estimating the ECM parameters of a battery, along with the open-circuit voltage, from such data. In the proposed method, the time constants are first estimated using a LS formulation, followed by a second LS step to determine the remaining circuit parameters. Compared to nonlinear LS techniques, the two-stage linear LS approach offers several advantages: it requires no initial guess, guarantees global convergence, simplifies stability analysis, enables experiment-design optimization, and achieves high computational efficiency due to its non-iterative structure. Experimental validation using data from four cylindrical Li-ion cells demonstrates the accuracy of the proposed method, achieving voltage-prediction errors below 1 mV across the battery operating range, making it a suitable choice for on-board battery management tasks."

This study assesses the feasibility of a Hybrid Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) approach for patient-controlled EHR access, focusing on performance, cost, security, and usability. The proposed design integrates TLS 1.3 with hybrid key encapsulation (X25519+ML-KEM-768) and ML-DSA, Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) R4 off-chain storage, Ethereum Proof-of-Authority smart contracts for grant/revoke operations and on-chain indices, and IPFS for large objects. Synthetic EHR workloads generated by Synthea were tested under realistic network impairments, with handshake latency, end-to-end read/write latency, throughput, revocation latency, and gas units as primary endpoints, and attack resilience and usability scores as secondary endpoints. Results show that Hybrid PQC increases TLS handshake latency by about 25% compared with ECC-only, while maintaining approximately 91% of baseline throughput. Revocation latency averaged 1.84 seconds and consent transactions consumed about 85k gas units, while attacks such as man-in-the-middle, downgrade, and replay were fully prevented under policy. Usability testing indicated acceptable performance with a System Usability Scale score of 78.5. These findings suggest that Hybrid PQC enables quantum-ready, auditable, and patient-centric EHR access with bounded overhead and minimal impact on clinical throughput, while also highlighting the need for multi-site validation and further optimization of PQC performance in healthcare contexts."

    "abstract": "Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks remain one of the most critical and persistent threats to network security, causing severe service disruptions and economic losses by overwhelming network infrastructures with malicious traffic. Traditional detection frameworks, which rely on static or pre-trained AI classifiers, often fail to identify newly emerging or stealth attack variants due to their limited adaptability and lack of real-time learning capability. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes an Adaptive Meta-Learning Framework integrated with Hybrid AI Classifiers for intelligent, real-time DDoS detection and mitigation. The proposed framework employs meta-learning to rapidly adapt to novel attack scenarios using minimal data, thereby enhancing model generalization and resilience to zero-day threats. A hybrid ensemble architecture combining Graph Neural Networks (GNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) is developed to capture spatial, temporal, and topological characteristics of network traffic. To strengthen robustness, an adversarial training module based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is incorporated, enabling resistance against evasion and adversarial attacks. For dynamic response, a reinforcement learning-based mitigation agent autonomously selects optimal countermeasures-such as IP blocking and rate limiting-balancing network performance and service continuity. Furthermore, an edge-cloud collaborative processing layer distributes computational tasks efficiently, ensuring low latency at the edge and scalability in the cloud. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets (CICIDS2017, CICDDoS2019) and adversarially generated data demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior detection accuracy (85.7%), faster adaptation speed, and improved mitigation effectiveness compared with state-of-the-art baselines. The research establishes a comprehensive, intelligent, and scalable defense mechanism capable of maintaining network integrity in evolving threat environments. This work contributes a novel synthesis of meta-learning, hybrid ensemble intelligence, and reinforcement-based mitigation for real-time, adaptive DDoS protection."

Wrist rigidity is quantified using synchronized Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs), while acoustic features extracted from sustained phonation are used to predict UPDRS scores via an XGBoost regression model. Both modalities are fused to generate a unified Medication Response Score (MRS), providing a continuous estimation of patient state rather than categorical ON/OFF detection. This multi-modal fusion will be performed using an application-based system responsible for all data processing and user interaction.

    "abstract": "This study presents a new framework for rural electrification in village, Kerala, India, that utilizes machine learning (ML) and IoE (Internet of everything) to improve techno-economic performance. The framework is IoE integrated and hybrid solar-wind-biomass. Using the IoE platform, data is collected in real-time via Message queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocols from a variety of distributed energy resources, including 50 kW of PV, 20 kW of wind, 30 kW of biomass, 100 kWh of Li-ion storage, and an 800 kWh/day load. While ML algorithms such as Long short-term memory (LSTM) for forecasting and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for dispatch then optimize system sizing and operation under Kerala's monsoonal climate, HOMER (Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Energy Resources) Pro (v3.16) conducts techno-economic analysis. The results show that compared to diesel baselines, there is a 25 % reduction in Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) (from <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\$ 0.12 / \\text{kWh}$</tex> to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{\\$ 0. 0 9 / k W h}$</tex>), 99.5% continuity of supply (LPSP <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$&lt;\\mathbf{0. 5 \\%}$</tex>), and 150 tons/year abatement of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\text{CO}_{2}$</tex>.

With the purpose of determining the most successful methods in which context-aware artificial intelligence improves communication via enhanced customization, efficiency, and appropriateness, this study conducts an analysis of twenty-five current research originating from academic and industrial sources.

It has been shown by the results of the review that there have been significant shifts in the amount of time required to complete tasks, the level of contentment experienced by users, and the degree of discomfort experienced by users when conversing with other individuals. The study investigates the safety of data, the degree to which individuals have faith in the system, the way in which the system functions as whole, and the methods for dealing with ambiguity. By doing a substantial amount of research and putting prototypes through rigorous testing, businesses have the potential to design communication systems that are honest, adaptable, and ready to expand.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have made it possible to produce very realistic deepfake electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, posing serious threats to data integrity, clinical decision-making, and biometric security. This work presents use of Temporal convolutional networks (TCN) which enables simultaneous capture of local waveform characteristics and global temporal patterns, ensuring comprehensive signal representation for distinguishing deepfake from authentic ECG signals. Our approach emphasizes Intra-lead analysis, where models are trained to learn temporal patterns within individual ECG leads, rather than relying on interlead correlations. This helps the models focus on lead-specific morphological cues that may be subtly distorted in synthetic ECGs, avoiding artifact-based learning. We test the approach on a collection of 10-second ECG records at 500 Hz sampling rate, which is evenly split between authentic and artificially generated signals. With early stopping and learning rate tuning, the proposed TCN model attained accuracy of 98.58% at a learning rate of 0.001. Results reflect the susceptibility of AI-based healthcare systems to adversarial-generated physiological signals and the necessity for secure frameworks to guarantee the authenticity of ECG data."

Manual traditional methods of inspection are time-consuming, error-prone and do not scale. In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based model for real-time plant leaf disease identification using a new lightweight convolutional network (AgroNet-Light) optimized in relation to edge computing. Different from previous methods like entropy- aware data sampling, interpretability via Grad-CAM and adaptive feedback for model evolution in their own way, our work combines them with each other. Quantitative experiments on joint datasets, which contain field-captured images, show that the proposed model is robust under diverse visual conditions and capable of generalizing across crops and regions. Additionally, we demonstrate how the optimization techniques such as quantization and pruning enable integration with mobile and IoT devices without compromising prediction accuracy. Our work provides a deployment-ready farmercentred initiative, that not only diagnoses the disease, but also educates the user thereby paving the path toward a participatory and smart farming future."

The core innovation of this work is the reuse of pre-simulated optimization data to develop a fast and reusable predictive model, thereby eliminating the need for new simulations in Computer Simulation Technology (CST) Studio Suite during the design phase. The proposed Pattern-Based Predictive Optimization (PBPO) framework transforms a compact set of PSO/GA optimization results into regression-based equations that map the operating frequency directly to the dominant antenna dimensions (L<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</inf> and W<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</inf>). We demonstrate this framework through the design of an E-shape microstrip patch antenna, where the predictive model efficiently generates geometry without iterative full-wave computation. The results show that PBPO significantly reduces design time while maintaining dimensional consistency with conventional optimization methods.

Conventional machine learning and time series methods tend to find it difficult to manage intricate patterns over space and time, particularly when facing large amounts of data and multiple types of data. To this, the Crime Pattern Analyzer makes use of advanced AI technologies to categorize crimes, forecast future cases, and ascertain where crimes occur more efficiently. The system uses CatBoost, a robust algorithm capable of processing categorical and imbalanced data. It achieved over 90% F1-score in identifying crimes like burglary and theft, and improved classification accuracy by 13-15% compared to older models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest. To comprehend how crimes occur over time, a GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) network was employed, which achieved 87% accuracy for recording weekly and monthly trends and minimized over fitting by 20%. For predictive purposes of trend in future crime, the Prophet model identified seasonal peaks, as denoted by thefts and assaults increasing by <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$18-22 \\%$</tex> in months like March and October.

    "abstract": "In recent years, multimodal learning has become essential in robotic vision and information fusion, especially for understanding human behavior in complex environments. However, current methods struggle to fully leverage the textual modality, relying on supervised pretrained models, which limits semantic extraction in unsupervised robotic environments—particularly with significant modality loss. These methods also tend to be computationally intensive, leading to high resource consumption in real-world applications. To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-Modal Mamba-Enhanced Transformer (M3ET), a lightweight model designed for efficient multimodal learning, particularly on mobile platforms. By incorporating the Mamba module and a semantic-based adaptive attention mechanism, M3ET optimizes feature fusion, alignment, and modality reconstruction. Our experiments show that M3ET improves cross-task performance, with a 2.3 times increase in pre-training inference speed. Particularly, the core VQA task accuracy of M3ET remains at 74.18%, while the model’s parameter count is reduced by 66.63%. Although performance on the EQA task is limited, M3ET’s lightweight design makes it well-suited for deployment on resource-constrained robotic platforms."

The proposed MCSCHG9LI comprises a single DC supply, two capacitors, eight switches, and a pair of diodes to provide nine distinct levels of output. When contrasted to other relevant inverter systems, the MCSCHG9LI requires the minimum possible of components. Additionally, employing a Unipolar variable frequency multi-carrier modulation technique with a Trapezoidal reference enhances the quality of the waveforms developed. The results of MATLAB simulations are used to assess the MCSCHG9LI’s overall functionality. This assessment relies upon the relatively low total harmonic distortion and high DC bus utilization achieved by successful utilization of a variety of UTVFPWM controls and modulation indices."

The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves an SOC estimation error of less than 1%.

Gait-based fall prediction generally uses motion data captured using wearable inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors, vision sensors, and pressure sensors. Despite growing interest in Smartphone-based fall prediction, these systems often face distrust among clinicians, questioning its clinical reliability. In this experimental study, we present a comparison of the interpretability and trustworthiness of automated fall prediction models trained on mobile IMU data and wearable IMU data. For this purpose, a bidirectional Long Short-term Memory model is trained on two standard datasets - MobiFall and KFall. The MobiFall dataset incorporates data from a smartphone of participants engaging in various activities and a range of falls. The KFall dataset includes falls and daily activities of individuals, collected using waist-worn IMUs. We utilize SHapley (SHAP) Additive exPlanations and Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) approach to explain the model’s predictions for both datasets. The predictor variables are analyzed for their contribution to the performance of the prediction models. The interpretability of the variables derived from smartphone and wearable IMU devices is compared to validate the applicability of mobile sensors for fall prediction. The maximum SHAP values reported for the MobiFall and the KFall datasets are 0.01877 and 0.0202, respectively. The visualization of the LRP relevance score demonstrates a deeper understanding of the features in the deep learning model that enhance the trustworthiness of systems designed to predict falls, enabling clinicians to provide more informed patient care, treatment plans, and interventions."

While MTPV control in the rotor flux-oriented frame is established in literature, this work extends the analysis to air-gap flux and current-oriented reference frames as well. Based on comparative assessment, the most appropriate reference frame is selected for implementation. The simulation and experimental results corresponding to the final selected reference frame are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed MTPV control approach.

Three SR models, SFMNet, FishFSRNet, and MAIC, were trained to upscale 8×8 LR facial images from the UTKFace dataset to 128×128 pixels (16× SR). All experiments used a stratified 80:10:10 train, validation, and test split. The SR models were trained with the Adam optimizer for 50 to 100 epochs with early stopping, while the recognition models, GRA_Net, XceptionAG, and a modified CNN, were trained using Adam or SGD under the same early stopping technique. Results show that deep learning recognition models perform poorly when directly applied to 8×8 images. FishFSRNet was identified as the strongest SR model in reconstruction quality, achieving an SSIM of 0.7598 and a PSNR of 25.28 dB on the test set. Across all SR and recognition model combinations, SR consistently improved recognition-stage performance. The best overall results were obtained by combining the XceptionAG recognition model with the SFMNet SR model, producing the lowest Mean Absolute Error of 6.3956 years for age estimation and the highest gender classification accuracy of 0.8880. These findings demonstrate that a two stage SR enhanced pipeline provides a reliable and effective approach for recognition tasks in severe low resolution scenarios."

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning has been successfully applied to continuous state space problems, with neural networks widely employed for adaptive evaluator research. It has also been utilised for solving the Hamilton-Jacobi Bellman equation in online learning for partially constrained input systems. Theoretical proofs in this field remain largely confined to specific scenarios such as linear-quadratic (LQ) systems, with limitations including the inability to guarantee optimal policy discovery or demonstrate narrow scope. This paper therefore proposes an integral reinforcement learning (IRL) algorithm based on an actor-critic architecture to address these challenges. The IRLbased controller design analyses the implementation of four adaptive critic variants within LQR, integrating actor-critic and experience replay online learning algorithms to address optimal control for partially unknown continuous-time systems subject to input constraints. The Linear Quadratic Regulation (LQR) optimal controller utilises the Integral Reinforcement Learning (IRL) algorithm to update critic network weights, providing an online adaptive solution for partially unknown systems. This experiment demonstrates that the IRL algorithm, based on an Actor-Critic architecture, converges to theoretically optimal solutions without relying on system dynamics models. The stable convergence of the weight vector yields results that closely match the theoretical optimum. This work not only resolves optimal control problems for partially unknown continuous-time systems subject to input constraints but also designs controllers that are more intelligent, reliable, and adaptable, bridging control theory and reinforcement learning."

    "abstract": "Underwater speech communication suffers from bandwidth limits, multipath fading, and Doppler distortions that degrade intelligibility. Conventional vocoders transmit spectral features that are highly Doppler-sensitive. This paper proposes a Zero-Crossing Deep Autoencoder Vocoder (ZC-DAEV) that exploits the Doppler-robustness of inter–zero-crossing intervals (IZCI) and compresses them with deep autoencoders. Mathematical analysis shows that normalized IZCIs are invariant up to a global scaling factor, and become exactly invariant after normalization, enabling stable feature extraction. Global median and sliding-window correction further address constant and time-varying Doppler effects. The IZCI–sign sequences are encoded into low-dimensional latent codes, combined with encrypted auxiliary parameters, and reconstructed securely at the receiver. Experiments on clean and simulated underwater speech demonstrate that ZC-DAEV achieves intelligible reconstruction at 800 bps, improving STOI scores over LPC-10 (0.81 to 0.85 in clean speech, 0.65 to 0.75 at 3 dB SNR, and 0.58 to 0.64 with Doppler, α ≈ 1.05). Security tests confirm that intercepted features alone remain unintelligible without the encrypted key. These results highlight ZC-DAEV as a robust, low-bitrate, and secure solution for underwater acoustic speech communication."

Based on this positive finding on enhancing scientific learning, the researchers made recommendations about adopting Gen-AI-guided IVR games as a complementary learning mode to typical instruction for science learning among English language learners in elementary school settings."

    "abstract": "Sustainable port operations and efficient container handling are essential components of competitiveness in modern maritime logistics. Although machine learning (ML) has been widely applied to port operations, particularly for berth scheduling, crane allocation, and yard optimization, current approaches generally emphasize operational efficiency and rarely integrate sustainability requirements. This gap limits the capacity of predictive systems to support emerging Smart Port environments, where performance must align with Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles. To address this need, this study develops an ESG-driven predictive framework for estimating container turnaround time using six ML algorithms: Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Deep Learning, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees, and Support Vector Machine. Historical operational characteristics, such as berth time, crane efficiency, loading and unloading rates, and delay factors, were analyzed utilizing RapidMiner. Experimental results indicate that GLM attains the lowest Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.175, while providing the fastest runtime of 7 seconds, surpassing more complex ensemble methods and neural network models. These findings demonstrate that operational variables display strong linear correlations with turnaround efficiency, thereby rendering GLM appropriate for real-time decision support. By integrating ESG considerations into the predictive process, the proposed model improves environmental performance, reinforces governance coordination, and promotes social workload equilibrium. This study presents a computationally effective methodology for the sustainability-oriented transformation of smart ports."

    "abstract": "With the access of large-scale renewable energy and the increasing uncertainty of both sources and loads, the power grid presents high-dimensional and strong nonlinear characteristics, which makes it difficult for traditional scheduling optimization algorithms to give consideration to both computational efficiency and dynamic adaptability. The deep reinforcement learning algorithm can deal with high-dimensional dynamic characteristics and uncertainties, and can be used to solve the above problems. However, due to its “black box” characteristics, the decision-making is poorly interpretable and easily deviates from the scheduling rules, so it has not been effectively applied in engineering practice. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a multi-objective optimization method of distribution network outage planning based on interpretable deep reinforcement learning. Firstly, the equivalent aggregation strategy of nodes in each time period is designed, and the secondary nodes are aggregated based on the load influence threshold to reduce the state space dimension. Secondly, a multi-objective optimization model including power outage loss load, workload balance and power outage cost is constructed and solved by deep reinforcement learning. Then, an interpretability enhancement mechanism based on expert experience and scheduling rules is proposed, which directly transforms key expert experience such as equipment health threshold and load peak threshold into state space characteristics and action space constraints, making the decision-making process transparent and traceable, enhancing the interpretability and engineering credibility of DRL, and solving the “black box” problem. Finally, the near-end strategy optimization algorithm is used to train the model, and the trained model is used to make optimization decisions. The example shows that this method can not only ensure the economy and reliability of power grid, but also significantly improve the calculation efficiency and interpretability of the algorithm."

    "abstract": "As the energy sector transitions towards greener solutions, energy storage systems (ESSs) become increasingly vital in managing power fluctuations arising from renewable energy sources (RESs). The intermittent nature of RESs, combined with seasonal variations in power demand, presents significant challenges for system balancing and operational stability. This paper proposes a novel optimization framework for determining the optimal sizing of ESSs, explicitly considering constraints to maintain safe operational limits and prevent overcharging or over-discharging. The study further investigates the impacts of various connectivity arrangements and energy management strategies among system components, analyzing their trade-offs in terms of energy balancing, flexibility in meeting user demands, and efficient storage allocation. The proposed methodology is validated through simulations using real-world generation and consumption data from a smart home environment (iHouse), capturing seasonal variations across summer, winter, spring, and autumn. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ESS design in mitigating power fluctuations, significantly reducing the required storage capacity while ensuring robust, reliable, and safe system operation. These findings underscore the critical role of optimal ESS sizing and connectivity management in enhancing the efficiency and reliability of renewable energy-powered nanogrids."

The VSConv module combines Constrained Variable Convolution (CVC) and Context Self-Attention Based Proposal Module (CSAPM) to enhance feature representation. CVC introduces controlled local deformation to better capture scale variations in smoke. CSAPM dynamically defines the deformation region to reduce information loss caused by excessive deformation and repeated sampling. To improve computational efficiency, ESNet applies partial channel features during the deformation process. Experimental results show the proposed method achieves superior smoke identification performance compared with other identification methods, e.g. YOLOX and Cascade R-CNN in steel industrial environments."

    "abstract": "Stock market price prediction remains one of the challenges as it depends on a large number of factors that influence each other and are hard to predict. These factors include economic indicators, global events, investor sentiment, and policy changes. AI and machine learning techniques have a potential in pattern recognition and in generating insights that lead to informed decision-making by traders and investors. This work compares the performance of various AI-based predictive modelling approaches in forecasting the NIFTY50 index. The models are trained using the historical Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume data, collectively known as OHCLV data. The results of the experiments show that the extreme gradient boosting model yields the lowest mean squared error of about 16,692 and a coefficient of determination of 0.999. The hybrid model combining long short-term memory and convolutional neural network, has a significantly lower coefficient of determination of 0.961. However, the hybrid model is more robust in new market scenarios as it can capture both temporal dependencies and localized patterns. This study conducts a comprehensive review of predictive modelling techniques and realizes their practical relevance in facilitating data-driven investment strategies, which is one of the most important aspects of AI's revolutionary role in financial forecasting."

Conventional DSS have a static database and centralized architecture that translates to latency, inefficiencies, and lack of flexibility. The suggested architecture combines real-time monitoring based on IoT with distributed Edge AI and cloudbased analytics, which allow making predictive and prescriptive decisions. The empirical validation in the manufacturing, healthcare, supply chain, and smart city spheres has shown that it has resulted in a substantial improvement in performance: the decrease in the decision latency by up to 69%, the improvement in the accuracy of decisions by $7-16$ percent, and the reduced operational expenses by $\\mathbf{1 8}-\\mathbf{2 5}$ percent. Additionally, the integration of Explainable AI (XAI) features like LIME and SHAP enhanced the level of trust of the stakeholders by around 30% and usability by around 25%. In the case of TBIs and startups, such capabilities allow pivoting more rapidly, allocating resources more efficiently, and conducting an open review of entrepreneurial projects. These findings create a scalable and sustainable model through which incubators can reinforce entrepreneurial ecosystems by using AI-IoT-based decision support."

This paper introduces a secure and effective solution called SE-FedMLP, which combines Federated Learning (FL) with a Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) enhanced Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model. FL allows different clients (like farms) to train the model locally without sharing data, hence keeping the data private. SE blocks improve the model to extract the important features from the input data. Experiments were done using a synthetic crop dataset with 7 features and 22 crop labels. We have also created a synthetic dataset to simulate real agricultural scenarios, including data variations across different regions The model was trained across 3 clients using the FedProx algorithm, and the results show high accuracy (97.85%) and strong F1-score (96.16%), proving the effectiveness of the proposed approach. This approach proves that FL can be a effectively used for crop recommendation while keeping data private."

Static passwords and other conventional techniques are inadequate because they are susceptible to phishing and brute force attacks. Despite adding a physical authentication component to improve security, USB token-based multi-factor authentication (MFA) systems are still vulnerable to compromise when both the password and the token are stolen. This paper suggests a sophisticated authentication framework that combines behavioral anomaly detection powered by artificial intelligence with USB token-based protocols. By examining user-specific behavioral patterns, such as keystroke dynamics, mouse movements, and login session characteristics, the suggested system adds an adaptive, context-aware security layer. Experiments on publicly accessible keystroke datasets show anomaly detection accuracy of over 90%, highlighting the approach's viability and resilience. The foundation for creating intelligent authentication systems that can withstand complex cyberthreats is laid by this work."

Existing AI-based anemia studies primarily rely on large datasets, image modalities, or single-model approaches, yet lack a unified comparative framework using structured hematological data. To address this gap, this study proposes an AI-driven anemia classification framework evaluating five ensemble models, such as Histogram-based Gradient Boosting (HGB), AdaBoost, XGBoost, CatBoost, and Bagging on clinically validated complete blood count (CBC) datasets. The dataset consists of 128 clinically validated CBC samples from Yogyakarta (2020– 2021), comprising BTT and IDA cases confirmed via ferritin tests and hemoglobin electrophoresis. Class imbalance was handled using SMOTE, improving model stability and predictive performance. HGB achieved the best results on the anemia dataset after SMOTE (accuracy 0.985, F1-score 0.988, AUC 0.999) and demonstrated strong generalizability on diabetes and heart disease datasets. Its performance benefits from histogram-based binning and robust regularization, enabling efficient training with limited samples. The findings show that integrating HGB with SMOTE provides an accurate, interpretable, and computationally efficient solution for AI-assisted diagnosis, particularly suited for resource-constrained healthcare environments."

Experimental data were collected for each angle under real operating conditions. Bifacial module shows a consistent increase in performance compared to monofacial module. The highest bifacial gain of 13.20% was observed at 90° tilt angle when rear radiation reached at $174 \\mathrm{~W} / \\mathrm{m}^{2}$ and measured irradiation ratio was 0.28. The optimum electrical power output of bifacial module of 392.88 W was recorded at 30° tilt angle and in case of monofacial module it was 341.82 W at 35° tilt angle. The findings show that rear radiation and albedo hugely affect the bifacial gain at higher tilt angle whereas optimal power output is achieved at moderate tilt angle in between 30° to 35°. These results signify the importance of adjusting tilt angles in a specific location to maximize the energy output of the bifacial solar PVmodule."

Moderating this content is a significant technical challenge, requiring automated systems that can detect both cigarettes and e-cigarettes across diverse, real-world scenarios. Unfortunately, no prior research has developed a single model to detect both cigarettes and e-cigarettes for social media moderation, a gap largely attributed to the lack of dataset for a unified detection model. To address these limitations, this study compares CNN-based YOLOv12 architecture with the Transformer-based RF-DETR, training on a novel CORTEX dataset to evaluate their ability to simultaneously detect both product types across diverse media content. A key trade-off between the models was revealed by the experimental results. The highest precision and accuracy were achieved by the YOLOv12m model, which obtained a mAP<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">50</inf> of 0.841. In contrast, superior recall of 0.822 along with more consistent performance across varied scenes was demonstrated by the RF-DETR model. Although effective performance on static images was observed, detection flickering in video frames was identified as a key limitation. Therefore, the future work of this research is to integrate object tracking algorithms to enable robust, real-time analysis."

Furthermore, it integrates a spatio-temporal attention mechanism to capture the spatio-temporal characteristics of fault propagation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits superior performance in environments with single faults, multiple faults, and interfering signals, achieving an average location accuracy of 97.78%.

Meanwhile, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have been studied to enable some of the applications future wireless networks are envisioned to support. To reflect these recent research directions, this paper proposes a satellite-terrestrial integrated network (STIN) model, which comprises an uplink terrestrial ISAC-RIS scenario and a downlink satellite transmission to the ISAC base station. Based on the system model, a mathematical formulation is provided to characterize the communication symbol detection and target estimation problems. Further, the maximum likelihood (ML) detection algorithm is proposed to jointly detect the symbols transmitted by the terrestrial user equipment and satellite. In an interference cancellation scheme, the reflection coefficients of the ISAC target are estimated after symbol detection using the minimum mean-squared error estimation (MMSE) method. The computational complexities of ML and MMSE algorithms are analyzed in terms of the number of real additions and real multiplications involved in their operations. Finally, Monte Carlo simulations are presented to support the findings."

    "abstract": "Smart power grids, as the backbone of contemporary electrical power distribution systems, are more vulnerable to cyberattacks with their interconnectedness and reliance on a communication network. Distributed nature and complexity of the grids make them vulnerable to cyberattacks that can lead to disruption of power supply and compromise of critical infrastructure. In this paper, we introduce a multilayered cybersecurity framework that will improve the security of smart grids through Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) mechanisms. The framework includes physical, network, and application-layer security controls, along with real-time anomaly detection and predictive threat prevention by ML-driven algorithms. We simulate a variety of cyberattacks, such as Denial of Service (DoS), Man-in-the-Middle (MITM), and data injection attacks, to test the performance of the proposed framework. Experimental results indicate that the framework detects and mitigates cyber threats with an accuracy of 98.5% with low latency and false positives. The proposed solution demonstrates significant improvement in the resilience and reliability of smart grids against emerging cyber risks."

    "abstract": "Forest fires have caused a critical threat, leading to severe environmental degradation, economic losses and serious consequences for human life. Prediction, prevention, and control to handle forest fires become important. Several studies have applied machine learning for forest fire prediction. In this study, one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN) was implemented to forest fire prediction using the UCI Algerian forest fire dataset. This dataset contains 12 features and 244 instances. The proposed model was measured using standard metrics—accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score—and its performance is compared with baseline algorithms including SVM, Random Forest and XG-Boost. Based this experiment, 1D CNN achieves higher performance than existing traditional models, although its performance remains slightly below that of optimized model in previous studies. These findings indicate that 1D CNN offers a competitive deep-learning method for forest fire prediction and provides a useful benchmark for future research."

This paper introduces the Cloudless Intelligence paradigm which is centred on creating autonomous AI agents that could operate fully within decentralized edge fabrics. We discuss the architecture blueprint of edge-native agents which utilises local computation, federated learning and lightweight inference models to support real-time decision-making, privacy friendliness and context sensing. Our suggestion of a framework combines decentralized communication technology, energy-efficient AI algorithms, and dynamic resource orchestration strategies to achieve self-guiding conduct that is independent of cloud connections. Such experimental performance characteristics on various IoT and edge use case are recorded to justify the viability and practical benefits of our cloudless agents in the aspects of latency, resilience, and energy.

    "abstract": "This study benchmarks the effectiveness of multiple subjective quality assessment (QA) methods for evaluating the perceptual quality of light field (LF) content in the context of image coding applications. A passive visualization approach is adopted, where LF data are rendered as pseudo-video sequences and assessed on calibrated 4K 2D displays under controlled laboratory conditions. Three subjective test protocols, including two rating-based and a pairwise comparison (ranking-based) method, are evaluated through six experimental configurations, incorporating different viewing trajectories and interaction modes. This setup, together with our proposals for deploying inter-rater consistency criteria (e.g., error consistency), enables a comprehensive evaluation of the reliability and suitability of different subjective experiments for LF QA. The results confirm the superior discriminability of the pairwise comparison tests over the rating-based methods. Among the rating-based approaches, the method employing a comparative scale scoring outperformed the one based on an impairment scale. Moreover, the performance of several objective QA metrics was evaluated by comparing their scores against the subjective scores obtained from the three test protocols. The outcomes of this study provide methodological guidance for designing subjective LF quality experiments, highlighting the trade-offs between reliability, sensitivity, and experimental cost, and offer insights relevant to future standardization efforts in LF coding."

    "abstract": "Storm surges triggered by tropical cyclones (TC) in coastal regions, which refer to an abnormal rise in sea surface elevation, represent a severe hazardous phenomenon. The novelty of this study is to test the applicability of sea surface elevation retrieval from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image under TCs based on wave dispersion relation at nearshore. There are 36 dual-polarized [vertical-vertical (VV) and vertical-horizontal (VH)] Sentinel-1 (S-1) images acquired in interferometric wide and extra wide mode in the Northwest Pacific Ocean. In addition, these images are collocated with sea surface elevation simulated by a couple atmospheric–oceanic numerical model, namely Weather Research and Forecasting−Finite-Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM)−Simulating Waves Nearshore. Three wave parameters, including significant wave height, cross-zero wave period, and mean wavelength were inverted from VV-polarized S-1 imagery using a trained eXtreme Gradient Boosting model. Under TC conditions, the comparison of sea surface elevations from SAR and the FVCOM model yielded a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.26 m, whereas validation against tide gauge observations achieved an RMSE of 0.42 m. The observed bias exhibited a nonlinear correlation with water depth rather than dynamic processes, originating from a systematic overestimation by FVCOM in shallow nearshore areas. Collectively, our work advances the retrieval of sea surface elevation from SAR during TCs."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "This article introduces methods for path-specific beamforming and adaptive compensation of nonuniform Doppler drifts in single-carrier broadband underwater acoustic communications. We focus on scenarios where different propagation paths experience varying Doppler drifts, which can significantly degrade conventional receivers. The proposed method employs broadband beamforming to separate the multipath components. Each path is then individually time-aligned and Doppler-synchronized before being processed by a multichannel fractionally spaced decision-feedback equalizer (DFE). By time-aligning the signals before equalization, the DFE filters need only cover the dispersion of each isolated path rather than the entire multipath spread, which leads to an overall reduction in the equalizer size. To account for time compression and dilation, we incorporate a delay-locked loop alongside a phase-locked loop to perform adaptive online resampling or delay tracking, thus eliminating the need for front-end resampling even in high-Doppler scenarios. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach operates successfully under conditions that cause conventional receivers to fail. In cases where the conventional receiver performs well, our proposed algorithm achieves comparable performance with significantly fewer training symbols, yielding excellent performance in terms of data detection mean squared error and bit error rate."

While semantic communication (SemCom) can alleviate bandwidth pressure by transmitting semantics rather than raw data, random access (RA) for SemCom may still suffer from collisions and delays due to resource competition. This indicates that, in current vehicular networks, a unified modeling and analysis framework integrating SemCom and access schemes is supposed to be designed and explored. In this correspondence, we propose a RA scheme named SVRA under the buffer and retransmission constraints, where the state characterizations are determined using Markov chain. Furthermore, we introduce the age of incorrect information (AoII) by considering the structure similarity index measure (SSIM). We compare SVRA with existing schemes, the results of which validate that SVRA has a better performance."

    "abstract": "The extraction of concise and discriminative features from hyperspectral remote sensing images (HSIs) holds great significance for land cover classification tasks. Nevertheless, the intricate spatial-spectral tensor structure and inaccurate class labels undermine the performance of existing vector-based or Tucker tensor-based feature dimensionality reduction (DR) approaches. To tackle this problem, we propose an Adaptive Tensor-Ring Manifold Maintaining Embedding (ATRMME) approach for HSI feature DR in the presence of noisy labels. Firstly, a tensor-ring subspace representation theory is established to characterize the low-dimensional hyperspectral tensor subspace. To mine concise features from complex spatial-spectral data, differing from existing Tucker-based DR methods that involve exorbitant parameter overheads, a nuclear norm-constrained Tensor-Ring (TR) feature representation term is designed. This term enables the compression of key features within the low-dimensional subspace with a linear parameter cost. For the adaptive perception and capture of the manifold structure under noisy labels, an adaptive adjacency matrix is constructed, and the adjacency relationships are reorganized based on the TR feature distribution. To guarantee the effective execution of model training, an alternating optimization algorithm is developed for parameter estimation. Experimental results on multiple hyperspectral datasets verify that the ATRMME approach exhibits strong robustness against noisy labels, outperforms conventional vector-based and Tucker tensor-based methods, and has lower parameter requirements."

Maintaining an optimal oxygen excess ratio (OER) is critical to balancing the efficiency, durability, and dynamic performance of PEMFC systems, but this task faces inherent nonlinearities, external disturbances, and unpredictable concurrent air compressor faults—challenges that traditional control strategies struggle to address simultaneously. Its core innovations are reflected in three aspects. First, it establishes a unified adaptive control architecture to address the performance limitations of existing command-filtered backstepping frameworks under air compressor fault conditions. Rigorous Lyapunov stability analysis verifies the closed-loop stability under parameter perturbations. Second, it develops a new fault-tolerant control paradigm to ensure the finite-time convergence of the OER under multiple concurrent unknown faults of the air compressor, without relying on external fault diagnosis modules. Third, its practical feasibility is verified through controller-hardware-in-the-loop (C-HIL) experiments. Compared with mainstream methods, the adaptive finite-time command-filtered backstepping (AFTCFB) controller exhibits better tracking accuracy, smaller overshoot, and faster fault recovery speed."

This review synthesizes two decades of advancements in LGU, highlighting its pivotal role in biomedical imaging, tissue characterization, and therapeutic applications. In imaging, LGU integrates seamlessly with modalities like photoacoustics to enhance diagnostic precision, as demonstrated by studies combining laser-induced ultrasound with classical techniques to improve vascular contrast and subsurface tissue visualization. Innovations such as fiber-optic transducers and carbon nanotube composites have enabled further miniaturization and optimization of LGU systems for clinical uses, resulting in high-resolution intravascular and endoscopic imaging. Beyond diagnostics, LGU excels in tissue characterization, providing non-invasive insights into biomechanical properties through techniques like laser-guided focused ultrasound and quantitative ultrasound visualization. These methods have proven invaluable for assessing bone health and detecting microstructural anomalies without ionizing radiation. Therapeutically, LGU enables precision interventions, such as microbubbles and nanodroplets-mediated thrombolysis, targeted drug delivery, and noninvasive surgery, with minimal collateral damages. Recent developments, including optically generated focused ultrasound for neuromodulation, underscore its potential in neurosurgery and regenerative medicine. Despite its promise, challenges like signal attenuation and clinical scalability persist. However, solutions such as AI-driven image reconstruction and robotic-assisted systems are poised to overcome some existing barriers. By bridging technological innovation with clinical needs, LGU is redefining precision medicine, offering safer, more effective alternatives to traditional ultrasound-based diagnostics and therapeutics."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in sensing and artificial intelligence technologies have laid the foundation for proactive pedestrian safety at non-signalized intersections. These technologies enable the prediction of future pedestrian-vehicle conflicts, allowing for timely intervention. Existing studies, however, overlook the uncertainty inherent in future prediction, which mainly stems from behavioral variability and observational inaccuracies. Probabilistic trajectory prediction can capture these uncertainties, yet it has rarely been applied to future conflict evaluation. To improve future conflict evaluation by accounting for uncertainty, this study introduces a novel method that integrates probabilistic trajectory prediction with a newly designed surrogate safety measure, Stochastic Predicted Time to Collision (SPTTC). SPTTC enables accurate conflict prediction, reliable scenario classification and evaluation of conflict severity progression, as demonstrated in quantitative results and case studies. Across different types of non-signalized intersections, SPTTC was separately integrated with four probabilistic trajectory prediction models, achieving F1 scores of 0.77–0.84 and consistently outperforming baseline methods. The proposed method also exhibits strong robustness under high-uncertainty conditions, such as unpredictable pedestrian behavior (e.g., children), low visibility (e.g., nighttime), and missing data. This proposed method can be integrated into proactive pedestrian protection systems, enhancing safety by providing timely alerts to pedestrians or activating vehicle brakes at critical moments."

    "abstract": "Roadside vision centric 3D object detection has received increasing attention in recent years. It expands the perception range of autonomous vehicles, enhances the road safety. Previous methods focused on predicting per-pixel height rather than depth, making significant gains in roadside visual perception. While it is limited by the perspective property of near-large and far-small on image features, making it difficult for network to understand real dimension of objects in the 3D world. Bird’s Eye View (BEV) features and voxel features present the real distribution of objects in 3D world compared to the image features. However, BEV features tend to lose details due to the lack of explicit height information, and voxel features are computationally expensive. Inspired by this insight, an efficient framework learning height prediction in voxel features via transformer is proposed, dubbed HeightFormer. It groups the voxel features into local height sequences, and utilize attention mechanism to obtain height distribution prediction. Subsequently, the local height sequences are reassembled to generate accurate voxel features. The proposed method is applied to two large-scale roadside benchmarks, DAIR-V2X-I and Rope3D. Extensive experiments are performed and the HeightFormer outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in roadside vision centric 3D object detection task.

The arrangement consists of soldering copper wires to the opposing ends of the rotor bars and routing them through a spinning reel to avoid entanglement, thereby providing a continuous electrical connection between the rotating quantities of the rotor and the stationary measurement instruments. Experiments with both ramped and stepped stator voltage inputs under no-load conditions revealed markedly different dynamic behaviors, including rapid acceleration, hunting torque, and current distortion. A recurring component at ≈1.05 Hz was consistently identified on the rotor bar voltages across independent tests, including at different input frequencies, suggesting the presence of an intrinsic oscillation under low excitation. The proposed measurement approach provides new experimental access to the flux-flow and synchronous regimes of HTS machines and establishes a foundation for future studies under load and with varied rotor designs."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly popular in medical domains to assist physicians with a variety of clinical and operational tasks. Given the fast-paced and high-stakes environment of emergency departments (EDs), small language models (SLMs), characterized by a reduction in parameter count compared to LLMs, offer significant potential due to their inherent reasoning capability and efficient performance. This enables SLMs to support physicians by providing timely and accurate information synthesis, thereby improving clinical decision-making and workflow efficiency. In this paper, we present a comprehensive benchmark designed to identify SLMs suited for ED decision support, taking into account both specialized medical expertise and broad general problem-solving capabilities. In our evaluations, we focus on SLMs that have been trained on a mixture of general-domain and medical corpora. A key motivation for emphasizing SLMs is the practical hardware limitations, operational cost constraints, and privacy concerns in the typical real-world deployments. Our benchmark datasets include MedMCQA, MedQA-4Options, and PubMedQA, with the medical abstracts dataset emulating tasks aligned with real ED physicians’ daily tasks. Experimental results reveal that general-domain SLMs surprisingly outperform their medically fine-tuned counterparts across these diverse benchmarks for ED. This indicates that for ED, specialized medical fine-tuning of the model may not be required."

Tests were conducted in a closed-loop experimental setup across pressure ranges from 1.0 to 2.0 bar, generating over 8,640 pressure readings and 2,160 flow measurements. Sensor performance was assessed through pressure measurement accuracy metrics (RMSE and CV), and flow estimation reliability was assessed using five ML algorithms. Results demonstrate that all sensors achieve comparable flow estimation accuracy. While calibration improves absolute pressure measurement accuracy, it provides minimal advantage for flow estimation tasks. This low-cost, non-invasive approach offers a promising water monitoring solution that is accessible and economically viable."

    "abstract": "Speech Emotion Recognition (SER)has attracted a lot of interest due to its uses in emotional computing, education, healthcare, and human-computer interaction. However, the constraints of accessible audio datasets severely limit the advancement of SER. Model generalization is constrained by the majority of extant corpora, short sample sizes, lack of speaker diversity, class imbalance, and language or cultural bias. The resilience of trained models in practical situations is further affected by environmental variables such as channel fluctuation, recording quality, and background noise. These issues show how urgently large scale, balanced, multilingual datasets, as well as consistent labeling systems and evaluation processes, are needed. This paper presents a survey of speech emotion recognition datasets along with research challenges and issues. Speech data sets are taxonomized according to how emotional expressions are obtained, mainly into four categories: simulated data set, prompted data set, unprompted data set, and natural dataset. Moreover, it describes various research challenges and issues that need attention to develop precise, reliable, and broadly applicable SER systems. Data set-related problems can be facilitated via data augmentation, cross corpus learning, multi-modal integration, and transfer learning."

    "abstract": "Intelligent systems and AI-driven analytics are reshaping smart cities by enabling accurate, large-scale mapping of transportation infrastructure, where reliable road network extraction from satellite imagery is critical for navigation, traffic optimization, and emergency response. A ma-jor limitation of existing approaches is the vulnerability of single-model deep learning methods to noise, occlusions, and diverse urban-rural contexts. To overcome this, seven complementary DeepLabV3+ networks-efficientnet-b3, resnet50, resnext50_32x4d, densenet169, mobilenet_v3 _large,regnetx_032, and efficientnet-b0-were independently trained on bootstrap samples of the DeepGlobe road dataset with varied augmentations and optimization schedules to maximize representational diversity. Their predictions were fused using probability averaging and an alternative spatial interleaving strategy enhanced by seam smoothing and conditional random field refinement to improve boundary continuity. The ensemble delivered consistent gains in intersection-over-union, Fl-score, and boundary accuracy compared to the strongest individual model, reducing false positives and capturing fine-grained road structures. These findings demonstrate that leveraging encoder diversity and structured fusion significantly strengthens road network extraction, offering a scalable and robust foundation for autonomous navigation, urban planning, and disaster management in smart city applications."

Timely and accurate diagnosis is essential for enhancing clinical outcomes. In this work, we propose a multimodal approach for automatically segmenting HIE lesions and severity classification using MRI scans. A SegResNet architecture was employed to segment lesions from Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) and Z-scored ADC (Z-ADC) maps. In the following stage, features derived from predicted lesion masks and clinical meta data were combined using an early fusion approach. The fused feature set was used for classifying the HIE lesions according to severity as mild, moderate and severe. Experiments were conducted on the Boston Neonatal Brain Injury Dataset (BONBID-HIE). The segmentation model achieved a Dice score of 0.749, while the severity classification obtained an accuracy of 88.64%. These findings show the effectiveness of the proposed structure in both clinically relevant severity classification and accurate lesion spot identification, indicating its ability to support early clinical decision-making in neonatal clinical care.."

The proposed approach integrates a real-time optimisation algorithm that dynamically allocates torques to individual motors/brakes by considering the tyre, motor and friction brake dynamic limits. It also employs an asymmetrical cost function, penalising positive and negative motor torques differently to maximise regenerative braking energy recovery. Simulation results using a high-fidelity vehicle model demonstrate significant improvements in vehicle handling and energy efficiency performances compared to the traditional control allocation method. This paper therefore showcases how to construct a global optimal wheel torque strategy considering both performance-oriented and energy-efficient EV applications."

While existing methods such as the fast NeRF variant based on hash grid representation can achieve efficient reconstruction of low-resolution human avatars, they need to increase the hash grid resolution when reconstructing high-resolution human avatars, which leads to a dramatic increase in network parameters. To solve the problem, a hybrid representation that combines multi-resolution hash grid features and tri-plane features is proposed. Based on this representation, we propose a novel reconstruction method that can provide higher rendering quality while maintaining a compact model size compared to the baseline methods. In addition, we introduce a training strategy from coarse to fine, using patch-level supervision to encourage the network to acquire clear appearance details. The proposed method demonstrates its superior performance in terms of appearance quality based on extensive experiments."

The method determines the optimal current angle for active power output while considering practical active power limits. It is capable of adjusting the output current angle, adaptively switching between the optimal angle for active power output and the optimal angle for voltage support. This enables the full utilization of both active power and current capacities to achieve effective active power support and voltage support simultaneously. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through simulations."

By projecting process data into a high-dimensional feature space and applying NMF, the method successfully captures nonlinear patterns while maintaining the physical meaning of nonnegative components. Validation on benchmark datasets demonstrates that KNMF performs well, as it gives high fault detection rates and low false alarm rates."

Both balanced and imbalanced datasets were evaluated using standard classification metrics. GroundingDINO achieved perfect precision but had the lowest accuracy, making it less practical for real-time applications due to its reliance on AWS Lambda and S3, which require significant computational resources. YOLOv11 offered a good balance of speed and precision, making it suitable for real-time use. SSD MobileNet-v3 provided high efficiency with minimal resource requirements, making it ideal for edge devices.

Existing AUVs, however, exhibit limited adaptability to fluctuating underwater conditions, short operational lifespans due to restricted energy resources, and low spatial-temporal coverage. To address these limitations, this paper introduces EcoSwarm, a distributed autonomous underwater robot swarm that uniquely integrates adaptive sensing and bio-inspired manipulation for real-time environmental monitoring and interaction. Each miniature AUV is equipped with multi-modal sensors for chemical, biological, and physical data collection, coupled with an AI-driven adaptive sensing framework that dynamically adjusts sensing strategies in response to environmental changes. A decentralized communication system, combining acoustic and optical channels, enables robust coordination and data fusion across the swarm. Additionally, bio-inspired compliant robotic arms empower EcoSwarm to perform cooperative environmental interventions such as microplastic collection and habitat restoration. The system's hybrid energy-harvesting and docking architecture extends operational endurance, while prototype testing demonstrates superior adaptability, fault tolerance, and real-time responsiveness compared to conventional AUVs. EcoSwarm thus establishes a transformative paradigm in underwater robotics, combining swarm intelligence, adaptive sensing, and manipulative interaction to achieve sustainable marine ecosystem management."

Historically, the urine sediment microscopic image samples were manually examined under a microscope by the clinical experts and trained professionals. This traditional manual analysis is slow, time consuming, labor intensive and prone to variability and errors. In recent times, computer vision models have been extensively used in automated urine sediment analysis but they often struggle in accurately locating and identifying smaller and irregular shaped urine sediments. In order to overcome these challenges we have worked with two distinct approaches to improve the performance of computer vision models in urine sediment analysis. In this work, we have used two state-of-the-art computer vision models YOLOv12 and RT-DETR in our experimental results on the publicly available datasets. The experimental results confirms that the proposed merging method improves the overall accuracy of YOLOv12 and RT-DETR by 4.14% and 9.45% respectively. However, the augmentation method declines the performance of these models and a decrease in the accuracy is observed with this approach. This study further concludes that YOLOv12 outperforms RT-DETR when trained on a smaller dataset but this trend gets reversed when trained with more comprehensive merged dataset."

The proposed approach has been applied to a distance protection set-up within a transmission network that incorporates four interconnected intelligent electronic devices (IEDs). By coupling an Innovative Machine Learning model- based feature selector with multiple machine learning algorithms, the inclusion of the framework in Principal Component Analysis (PCA) improves the accuracy and performance of the abnormal detection system. Support vector machine(SVM), Gradient boosters, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest (RM), and decision tree (DT) classifiers are evaluated to determine the most suitable models to detect and distinguish between normal operations, natural disturbances, and cyber attacks within transmission networks.

The proposed method combines the loss sensitivity factor (LSF) with an advanced metaheuristic technique, the Hippopotamus Optimizer Algorithm (HOA). The LSF is first computed to identify a set of potential locations for DG placement, while HOA leverages the unique defense mechanisms and evasion strategies of hippopotamuses to optimize the DG capacity. The effectiveness of the proposed integrated approach is validated on the balanced IEEE 33-bus benchmark RDPN under both nominal and peak load conditions.

    "abstract": "The rapid digital transformation in healthcare has accelerated the adoption of Electronic Medical Records (EMRs), yet concerns about privacy, interoperability, and security remain major challenges. Centralized learning models expose data to leakage and adversarial attacks, reducing clinical reliability. To address these issues, this study proposes a Secure Federated Learning (FL) framework integrated with Blockchain to enable scalable, privacy-preserving, and trustworthy EMR management. A quantitative experimental design was conducted using the publicly available MIMIC-III dataset in a simulated multi-institutional environment. Federated learning enabled local model training across distributed nodes, while blockchain served as a permissioned ledger for update verification, node authentication, and access control. Homomorphic encryption and differential privacy were incorporated to enhance confidentiality. System performance was evaluated in terms of predictive accuracy, calibration, communication efficiency, and security resilience. The proposed framework achieved an average prediction accuracy of 94.7%, with balanced precision (93%) and recall (92%), and an AUROC of 0.97. Calibration also improved, yielding lower Brier and ECE values compared with baselines. Communication latency remained practical at 210 ms per iteration, while bandwidth consumption decreased by 18% relative to vanilla FL. Security analysis showed that the system detected anomalous updates under poisoning attacks with an 87% success rate, while differential privacy reduced membership-inference risk toward chance levels. The blockchain layer further ensured transparency and auditability of all transactions without degrading predictive utility. In conclusion, integrating federated learning with blockchain provides a scalable, auditable, and privacy-preserving solution for EMR management. This framework advances secure digital healthcare infrastructures and establishes a foundation for real-world deployment in hospital ecosystems."

In contrast to other traditional models of machine learning, CatBoost works with high dimensionality and learning results optimization using historical data of Scrum projects. Catboost model is better than traditional regression models since it has better MSE, RMSE by getting an R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> score of 0.9872, which is a particular improvement to the best baseline model. In this piece of research, we conclude that our model improves the estimation of Scrum efforts, which results in a solid and effective agile project management solution through the combination of risk-based adjustments and sophisticated features."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a hierarchical intelligent design approach for vehicle frontal collision vehicle body structures. It involves constructing system-level decision-tree models for each body performance requirement, where body performance requirements (e.g., Occupant Load Criterion (OLC)) are leaf nodes and component performance (e.g., component average stiffness) are decision nodes. Then, component-level decision-tree models are built for each component's performance requirements, with component performance (e.g., component average stiffness) as leaf nodes and design parameters (e.g., beam design parameters) as decision nodes. Using these models enables rapid intelligent design of body components. Initially, determine vehicle-level performance requirements and use the system-level model to identify key component performance requirements. Next, apply the component-level model to design parameters for each key component based on its performance requirements. This approach significantly diminishes repetitive iterations in traditional optimization, reducing necessary simulation and testing rounds in body structure optimization for similar vehicles. Consequently, it conserves computational resources, cuts development costs, and enhances design efficiency."

The term “cancer” refers to malignant tumors, which are characterized by aberrant cell development and are brain tumors. Traditionally, to locate malignant areas within the brain, medical experts have relied on CT and MRI images. However, in this study, we focus on processing MRI scan pictures to identify illness status. These are the purposes of this study: i) the identification of abnormal image features and ii) the precise segmentation of tumor regions. By creating segmented masks, we can estimate tumor density, which holds crucial implications for therapeutic interventions. Our study employs deep learning techniques to detect abnormalities within MRI images to achieve these objectives. Tumor region segmentation is achieved by applying a multi-level thresholding technique. The segmented region's quantity of cancerous pixels is a vital indicator of the affected area's density."

Initially, a collaborative architecture integrating carbon capture systems and electric boilers is constructed within the virtual power plant, followed by the development of an economic dispatch model embedded with a deep peak-shaving compensation mechanism. Subsequently, a coordinated optimization strategy is proposed, which unlocks the deep peak-shaving potential of CHP units through the incorporation of electric boilers and peak-shaving compensation mechanisms. Meanwhile, the carbon capture system is treated as a dispatchable load, with its capture energy consumption flexibly adjusted to synergistically enhance system operational flexibility and renewable energy accommodation capacity. Moreover, an improved multi-genetic algorithm is introduced to efficiently solve this high-dimensional nonlinear optimization model. Finally, simulation analyses validate the effectiveness of the proposed model and strategy in enhancing the economic benefits of the virtual power plant and strengthening its peakshaving capabilities."

    "abstract": "Agentic AI needs strong long-term memory to reason over long horizons and adapt. Standard reinforcement learning (RL) replay buffers use static retention, wasting capacity on low-value experiences and slowing learning. We introduce a utility-driven memory curation framework that scores each transition by a weighted combination of immediate reward magnitude and temporal-difference (TD) error, capturing both episodic importance and training informativeness. A Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent with our adaptive buffer keeps high-utility transitions and evicts low-utility ones under capacity pressure, emulating selective consolidation and relevance-based forgetting. Sampling remains uniform over the retained set, preserving simplicity, while logs of utility and evictions provide transparent, interpretable memory decisions. On CartPole-v1 and Acrobot-v1, Utility-Driven Replay learns faster than FIFO and Prioritized Experience Replay (PER) on CartPole-vl and achieves higher final returns on Acrobot-v1 by preserving informative swing-up experiences. Utility-driven agents match or slightly outperform PER in final returns on CartPole-v1 and converge faster; on Acrobot-v1, they reach superior asymptotic performance. Baselines include Uniform Replay (FIFO), PER with FIFO eviction, and Random Eviction, averaged over multiple seeds. Beyond performance gains, the approach is easy to implement with minimal DQN changes and clarifies memory dynamics over training, pointing toward lifelong learning, self-regulated memory, and ethical, explainable agent behavior."

Traditional approaches depend on numerical simulations or machine learning; however, these methods face challenges in real-time deployment and generalization. To overcome these limitations, this work applies DRL for TSA using phasor measurement unit (PMU) data. Specifically, five DRL models like Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), Deep Q-Network (DQN), Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C), Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) are applied to a well-known benchmark dataset. The dataset comprises of 3,120 simulation cases with 354 features that are generated from transient stability studies of the IEEE 39-bus New England test system. The models are employed to classify operating conditions as either stable or unstable under a range of fault disturbances. In these five DRL Model results, DQN achieved the highest accuracy by outperforming PPO, SAC, DDPG, and A2C. These findings demonstrate the robustness of the DQN for real-time TSA and highlight its potential for integration into wide-area monitoring systems."

In the classical approach for the diagnosis of ASD, there are often instances where the diagnosis is based on the expert opinion of the clinician, which often leads to inconsistent diagnosis and delays. In light of the above-discussed limitations, the following study proposes an understandable approach for the diagnosis of ASD by combining the Extreme Gradient Boosting algorithm and SHAP. This study uses an independent evaluation approach for the XGBoost model and carries out the experiment on three separate ASD datasets available to the general public. After pre-processing the data, the study uses accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.The experimental study reveals that the XGBoost model performs well on the first and third dataset, which confirms the presence of reliable and distinct behavioral cues. However, the suboptimal performance on the second dataset confirms the challenges faced due to the presence of noise and inconsistent features. The result obtained from the SHAP study confirms that the behavioral questionnaire items and the array of features, specifically A6 to A9, play the most significant role, and the characteristics are less important. These experimentally supported facts and study analyses verify that the novel XGBoost-SHAP model not only delivers optimal accuracy but also provides clarity and meaningful information for toddlers suffering from ASD.

Predicting tweet virality can support effective strategies in digital marketing, public communication, and online engagement. This study classifies Indonesian tweet virality into three categories—low, medium, and high—based on retweet counts, using textual and numerical features. Textual features are represented through IndoBERT embeddings, complemented by sentiment, emotion, and tweet metadata. To address class imbalance, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) were applied alongside cost-sensitive learning, while Genetic Algorithm (GA) was employed for hyperparameter tuning. Experimental results show that XGBoost with cost-sensitive learning achieved perfect metrics (F1 = 1.00), while PCA + SMOTE + XGBoost also performed strongly (F1 = 0.94). In contrast, Deep Neural Networks (DNN) struggled to capture minority classes, resulting in lower F1-scores despite relatively high accuracy. These findings highlight the robustness of XGBoost, though perfect performance should be interpreted with caution as further validation on larger and more diverse datasets is needed. Beyond methodological contributions, this study also fills a gap in non-English NLP research by demonstrating effective virality prediction for Indonesian tweets."

    "abstract": "The detection of pulse positions in pseudorandom time-hopping (TH) pseudolite (PL) signals is essential for their integration into participative Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers. Conventional approaches rely on computationally intensive exhaustive searches of TH intervals, which often yield a low detection probability and may fail under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces a robust four-stage pulseposition detection methodology that significantly improves TH signal acquisition compared to conventional approaches. The core innovation is the sequential integration of coarse acquisition for fractional alignment, matched filtering, and a novel adaptive energy detection scheme. This adaptive process reliably converts noisy correlation peaks into a clean binary pulse sequence, which is then efficiently compared against the TH table using circular correlation to identify the correct slot sequence and phase. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently detects the correct TH slot indices and initial phases across varying duty cycles and SNR levels while achieving higher detection probability and substantially reducing computational complexity compared to conventional exhaustive search (ES) approaches. This methodology improves the reliability of PL-based positioning and supports practical real-time implementation in participative GNSS receivers."

    "abstract": "The surface finishing and robotic painting processes in automotive manufacturing are critical determinants of vehicle exterior quality and production efficiency. Despite considerable progress in automation, real-time correction of paint irregularities remains a major challenge due to the absence of continuous, adaptive feedback mechanisms. Conventional vision-based inspection systems primarily detect defects post-application, leading to increased rework, material wastage, and production downtime. To overcome these constraints, this paper proposes the Real-Time Adaptive Aeroacoustic Robotic Painting and Finishing System (RAARPS)-a novel intelligent framework that integrates aeroacoustic sensing and deep learning-driven adaptive control for instant defect detection and correction. The RAARPS system utilizes an array of miniature directional microphones and airflow sensors strategically positioned on robotic arms and within the paint booth to capture high-frequency acoustic and aerodynamic signals generated during spray atomization and surface wetting. These signals are processed by a hybrid convolutional and recurrent neural network model, which interprets subtle variations in sound and airflow patterns to identify turbulence, overspray, or non-uniform atomization within milliseconds. The inference model then autonomously adjusts spray parameters, such as paint flow rate, electrostatic charge, and arm motion trajectory, ensuring consistent coating thickness and finish quality. Experimental validation demonstrates that RAARPS achieves a 6% improvement in defect detection accuracy and enhances first-pass yield compared to existing vision-based systems. Furthermore, the system reduces paint waste by approximately 12% and lowers volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions by about 8%, contributing significantly to sustainable and eco-efficient manufacturing. The results confirm that RAARPS provides a transformative advancement in intelligent robotic painting, offering real-time, data-driven adaptability that enhances surface precision, operational reliability, and environmental compliance."

    "abstract": "Modern intelligent factories are struggling to achieve real time visibility of the inventory because of the latency, flaws in the human intervention, and bottlenecks in the verticality of the traditional systems that encompass RFID-ERP integrations, barcode-MES models and manual periodical stock valuations. Such constraints cause poor decision making, poor stock control and insufficiency in regard to responsiveness to changing production requirements. To meet the issues described above, though, the application of Adaptive Zone-Aware IoT Mesh equipped with Autonomous Inventory Decision Agents (AZA-IMAD) can be proposed on this paper; it is a full edge-centric inventory control framework. AZA-IMAD implements the IoT sensor nodes in a truly dynamic form of zoning that are governed with autonomous decision agents that have the capability to perform real time sensor fusion, anomaly detection as well as reconstruction of replenishment at the edge itself. A zone-aware communication protocol will further ensure the vital changes will be transmitted to the network to reduce network congestion but a lightweight blockchain ledger will provide auditing to diverse changes that are decentralized as well as tamper-resistant and will not need web connectivity on an ongoing basis. The overall evaluation in a virtual smart manufacturing arrangement reveals AZA-IMAD achieves an desired inventory monitoring of an 91.75 that is above the conventional process of 65% - 85%. Also, specifically, the framework recognizes stock change at a rate of 93,90 and induces timely replenishment decision at 91 of the stock at 93% accuracy. In addition, AZA-IMAD saves on 38 percent of bandwidth in addition to activation response of decisions in milliseconds since the centralized processing bypasses are eliminated. AZA-IMAD introduces two core innovations: (1) a dynamic zoning mechanism that adapts sensor clusters based on real-time inventory density and flow, and (2) autonomous decision agents (AIDAs) operating at the network edge, enabling immediate anomaly detection and replenishment without central dependence. These innovations jointly deliver over 10% higher accuracy and 38% bandwidth savings compared to RFID-ERP systems."

This study aims to conduct a comparative performance analysis of several Transformer-based models, such as IndoBERTweet, BERT, and DeBERTa, for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) on this type of data. In contrast to other studies, this one provides a more accurate evaluation, particularly for minority classes, by methodically testing these models on a homogeneous dataset and including the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to rectify class imbalance. Micro F1-score, precision, and recall were used to assess the models' performance after they were trained on a pre-processed and balanced dataset of hotel reviews from Indonesia. Due in great part to its pre-training on informal social media language that closely resembles the review content, IndoBERTweet demonstrated outstanding performance with a micro F1-score of 96.36%. In conclusion, IndoBERTweet and the SMOTE balancing approach work well together to provide a reliable and accurate ABSA system for hotel reviews in Indonesia."

By collecting motion and energy-related measurements directly from the vehicle during actual driving, the method formulates an optimization problem that minimizes the discrepancy between measured and calculated values to identify model parameters. The proposed approach enables parameter estimation on each driving occasion, allowing it to adapt dynamically to variations in vehicle characteristics and road conditions. As a result, the obtained model closely reflects the actual energy consumption, leading to a reduction in the root mean square error."

DET FFs are essential elements in contemporary VLSI designs due to their ability to function on both clock edges. DET-FF (Dual Edge Triggered Flip-Flop) can lower the power dissipation of synchronous logic circuits by achieving the same data rate as SET FFs (Single Edge Triggered) at half the clock frequency. According to a hypothesis, DET-FFs use less power than SET FFs in situations where glitches are infrequent; however, to achieve the most beneficial design choices, a wide range of perceptions is required. In FN_C-DET, when the supply voltage varies from 0.7 V to 1.2 V, the delay is reduced by 66.1% at a temperature of 300 K and 65.75% at 380 K. In contemporary electronic systems, energy- and power-efficient designs are becoming increasingly crucial. Systems that maintain high performance while consuming less power are necessary for both current and future applications. The impact of temperature, voltage, and process fluctuations on system performance is a significant problem."

    "abstract": "In this article, we present a branch-and-bound (BnB) optimization framework for camera pose estimation that jointly exploits point and line features under a known direction constraint. By leveraging the known direction, the original six-degree-of-freedom point–line pose problem is reduced to the 4-D formulation. This reduced problem is further decoupled into two subproblems: global translation estimation and 1-D attitude estimation. Subsequently, the BnB optimization algorithm is used to estimate the global translation. We solve the translation globally using a BnB scheme, for which we derive tight upper and lower bounds for both point and line measurements based on two complementary geometric constraints. The remaining rotational component is then recovered via 1-D global voting followed by singular value decomposition. We show that the proposed method is robust to outliers in both point and line sets, yielding accurate and reliable pose estimates. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real data validate the effectiveness and accuracy of the approach.

Electric machines are designed not only for good operational performance but also for reduced resource consumption and waste of materials. This study focuses on optimizing high-voltage flameproof induction motors to minimize their active material mass. The process was implemented through an analytical optimization procedure, using a direct search method, the Nelder-Mead Simplex algorithm. Key design variables, such as slot dimensions, core length, and stator windings parameters, were carefully set during optimization due to their substantial impact on the volume of active materials, specifically aluminum, copper, and electrical steel. Regarding constraints, particular emphasis was placed on factors such as starting current, efficiency, and maximum magnetic flux density so as not to compromise the motors' operational performance. In addition, mechanical and manufacturing constraints were also considered. The results obtained from the optimization process were validated through finite element analysis using Ansys Maxwell software. The comprehensive results of the entire procedure revealed a significant reduction in the active material mass in all the motors analyzed, always respecting the imposed restrictions and manufacturing limits. Additionally, two other benefits were observed: improved machine efficiency and reduced harmonic content in most cases."

    "abstract": "With the evolution of automotive E/E architectures toward centralized designs, virtualization systems for intelligent cockpits impose higher demands on the security and reliability of hypervisors. Traditional Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) methods suffer from dual bottlenecks: poor model-code consistency and low verification efficiency. Current research primarily relies on manual fault tree construction and code-level verification, leading to logical redundancy and insufficient coverage. To address the issues of logical redundancy and critical path omission, this paper proposes an automated fault tree generation framework based on program analysis and symbolic execution, enabling automated extraction of code-level critical paths and precise mapping of fault logic. Specifically, it achieves comprehensive variable-level dependency tracking through backward program slicing on Low Level Virtual Machine (LLVM) intermediate representation, resolves multipath events using an enhanced symbolic execution-based SMT solver, and optimizes minimal cut set generation via the Quine-McCluskey algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can automatically generate fault trees from source code effectively, maintain high consistency with traditional FTA from design models, and uncover additional critical fault paths while dramatically reducing manual effort."

    "abstract": "Road accidents have been a thorn in the flesh of the world, and most of these accidents are related to human factors that include distracted drivers, drowsiness, and illegally entering a vehicle. Conventional safety systems, such as seatbelt alerts, lane departure warning systems, and alcohol ignition interlocks, are effective in specific contexts but cannot respond to multiple factors that lead to driver-related accidents in real-time in a holistic manner. Equally, with more sophisticated technologies like adaptive cruise control and blind-spot detection, there is enhanced situational awareness; however, this is limited to the vehicle’s surroundings and provides little control over driver actions. These gaps serve as an indication of the urgency of a more detailed and innovative driver assistance solution. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce the Smart Driver Assistance System (SDAS). This holistic, AI-based platform utilises a single front-facing camera and integrates various safety features into a cohesive platform. The system also features secure face verification based on MTCNN and FaceNet models to limit unauthorised vehicle access; therefore, only authenticated users will be able to manage the vehicle. Ingestion of main media is only achievable via a gesture control module powered by MediaPipe Hands, which facilitates distraction-free management of infotainment; consequently, less cognitive load is applied6 to the drivers. A YOLOv8-based object detection model, which detects cases of mobile phone use during driving and provides real-time auditory and visual feedback, is used to reduce unsafe behaviour. Moreover, the constant tracking of the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) enables the identification of drowsiness and microsleep instances beforehand, providing a warning to avert fatigue-related accidents. Installed on a conventional computing platform, SDAS demonstrates strong performance, achieving authentication accuracy of over 98%, gesture recognition of over 95%, and driver monitoring of over 90%. This system will also help bridge the gap between conventional driver assistance technology and the latest autonomous driving technology, thereby providing a unified solution that enhances safety levels, reduces the number of accidents, and makes the driving experience more enjoyable. Finally, SDAS highlights the potential of AI-driven multimodal monitoring to pave the way for more innovative and safer cars in the future."

    "abstract": "The sustainability of the healthcare sector is increasingly recognized as a crucial goal, aided by novel ideas and technologies. This study investigates the transformative potential of metaverse technologies, namely virtual laboratory simulations (VLS), in promoting sustainable healthcare practices through medical education. Our research focuses on the use of VLS in medical professional training, particularly in the field of medical virology. Our findings show that VLS has considerable advantages in teaching practical skills required for identifying and managing viral infections, resulting in a deeper knowledge among students. However, we discovered issues, such as technological difficulties encountered by users, that could impede effective deployment. This study emphasizes the metaverse's function as a sustainable practice with the potential to influence the future of medical education and healthcare services. We make specific recommendations for maximizing the integration of metaverse technology to optimize their educational benefits. Finally, the incorporation of developing metaverse technologies opens significant prospects for boosting healthcare sustainability by effectively reducing existing restrictions while improving healthcare delivery and education."

    "abstract": "Counterfeits in commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) devices pose significant security risks to supply chains, emphasizing the need for robust authentication methods. As the Internet of Things (IoT) continues to expand across various domains, such as autonomous vehicles (AVs), smart homes, and industrial automation, IoT devices have become ubiquitous. Many of these devices are equipped with wireless transceivers, enabling the use of radio frequency fingerprinting (RFF) for device authentication. One of the common RFF techniques is to extract unique features from in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) imbalance measurements. However, existing RFF techniques often rely on the use of a common test receiver, which limits their applicability in real world deployments. In this work, we propose a novel RFF technique independent of a common test receiver that leverages the crosstalk effect in the transceiver. An individual I/Q imbalance measurement is converted into an abstract data point that can be a vector value or, more generally, a probability density function (PDF). Our approach employs a statistical modeling framework that is lightweight and computationally efficient, eliminating the need for large labeled datasets or frequent model retraining. This makes the method well suited to real time implementation on platforms with limited computation and memory, since constellation gating, I/Q imbalance estimation, and PDF comparison can be implemented with simple streaming updates and a single distance check per recording. To examine the feasibility of the proposed method, we conducted extensive experiments using software-defined radios (SDRs) in different environments. Statistical analysis of the extracted fingerprints reveals that for a given device, the maximum measurement deviation (MMD) between a measured data point and the center of multiple measured points remains consistently smaller than the minimum inter-device distance, suggesting that it is feasible to generate stable and discriminative RFFs to authenticate COTS devices with transceivers in the supply chain."

    "abstract": "This article investigates the robustness of ratesplitting multiple access (RSMA) in multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems to interference attacks against channel acquisition induced by beyond-diagonal RISs (BD-RISs). Two primary attack strategies, random and aligned interference, are proposed for fully connected and group-connected reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) architectures. Valid random reflection coefficients are generated exploiting the Takagi factorization, while potent aligned interference attacks are achieved through optimization strategies based on a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP) reformulation followed by projections onto the unitary manifold. Our numerical findings reveal that, when perfect channel state information (CSI) is available, RSMA behaves similarly to space-division multiple access (SDMA) and thus is highly susceptible to the attack, with BD-RIS inducing severe performance loss and significantly outperforming diagonal RIS. However, under imperfect CSI, RSMA consistently demonstrates significantly greater robustness than SDMA, particularly as the system's transmit power increases."

The mission-critical and time-sensitive nature of these applications necessitates the design of low-latency FL frameworks that guarantee high learning performance. In practice, achieving low-latency FL faces two challenges: the overhead of computing and transmitting high-dimensional model updates, and the heterogeneity in <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">communication-and-computation</i> (C<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>) capabilities across devices.

Specifically, increasing batch sizes improves the accuracy of gradient estimation in FL and thus reduces the number of communication rounds required for convergence, but results in higher per-round latency, and vice versa. The associated problem of latency minimization is intractable; however, we solve it by designing an accurate and tractable surrogate for convergence speed, with parameters fitted to real data. This approach yields two batch-size control strategies tailored to scenarios with slow and fast fading, while also accommodating device heterogeneity. Extensive experiments using real datasets demonstrate that the proposed strategies outperform conventional batch-size adaptation schemes that do not consider the C<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> tradeoff or device heterogeneity."

    "abstract": "Large-scale generative artificial intelligence (AI) models are requiring massive optical interconnects to implement distributed training. However, intensity modulation direct detection (IM-DD) optics falls short in transmission distance due to dispersion-induce power fading. We propose a cost-effective carrier-assisted IM-DD (CA-IM-DD) scheme enabling single-lane >200 Gb/s transmission up to 75 km for scale-across applications. By adding a dedicated optical carrier, a single-sideband (SSB) signal is constructed with intensity modulation. To overcome the destruction of the Kramers-Kronig (KK) relation caused by receiver bandwidth limitation, two half-bandwidth field recovery (HB-FR) schemes, HB-KK and HB iteration cancellation (HB-IC), are implemented, which efficiently recovers the original SSB signal from received incomplete signal and eliminates signal-signal beating interference (SSBI) distortions. To estimate and remove the introduced phase noise, the residual carrier is adopted to accurately track the phase noise between two individual lasers. Experimentally, we transmit 45-Gbaud subcarrier modulation probabilistically-shaped 64-QAM across a standard single-mode fiber (SSMF) link. The measured normalized generalized mutual information (NGMI) meets the threshold of 0.857 after transmission, achieving gross data rates of 211.5 Gb/s (75 km) and 265.5 Gb/s (0 km). Meanwhile, the feasibility of residual carrier-based CPR is investigated. Several combinations with 1-MHz and 100-kHz linewidths lasers are employed, showing consistency on NGMI performance. The demonstrated CA-IM-DD system offers a distance-extended, power-efficient and cost-effective solution for next-generation 200 G datacenter interconnects."

    "abstract": "In wireless localization, non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation in complex environments significantly degrades the time-of-arrival (TOA) positioning accuracy of ultra-wideband (UWB) systems. However, existing robust optimization methods mainly rely on interval uncertainty set modeling for NLOS errors, which inherently neglects the non-uniformity and correlation of NLOS errors, with these interval set bounds often being conservatively predefined. To address these issues, this paper proposes replacing interval sets with ellipsoidal uncertainty sets for a more accurate characterization of the statistical properties of NLOS errors. In particular, the ellipsoidal uncertainty set is constructed based on the mean vector and covariance matrix of NLOS errors predicted by a deep learning model. Since ellip-soidal uncertainty sets inherently lead to nonconvex formulations, we introduce auxiliary variables for reparameterization and apply the S-lemma, thereby reformulating the original problem into a tractable convex optimization problem. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that, compared with existing methods, our ellipsoidal set-based approach, which accounts for the non-uniformity and correlation of NLOS errors, significantly improves localization accuracy and robustness across various complex environments."

Central to our model is a Binary Neural Network (BNN) architecture that reduces computational overhead by quantizing weights and activations while preserving detail. EeveeDark incorporates (i) modality-specific binary encoders for processing RAW frames and event data, (ii) a lightweight fusion block for integrating spatial and temporal cues, and (iii) an event-guided skip gating mechanism for dynamic spatiotemporal refinement.

Prior and precise finding of complaint as well as relevant proposals of toxin would be an essential role in perfection husbandry. This endeavour suggests an extensive literacy- based pattern of automated factory complaints vaticination and toxin recommendation. The ideas of the proposed system leverage the use of image datasets containing factory leaves that can be used to classify high-delicacy complaint-affected crops. When the name of a crop and complaint are interconnected, the system suggests accurate diseases adapted to the definite condition hence assisting the grower to make sound decision making. Combined complaints bracket and toxin suggestion, this strategy would offer an increased crop working, a decline in homemade dependence and ease of harvest loss.

    "abstract": "In this paper, a novel computing architecture for analogue signals is proposed to meet the specifications of real-time thermal environments and wearable electronics with resource constraints. The proposed architecture differs from prior art digital signal processing systems, which dissipate considerable power and computational resources. The proposed architecture utilises ultra-low-power analogue circuits to directly operate on environmental signals, such as temperature, humidity, gas concentrations, and light intensity, in the analogue domain. The system implements efficient signal conditioning, feature extraction, and anomaly detection using core building blocks, such as operational transconductance amplifiers (OTAs), analogue integrators, floating-gate MOSFETs, and event-driven ADCs, without requiring constant digital sampling. An adaptive thresholding and choice are made possible by a neuromorphic analogue processing core and are responsive in real-time. It is built using 0.18 μm lithography CMOS and optimised for wearable platforms in terms of area-efficient layout and energy-conscious operation, utilising tiny energy harvesters. Experimental simulations and prototype measurements have proven that the analogue system is significantly more energy-efficient than its digital equivalents, with a processing energy consumption of less than 50 mW per module and an accuracy range of 8,592 per cent, making it suitable for monitoring environmental conditions. The system is capable of resisting noisy input very well, which means it can be applied in the real world, where power and reliability are essential limitations. The proposed architecture extends battery life and facilitates easy integration into flexible, skin-compatible wearable devices, as it alleviates the demand for complex digital processing and information transmission. The foundation for future research on bio-inspired analogue signal processing for edge intelligence in energy-constrained systems has been established in this work, which may be considered a breakthrough in self-powered, intelligent wearable devices for energy and health monitoring technologies."

This article proposes a causality-aware, large language model–enhanced distribution-preserving graph representation learning framework (LLM-DP-GRL) for fast and accurate stability prediction and decision-making. The DP-GRL model captures both structural and distributional properties of network states, whereas large language models provide physics-informed priors that improve data efficiency and generalization under multicontingency and out-of-distribution scenarios. A causal intervention module further quantifies bus-level influence on stability margins, offering interpretable insights consistent with system dynamics. The learned surrogate model is integrated into a cooperative preventive–emergency control strategy, enabling real-time stability margin evaluation and optimization. Tests on the IEEE 39-bus and 118-bus systems show that LLM-DP-GRL achieves higher accuracy, faster convergence, and improved robustness compared with conventional machine learning, LSTM, and GNN-based methods. The proposed approach reduces online control computation from over 35 min (TDS-based) to 39 s while maintaining inference latency below 30 ms. These results demonstrate that combining graph learning, LLM-guided priors, and causal analysis provides an effective and scalable solution for stability assessment and emergency control in low-inertia, high-renewable power systems."

    "abstract": "The detection of weak defects in eddy current pulsed thermography is hampered by nonuniform heating and thermal diffusion, which cause low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). While conventional principal component thermography (PCT) is widely used for data reduction, its nature as a “blind” statistical tool often fails to separate these subtle defect signatures from the dominant background noise. To address this, we adapt conventional PCT by introducing a saliency-based spatial weighting strategy. The core innovation is a weighting scheme where a spatial saliency map, derived from time-integrated thermal energy, is nonlinearly enhanced via a gamma transformation. Integrating this high-contrast weight map into the PCT algorithm transforms it from a blind statistical tool into a targeted, guided analysis. Validated on six diverse metallic specimens, the proposed spatially weighted PCT (SW-PCT) significantly outperforms traditional PCT and other representative methods in SNR, especially for enhancing weak defects. An optimized vectorized implementation ensures high computational efficiency, establishing SW-PCT as a robust solution that balances detection accuracy and processing speed for industrial nondestructive testing applications."

The effects of the intensity of light, the availability of nutrients, the density of algae on the performance of the system are studied. The results indicate that the prototype can provide the consistent voltages up to 7 V, which can be used to drive lowvoltage gadgets and sensors, especially in a setting without an electric grid or off-grid settings. In addition to energy generation the system has other benefits in ecological values and cost-effective implementation.

    "abstract": "This work provides a light-weight deep-learning customer segmentation pipeline in engineering-based retail settings. The proposed work uses an autoencoder-based latent feature extraction alongside unsupervised clustering. The data consists of 15,079 customer records, which have five basic behavioral and demographic characteristics. In order to have a reproducible assessment benchmark, the data were treated via a stratified 80/20 train-test divide; the auto-coder was furnished with the training data to train as a non-linear latent representation. The best combination of clusters was obtained through the silhouette analysis and the elbow method, where a better silhouette score was attained at k = 2 (0.56). Other measures, such as Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) and Normalised Mutual Information (NMI), were also calculated to ensure stability of the clusters. To compare the latent embeddings of the autoencoder to the benchmark, representations of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) were compared to the latent embeddings of the autoencoder. The autoencoder proved to have a better ability to discover concealed segments of behaviour in micro-dimensions that were not reflected in the conventional dimensionality reduction. The findings revealed that, although demographic variations across clusters were not significant, there was a significant variance in spending behaviour, which is critical in targeted marketing, personalized recommendations, optimisation of loyalty programmes, and strategic pricing. The contribution of this work is that it provides a resource-efficient neural framework, which combines both feature learning and unsupervised clustering in aiding marketing decision-making. The implications of the results are widely applicable in the retail, engineering, and customer analytics sectors, in which behavioural insights can be used to develop personalised engagement tactics."

    "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) involves complex disruptions in large-scale brain connectivity, which vary across individuals and are rooted in both neurodevelopmental and genetic factors. To better model this variability, we introduce a biologically informed Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework that integrates insights from evolutionary biology, gene expression, spatial neuroanatomy, and functional brain dynamics. By embedding these priors into brain graph representations derived from resting-state fMRI, our framework captures both individualized connectivity patterns and biologically conserved relationships. A dual-stage GNN is then trained for ASD classification and emotional state decoding. Experimental results demonstrate improved performance (87% Accuracy) and interpretability, highlighting the promise of biologically enriched graph learning in advancing precision modeling of neurodevelopmental conditions."

    "abstract": "With the continuous development of meteorological observation and detection means as well as numerical forecasting technology, meteorological data have seen a huge growth in terms of types, forms, and volume, which has brought great challenges to the retrieval of meteorological data. In order to alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose a method named GeoMet, which is based on the Geohash encoding algorithm. Specifically, it firstly decodes meteorological data by the NetCDF library, then employs the Geohash algorithm to spatially encode data. This process transforms the two-dimensional latitude and longitude spatial ranges into comparable one-dimensional strings. Thirdly, according to the characteristics of meteorological data access, we store the processed data in a columnar database, with spatial indexes constructed by the one-dimensional geohash strings. Finally, we conduct experiments on real ERA5 meteorological reanalysis datasets to evaluate the performance of our method. The experimental results demonstrate that for different data query scenarios, the efficiency of retrievals based on GeoMet improved by at least 81.7% compared to traditional spatial range-based retrievals."

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems in domains such as healthcare, transportation, industrial automation, and smart cities has created an urgent need for secure, efficient, and privacy-preserving communication methods. Conventional cryptographic techniques impose excessive computational, memory, and energy overhead on resource-constrained IoT devices, limiting their practical adoption. This paper presents a hybrid security framework that integrates Federated Learning (FL), Homomorphic Encryption (HE), and Lightweight Cryptography (LWC) into a unified pipeline for privacy-preserving IoT environments. FL enables decentralized training without exposing raw data, HE allows secure computation over encrypted updates, and LWC ensures low-complexity cryptographic operations suitable for constrained devices. Experimental evaluation using the NSL-KDD dataset shows that the proposed FL+HE+LWC framework achieves 91.63% accuracy, an F1-score of 92.72%, and reduces privacy risk to 0.08, with minimal overhead in communication and latency compared to existing solutions. Preliminary validation on the UNSW-NB15 dataset further demonstrates adaptability across diverse IoT benchmarks. The results confirm that combining FL, HE, and LWC enhances communication security, efficiency, and attack resistance, making the framework a novel and practical solution for scalable and privacy-preserving IoT deployments."

    "abstract": "Concentrated solar power (CSP) has experienced rapid development in recent years due to its inertia and energy storage characteristics. Compared to traditional thermal power units, CSP systems typically have a smaller unit capacity and lower inertia. Furthermore, CSP plants are generally located in remote desert areas, far from load centers. When active power is transmitted over long-distance lines, oscillations may be triggered due to mismatches in the unit parameters, excitation parameters, and line parameters. Therefore, this paper investigates the oscillation stability of the grid-connected CSP plant. To this end, a comprehensive system model is first established, which includes the dynamic models of the solar concentrator heating system, the thermal energy storage system, and the power generation system. Based on the small-signal model, the oscillation modes of the system are obtained through modal analysis. The oscillation modes related to the excitation system shift to the right as the excitation system parameters increase, indicating that excessively large excitation parameters could pose a risk of oscillation in the system. The results of time-domain simulation analysis also confirm this conclusion."

Wireless sensing technology has garnered attention due to its non-invasive nature and privacy protection benefits. However, current solutions face numerous challenges, such as a gradual decline in detection accuracy under blanket coverage, overly coarse posture classification, and difficulty in continuously tracking changes in sleep posture. This study presents a millimeter-wave radar-based sleep posture classification system that functions effectively even under blanket coverage and continuously monitors 14 sleep postures and 28 posture transitions. Experimental results demonstrate that the system maintains an accuracy of approximately 95% for classifying 6 sleep postures, even with blanket coverage, which is significantly higher than other methods. In the framework of classifying 14 sleep postures and 28 posture transitions, the system achieves over 85% classification accuracy and shows excellent robustness in real-world scenarios."

Optimizing value streams is crucial for modern software organizations, which are increasingly characterized by diverse and evolving roles. Implementing a digital twin in this context can significantly enhance the ability to identify opportunities for improvement and explore potential change scenarios. To overcome these adoption barriers, we propose PRIMAD, a progressive methodology for building an SDLC DT that delivers incremental benefits by leveraging existing empirical data from issue-tracking systems, such as JIRA. This approach resolves the \"cold start\" problem, enabling simulations to emerge directly from real-world behavior. Our methodology integrates a Python-based simulation core with an Akka actor system for modeling issues and resources, enriched by supervised machine learning for context-aware predictions. Preliminary results validating PRIMAD components independently (using pm4py, Akka, and LightGBM) show promising outcomes. This paper details our methodology, presents preliminary component-wise results, and outlines future work."

In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models for classifying the number of drones based on Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) values from fifth-generation (5G) wireless communication. An experimental setup comprising a 5G transmitter and receiver is established using Ettus E312 software-defined radios. Then, multiple drones were allowed to fly between this transceiver pair and collect the RSSI values at the receiver. A balanced dataset comprised of continuous RSSI samples is prepared, which is then segmented into windows for training and evaluation. These RSSI samples are trained using various deep learning architectures, including LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM, BiGRU, and their hybrid models with CNN, alongside traditional machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost. The performance of these models is evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the curve (AUC). The results showed that XGBoost achieved the highest accuracy of 89.72% and a macro-average AUC of 0.9923, while CNN reached an accuracy of 89.38% and a macro-average AUC of 0.9937. Experimental results show that simpler models like XGBoost and CNN outperform more complex DL architectures in terms of both accuracy and AUC."

    "abstract": "By accurately predicting electricity load in the steel industry, enterprises can be enabled to gain a more precise understanding of power operation conditions and to make reasonable dispatching decisions accordingly, thus enhancing production efficiency. Due to the complex processes and multiple load categories in the steel industry, among which the fluctuations of impact loads are particularly intense, forecasting impact loads in the steel industry has always been a research hotspot for researchers. A hierarchical multi-head attention mechanism model integrating production scheduling data is proposed to achieve refined modeling and forecasting of multi-process load fluctuations, employing a three-layer attention architecture to parse complex correlations between processes in a layer-by-layer fashion: bottom-layer intra-process attention highlights key operations within each process; middle-layer inter-process attention captures collaborative effects and differentiated relationships across processes; top-layer global attention fuses process correlation features and load temporal features, adjusts temporal weights, and enables future load forecasting. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with traditional forecasting models and single-attention architectures, significant improvements in load forecasting accuracy are achieved by the proposed model, thereby providing a \"data-driven + process-aware\" approach for load forecasting in the steel industry, facilitating power grid load balancing and energy consumption optimization, and realizing substantial engineering application value."

Related Work Microgrid systems are widely monitored and managed based on IoT. Despite this fact, IoT-based solutions are also getting restricted more and more with high latency and restricted processing power as the microgrid becomes more complex. This paper aims to circumvent these computational inefficiencies and maximize the overall system efficiency. This paper examines the use of Edge computing in the microgrid. The study measures and compares the latency, data rate, and energy efficiency between Edge computing and IoT via a microgrid testbed. As observed in the actual experiment, the latency can be significantly reduced and the data processing efficiency significantly enhanced by edge computing compared with the traditional way of IoT. Through the support for flexible and efficient microgrid operation, edge computing contributes to the optimal utilization of resources and the stability of the grid. The findings of the study indicate that edge computing offers a promising alternative to address the limitations of classic IoT to deliver more advanced and intelligent microgrid management strategies.

In this paper, we review the limitations of current deep learning-based object detection algorithms and analyze the performance of recent architectures including YOLO, Mask Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (MRCNN) and adaptations for small object detection in aerial scenarios. We highlight key architectural strategies such as Keypoint (Keypoint MRCNN) and multi-task learning (Hydra MRCNN) that have been developed to address the few-pixel feature limitations inherent in detecting objects such as cars in aerial datasets. Through comparative experiments on benchmark UAV datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of selected techniques in improving detection accuracy for small targets and assess the generalization performance. Our findings indicate that while Keypoint MRCNN enhances recall by incorporating scale-invariant structural cues, Hydra MRCNN excels at capturing fine-grained features through dynamic multi-branch learning. We further evaluate cross-dataset generalization and discuss how inconsistent labeling—such as the presence or absence of ignore regions—impacts performance. This work contributes insights into robust small object detection under real-world UAV conditions and highlights the need for tailored dataset design and adaptive architectures."

In this paper, we extend the state-of-the-art SSL framework for bird sound classification by implementing and evaluating three advanced few-shot inference methods combined with enhanced pre-trained audio neural network (PANN) selection strategies. Using extended training (300 epochs), enhanced data augmentation, and multi-stage PANN filtering on the BirdCLEF 2020 dataset with 10,000 evaluation tasks, we achieve adequate performance improvements over previous work. Our enhancement to Barlow Twins model with smart segment selection achieves 62.72% accuracy in 5-way 1-shot classification, representing a 10.77% improvement over baseline methods and approaching the base paper’s performance of 64.19%. With the implementation of enhanced PANN selection, we achieve 65.18% accuracy, exceeding the original benchmark.

Existing unimodal based machine learning methods are difficult to comprehensively capture the complex motor symptoms of PD due to modal homogeneity and spatio-temporal alignment challenges of heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose Parkinson’s Heterogeneous Stream Fusion Framework (PHSFF), which for the first time unites event camera gait data and RGB hand video data to achieve high-precision assisted diagnosis through dual-stream network architecture and dynamic decision-level fusion. PHSFF innovatively designs: Firstly, for event stream gait data, a feature extraction module is constructed based on the Spiking Neural Network (SNN) with Temporal-Channel Joint Attention (TCJA). This module utilizes the bio-temporal coding properties of spiking neurons to enhance the gait phase modeling capability. Secondly, for RGB hand videos, a cascade architecture of Graph Attention Network variant 2 (GATv2) with BiLSTM is proposed, which is derived from the spatial relationships of hand joint points and temporal motion to extract tremor and bradykinesia features; Thirdly, a dynamic weighted fusion strategy is designed to integrate complementary information from heterogeneous modalities at the decision-level to avoid the temporal alignment problem. A series of experiments on the self- constructed multimodal dataset PHG-MD have shown that PHSFF is able to achieve better performance."

In Indonesia itself, it is often not free from attacks of dangerous diseases that can affect health issues in society in the future, one of which is \"Stroke.\" Stroke ranked second in the world as a cause of death after ischemic heart disease in 2019. However, in Indonesia, this disease ranked first as the leading cause of death in the same year, with recorded data of 131.8 deaths per 100,000 population. There are several risk factors that can increase a person's potential to suffer from a stroke, including three main factors: health factors, lifestyle factors, and other factors. Other factors include age and hereditary factors. Therefore, in relation to this, a machine was created and programmed to identify the factors of stroke disease. The machine has obtained prediction results using several algorithms, including KNN which achieved an accuracy of 98%, Decision Tree which achieved an accuracy of 98%, SVM which achieved an accuracy of 81%, and Logistic Regression which achieved an accuracy of 76%. These four algorithms will be combined with one of the algorithms from the ensemble machine learning method, namely the stacking classifier, which results in an accuracy improvement to 99.35. This can prove the hypothesis regarding the indication of 3 stroke-causing factors based on three factors: age, blood sugar, and weight. Next, the recommendation for future research is to focus on experimenting with other meta-models of ensemble machine learning methods, such as bagging or voting. Additionally, it can also focus on other base models of the four algorithms used in this study to be further improved through ensemble machine learning method."

The technique consists of four different stages that begin with data preparation followed by preprocessing and the model development and finally a performance evaluation. MobileNetV2 is an advanced architecture that functions as a mobile as well as embedded systems operating model with its light-weight architecture that ensures accuracy and performance in minimal compute requirements. Evaluation of the performance of the model is based on a classification report and a confusion matrix and an analysis of the accuracy of the training and validation. The model proposed overall accuracy of 95 percent with very good precision and recall and F1 scores across all classes of classification. The model is very robust since the confusion matrix indicates few figures comprising of misclassifications. As of the system implementation, MobileNetV2 proves to be efficient in bringing accuracy in classifying animal images, thus rendering itself useful in animal conservation efforts and livestock applications on management and commercial automation processes."

Artificial intelligence has greatly enhanced the human intelligence with machine learning, neural networking, deep-learning etc. The world of finance is also witnessing the rise in efficiency, effectiveness and productivity with deployment of such innovations & techniques. The financial ecosystem has started exploring the usage of one of the latest development in this area, Agentic-AI. This is providing a competitive edge through hyperpersonalizing the experience of users while providing the power of autonomous decision-making. Despite of these advantages, agentic-AI systems have yet to be seen with widespread adoption in the global financial world. This poses for a great case of examining the different relevant psychological and perceptual factors influencing Agentic-AI adoption intentions in the financial advisory services. Grounded in the Technology Affordances and Constraints Theory (TACT) & technology acceptance framework (TAM), this study explores a multidimensional model investigating role of consumers' perceptions and technological affordances. Further, the impact of Consumer Technology Vulnerability (CTV) is investigated as a mediator in these relationships. To achieve this the survey results of 213 users of Agentic-AI enabled financial services in India are analyzed using PLS-SEM. The findings conclude CTV as a partial mediator in this relationship."

Based on the stringent space envelope and performance requirements from the application, two candidate versions of such machine with the same stator outer diameter, rotor inner diameter, permanent magnet volume, air gap length, and axial stack length, have been proposed. The response surface method is implemented to carry out optimization of the two machine configurations based on two-dimensional parametric finite element analysis. The optimal designs of the machines are comprehensively compared with a conventional fractional-slot concentrated-winding permanent magnet synchronous machine with spoke-type rotor. Additionally, three-dimensional finite element analysis is employed to reveal the end effect from the peculiar stator topology.

    "abstract": "The coordinated control system (CCS) of coal-fired unit is crucial for their stable and economical operation. However, existing methods struggle to adapt to the variable operating conditions of the unit, particularly in dynamically matching the main steam pressure with load setpoints, resulting in suboptimal control performance. To address this challenge, a dual-layer collaborative optimization approach is proposed in this study. In the optimization layer, a Background Knowledge Graph (BKG) for CCS is constructed to effectively integrate historical operational data and expert knowledge, identifying the complex coupling relationship between load and main steam pressure, thereby generating an optimal operating setpoint curve that balances both economic efficiency and operation stability. In the control layer, the Data-Driven Predictive Control (DDPC) algorithm is employed to overcome the limitations of model-dependent control algorithms, which tends to deliver unsatisfactory control performance with low model accuracy. Experimental results based on real data of a 300MW subcritical coal-fired unit in a power plant in China demonstrate that the proposed method reduces operational costs and improves control accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art methods."

    "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurological disorder that affects a subject's growth and development in the formative years. This can have a life-long impact on the quality of life, as it influences the way individuals interact, communicate, and behave. With advancements in deep learning (DL) approaches, it has been possible to detect ASD as early as at the age of one and half years. DL models generate quick and automated classifications and predictions using facial image data, about a subject being autistic or otherwise. A lot of work has been done in this direction. However, in most of these works, the DL models generate outputs as either as classifications or predictions. Generally, no one DL model is generally best for both tasks. Also, there can be huge impact of the optimizers, early stopping, etc. on the outcomes of the DL models. To demonstrate this, we therefore, compare the performances of state-of-art DL models: ResNet152, MobileNet, VGG16, Xception and Vision Transformer (ViT); two optimizers Adam's and Lion; as well as two stopping criteria: early stopping and without. All the tests were performed on the publicly available dataset of children facial images: divided as autistic and non autistic. Our results show that ViT combined with Adam's optimizer, outperformed other DL models by generating a 91.88% accuracy without early stopping as well as 91.88% classification score. On the other hand, VGG16 gave the best performance when combined with Lion's optimizer with an accuracy of 90.36% and classification score of 90.35%, without early stopping. On the contrary, the performances of all the models and optimizers were quite poor with early stopping. We feel that our work is first of its kind to perform such comparison and provide a line of research for interested researchers."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a Disturbance Observer (DOB)based control strategy for grid-connected converters and evaluates its performance against the conventional PI plus decoupling approach. The proposed structure is formulated as a direct modification of traditional decoupling mechanisms, allowing unmodelled dynamics and delays to be interpreted as input disturbances that can be estimated and compensated. The observer relies on a single tuning parameter which simultaneously determines both robustness and dynamic performance, inherently leading to design trade-offs. The main properties of the strategy are analysed, and its behaviour is assessed through time-domain simulations under different operating conditions, including parameter mismatches, weak grid scenarios and control-input delays. The results show that the DOB preserves the nominal performance of the conventional approach when no uncertainties are present. In addition, in non-nominal conditions, it provides a superior disturbance rejection and reduces cross-coupling effects at the cost of a more oscillatory transient, and a lower sensitivity margin as the observer bandwidth grows. Overall, the DOB-based proposed controller appears as a robust alternative to classical decoupling schemes."

Realistic usage data are essential for the effective sizing of low-power charging facilities and designing their power flow management algorithms. Unfortunately, available datasets only provide aggregate quantities but do not offer detailed information on the charging facility. This paper aims to fill this research gap by presenting a dataset of real usage data collected in two pilot charging facilities developed at the University of Pisa, Italy. One simple facility consisting of three EV chargers directly connected to the electric grid, while the second one is based on the microgrid concept. The detailed information on charging events, anonymous user data, PV production, and battery usage is collected in the proposed dataset. The database is provided freely to the scientific community as a benchmark for the sizing, development, and validation of workplace charging facilities. It currently contains the data collected during the first 16 months of activity, but it will continue to be updated."

The paper details the system architecture, component sizing, construction methodology, and grid-tie technical measures, followed by a comprehensive assessment of energy yield, energy-saving potential, and economic viability. Annual generation is projected at 3.37 GWh, meeting approximately 15% of the WWTP's electricity demand. This output corresponds to an annual reduction of 1078.88 tonnes of standard coal. The project achieves a payback period of 10.88 years, demonstrating significant environmental benefits and economic feasibility.

This study explores the use of Faster R-CNN with an EfficientNetV2 backbone for automatic fracture detection and investigates enhancements through feature aggregation and cost-sensitive optimization. Using the FracAtlas dataset (4,083 images with 717 fracture annotations), we evaluated baseline and enhanced models with standardized preprocessing, augmentation, and training strategies. The proposed configuration with Path Aggregation FPN and cost-sensitive loss achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.50:0.95) of 0.2016, representing a 21.6% relative improvement over the baseline Faster R-CNN with EfficientNetV2-S. Results indicate that reweighting errors on small fracture regions and strengthening bidirectional feature fusion can provide more reliable detection, though challenges remain in achieving precise bounding-box localization at stricter IoU thresholds. This suggests that the approach has potential as a supportive tool in computer-aided diagnosis, contributing incremental improvements to bone fracture detection workflows."

    "abstract": "A narrow band of spectral lines observed in the low-frequency analysis and recording (LOFAR) of the underwater acoustic signal received by the passive sonar indicates the presence of underwater targets. However, low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions degrade the quality of the LOFAR spectrum, causing these spectral lines to become weak or buried in ambient noise. Traditional line enhancing often struggle to suppress residual noise effectively due to weighted noise in adaptation. This paper presents a robust spectral enhancement framework that integrates frequency domain ALE preprocessing with an dual attention guided iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm (ISTA) in the wavelet domain. The ALE stage effectively reduces broadband noise and preserves spectral line structure. The subsequent ISTA block utilizes the wavelet transform’s multiresolution and localized time-frequency analysis capabilities and incorporates a learnable attention mechanism that adaptively weights wavelet coefficients to perform enhancement by preserving spectral features and promoting sparsity. Experimental evaluations show that the proposed method, namely dual attention guided wavelet domain ISTA-Net spectral line enhancer achieves an SNR improvement of 4.45 dB over fast block-processed sparsity-based ALE and 6.37 dB over conventional frequency-domain ALE. To further study the recognition accuracy of the proposed method, a ResNet-based classifier is used. The proposed method attains a classification accuracy of 96.32% outperforming existing state-of-the-art techniques. These results confirm the method’s effectiveness in enhancing target detection and recognition in underwater environments."

    "abstract": "Modern intrusion detection systems increasingly rely on machine learning models that can handle heterogeneous flow features, severe class imbalance, and evolving network traffic. While prior Transformer-based IDS approaches have shown promise, many suffer from evaluation issues such as temporal leakage and insufficient handling of extreme class imbalance. This work introduces a comprehensive framework that combines a strictly leak-free evaluation protocol with an encoder-only Transformer that treats flow features as tokens, enabling the model to capture cross-feature interactions while remaining lightweight and deployment-friendly. The architecture incorporates a learnable feature-gating tokenizer and attention-based pooling, trained within a pipeline that uses time-aware splits, train-only preprocessing, robust imputation, outlier handling, and quantile-based scaling. Training stability and generalization are further improved through mixup regularization, a One-Cycle learning-rate schedule, stochastic weight averaging, and a focal-style loss for imbalanced data.On the CICIDS2017 benchmark, the proposed Transformer achieves an AUC-ROC of 0.99986, a PR-AUC of 0.99944, an accuracy of 0.9978, and an F1-score of 0.9943 for binary intrusion detection. In the more challenging 15-class setting, it attains an accuracy of 0.9977 and a macro F1-score of 0.6939, with strong performance on frequent attack categories. The model demonstrates competitive performance compared to traditional tree-based methods while maintaining exceptional computational efficiency with only 354K parameters and 0.0087ms inference latency per flow. An ablation study confirms the contribution of each pipeline component to overall robustness."

Traditional soil testing methods are time-consuming, requiring several weeks for laboratory results, and often do not include crop recommendations. To address this issue, we propose a system integrating sensor technology with machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Naïve Bayes, and KNN classifiers to analyse soil properties in real time. Sensors measure key soil parameters such as N, P, K, pH, temperature, and humidity, transmitting real time data to three machine learning models implemented in Python. The proposed system then predicts three optimal fertilizer and crop choices, enhancing both yield and soil sustainability. Instead of suggesting generic fertilizers, the model detects nutrient deficiencies and recommends only the necessary supplements. Using multiple algorithms, it generates three crop and fertilizer options, giving farmers the flexibility to choose the best fit for their needs. For random data samples collected from nearby our areas, proposed method predicts Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassium and pH with the accuracy of 95.24%, 97.96%, 97.23% and 100% respectively."

    "abstract": "Phishing remains a persistent and rapidly evolving cybersecurity challenge, with adversaries leveraging advanced tactics such as zero-day exploits, code obfuscation, and misleading URLs. Traditional detection methods, including blacklist-based methods and heuristic methods, often have trouble identifying recently emerging or highly advanced phishing patterns. To transcend these limitations, this research presents TriStack, a stacking ensemble hybrid framework aimed at improving detection accuracy without compromising interpretability. The model we propose integrates Random Forest and XGBoost as base learners, with a Decision Tree as the meta-classifier. Unlike most of the previous works that work with imbalanced data, this research employs a well-structured dataset containing 11,430 URLs, distributed evenly between phishing and legitimate samples with 87 extracted features. Model performance is assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Experimental analysis shows that TriStack achieves accuracy of 0.9624, precision of 0.9603, recall of 0.9637, and F1 score of 0.9620. These findings demonstrate that the proposed approach offers strong predictive capability and the ability for light-weight deployment, making it a viable option for incorporation into real-world security frameworks. The method’s equilibrium between accuracy and explainability emphasizes its promise as a viable protection approach against phishing threats."

    "abstract": "This study evaluates the performance of a synchronous MariaDB Galera Cluster deployed across homogeneous (AWS-only, Proxmox-only) and hybrid (AWS-Proxmox) cloud configurations. Benchmarking with SysBench under OLTP workloads reveals that the homogeneous AWS deployment delivers superior performance, achieving an average throughput of 2,131.92 TPS for read-only and 104.42 TPS for write-only operations. This represents a 63.5% and 36.9% performance advantage over the Proxmox-only cluster for read and write operations, respectively. The hybrid configuration provides a balanced compromise, delivering intermediate performance at 1,203.06 TPS (read-only) and 91.74 TPS (write-only), which is 43.6% lower in read throughput and 12.1% lower in write throughput compared to the AWS-only setup. The Proxmox-only cluster yields the lowest average throughput. The results quantify the inherent performance-resilience trade-off, demonstrating that while a unified public cloud offers optimal performance, the hybrid model is a viable alternative for read-intensive, high-availability applications. A universal limitation is identified: synchronous replication imposes a severe write-scalability bottleneck, with 95th percentile latency exceeding 1,200 ms beyond 64 concurrent threads across all deployments. This work provides crucial empirical benchmarks and architectural guidance for deploying stateful database services in hybrid cloud environments."

    "abstract": "In this paper, a new Multi-Modal Edge Inference Processor that incorporates Memory-In-Logic (MiL) architecture is introduced to be used in real-time detection of emotions and health states; it is targeted at wearable and mobile health devices. The proposed system addresses the shortcoming of traditional von Neumann architectures in which processing is embedded into the memory fabric via ReRAM-based in-memory computing to greatly decrease the latency and energy overheads associated with frequent memory access. The processor will process heterogeneous sensor inputs, such as face expression data (low power cameras), voice (on-chip microphone arrays) and physiological vitals like ECG and PPG (analog front-ends). A cross-modal attention module is conducted to unite these heterogeneous information flows to perform robust and context-aware inference. Inference of lightweight neural network models (e.g. quantized transformers and GRUs) is supported on-chip with 4-bit and 8-bit arithmetic to enable efficient inference at the edge with stringent area and power budgets. The simulation outcomes show the “0.8 ms average latency, 4.2 mW at 1.2 V” response time and power consumption of less than 5 mW, and detection accuracy varying between 85 and 92 percent across all the emotion and health state classes. The proposed solution ascends up to 40 percent better energy efficiency and 30 percent lesser inference latency compared to the traditional edge processors. Also, the architecture can do adaptive learning, with incremental updates to the memory with gated logic circuits in the MiL array, allowing to refine the model continuously on-device. The processor is scalable, reconfigurable, and very much fit in real-time processing in personalized healthcare, emotion-aware systems, and constant physiological monitoring, thereby extending the <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{A I}$</tex> processing capabilities to the extreme edge."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel strategy for speed range expansion of direct torque controlled (DTC) open end winding induction motor drives powered from two inverters with a common DC supply. The problem of using common DC supply for an open end winding configuration is the flow of high circulating current because of the common mode voltage generated across the windings. Therefore, the scheme proposed in this paper for speed range extension, also incorporate a switching method to eliminate common mode voltage. For operating the motor at higher speed in the constant torque operating area, more fundamental voltage should be applied at the motor windings. So to get increased fundamental voltage across the windings without increasing the DC link voltage, this paper proposes a modified DTC scheme in which both the inverters are controlled based on the desired flux trajectory while operating from a single DC source. This scheme thus facilitates extension of the speed range in the constant torque region and delay the onset of the flux weakening. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified using PLECS simulation software."

However, the introduction of distributed frameworks and increased networking of information transmission have also significantly heightened the risk of cyberattacks on power dispatch systems. To address this gap, a novel dispatch framework is proposed to ensure the economical and secure operation of microgrids amidst FDI attacks on communication links. in communication networks. We propose an attack detection mechanism based on trust subnetwork observation and an attack isolation mechanism based on dynamic reputation value updates. These mechanisms enable the effective isolation of malicious nodes in microgrids through a fully distributed approach, ensuring both system security and economic operation. Through comprehensive simulations and comparative studies on a standard IEEE 39-node system, the proposed method is verified to be both correct and effective."

There are numerous problems that necessitate the computation of semantic similarity, which is then calculated using word similarity, such as question answering systems, machine translation, text summarization, recommendation systems, etc. Recent trends in word similarity calculation include the use of encoder-decoder-based systems, LLMs, and other techniques. Deep learning-based word similarity algorithms need a huge amount of training data as well as a highly accurate model. This paper proposes a knowledge graph called SimNet, which can be used for the calculation of concept similarity, for the creation of encoded knowledge bases, as an extension for creating other major knowledge bases, and can be converted to a training dataset for deep learning models. SimNet is evaluated by a dataset containing various types of terms such as synonyms, antonyms, hypernyms/hyponyms, related words, and unrelated words.

    "abstract": "With rapid urbanization continuing and traffic density rises daily, pedestrian safety at road crossings has quickly become a serious concern. Most conventional crosswalk systems use fixed time periods which cannot adjust to pedestrian flow on a real-time basis and can cause unnecessary waiting periods, increased pedestrian accident and congestion risk. The new capabilities of the Internet of Things (IoT) allow for the implementation of adaptive, intelligent crosswalk systems to enhance pedestrian safety and operations of the road system. We show IoT-based pedestrian movement monitoring framework, including distributed sensing, soft real-time data processing and analytics, and intelligent traffic signal control. The method utilizes a series of connected sensors to monitor pedestrian density and movement; the information (and available meta-information) from the sensors is processed at the edge, or in the cloud, to control traffic signals reactively in real-time, which limits congestion and anomalous behaviors. A simulation of a prototype was designed, and tested, or assessed, to evaluate the possible usefulness and effectiveness of the approach; simulation results indicated that the method produced a lesser increase in average pedestrian waiting time while producing an increased vehicle volume, and a significant increase in the validity of safety compared to fixed-time signal methods. These results demonstrate possible implications for IoT-centered crosswalk systems in the context of improved aide for pedestrian operating at crossings."

This early diagnosis and timely treatment are important to the success of the treatment and survival enhancement. However, most imaging-based systems are traditional with too many false-positives and low interpretability. We suggest a deep learning pipeline that can be interpreted and directly applied to X-ray lung diseases classification. It would be aimed to improve the accuracy of diagnosis, interpretability, and computation speed of the stacked ensemble of YOLOv8 models attached to a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) meta-classifier. To form a balanced dataset of 800 chest x-ray images on Roboflow, five classes were used i.e. bacterial pneumonia, viral pneumonia, tuberculosis, coronavirus infection and normal lung. Preprocessing included image resizing (224224), partition of data (train, validation, and test) and split of images (95) by at least 3 percent with respect to the model accuracy, which was (Nano: 85% and Small: 88% and Medium: 88% and Large: 86percent) image. The stacked ensemble classifier was observed to be with an overall accuracy of 89 per cent and AUCs of between 0.95 to 1.00. The next step is to increase the information and multi-modality imaging with a purpose of real-time and clinical relevant lung disease diagnosis."

Alumni tracking is conducted to determine the length of time graduates require to obtain a job. Predictive models for graduates’ waiting time are essential in assessing the urgency of addressing this issue. This study compares several machine learning methods—Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), for this purpose. The dataset, comprising 500 records obtained from tracer studies (alumni tracking) and student records, underwent preprocessing, cleaning, and normalization. The attributes used in the classification included student ID (NIM), GPA, study duration, organizational involvement, competition achievements, competency certifications, scholarships, and waiting time. Waiting time was categorized into two groups: less than six months (considered \"good\") and more than six months (considered \"less good\"). Model performance was evaluated using confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results show that the KNN model achieved the best performance, with an accuracy of 0.8625 . This research can assist higher education institutions in predicting graduates’ waiting time for employment and in improving institutional quality. It can develop a predictive model of students’ waiting time to obtain employment and develop an evaluation framework for measuring the performance of waiting time in securing a job."

A key challenge stems from the inherent complexity of educational contexts: learners are human beings with various cognitive behaviors, and pedagogy is fundamentally centered on personalized human-to-human communication. To address this issue, this paper proposes AgentSME, a unified generative agent framework powered by LLM. Three directional communication modes are considered in the models, namely Solo, Mono, and Echo, reflecting different types of agency autonomy and communicative reciprocity. Accuracy is adopted as the primary evaluation metric, complemented by three diversity indices designed to assess the diversity of reasoning contents. Six widely used LLMs are tested to validate the robustness of communication modes across different model tiers, which are equally divided into base-capacity and high-capacity configurations. The results show that generative agents that employ the Echo communication mode achieve the highest accuracy scores, while DeepSeek exhibits the greatest diversity. This study provides valuable information to improve agent learning capabilities and inspire smart education models."

The proposed work randomly develops a set of MLP models with different combinations of hyper parameters. All these models are carefully evaluated and selected a best MLP model with the best hyper parameters. The performance of MLP model-3 is good and has a training precision of $84 \\%$ and a validation accuracy value of $86 \\%$. The training and testing accuracies of the sleeted model is also mapping with slit differences. This model detects electrical shunt faults and gives information to the protection system.

    "abstract": "Hierarchical clustering remains a fundamental challenge in data mining, particularly when dealing with real-world datasets. Here, traditional approaches fail to scale effectively when the datasets are large-scale and high-dimensional. Recent Chameleon clustering algorithms – Chameleon2, M-Chameleon, and INNGS-Chameleon – have proposed advanced strategies that try to address this challenge. However, they still suffer from O(n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>) computational complexity. We address this challenge here by introducing Approximate-Chameleon (Approx-Ch) that has O(n log n) complexity.Our algorithm has three parts. First, Graph Generation — here we use approximate k-NN search instead of an exact one, as used by earlier three algorithms. This results in fast nearest-neighbor computation, significantly reducing the graph generation time. Second, Graph Partitioning — here we use a multi-level partitioning approach as compared to a single-level one, mostly used by the prior three works. This change ensures that graph partitioning is robust to the errors introduced by approximate graph generation. This also facilitates minimal configuration requirements. Third, Merging — here we follow Chameleon2 by retaining its flood-fill heuristic and its merging criteria since it is the cheapest among the earlier three algorithms.On real-world benchmark datasets used in former three works, Approx-Ch delivers an average improvement of 5% in clustering quality and reduces total run-time by 86%. This demonstrates that algorithmic efficiency and clustering quality can co-exist in large-scale hierarchical clustering."

The EMS aims to minimize a multi-objective cost function encompassing BP current fluctuations, overall energy consumption, DTP-PMSM winding loading, and winding exploitation. To address this challenge caused by unknown future information, an adaptive low-pass filtering-based EMS is proposed to dynamically adjust its time constant based on the SM’s State-of-Energy. This strategy effectively allocates high-frequency power transients to the SM while the BP handles sustained loads. The design rationale focuses on mitigating operational trade-offs, particularly protecting the BP from excessive current fluctuations and ensuring robust SM operation even with uncertain future power demands. Comparative simulation results across various operational cycles demonstrate that the proposed EMS significantly reduces the overall cost function—achieving improvements of up to 21.53%—when benchmarked against a baseline EMS. This performance enhancement is attributed to smoother BP power profiles, more efficient SM utilization, and better overall energy management."

In this work, we present VIKOR-BFT, a leader election scheme that integrates a lightweight data-sanitization stage with the VIKOR multi-criteria ranking mechanism to improve resilience against Byzantine behaviour. To understand its practical behaviour, we developed a Python-based prototype and evaluated the protocol under a range of adversarial and high-load scenarios. The study indicates that VIKOR-BFT keeps latency growth moderate even as the network scales and sustains throughput values above 100 tx/s in networks of roughly 500 nodes. In comparison with PBFT and an optimized PBFT variant, the proposed method reduces message complexity by almost two orders of magnitude without compromising the correctness of leader selection. Under 15% and 25% Byzantine participation, the protocol continues to select an honest leader in more than 90% and 75% of the trials, respectively. Overall, the findings suggest that VIKOR-BFT provides a scalable and practically viable option for secure leader election in hybrid quantum-classical communication environments."

Therefore, this paper evaluates such feasibility from both technical and economic perspectives. This paper first elaborates on the dynamic response process of frequency after the power system is disturbed, points out the characteristics of shared energy storage and its advantages in participating in active power regulation, and constructs control models for shared energy storage to participate in inertial frequency response (IFR), primary frequency response (PFR), secondary frequency regulation (SFR), and peak regulation (PR) respectively. Furthermore, this paper analyzes the economic benefits of shared energy storage at different timescales. Through these researches, the paper demonstrates that shared energy storage possesses both the technical and economic feasibility to participate in active power regulation across the full timescales."

This method involves the reaction between glucose oxidase fixed on the cladding of the waveguide and glucose, which causes a local refractive index change, resulting in a shift in the WBG reflection center wavelength, enabling the quantitative detection of blood glucose concentration. Nevertheless, during measurement, optical blood glucose sensors are susceptible to spectral drifts caused by environmental temperature variations, leading to a decrease in sensing accuracy. To address this issue, a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) WBG sensor for glucose concentration measurement is proposed and implemented. Two types of WBG blood glucose sensors, namely, bilateral and slit sensors, are designed, incorporating an athermalization design to enhance system stability and environmental robustness. By employing a compensating material with a negative thermo-optic coefficient (TOC) and optimizing various waveguide structural parameters, temperature-induced drift is effectively suppressed, which enables the design of bilateral and slit WBG glucose sensors with both glucose sensing and temperature compensation capabilities. The experimental results show that the bilateral WBG glucose sensor exhibits a refractive index sensitivity of 161 nm/refractive index unit (RIU) and a temperature sensitivity of 7.27 pm/°C within a glucose concentration range of 0–2.6 mg/mL. The slit WBG glucose sensor has a refractive index sensitivity of 242.3 nm/RIU and a temperature sensitivity of 2.37 pm/°C within the 0–2.8 mg/mL glucose concentration range."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a Digital Twin (DT) framework for a single-stage, three-phase grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) inverter system, leveraging discrete-time state-space modelling in frequency domain for accurate dynamic representation under all switching conditions. The DT integrates a novel CSTOGI-NSB-CGI (Cascaded Second and Third-Order Generalized Integrator, Noise Suppression Block, Compact Generalized Integrator) filter for robust extraction of the fundamental grid voltage, even during voltage unbalance, distortion, and harmonic conditions. To maintain precise current regulation and consistent switching frequency, an Adaptive Hysteresis Band Current Controller (AHBCC) is implemented. For real-time tuning of inverter parameters, a Magnetic-Domain Alignment Electromagnetic Field Optimization (MDA-EFO) algorithm is introduced, offering fast convergence through dual-force interaction involving global best and peer alignment. MDA-EFO is deployed on an OPAL-RT HIL platform for real-time experiments; the algorithm is platform-agnostic and can also be implemented in MATLAB/Simulink or other real-time environments. The DT framework accurately estimates internal system parameters, such as inductances, resistances, and filter capacitances, without relying on external training data. Experimental validation using real-time hardware measurements confirms the DT’s high-fidelity performance, as supported by the Digital Twin Fidelity Score (DTFS) metric. The results demonstrate the DT’s capability for real-time monitoring, adaptive optimization, and predictive diagnostics in grid-connected PV applications."
