    "abstract": "Equational reasoning is central to quantum circuit optimisation and verification: one replaces subcircuits by provably equivalent ones using a fixed set of rewrite rules viewed as equations. We study such reasoning through finite equational theories, presenting restricted quantum gate fragments as symmetric monoidal categories (PROPs), where wire permutations are treated as structural and separated cleanly from fragment-specific gate axioms. For six widely used near-Clifford fragments: qubit Clifford, real Clifford, Clifford+T (up to two qubits), Clifford+CS (up to three qubits) and CNOT-dihedral, we transfer the completeness results of prior work into our PROP framework. Beyond completeness, we address minimality (axiom independence). Using uniform separating interpretations into simple semantic targets, we prove minimality for several fragments (including all arities for qubit Clifford, real Clifford, and CNOT-dihedral), and bounded minimality for the remaining cases. Overall, our presentations significantly reduce rule counts compared to prior work and provide a reusable categorical framework for constructing complete and often minimal rewrite systems for quantum circuit fragments."

    "abstract": "Building on recent advances in video generation, generative video compression has emerged as a new paradigm for achieving visually pleasing reconstructions. However, existing methods exhibit limited exploitation of temporal correlations, causing noticeable flicker and degraded temporal coherence at ultra-low bitrates. In this paper, we propose Free-GVC, a training-free generative video compression framework that reformulates video coding as latent trajectory compression guided by a video diffusion prior. Our method operates at the group-of-pictures (GOP) level, encoding video segments into a compact latent space and progressively compressing them along the diffusion trajectory. To ensure perceptually consistent reconstruction across GOPs, we introduce an Adaptive Quality Control module that dynamically constructs an online rate-perception surrogate model to predict the optimal diffusion step for each GOP. In addition, an Inter-GOP Alignment module establishes frame overlap and performs latent fusion between adjacent groups, thereby mitigating flicker and enhancing temporal coherence. Experiments show that Free-GVC achieves an average of 93.29% BD-Rate reduction in DISTS over the latest neural codec DCVC-RT, and a user study further confirms its superior perceptual quality and temporal coherence at ultra-low bitrates."

    "abstract": "Clustering heterogeneous relational data remains a central challenge in graph learning, particularly when interactions involve more than two types of entities. While differentiable modularity objectives such as DMoN have enabled end-to-end community detection on homogeneous and bipartite graphs, extending these approaches to higher-order relational structures remains non-trivial. In this work, we introduce a differentiable formulation of tripartite modularity for graphs composed of three node types connected through mediated interactions. Community structure is defined in terms of weighted co-paths across the tripartite graph, together with an exact factorized computation that avoids the explicit construction of dense third-order tensors. A structural normalization at pivot nodes is introduced to control extreme degree heterogeneity and ensure stable optimization. The resulting objective can be optimized jointly with a graph neural network in an end-to-end manner, while retaining linear complexity in the number of edges. We validate the proposed framework on large-scale urban cadastral data, where it exhibits robust convergence behavior and produces spatially coherent partitions. These results highlight differentiable tripartite modularity as a generic methodological building block for unsupervised clustering of heterogeneous graphs."

For a pair of points p, q, the disjointness gap G(p; q) measures the shortfall when we optimize length over pairs of disjoint paths from p to q versus optimizing over all pairs of paths. Any spatial marginal of G is simply the gap between the top two lines in an Airy line ensemble. In this paper, we show that when the start and end time are fixed, the disjointness gap fully encodes the set of exceptional geodesic networks. The correspondence uses simple features of the disjointness gap, e.g. zeroes, local minima. We give a similar correspondence relating semi-infinite geodesic networks to a Busemann gap function. The proofs are deterministic given a list of soft properties related to the coalescent geometry of the directed landscape."

As a virtual sandbox, the GUI World model empowers agents with human-like foresight by enabling action-conditioned prediction.

To this end, we propose Code2World, a vision-language coder that simulates the next visual state via renderable code generation. Specifically, to address the data scarcity problem, we construct AndroidCode by translating GUI trajectories into high-fidelity HTML and refining synthesized code through a visual-feedback revision mechanism, yielding a corpus of over 80K high-quality screen-action pairs. To adapt existing VLMs into code prediction, we first perform SFT as a cold start for format layout following, then further apply Render-Aware Reinforcement Learning which uses rendered outcome as the reward signal by enforcing visual semantic fidelity and action consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Code2World-8B achieves the top-performing next UI prediction, rivaling the competitive GPT-5 and Gemini-3-Pro-Image. Notably, Code2World significantly enhances downstream navigation success rates in a flexible manner, boosting Gemini-2.5-Flash by +9.5% on AndroidWorld navigation.

Note that a closed bounded star-shaped set in a locally convex space is convex if and only if alpha=1, and we extend a Brouwer's type fixed-point theorem on compact star-shaped sets in Banach spaces in a more concise manner to locally convex spaces, thereby this is a simplification and an improvement of the Tychonoff fixed-point theorem to compact star-shaped sets."

These results are obtained using a theoretical framework that we developed, which combines DFT single-particle states with screened configuration interaction, a quasi-2D dielectric screening model, and an efficient Coulomb-cutoff scheme that eliminates periodic-image interactions and enables accurate Coulomb and exchange integrals at low computational cost.

    "abstract": "Stochastic minimax optimization on Riemannian manifolds has recently attracted significant attention due to its broad range of applications, such as robust training of neural networks and robust maximum likelihood estimation. Existing optimization methods for these problems typically require selecting stepsizes based on prior knowledge of specific problem parameters, such as Lipschitz-type constants and (geodesic) strong concavity constants. Unfortunately, these parameters are often unknown in practice. To overcome this issue, we develop single-loop adaptive methods that automatically adjust stepsizes using cumulative Riemannian (stochastic) gradient norms. We first propose a deterministic single-loop Riemannian adaptive gradient descent ascent method and show that it attains an $ε$-stationary point within $O(ε^{-2})$ iterations. This deterministic method is of independent interest and lays the foundation for our subsequent stochastic method. In particular, we propose the Riemannian stochastic adaptive gradient descent ascent method, which finds an $ε$-stationary point in $O(ε^{-6})$ iterations. Under additional second-order smoothness, this iteration complexity is further improved to $O(ε^{-4})$, which even outperforms the corresponding complexity result in Euclidean space. Some numerical experiments on real-world applications are conducted, including the regularized robust maximum likelihood estimation problem, and the robust training of neural networks with orthonormal weights. The results are encouraging and demonstrate the effectiveness of adaptivity in practice."

In order to characterize the effect of mobility and Doppler shift in low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, we performed BER comparisons over four different NTN tapped-delay-line (TDL) models, TDL-A, TDL-B, TDL-C, and TDL-D, as specified in the 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) technical report TR 38.811. After channel equalization, a minimum mean squared error with successive detection (MMSE-SD) algorithm was used to enhance the BER performance. It was found that AFDM and OTFS consistently outperformed OCDM across all TDL models, while AFDM performed better than OTFS in TDL-B and TDL-C, in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. The complete simulation framework is made available as an open-source code for quick validation and further development."

We investigate whether reasoning generated by LLMs can be used to predict the correctness of a model's own predictions. We analyze 30,300 teacher utterances from classroom dialogue, each labeled by multiple state-of-the-art LLMs with an instructional move construct and an accompanying reasoning. Using human-verified ground-truth labels, we frame the task as predicting whether a model's assigned label for a given utterance is correct. We encode LLM reasoning using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and evaluate five supervised classifiers. A Random Forest classifier achieves an F1 score of 0.83 (Recall = 0.854), successfully identifying most incorrect predictions and outperforming baselines. Training specialist detectors for specific instructional move constructs further improves performance on difficult constructs, indicating that error detection benefits from construct-specific linguistic cues. Using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) framework, we examine four linguistic markers of correctness: Causation, Differentiation, Tentativeness, and Insight. Correct predictions exhibit grounded causal language (e.g., because, therefore), while incorrect reasoning is substantially more likely to rely on epistemic hedging (e.g., might, could) and performative metacognition (e.g., think, realize). Syntactic complexity does not distinguish correct from incorrect reasoning, and longer reasoning is not more reliable. These findings demonstrate that reasoning-based error detection offers a practical and scalable approach to quality control in automated educational dialogue analysis."

We calculate the precise maximal order types of this class of wqos as a function of the maximal order type of the labels $Q$. In the process, we sharpen some recent results of Friedman and Weiermann. Furthermore, we show a correspondence with indecomposable transfinite sequences with finite range, over elements of the wqo $Q$, of length less than $ω^ω$. Nash-Williams proved that arbitrary transfinite sequences with finite range are also well-quasi-ordered, but there are no known methods to extract bounds on the maximal order type from the proof. More concrete proofs for sequences of length less than $α$ for some $α< ω^ω$ were given by Erdős and Rado. Using the correspondence, we obtain precise bounds for the entire collection of transfinite sequences with finite range of length less than $ω^ω$."

Specifically, to internalize complex reasoning capabilities into a single efficient model, we first design a multi-agent teacher system capable of multi-turn tool usage and reflection. This teacher utilizes a Collaborative Signal Translation mechanism to explicitly convert latent behavioral patterns into descriptive natural language evidence to enhance reasoning accuracy. Subsequently, a trajectory-driven distillation pipeline transfers this agentic logic, including planning, tool usage, and self-reflection, into the compact STAR model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STAR surpasses its teacher by 8.7% to 39.5% while eliminating iterative latency, paving the way for real-time, reasoning-enhanced recommendation."

In particular, we predict that the cutoff wave number increases linearly with increasing ITG for sufficiently large values of the ITG. Direct numerical solutions of the gyrokinetic dispersion relation using a purpose-built solver confirm the predicted scalings at large ITG values and find a weaker power-law scaling for intermediate ITG values. Combining these wave number scalings with a simple diffusive estimate for turbulent fluxes produces a scaling prediction for the ITG heat flux in SWITG-driven turbulence. Applying the critical balance conjecture additionally provides scalings for the aspect ratio of the SWITG turbulent eddies."

However, current graph-based SI methods rely on pre-trained models, lack adaptation to larger and unseen graphs at test-time, and overlook test data utilization. To address these issues, we propose PlugSI, a plug-and-play framework that refines test-time graph through two key innovations. First, we design an Unknown Topology Adapter (UTA) that adapts to the new graph structure of each small-batch at test-time, enhancing the generalization of SI pre-trained models. Second, we introduce a Temporal Balance Adapter (TBA) that maintains a stable historical consensus to guide UTA adaptation and prevent drifting caused by noise in the current batch. Empirically, extensive experiments demonstrate PlugSI can be seamlessly integrated into existing graph-based SI methods and provide significant improvement (e.g., a 10.81% reduction in MAE)."

Existing research mainly focuses on model improvements and sentence-level pruning, but often overlooks global structure, leading to disrupted coherence and weakened downstream performance. Some studies employ large language models (LLMs), which achieve higher accuracy but incur substantial resource and time costs. To address these issues, we introduce GloSA-sum, the first summarization approach that achieves global structure awareness via topological data analysis (TDA). GloSA-sum summarizes text efficiently while preserving semantic cores and logical dependencies. Specifically, we construct a semantic-weighted graph from sentence embeddings, where persistent homology identifies core semantics and logical structures, preserved in a ``protection pool'' as the backbone for summarization. We design a topology-guided iterative strategy, where lightweight proxy metrics approximate sentence importance to avoid repeated high-cost computations, thus preserving structural integrity while improving efficiency. To further enhance long-text processing, we propose a hierarchical strategy that integrates segment-level and global summarization. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that GloSA-sum reduces redundancy while preserving semantic and logical integrity, striking a balance between accuracy and efficiency, and further benefits LLM downstream tasks by shortening contexts while retaining essential reasoning chains."

Hence, to improve the reliability of coronal density measurements, it is highly desirable to explore other complementary methods. In this study, we estimate the coronal electron densities in the middle corona, between approximately $1.7-3.5R_\\odot$, using low-frequency radio observations from the recently commissioned Long Wavelength Array at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO-LWA). The results demonstrate consistency with those derived from white-light coronagraph data and predictions from theoretical models.

To address this challenge, we introduce a hierarchical Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework for environment design. Our framework features a teacher agent that leverages student policy representations derived from discovered evaluation environments, enabling it to generate training environments based on the student's capabilities. To improve efficiency, we incorporate a generative model that augments the teacher's training dataset with synthetic data, reducing the need for teacher-student interactions. In experiments across several domains, we show that our method outperforms baseline approaches while requiring fewer teacher-student interactions in a single episode.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a critical method for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, continuous training often leads to policy entropy collapse, characterized by a rapid decay in entropy that results in premature overconfidence, reduced output diversity, and vanishing gradient norms that inhibit learning. Gradient-Preserving Clipping is a primary factor influencing these dynamics, but existing mitigation strategies are largely static and lack a framework connecting clipping mechanisms to precise entropy control. This paper proposes reshaping entropy control in RL from the perspective of Gradient-Preserving Clipping. We first theoretically and empirically verify the contributions of specific importance sampling ratio regions to entropy growth and reduction. Leveraging these findings, we introduce a novel regulation mechanism using dynamic clipping threshold to precisely manage entropy. Furthermore, we design and evaluate dynamic entropy control strategies, including increase-then-decrease, decrease-increase-decrease, and oscillatory decay. Experimental results demonstrate that these strategies effectively mitigate entropy collapse, and achieve superior performance across multiple benchmarks."

    "abstract": "The existence of Galactic optical cirrus poses a challenge for observing faint objects within our Galaxy and dim extragalactic structures. To investigate individual cirrus filaments in the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program public data release 3 (HSC-SSP DR3) we use a technique based on convolutional neural networks and ensemble learning. This approach allows us to distinguish cirrus filaments from foreground and background objects across the entire HSC-SSP, using optical images in the $g$, $r$, and $i$ wavebands. A comparison with previous work using deep Sloan Digital Sky Survey Stripe~82 (SDSS Stripe~82) data reveals that the cirrus clouds identified in this study are highly consistent in location within the overlapping survey region. However, in the deeper HSC-SSP dataset, we were able to detect $4.5$ times more cirrus clouds. Our study indicates that the sky background in HSC-SSP coadd images is over-subtracted, as evidenced by the surface brightness distribution in cirrus filaments and surrounding regions. Objects with surface brightness of $m = 29~\\mbox{mag~arcsec}^{-2}$ near large filaments can be dimmed by over-subtraction of $0.5$ magnitude in the $r$ band. This suggests that cirrus clouds should be taken into account in algorithms for estimating the sky background. For practical use, we provide a catalog of filaments and a framework that allows one to train neural network models for segmenting cirri in HSC-SSP coadd images."

If the thickness of the nematic layer exceeds this threshold, there is a global-in-time suitable weak solution converging exponentially to a nontrivial equilibrium state as time tends to infinity. If the thickness is no more than the threshold, the global-in-time suitable weak solution has a trivial long-time asymptotic limit. Our results rigorously justify the P-HAN transition discussed in the physics literature."

    "abstract": "Most self-supervised learning (SSL) methods learn continuous visual representations by aligning different views of the same input, offering limited control over how information is structured across representation dimensions. In this work, we frame visual self-supervised learning as a discrete communication process between a teacher and a student network, where semantic information is transmitted through a fixed-capacity binary channel. Rather than aligning continuous features, the student predicts multi-label binary messages produced by the teacher. Discrete agreement is enforced through an element-wise binary cross-entropy objective, while a coding-rate regularization term encourages effective utilization of the constrained channel, promoting structured representations. We further show that periodically reinitializing the projection head strengthens this effect by encouraging embeddings that remain predictive across multiple discrete encodings. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent improvements over continuous agreement baselines on image classification, retrieval, and dense visual prediction tasks, as well as under domain shift through self-supervised adaptation. Beyond backbone representations, we analyze the learned binary codes and show that they form a compact and informative discrete language, capturing semantic factors reusable across classes."

    "source": "arXiv",
    "abstract": "In this paper, the wave-particle turbulent simulation (WPTS), a recently developed multiscale, non-equilibrium turbulence modeling approach, is coupled with a turbulence characteristic-time closure derived from Prandtl mixing-length hypothesis and applied to spatially developing round jets. In WPTS, fluid elements in strongly turbulent regions are represented by Lagrangian particles that travel a finite distance before interacting with the background flow field represented in a wave-like (Eulerian) form. This mechanism bears conceptual similarity to the discrete fluid parcels invoked in the Prandtl mixing-length picture. WPTS differs from conventional mixing-length-based turbulence models in two key respects. First, particle evolution follows a non-equilibrium transport mechanism, rather than the equilibrium assumptions typically embedded in eddy-viscosity closures. Second, WPTS advances the wave and particle components in a coupled manner, with the particle fraction governed primarily by the modeled turbulence characteristic time, enabling laminar and turbulent regimes to be represented within a unified framework. Because spatially developing jets provide a canonical test case with well-established similarity behavior, they are used here for evaluation. Specifically, this work (1) develops a mixing-length-based characteristic-time model tailored to jet flows and (2) incorporates it into WPTS to assess predictive performance. The resulting WPTS framework accurately reproduces the jet similarity solution and other characteristic features at Reynolds numbers of 5,000 and 20,000, demonstrating the promise of WPTS as a practical tool for turbulence modeling and simulation."

Hierarchies of rational solutions of the discrete equations are derived in terms of the generalised Laguerre and generalised Umemura polynomials.

    "abstract": "The Weyl exceptional nodal lines usually occur in 3D topological semimetals, but also emerge in the parameter space of 1D systems. In this work, we study the impact of dissipation on the nodal ring in a 3D topological semimetal. We find that the energy spectrum becomes fully complex in the presence of dissipation, and the original nodal ring is split into two exceptional rings. We introduce a vortex field in the momentum space, which is generated from the spectrum, to characterize the topology of the exceptional rings. This provides a clear physical picture of the topological structure. The two exceptional rings act as two vortex filaments of a free vortex flow with opposite circulations. In this context, the 3D topological semimetal is the boundary separating two quantum phases identified by two configurations of exceptional rings. We also propose a 1D model that has the same topological feature in the parameter space. It provides a simple way to measure the topological invariant in a low-dimensional system. Numerical simulations indicate that the topological invariant is robust under the random perturbations of the system parameters."

    "abstract": "We investigate the fracture behavior of pre-cracked triangular beam-lattices whose elements have failure stresses drawn from a Weibull distribution. Through a statistical analysis and numerical simulations, we identify and verify the existence of three distinct failure regimes: (i) disorder is effectively suppressed, (ii) disorder manifests locally near the crack tip, modifying the crack morphology, and (iii) disorder manifests globally, leading to initially diffuse failure. Our model naturally reveals the key parameters governing this behavior: the Weibull modulus, quantifying the spread in failure thresholds, and a geometric quantity termed the Slenderness Ratio. We also reproduce the disorder-induced toughening reported in previous experimental and numerical studies, further demonstrating that its manifestation depends non-monotonically on disorder. Crucially, our results indicate that this toughening cannot be simply connected to the amount of damage in the lattice, challenging interpretations that attribute increased fracture energy solely to enhanced crack tortuosity or diffuse failure. Overall, our results establish geometry as a powerful control parameter for regulating how disorder is expressed during fracture in beam-lattices, with broader implications for the disorder-induced toughening in engineered materials."

In particular, automated detection of craquelure in digitized paintings is crucial for assessing degradation and guiding restoration, yet remains challenging due to the possibly complex scenery and the visual similarity between cracks and crack-like artistic features such as brush strokes or hair. We propose a hybrid approach that models crack detection as an inverse problem, decomposing an observed image into a crack-free painting and a crack component. A deep generative model is employed as powerful prior for the underlying artwork, while crack structures are captured using a Mumford--Shah-type variational functional together with a crack prior. Joint optimization yields a pixel-level map of crack localizations in the painting."

    "abstract": "High-order moving-mesh methods can effectively reduce numerical diffusion, but their formal accuracy typically relies on the regularity of the mesh velocity. This dependency creates a fundamental conflict in the numerical solution of hyperbolic conservation laws, where solution-driven adaptation may induce nonsmooth mesh motion, thereby degrading convergence order. We introduce \\emph{transport polynomial exactness} (TPE($k$)), a mesh-motion-independent criterion that generalizes classical free-stream preservation (TPE(0)) to the exact advection of degree-$k$ polynomials. We show that the classical geometric conservation law (GCL) is insufficient to ensure TPE($k$) for $k \\ge 1$ due to mismatches in higher-order geometric moments. To resolve this, we propose \\emph{evolved geometric moments} (EGMs), obtained by solving auxiliary transport equations discretized compatibly with the physical variables. We rigorously prove that second-degree EGMs evolved via the third-order strong stability preserving Runge--Kutta (SSPRK3) method coincide with the exact geometric moments. This exactness arises from a \\emph{superconvergence} mechanism wherein SSPRK3 reduces to Simpson's rule for EGM evolution. Leveraging this result, we construct a third-order conservative finite-volume rezoning moving-mesh scheme. The scheme satisfies the TPE(2) property for \\emph{arbitrary mesh motion} and \\emph{any pseudo-time step size}, thereby naturally accommodating spatiotemporally discontinuous mesh velocity. Crucially, this \\emph{breaks the efficiency bottleneck} in the conventional advection-based remapping step and reduces the required pseudo-time levels from $\\mathcal{O}(h^{-1})$ to $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ under bounded but discontinuous mesh velocity. Numerical experiments verify exact quadratic transport and stable third-order convergence under extreme mesh deformation, demonstrating substantial efficiency gains."

    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning has been able to solve various tasks successfully, however, due to the construction of policy gradient and training dynamics, tuning deep reinforcement learning models remains challenging. As one of the most successful deep reinforcement-learning algorithm, the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm (PPO) clips the policy gradient within a conservative on-policy updates, which ensures reliable and stable policy improvement. However, this training pattern may sacrifice sample efficiency. On the other hand, off-policy methods make more adequate use of data through sample reuse, though at the cost of increased the estimation variance and bias. To leverage the advantages of both, in this paper, we propose a new PPO variant based on the stability guarantee from conservative on-policy iteration with a more efficient off-policy data utilization. Specifically, we first derive an extended off-policy improvement from an expectation form of generalized policy improvement lower bound. Then, we extend the clipping mechanism with segmented exponential functions for a suitable surrogate objective function. Third, the trajectories generated by the past $M$ policies are organized in the replay buffer for off-policy training. We refer to this method as Extended Off-policy Proximal Policy Optimization (ExO-PPO). Compared with PPO and some other state-of-the-art variants, we demonstrate an improved performance of ExO-PPO with balanced sample efficiency and stability on varied tasks in the empirical experiments."

Aggregated from 12 online biblical libraries and one preexisting corpus, each translation is manually annotated with metadata that maps the text to a standardized identifier for the work, its specific edition, and its year of revision. This canonicalization empowers researchers to define \"uniqueness\" for their own needs: they can perform micro-level analyses on translation families, such as the KJV lineage, or conduct macro-level studies by deduplicating closely related texts.

In this paper, we present the first systematic benchmark of lightweight SNNs obtained by converting compact CNN architectures into spiking networks, where activations are modeled with Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons and trained using surrogate gradient descent under a unified setup. We construct spiking variants of ShuffleNet, SqueezeNet, MnasNet, and MixNet, and evaluate them on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet, measuring accuracy, F1-score, parameter count, computational complexity, and energy consumption. Our results show that SNNs can achieve up to 15.7x higher energy efficiency than their CNN counterparts while retaining competitive accuracy. Among these, the SNN variant of SqueezeNet consistently outperforms other lightweight SNNs. To further optimize this model, we apply a structured pruning strategy that removes entire redundant modules, yielding a pruned architecture, SNN-SqueezeNet-P. This pruned model improves CIFAR-10 accuracy by 6% and reduces parameters by 19% compared to the original SNN-SqueezeNet. Crucially, it narrows the gap with CNN-SqueezeNet, achieving nearly the same accuracy (only 1% lower) but with an 88.1% reduction in energy consumption due to sparse spike-driven computations. Together, these findings establish lightweight SNNs as practical, low-power alternatives for edge deployment, highlighting a viable path toward deploying high-performance, low-power intelligence on the edge."

    "abstract": "Sustaining long-term interactions remains a bottleneck for Large Language Models (LLMs), as their limited context windows struggle to manage dialogue histories that extend over time. Existing memory systems often treat interactions as disjointed snippets, failing to capture the underlying narrative coherence of the dialogue stream. We propose TraceMem, a cognitively-inspired framework that weaves structured, narrative memory schemata from user conversational traces through a three-stage pipeline: (1) Short-term Memory Processing, which employs a deductive topic segmentation approach to demarcate episode boundaries and extract semantic representation; (2) Synaptic Memory Consolidation, a process that summarizes episodes into episodic memories before distilling them alongside semantics into user-specific traces; and (3) Systems Memory Consolidation, which utilizes two-stage hierarchical clustering to organize these traces into coherent, time-evolving narrative threads under unifying themes. These threads are encapsulated into structured user memory cards, forming narrative memory schemata. For memory utilization, we provide an agentic search mechanism to enhance reasoning process. Evaluation on the LoCoMo benchmark shows that TraceMem achieves state-of-the-art performance with a brain-inspired architecture. Analysis shows that by constructing coherent narratives, it surpasses baselines in multi-hop and temporal reasoning, underscoring its essential role in deep narrative comprehension. Additionally, we provide an open discussion on memory systems, offering our perspectives and future outlook on the field.

    "abstract": "Compared to theoretical frameworks that assume equal sensitivity to deviations in all features of data, the theory of anomaly detection allowing for variable sensitivity across features is less developed. To the best of our knowledge, this issue has not yet been addressed in the context of isolation-based methods, and this paper represents the first attempt to do so. This paper introduces an Extended Isolation Forest with feature sensitivities, which we refer to as the Anisotropic Isolation Forest (AIF). In contrast to the standard EIF, the AIF enables anomaly detection with controllable sensitivity to deviations in different features or directions in the feature space. The paper also introduces novel measures of directional sensitivity, which allow quantification of AIF's sensitivity in different directions in the feature space. These measures enable adjustment of the AIF's sensitivity to task-specific requirements. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithm by applying it to synthetic and real-world datasets. The results show that the AIF enables anomaly detection that focuses on directions in the feature space where deviations from typical behavior are more important."

Here I assess the role of young massive clusters (YMC) evolving into old open clusters (OC) -- the YMC/OC channel -- to the GW merger population. A homogeneous grid of 90 N-body evolutionary model star clusters, spanning initial masses of $10^4M_\\odot\\leq M_{cl}(0)\\leq10^5M_\\odot$, half-mass radii of 1-3 pc, and metallicities between 0.0002-0.02 is computed with the direct, post-Newtonian N-body code NBODY7. The N-body simulations include primordial binaries, delayed stellar-remnant model forming black holes (BH) and neutron stars (NS), BH spin prescriptions, and GW recoil kicks, and they are evolved until BH depletion. Most GW mergers from the cluster models are dynamically assembled binary black holes (BBH) that merge within their host clusters. Merger mass ratios reach down to 0.1-0.2 despite an overall bias toward nearly symmetric pairs. The GW merger efficiency varies non-monotonically with cluster mass, peaking around $M_{cl}(0)=7.5\\times10^4M_\\odot$ and also for $M_{cl}(0)\\leq3.0\\times10^4M_\\odot$. The computed mergers reproduce some of the key features of the latest observed GW event catalogue, including asymmetric low-mass mergers, misaligned events among highly spinning, massive BHs, and an excess of $30M_\\odot$ primaries, though they under-produce $10M_\\odot$ primaries, hinting at contributions from other channels. The model merger rate density accounts for 25%-33% of the observed rate; it increases with redshift somewhat faster than the cosmic star formation, consistently with LVK's inferences. The model effective spin distribution is positively asymmetric at zero redshift and broadens with redshift. The models yield field BH- and NS-main sequence star binaries with parameters consistent with the Gaia-discovered candidates. [Abgd.]"

Here, we investigate the photovoltaic potential of bulk-stacked GeSe$_{2}$ chains using first-principles calculations within the $GW0$ approximation and the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) to capture quasiparticle and excitonic effects. The bulk GeSe$_{2}$ exhibits indirect GW band gaps of 1.92 eV (type-I) and 1.08 eV (type-II). Optical calculations show markedly stronger visible-light absorption in type-II, yielding a spectroscopically limited maximum efficiency (SLME) of ~25.6% at a 0.5 $μ$m thickness. Phonon and room-temperature ab initio molecular dynamics analyses indicate that type-II is dynamically stable, whereas type-I shows imaginary phonon modes, suggesting a propensity for structural distortion. These results identify type-II GeSe2 as a promising stable absorber for thin-film photovoltaics with enhanced flexibility compared to typical 2D vdW systems."

    "abstract": "In today's connected world, the generation of massive streaming data across diverse domains has become commonplace. In the presence of concept drift, class imbalance, label scarcity, and new class emergence, they jointly degrade representation stability, bias learning toward outdated distributions, and reduce the resilience and reliability of detection in dynamic environments. This paper proposes SCIL (Streaming Class-Incremental Learning) to address these challenges. The SCIL framework integrates an autoencoder (AE) with a multi-layer perceptron for multi-class prediction, uses a dual-loss strategy (classification and reconstruction) for prediction and new class detection, employs corrected pseudo-labels for online training, manages classes with queues, and applies oversampling to handle imbalance. The rationale behind the method's structure is elucidated through ablation studies and a comprehensive experimental evaluation is performed using both real-world and synthetic datasets that feature class imbalance, incremental classes, and concept drifts. Our results demonstrate that SCIL outperforms strong baselines and state-of-the-art methods. Based on our commitment to Open Science, we make our code and datasets available to the community."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer unique opportunities for scientific tasks, yet their ability to reason over complex numerical data remains largely unexplored. We propose a simple mechanism to introduce domain-specific physical knowledge into LLMs by fusing pre-trained latent physical features with a pre-trained language model. Our method employs a teacher-student knowledge distillation framework where a large LLM (teacher) generates synthetic question-answer supervision to transfer physical reasoning to a smaller LLM (student). The student is conditioned on latent physical features and trained via a lightweight adapter and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). We demonstrate that this approach, applied to models with 1B, 8B, and 32B parameters, enables effective reasoning over real scientific data. Our models substantially outperform strong baselines, such as Gemini 3 Pro, across multiple downstream tasks without task-specific fine-tuning. We show that the model combines latent information with general physical understanding to predict complex properties and can be \"steered\" by identifying physically meaningful directions in the latent space. This allows for explicit physical manipulation and natural language interpretation of latent structures. While our experiments focus on astrophysics, the framework is domain-agnostic and applicable to various scientific fields. Our main contribution is a general framework for using LLMs as interpretable interfaces to scientific latent spaces, enabling a single model to perform diverse tasks through natural language guidance. This work marks a step toward developing scientifically capable and useful LLMs."

    "abstract": "The transition toward low-inertia power systems demands modeling frameworks that provide not only accurate state predictions but also physically consistent sensitivities for control. While scientific machine learning offers powerful nonlinear modeling tools, the control-oriented implications of different differentiable paradigms remain insufficiently understood. This paper presents a comparative study of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs), and Differentiable Programming (DP) for modeling, identification, and control of power system dynamics. Using the Single Machine Infinite Bus (SMIB) system as a benchmark, we evaluate their performance in trajectory extrapolation, parameter estimation, and Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) synthesis. Our results highlight a fundamental trade-off between data-driven flexibility and physical structure. NODE exhibits superior extrapolation by capturing the underlying vector field, whereas PINN shows limited generalization due to its reliance on a time-dependent solution map. In the inverse problem of parameter identification, while both DP and PINN successfully recover the unknown parameters, DP achieves significantly faster convergence by enforcing governing equations as hard constraints. Most importantly, for control synthesis, the DP framework yields closed-loop stability comparable to the theoretical optimum. Furthermore, we demonstrate that NODE serves as a viable data-driven surrogate when governing equations are unavailable."

Analytically, we show that a burst becomes probabilistically rare after a long time.

These predictions can be tested with programmable quantum simulators."

The presence of HCOOH suggests that oxygen-bearing molecules may be directly involved in the chemical and physical evolution of star formation regions, particularly in hot molecular cores. This paper presents the first detection of the rotational emission lines of the $trans$-conformer of HCOOH toward the hot molecular core G358.93$-$0.03 MM1, located in the massive star formation region G358.93$-$0.03. This study employed high-resolution observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Band 7. The column density and excitation temperature of $t$-HCOOH are determined as $(8.13\\pm0.72)\\times10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $120\\pm15$ K, respectively. The fractional abundance of $t$-HCOOH relative to H$_{2}$ is $(2.62\\pm 0.29)\\times 10^{-9}$. The column density ratios of $t$-HCOOH/CH$_{3}$OH and $t$-HCOOH/H$_{2}$CO are $(1.56 \\pm 0.12)\\times 10^{-2}$ and $(1.16 \\pm 0.12)$, respectively. We computed a three-phase warm-up chemical model of HCOOH using the gas-grain chemical code UCLCHEM. We found that the observed and modelled abundances of HCOOH are almost identical, within a factor of 0.89. Based on chemical modelling, we showed that HCOOH may be formed through the reaction between HCO and OH on the grain surface, which is further released in the gas-phase."

First, we introduce HealthRubrics, a dataset of 7,034 physician-verified preference examples in which clinicians refine LLM-drafted rubrics to meet rigorous medical standards. Second, we distill these rubrics into HealthPrinciples: 119 broadly reusable, clinically grounded principles organized by clinical dimensions, enabling scalable supervision beyond manual annotation. We use HealthPrinciples for (1) offline alignment by synthesizing rubrics for unlabeled queries and (2) an inference-time tool for guided self-revision. A 30B parameter model that activates only 3B parameters at inference trained with our framework achieves 33.4% on HealthBench-Hard, outperforming much larger models including Deepseek-R1 and o3, establishing a resource-efficient baseline for clinical alignment."

We propose Time2General, a DGVSS framework built on Stability Queries. Time2General introduces a Spatio-Temporal Memory Decoder that aggregates multi-frame context into a clip-level spatio-temporal memory and decodes temporally consistent per-frame masks without explicit correspondence propagation. To further suppress flicker and improve robustness to varying sampling rates, the Masked Temporal Consistency Loss is proposed to regularize temporal prediction discrepancies across different strides, and randomize training strides to expose the model to diverse temporal gaps. Extensive experiments on multiple driving benchmarks show that Time2General achieves a substantial improvement in cross-domain accuracy and temporal stability over prior DGSS and VSS baselines while running at up to 18 FPS.

Although recent experiments have demonstrated dark cavity effects for electronic material phases, like superconductivity, ferroelectricity and charge density waves, a smoking gun experiment for magnetic systems is lacking. Largely, this comes from the focus on phase transitions, where a large critical light-matter coupling is needed to observe cavity modifications. Here, we propose spiral magnets, where even a small cavity-mediated change in magnetic interactions is reflected in a change of the spiral wavelength, as a promising platform to observe cavity effects. We focus on the single-layer multiferroic NiI$_2$, interacting with electric field fluctuations from surface phonon polaritons of the paraelectric substrate SrTiO$_3$. With decreasing substrate-material distance, the ratio of nearest and third nearest neighbor exchange interactions reduces, leading to an increase of the spiral wavelength and an eventual transition into a ferromagnetic state. Our work identifies a realistic platform to observe cavity vacuum renormalization effects in magnetic systems."

A high-order nodal discontinuous Galerkin method is employed to solve the governing equations on the generated mesh. Three different inflow profiles are evaluated to represent the nozzle-exit conditions, namely, inviscid, steady viscous, and unsteady viscous profiles. Velocity and shear stress tensor component profiles obtained from the simulations are compared with experimental data. Among the investigated profiles, the steady viscous inflow shows the most significant deviation from the inviscid case, particularly in the near-field region of the jet inlet. The steady viscous profile also leads to reduced peak velocity fluctuations, showing better agreement with experimental results. Further downstream, the influence of the inflow condition diminishes, with all three profiles converging toward the experimental reference. In addition, power spectral density analyses of streamwise velocity fluctuations reveal that the inflow conditions have little effect on spectral distributions, with numerical results showing consistent agreement with experimental data within the accessible Strouhal range. Beyond these findings, the study provides a highly detailed, high-fidelity database of supersonic jet flow simulations, encompassing six large-eddy computations with different meshes, polynomial refinements, and inflow conditions. The database includes high-frequency data in relevant regions of the jet flow field and is openly available in the Zenodo repository, ensuring accessibility and reusability for the scientific community."

Conventional FS methods such as Extra Trees, Variance Threshold, Tree-based models, Chi-Squared tests, ANOVA, Random Selection, and Sequential Attention rely primarily on statistical heuristics or model-driven importance scores, often overlooking the semantic context of features. Motivated by recent progress in LLM-driven FS, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can guide feature selection in a zero-shot setting, using only feature names and task descriptions, as a viable alternative to traditional approaches. We evaluate multiple LLMs (GPT-5.0, GPT-4.0, Gemini-2.5 etc.) on the EMBOD dataset (a fusion of EMBER and BODMAS benchmark datasets), comparing them against established FS methods across several classifiers, including Random Forest, Extra Trees, MLP, and KNN. Performance is assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, F1, AUC, MCC, and runtime. Our results demonstrate that LLM-guided zero-shot feature selection achieves competitive performance with traditional FS methods while offering additional advantages in interpretability, stability, and reduced dependence on labeled data. These findings position zero-shot LLM-based FS as a promising alternative strategy for effective and interpretable malware detection, paving the way for knowledge-guided feature selection in security-critical applications"

    "abstract": "Semi-supervised learning relaxes the need of large pixel-wise labeled datasets for image segmentation by leveraging unlabeled data. The scarcity of high-quality labeled data remains a major challenge in medical image analysis due to the high annotation costs and the need for specialized clinical expertise. Semi-supervised learning has demonstrated significant potential in addressing this bottleneck, with pseudo-labeling and consistency regularization emerging as two predominant paradigms. Dual-task collaborative learning, an emerging consistency-aware paradigm, seeks to derive supplementary supervision by establishing prediction consistency between related tasks. However, current methodologies are limited to unidirectional interaction mechanisms (typically regression-to-segmentation), as segmentation results can only be transformed into regression outputs in an offline manner, thereby failing to fully exploit the potential benefits of online bidirectional cross-task collaboration. Thus, we propose a fully Differentiable Bidirectional Synergistic Learning (DBiSL) framework, which seamlessly integrates and enhances four critical SSL components: supervised learning, consistency regularization, pseudo-supervised learning, and uncertainty estimation. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate our method's state-of-the-art performance. Beyond technical contributions, this work provides new insights into unified SSL framework design and establishes a new architectural foundation for dual-task-driven SSL, while offering a generic multitask learning framework applicable to broader computer vision applications. The code will be released on github upon acceptance."

T Pyx is a primary progenitor candidate for Type Ia supernovae (SNIa).

The operators are defined by the quadratic form method and are described by continuity across each shell together with the usual jump condition for the radial derivative. Using a boundary integral approach based on the free Green kernel and single--layer potentials, we derive an explicit resolvent representation for an arbitrary number of shells with bounded coupling strengths. This yields a concrete Kreĭn--type formula and a boundary operator whose noninvertibility characterizes the discrete spectrum, and it is compatible with a partial--wave reduction under rotational symmetry. We then specialize to the two--shell case with constant couplings and obtain a detailed description of the negative spectrum. In particular, we show that the ground state (when it exists) lies in the $s$--wave sector and derive an explicit secular equation for bound states. For large shell separation, each bound level approaches the corresponding single--shell level with exponentially small corrections, while a genuine tunneling splitting appears when the single--shell levels are tuned to coincide. As a simple calibration, we relate the two--shell parameters to representative core--shell quantum dot scales. At the level of order--of--magnitude and qualitative trends, Type~I configurations yield a relatively strongly confined state, whereas Type~II configurations produce a comparatively shallow outer--shell state."

    "abstract": "We propose LaPha, a method for training AlphaZero-like LLM agents in a Poincaré latent space. Under LaPha, the search process can be visualized as a tree rooted at the prompt and growing outward from the origin toward the boundary of the Poincaré ball, where negative curvature provides exponentially increasing capacity with radius. Using hyperbolic geodesic distance to rule-verified correctness, we define a node potential and assign dense process rewards by potential differences. We further attach a lightweight value head on the same shared latent space, enabling self-guided test-time scaling with almost no additional overhead. On MATH-500, LaPha improves Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B from 66.0% to 88.2%. With value-head-guided search, LaPha-1.5B reaches 56.7% accuracy on AIME'24, and LaPha-7B further achieves 60.0% on AIME'24 and 53.3% on AIME'25."

    "abstract": "In our previous paper with Tudor Pădurariu, we introduced the notion of limit categories for moduli stacks of Higgs bundles and formulated the Dolbeault geometric Langlands correspondence. These limit categories are expected to provide an effective ``classical limit'' of the categories of D-modules on the moduli stack of bundles, and our formulation links categorical Donaldson-Thomas theory with the geometric Langlands correspondence. In this paper, we prove the above Dolbeault geometric Langlands correspondence for $\\GL_2$ over the locus in the Hitchin base where the spectral curves are reduced. This is the first non-trivial case in which the relevant moduli stacks are not quasi-compact, and the use of limit categories is essential to the formulation and proof of the correspondence. Our approach also outlines a strategy for proving the correspondence in greater generality and explains the current obstructions to such an extension."

    "abstract": "We study coalition formation for data sharing under differential privacy when agents have heterogeneous privacy costs. Each agent holds a sensitive data point and decides whether to participate in a data-sharing coalition and how much noise to add to their data. Privacy choices induce a fundamental trade-off: higher privacy reduces individual data-sharing costs but degrades data utility and statistical accuracy for the coalition. These choices generate externalities across agents, making both participation and privacy levels strategic. Our goal is to understand which coalitions are stable, how privacy choices shape equilibrium outcomes, and how decentralized data sharing compares to a centralized, socially optimal benchmark. We provide a comprehensive equilibrium analysis across a broad range of privacy-cost regimes, from decreasing costs (e.g., privacy amplification from pooling data) to increasing costs (e.g., greater exposure to privacy attacks in larger coalitions). We first characterize Nash equilibrium coalitions with endogenous privacy levels and show that equilibria may fail to exist and can be non-monotonic in problem parameters. We also introduce a weaker equilibrium notion called robust equilibrium (that allows more widespread equilibrium existence by equipping existing players in the coalition with the power to prevent or veto external players from joining) and fully characterize such equilibria. Finally, we analyze, for both Nash and robust equilibria, the efficiency relative to the social optimum in terms of social welfare and estimator accuracy. We derive bounds that depend sharply on the number of players, properties of the cost profile and how privacy costs scale with coalition size."

    "abstract": "We study two central qubits interacting with a transverse-field Ising chain that serves as their environment. The environment is driven linearly in time across its quantum critical points (QCPs) and, during the evolution, is subjected to quantum reset (QR), where it is returned at random times to its initial state. We investigate how such QR of the environmental spin chain modifies the dynamics of entanglement and quantum discord between the qubits. Our results show that in the strong-coupling regime, entanglement and discord exhibit pronounced revivals within the interval bounded by the Ising QCPs, but these revivals diminish as the QR rate increases. In contrast, weak coupling leads to a monotonic reduction of quantum correlations. Numerically, we find that the revival peaks of concurrence decay and scale exponentially with the QR rate, while quantum discord shows no clear scaling behavior. In the weak-coupling regime without QR, the correlations decay monotonically as the driven field crosses the second QCP. When QR is applied, however, both entanglement and discord undergo oscillatory suppression, with the oscillation period increasing as either the QR rate or the ramp time scale is reduced."

Treating LLMs as virtual informants, we probe their dialectal knowledge using two survey-style question formats: Yes-No questions and multiple-choice questions. To this end, we exploited a large-scale, expert-curated database of Spanish lexical variation. Our evaluation covers more than 900 lexical items across 21 Spanish-speaking countries and is conducted at both the country and dialectal area levels. Across both evaluation formats, the results reveal systematic differences in how LLMs represent Spanish language varieties. Lexical variation associated with Spain, Equatorial Guinea, Mexico & Central America, and the La Plata River is recognized more accurately by the models, while the Chilean variety proves particularly difficult for the models to distinguish. Importantly, differences in the volume of country-level digital resources do not account for these performance patterns, suggesting that factors beyond data quantity shape dialectal representation in LLMs. By providing a fine-grained, large-scale evaluation of geographic lexical variation, this work advances empirical understanding of dialectal knowledge in LLMs and contributes new evidence to discussions of Digital Linguistic Bias in Spanish."

    "abstract": "AI agents are increasingly deployed in multi-tenant cloud environments, where they execute diverse tool calls within sandboxed containers, each call with distinct resource demands and rapid fluctuations. We present a systematic characterization of OS-level resource dynamics in sandboxed AI coding agents, analyzing 144 software engineering tasks from the SWE-rebench benchmark across two LLM models. Our measurements reveal that (1) OS-level execution (tool calls, container and agent initialization) accounts for 56-74% of end-to-end task latency; (2) memory, not CPU, is the concurrency bottleneck; (3) memory spikes are tool-call-driven with a up to 15.4x peak-to-average ratio; and (4) resource demands are highly unpredictable across tasks, runs, and models. Comparing these characteristics against serverless, microservice, and batch workloads, we identify three mismatches in existing resource controls: a granularity mismatch (container-level policies vs. tool-call-level dynamics), a responsiveness mismatch (user-space reaction vs. sub-second unpredictable bursts), and an adaptability mismatch (history-based prediction vs. non-deterministic stateful execution). We propose AgentCgroup , an eBPF-based resource controller that addresses these mismatches through hierarchical cgroup structures aligned with tool-call boundaries, in-kernel enforcement via sched_ext and memcg_bpf_ops, and runtime-adaptive policies driven by in-kernel monitoring. Preliminary evaluation demonstrates improved multi-tenant isolation and reduced resource waste."

This allows us to assume, without loss of generality, that rules considered by us are stable canonical ones. The idea turns out to be useful. In particular, using stable canonical rules, we get an alterna tive proof of the Blok-Esakia theorem for intuitionistic modal logics which was first proved in [3] and generalize it to multi-conclusion consequence re lations. We also prove the Dummett-Lemmon conjecture for intuitionistic modal multi-conclusion consequence relations, which, as far as we know, is a new result."

Existing diversity metrics, such as feature-space dispersion and metric-space magnitude, primarily capture distributional variation or entropy, while largely neglecting the geometric structure of datasets. To address this gap, we introduce a framework based on topological data analysis (TDA) and persistence landscapes (PLs) to extract and quantify geometric features from data. This approach provides a theoretically grounded means of measuring diversity beyond entropy, capturing the rich geometric and structural properties of datasets. Through extensive experiments across diverse modalities, we demonstrate that our proposed PLs-based diversity metric (PLDiv) is powerful, reliable, and interpretable, directly linking data diversity to its underlying geometry and offering a foundational tool for dataset construction, augmentation, and evaluation."

    "abstract": "The consistent embedding of Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) effects within the Standard Model requires a rigorous understanding of how Planck-scale deformations manifest at low energies. While phenomenological approaches often introduce canonical deformations with multiple free parameters to capture these effects, the physical requirement of gauge symmetry in the framework of a covariant Effective Field Theory (EFT) imposes strict conditions on the allowed interaction structure. In this paper, we demonstrate that these conditions act as physical selection rules for admissible quantum gravity models. By applying non-Abelian Ward identities and a covariant operator mapping to the dimension-six operator basis, we derive a fundamental on-shell equivalence between kinetic and cubic interaction terms. As a paradigmatic application, we show that the Levy-Helayel-Neto (LHN) framework, a candidate effective description of LQG, satisfies this physical requirement only when its parameters obey the specific algebraic relation: theta_3 / theta_8 = -1/2 * [ 1 + theta_7 * (ell_P / L)^(2 + 2 Upsilon) ] + O(ell_P). It must be highlighted that this result advances the physical understanding of LQG phenomenology by revealing that the apparent freedom in defining the Hamiltonian is illusory; the parameters are bound by the necessity of preserving the gauge structure of the Standard Model."

To enhance CNN performance, feature stacking techniques have been explored to aggregate complementary acoustic descriptors into richer input representations. In this paper, we investigate CNN-based models employing various stacked feature combinations, including Log-Mel Spectrogram (LM), Spectral Contrast (SPC), Chroma (CH), Tonnetz (TZ), Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), and Gammatone Cepstral Coefficients (GTCC). Experiments are conducted on the widely used ESC-50 and UrbanSound8K datasets under different training regimes, including pretraining on ESC-50, fine-tuning on UrbanSound8K, and comparison with Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) models pretrained on large-scale corpora such as AudioSet. This experimental design enables an analysis of how feature-stacked CNNs compare with transformer-based models under varying levels of training data and pretraining diversity. The results indicate that feature-stacked CNNs offer a more computationally and data-efficient alternative when large-scale pretraining or extensive training data are unavailable, making them particularly well suited for resource-constrained and edge-level sound classification scenarios."

To mitigate these limitations, we propose GAFRNet, a robust and interpretable Graph Attention and FuzzyRule Network specifically engineered for histopathology image classification with scarce supervision. GAFRNet constructs a similarity-driven graph representation to model intersample relationships and employs a multihead graph attention mechanism to capture complex relational features across heterogeneous tissue structures.Concurrently, a differentiable fuzzy-rule module encodes intrinsic topological descriptorsincluding node degree, clustering coefficient, and label consistencyinto explicit, human-understandable diagnostic logic. This design establishes transparent \"IF-THEN\" mappings that mimic the heuristic deduction process of medical experts, providing clear reasoning behind each prediction without relying on post-hoc attribution methods. Extensive evaluations on three benchmark datasets (BreakHis, Mini-DDSM, and ICIAR2018) demonstrate that GAFR-Net consistently outperforms various state-of-the-art methods across multiple magnifications and classification tasks. These results validate the superior generalization and practical utility of GAFR-Net as a reliable decision-support tool for weakly supervised medical image analysis."

While in specific settings, Shampoo and Muon reduce to spectral descent analogous to how Adam and Signum reduce to sign descent, their general relationship and relative data efficiency under controlled settings remain unclear. Through extensive experiments on language models, we demonstrate that Shampoo achieves higher token efficiency than Muon, mirroring Adam's advantage over Signum. We show that Shampoo's update applied to weight matrices can be decomposed into an adapted Muon update. Consistent with this, Shampoo's benefits can be exclusively attributed to its application to weight matrices, challenging interpretations agnostic to parameter shapes. This admits a new perspective that also avoids shortcomings of related interpretations based on variance adaptation and whitening: rather than enforcing semi-orthogonality as in spectral descent, Shampoo's updates are time-averaged semi-orthogonal in expectation."

    "abstract": "Applying dynamic logics to program verifications is a challenge, because their axiomatic rules for regular expressions can be difficult to be adapted to different program models. We present a novel dynamic logic, called DLp, which supports reasoning based on programs' operational semantics. For those programs whose transitional behaviours are their standard or natural semantics, DLp makes their verifications easier since one can directly apply the program transitions for reasoning, without the need of re-designing and validating new rules as in most other dynamic logics. DLp is parametric. It provides a model-independent framework consisting of a relatively small set of inference rules, which depends on a given set of trustworthy rules for the operational semantics. These features of DLp let multiple models easily compared in its framework and makes it compatible with existing dynamic-logic theories. DLp supports cyclic reasoning, providing an incremental derivation process for recursive programs, making it more convenient to reason about without prior program transformations. We analyze and prove the soundness and completeness of DLp under certain conditions. Several case studies illustrate the features of DLp and fully demonstrate its potential usage."

To address this, we introduce a structure-preserving two-stage training strategy that decouples distribution learning from physics enforcement by freezing the coefficient decoder during physics-informed fine-tuning. We further propose a two-step residual objective that enforces physical consistency on refined, structurally valid generative trajectories rather than noisy single-step predictions. The resulting framework enables stable, high-fidelity inference for both unconditional generation and forward problems. We demonstrate that forward solutions can be obtained via a projection-based zero-shot inpainting procedure, achieving consistent accuracy of diffusion baselines with orders of magnitude reduction in computational cost."

However, there is still a lack of rigor in describing controlled experiments, hindering reproducibility and transparency. Registered Reports (RR) have been discussed in the ESE community to address these issues. A RR registers a study's hypotheses, methods, and/or analyses before execution, involving peer review and potential acceptance before data collection. This helps mitigate problematic practices such as p-hacking, publication bias, and inappropriate post hoc analysis. Objective: This paper presents initial results toward establishing an RR template for Software Engineering controlled experiments using the Open Science Framework (OSF). Method: We analyzed templates of selected OSF RR types in light of documentation guidelines for controlled experiments. Results: The observed lack of rigor motivated our investigation of OSF-based RR types. Our analysis showed that, although one of the RR types aligned with many of the documentation suggestions contained in the guidelines, none of them covered the guidelines comprehensively. The study also highlights limitations in OSF RR template customization. Conclusion: Despite progress in ESE, planning and documenting experiments still lack rigor, compromising reproducibility. Adopting OSF-based RRs is proposed. However, no currently available RR type fully satisfies the guidelines. Establishing RR-specific guidelines for SE is deemed essential."

We introduce an extended TE-QPINN (x-TE-QPINN) architecture that supports both classical and fully quantum embeddings, enabling a controlled comparison between feedforward neural network-based feature maps and parameterized quantum circuit embeddings. The first architecture is the classical embedding feed-forward neural network-based TE-QPINN (FNN-TE-QPINN), while the latter variant is a purely quantum one, referred to as quantum embedding neural network-based TE-QPINN (QNN-TE-QPINN). The proposed framework employs hardware-efficient variational quantum circuits and species-specific readout operators to approximate coupled multi-field dynamics while enforcing governing equations, boundary conditions, and initial conditions through a physics-informed loss function. By isolating the embedding mechanism while keeping the variational ansatz, loss formulation, and optimization procedure fixed, we analyze the impact of embedding design on gradient structure, parameter scaling, and quantum resource requirements. Numerical experiments on one- and two-dimensional RD equations demonstrate that quantum embeddings can replace classical embeddings without degradation in solution accuracy and, in certain regimes, exhibit improved optimization behavior compared to classical PINNs and hybrid quantum models with fixed embeddings. These results provide architectural insight into hybrid quantum PDE solvers and inform the design of resource-efficient quantum physics-informed learning methods."

We consider measurement models where each sensor collects a single-snapshot measurement. This covers sensor placement for inverse problems governed by linear steady PDEs or evolution equations with final-in-time observations. It is well-known that in the finite-dimensional (discretized) formulations of such inverse problems, EIG is a monotone submodular function. This also entails a theoretical guarantee for greedy sensor placement in the discretized setting. We extend the result on submodularity of the EIG to the infinite-dimensional setting, proving that the approximation guarantee of greedy sensor placement remains valid in the infinite-dimensional limit. We also discuss computational considerations and present strategies that exploit problem structure and submodularity to yield an efficient implementation of the greedy procedure."

    "abstract": "High-quality medical imaging datasets are essential for training deep learning models, but their unauthorized use raises serious copyright and ethical concerns. Medical imaging presents a unique challenge for existing dataset ownership verification methods designed for natural images, as static watermark patterns generated in fixed-scale images scale poorly dynamic and high-resolution scans with limited visual diversity and subtle anatomical structures, while preserving diagnostic quality. In this paper, we propose X-Mark, a sample-specific clean-label watermarking method for chest x-ray copyright protection. Specifically, X-Mark uses a conditional U-Net to generate unique perturbations within salient regions of each sample. We design a multi-component training objective to ensure watermark efficacy, robustness against dynamic scaling processes while preserving diagnostic quality and visual-distinguishability. We incorporate Laplacian regularization into our training objective to penalize high-frequency perturbations and achieve watermark scale-invariance. Ownership verification is performed in a black-box setting to detect characteristic behaviors in suspicious models. Extensive experiments on CheXpert verify the effectiveness of X-Mark, achieving WSR of 100% and reducing probability of false positives in Ind-M scenario by 12%, while demonstrating resistance to potential adaptive attacks."

We show that neural retrievers used in RAG systems have blind spots, which we define as the failure to retrieve entities that are relevant to the query, but have low similarity to the query embedding. We investigate the training-induced biases that cause such blind spot entities to be mapped to inaccessible parts of the embedding space, resulting in low retrievability. Using a large-scale dataset constructed from Wikidata relations and first paragraphs of Wikipedia, and our proposed Retrieval Probability Score (RPS), we show that blind spot risk in standard retrievers (e.g., CONTRIEVER, REASONIR) can be predicted pre-index from entity embedding geometry, avoiding expensive retrieval evaluations. To address these blind spots, we introduce ARGUS, a pipeline that enables the retrievability of high-risk (low-RPS) entities through targeted document augmentation from a knowledge base (KB), first paragraphs of Wikipedia, in our case. Extensive experiments on BRIGHT, IMPLIRET, and RAR-B show that ARGUS achieves consistent improvements across all evaluated retrievers (averaging +3.4 nDCG@5 and +4.5 nDCG@10 absolute points), with substantially larger gains in challenging subsets. These results establish that preemptively remedying blind spots is critical for building robust and trustworthy RAG systems (Code and Data)."

We study egocentric interaction generation from a single scene image under free-space hand gestures, aiming to synthesize photorealistic videos in which hands enter the scene, interact with objects, and induce plausible world dynamics under head motion. This setting introduces fundamental challenges, including distribution shift between free-space gestures and contact-heavy training data, ambiguity between hand motion and camera motion in monocular views, and the need for arbitrary-length video generation. We present Hand2World, a unified autoregressive framework that addresses these challenges through occlusion-invariant hand conditioning based on projected 3D hand meshes, allowing visibility and occlusion to be inferred from scene context rather than encoded in the control signal. To stabilize egocentric viewpoint changes, we inject explicit camera geometry via per-pixel Plücker-ray embeddings, disentangling camera motion from hand motion and preventing background drift. We further develop a fully automated monocular annotation pipeline and distill a bidirectional diffusion model into a causal generator, enabling arbitrary-length synthesis. Experiments on three egocentric interaction benchmarks show substantial improvements in perceptual quality and 3D consistency while supporting camera control and long-horizon interactive generation."

    "abstract": "The increasingly stringent observational bounds on primordial gravitational waves strongly constrain inflationary model building, favoring scenarios that predict highly suppressed tensor perturbations. While many viable constructions rely on non-canonical kinetic terms, non-minimal couplings, or modifications of gravity, it remains an open question whether comparably small tensor amplitudes can emerge within a minimal, single-field framework driven solely by potential dynamics. In this work we propose a novel inflationary scenario based on a modified Lennard-Jones potential. Inspired by a well-known interaction potential in molecular physics, the proposed form naturally combines a smooth minimum with an extended flat plateau at large field values. This intrinsic structure supports slow-roll inflation and ensures a graceful exit without introducing additional degrees of freedom. We perform a detailed analysis of the inflationary dynamics and confront the model with current observational constraints. We find that the scalar spectral index is fully consistent with CMB data, while the tensor-to-scalar ratio is predicted to be extremely small, reaching values as low as $r\\sim10^{-7}$. Finally, the running of the scalar spectral index is also found to be small, well withing the 1$σ$ recent observational bounds from Atacama Cosmology Telescope."

We first introduce a domain-agnostic formulation that enables consistent detection and evaluation of the counterintuitive phenomenon, addressing the absence of precise definition. Through extensive experiments on 47 tabular datasets and 10 CV/NLP embedding datasets in ADBench, benchmarked against 13 baseline models, we demonstrate that the phenomenon, as defined, is consistently rare in general tabular data. We further investigate this phenomenon from both theoretical and empirical perspectives, focusing on the roles of data dimensionality and difference in feature correlation. Our results suggest that likelihood-only detection with normalizing flows offers a practical and reliable approach for anomaly detection in tabular domains."

    "abstract": "Entangled granular systems exhibit mechanical rigidity and resistance to deformation, reminiscent of cohesive materials, due to their reduced degrees of freedom and contact friction. A quantitative understanding of how classical granular phenomena, such as shear localization and plastic flow, appear in such geometrically cohesive systems remains unknown. Here, we investigate this using granular chain ensembles subjected to direct shear tests. Our experiments reveal that chains longer than four beads exhibit pronounced shear hardening, which is nearly independent of the applied normal stress and is accompanied by the complete suppression of shear localization. The volume dilation of the long chain ensembles also does not vanish in the steady state. We complement this phenomenology, which is distinct from that of typical frictional granular ensembles, with DEM simulations. The simulations reveal that tensile forces are generated due to particles being locally jammed, characterized by a high non-covalent coordination number. Consequently, this leads to a deformation that shows a very diffuse region of localization and enhanced shear hardening. Overall, our study highlights that granular chains provide a systematic route to map how connectivity constraints impact flow properties and mechanical rigidity."

In this work, we study how to adapt pretrained visuomotor diffusion policies to reflect preferred behaviors using limited demonstrations. We introduce RKO, a novel preference-alignment method that combines the benefits of two recent frameworks: RPO and KTO. We evaluate RKO against common preference learning frameworks, including these two, as well as a baseline vanilla diffusion policy, on real-world cloth-folding tasks spanning multiple garments and preference settings. We show that preference-aligned policies (particularly RKO) achieve superior performance and sample efficiency compared to standard diffusion policy fine-tuning.

We utilize two techniques: the first achieves a provably optimal query complexity via a shifted Dyson series; the second breaks the conventional linear dependency, achieving fast-forwarding by exhibiting a square-root dependence on the norm of the dissipative part. Furthermore, one can derive existing methods such as the LCHS (Linear Combination of Hamiltonian Simulation) and the NDME (Non-Diagonal Density Matrix Encoding) methods from APS. The APS provides an effective and generic pathway for developing efficient quantum algorithms for general non-unitary dynamics to achieve either optimal query complexity or fast-forwarding property, outperforming the existing algorithms for the same problems."

    "abstract": "We study the reconfiguration of odd matchings of combinatorial graphs. Odd matchings are matchings that cover all but one vertex of a graph. A reconfiguration step, or flip, is an operation that matches the isolated vertex and, consequently, isolates another vertex. The flip graph of odd matchings is a graph that has all odd matchings of a graph as vertices and an edge between two vertices if their corresponding matchings can be transformed into one another via a single flip. We show that computing the diameter of the flip graph of odd matchings is $Π_2^p$-hard. This complements a recent result by Wulf [FOCS25] that it is~$Π_2^p$-hard to compute the diameter of the flip graph of perfect matchings where a flip swaps matching edges along a single cycle of unbounded size. Further, we show that computing the radius of the flip graph of odd matchings is $Σ_3^p$-hard. The respective decision problems for the diameter and the radius are also complete in the respective level of the polynomial hierarchy. This shows that computing the radius of the flip graph of odd matchings is provably harder than computing its diameter, unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses. Finally, we reduce set cover to the problem of finding shortest flip sequences. As a consequence, we show $\\log$-\\APX-hardness and that the problem cannot be approximated by a sublogarithmic factor. By doing so, we answer a question asked by Aichholzer, Brenner, Dorfer, Hoang, Perz, Rieck, and Verciani [GD25]."

Trust in medical AI requires not just high accuracy but also transparency regarding the specific physiological features driving predictions. Existing explainability methods for ECGs typically rely on post-hoc approximations (e.g., Grad-CAM and SHAP), which can be unstable, computationally expensive, and unfaithful to the model's actual decision-making process. In this work, we propose the ECG-IMN, an Interpretable Mesomorphic Neural Network tailored for high-resolution 12-lead ECG classification. Unlike standard classifiers, the ECG-IMN functions as a hypernetwork: a deep convolutional backbone generates the parameters of a strictly linear model specific to each input sample. This architecture enforces intrinsic interpretability, as the decision logic is mathematically transparent and the generated weights (W) serve as exact, high-resolution feature attribution maps. We introduce a transition decoder that effectively maps latent features to sample-wise weights, enabling precise localization of pathological evidence (e.g., ST-elevation, T-wave inversion) in both time and lead dimensions. We evaluate our approach on the PTB-XL dataset for classification tasks, demonstrating that the ECG-IMN achieves competitive predictive performance (AUROC comparable to black-box baselines) while providing faithful, instance-specific explanations. By explicitly decoupling parameter generation from prediction execution, our framework bridges the gap between deep learning capability and clinical trustworthiness, offering a principled path toward \"white-box\" cardiac diagnostics."

This interest arises from its central role in developing vulnerability detection systems, copyright infringement analysis, and malware phylogeny tools. Nearly all binary function similarity systems embed assembly functions into real-valued vectors, where similar functions map to points that lie close to each other in the metric space. These embeddings enable function search: a query function is embedded and compared against a database of candidate embeddings to retrieve the most similar matches. Despite their effectiveness, such systems rely on bi-encoder architectures that embed functions independently, limiting their ability to capture cross-function relationships and similarities. To address this limitation, we introduce ReSIM, a novel and enhanced function search system that complements embedding-based search with a neural re-ranker. Unlike traditional embedding models, our reranking module jointly processes query-candidate pairs to compute ranking scores based on their mutual representation, allowing for more accurate similarity assessment. By re-ranking the top results from embedding-based retrieval, ReSIM leverages fine-grained relation information that bi-encoders cannot capture. We evaluate ReSIM across seven embedding models on two benchmark datasets, demonstrating consistent improvements in search effectiveness, with average gains of 21.7% in terms of nDCG and 27.8% in terms of Recall."

To address this, we propose \\textbf{Scalpel}, a method that reduces hallucination by refining attention activation distributions toward more credible regions. Scalpel predicts trusted attention directions for each head in Transformer layers during inference and adjusts activations accordingly. It employs a Gaussian mixture model to capture multi-peak distributions of attention in trust and hallucination manifolds, and uses entropic optimal transport (equivalent to Schrödinger bridge problem) to map Gaussian components precisely. During mitigation, Scalpel dynamically adjusts intervention strength and direction based on component membership and mapping relationships between hallucination and trust activations. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and benchmarks demonstrate that Scalpel effectively mitigates hallucinations, outperforming previous methods and achieving state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, Scalpel is model- and data-agnostic, requiring no additional computation, only a single decoding step."

Among existing methods, guiding the generation of frozen LLMs through autoregressive reward models (ARMs) to accomplish multi-objective test-time alignment is a low-cost solution. However, these methods typically rely on independent parameters for each preference objective, either by training ARMs independently across preference dimensions, which neglects interactions among preference features, or by training a single ARM with separate feature extraction modules for each preference, which can cause feature entanglement. Both strategies can result in misalignment between generated outputs and user preferences. To address this limitation, we propose Preference-Modulated \\& Shared Low-Rank Adaptation (MoSLoRA) for ARM training, which first extracts shared features via a preference-agnostic module and then applies affine transformations to shared features via a preference modulation module conditioned on mixed preference vectors.

However, the widespread reliance on the response-level Bradley-Terry (BT) model may limit its full potential, as the reference and learnable models are assumed to be autoregressive only after deriving the objective function. Motivated by this limitation, we revisit the theoretical foundations of DPO and propose a novel formulation that explicitly introduces the autoregressive assumption prior to applying the BT model. By reformulating and extending DPO, we derive a novel variant, termed Autoregressive DPO (ADPO), that explicitly integrates autoregressive modeling into the preference optimization framework. Without violating the theoretical foundations, the derived loss takes an elegant form: it shifts the summation operation in the DPO objective outside the log-sigmoid function. Furthermore, through theoretical analysis of ADPO, we show that there exist two length measures to be considered when designing DPO-based algorithms: the token length $μ$ and the feedback length $μ$'. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explicitly distinguish these two measures and analyze their implications for preference optimization in LLMs."

    "abstract": "Many modern iterative solvers for large-scale tomographic reconstruction incur two major computational costs per iteration: expensive forward/adjoint projections to update the data fidelity term and costly proximal computations for the regulariser, often done via inner iterations. This paper studies for the first time the application of methods that couple randomised skipping of the proximal with variance-reduced subset-based optimisation of data-fit term, to simultaneously reduce both costs in challenging tomographic reconstruction tasks. We provide a series of experiments using both synthetic and real data, demonstrating striking speed-ups of the order 5x--20x compared to the non-skipped counterparts which have been so far the standard approach for efficiently solving these problems. Our work lays the groundwork for broader adoption of these methods in inverse problems."

    "abstract": "Existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit insufficient visual attention, leading to hallucinations. To alleviate this problem, some previous studies adjust and amplify visual attention. These methods present a limitation that boosting attention for all visual tokens inevitably increases attention to task irrelevant tokens. To tackle this challenge, we propose a training free attentional intervention algorithm to enhance the attention of task-relevant tokens based on the argument that task-relevant tokens generally demonstrate high visual-textual similarities. Specifically, the vision-text cross-attention submatrices, which represent visual-textual correlations, are extracted to construct the reweighting matrices to reallocate attention. Besides, to enhance the contribution of visual tokens, we inject visual attention values into the beam search decoding to identify solutions with higher visual attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this method significantly reduces hallucinations across mainstream LVLMs, while preserving the accuracy and coherence of generated content."

    "abstract": "Imitation is a basic updating mechanism for strategy evolution in structured populations, determining how individuals sample social information and translate it into behavioral changes. Higher-order networks, such as hypergraphs, generalize pairwise links to hyperedges and provide a natural representation of group interactions. Yet existing studies on higher-order networks largely emphasize structural effects, while the impact of imitation-based update rules and how they interact with group structures remains poorly understood. Here, we introduce a class of structure-aware imitation rules on hypergraphs that explicitly parameterize how many groups are sampled and how many peers are consulted within each sampled group. Under weak selection, we derive an analytical condition for the success of cooperation for any multiplayer social dilemmas on homogeneous hypergraphs. This analysis yields an interpretable metric, information diversity, which quantifies how an update rule diversifies the sources of social information across groups. Analytical predictions and numerical simulations show that cooperation is more effectively promoted by update rules that induce higher information diversity for three representative dilemmas. Further simulations demonstrate that this principle extends to non-homogeneous hypergraphs and a broad class of multiplayer social dilemmas. Our work thus provides a unifying metric that links microscopic updating to evolutionary outcomes in higher-order networked systems and establishes a general design principle for promoting cooperation beyond pairwise interactions."

    "abstract": "Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs) generate text by iteratively filling masked tokens, requiring two coupled decisions at each step: which positions to unmask (where-to-unmask) and which tokens to place (what-to-unmask). While standard MDLM training directly optimizes token prediction (what-to-unmask), inference-time unmasking orders (where-to-unmask) are typically determined by heuristic confidence measures or trained through reinforcement learning with costly on-policy rollouts. To address this, we introduce Gt-Margin, a position-wise score derived from ground-truth tokens, defined as the probability margin between the correct token and its strongest alternative. Gt-Margin yields an oracle unmasking order that prioritizes easier positions first under each partially masked state. We demonstrate that leveraging this oracle unmasking order significantly enhances final generation quality, particularly on logical reasoning benchmarks. Building on this insight, we train a supervised unmasking planner via learning-to-rank to imitate the oracle ordering from masked contexts. The resulting planner integrates into standard MDLM sampling to select where-to-unmask, improving reasoning accuracy without modifying the token prediction model."

    "abstract": "A major challenge in photonic quantum technologies is developing strategies to prepare suitable discrete-variable quantum states using simple input states, linear optics, and auxiliary photon measurements to identify successful outcomes. Fundamentally, this challenge arises from the lack of strong non-linearities on the single-photon level, meaning that photonic state preparation based on linear optics cannot benefit from the deterministic gate-based approach available to other physical platforms. Instead, the preparation of quantum states can be probabilistically implemented using single photons, linear-optical networks, and photon detection. However, determining whether an input state can be transformed into a target state using a specific measurement pattern - a problem that can be mapped to deciding the feasibility of a system of polynomial equations - is a complex problem in general. To solve it, we apply the Nullstellensatz Linear Algebra algorithm from algebraic geometry to quantum state generation; this can provide definitive no-go results by proving infeasibility when the state preparation task in question has no solution. We demonstrate this capability to validate and establish lower bounds on the physical resource requirements for the realization of several ubiquitous optical states and gates."

    "abstract": "L7 load balancers are a fundamental building block in microservices as they enable fine-grained traffic distribution. Compared to monolithic applications, microservices demand higher performance and stricter isolation from load balancers. This is due to the increased number of instances, longer service chains, and the necessity for co-location with services on the same host. Traditional sidecar-based load balancers are ill-equipped to meet these demands, often resulting in significant performance degradation. In this work, we present XLB, a novel architecture that reshapes L7 load balancers as in-kernel interposition operating on the socket layer. We leverage eBPF to implement the core load balancing logic in the kernel, and address the connection management and state maintenance challenges through novel socket layer redirection and nested eBPF maps designs. XLB eliminates the extra overhead of scheduling, communication, and data movement, resulting in a more lightweight, scalable, and efficient L7 load balancer architecture. Compared to the widely used microservices load balancers (Istio and Cilium), over 50 microservice instances, XLB achieves up to 1.5x higher throughput and 60% lower end-to-end latency."

By combining crystal-symmetry-paired spin-momentum locking (CSML) with the layered structure, the V2Se2O-family offers a suitable platform for studying low-dimensional spintronic responses and exploring the interplay among multiple quantum degrees of freedom. To establish a concrete theoretical foundation for understanding and utilizing these materials, we investigate six representative members of the V2Se2O-family and construct a realistic tight-binding model parameterized by first-principles calculations, which is benchmarked by experimental measurements. This model accurately captures essential altermagnetic electronic properties, including CSML and noncollinear spin-conserved currents. It further incorporates strain-coupling parameters, enabling the simulation of strain-tunable responses such as the piezo-Hall effects. This realistic model allows systematic exploration of multiple degrees of freedom (like spin, valley, and layer) within a single system, and lays the groundwork for understanding their coupling with other quantum materials, such as topological insulators and superconductors, thereby advancing both the fundamental understanding and potential device applications of this novel class of layered altermagnets."

Previous approaches, bound by internal knowledge, often fail to provide verifiable results, yielding confident but ungrounded predictions when faced with confounded evidence. To address these challenges, we propose SpotAgent, a framework that formalizes geo-localization into an agentic reasoning process that leverages expert-level reasoning to synergize visual interpretation with tool-assisted verification. SpotAgent actively explores and verifies visual cues by leveraging external tools (e.g., web search, maps) through a ReAct diagram. We introduce a 3-stage post-training pipeline starting with a Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) stage for basic alignment, followed by an Agentic Cold Start phase utilizing high-quality trajectories synthesized via a Multi-Agent framework, aiming to instill tool-calling expertise. Subsequently, the model's reasoning capabilities are refined through Reinforcement Learning. We propose a Spatially-Aware Dynamic Filtering strategy to enhance the efficiency of the RL stage by prioritizing learnable samples based on spatial difficulty. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that SpotAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively mitigating hallucinations while delivering precise and verifiable geo-localization."

We explore how the background magnetic field qualitatively alters the BH's gravitational dynamics, affecting timelike geodesics such as the marginally bound orbit (MBO) and the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO). We then analyze periodic bound orbits using the frequency ratio ${ω_{\\varphi}}/{ω_{r}}$, which characterizes the orbits by their azimuthal and radial motions. Based on the numerical kludge method we further compute the gravitational waveforms emitted from periodic orbits around a supermassive Schwarzschild-BR BH. We show that the background magnetic field significantly changes orbital frequencies, resonance conditions, zoom-whirl structures, and the resulting waveforms. Finally, we examine the frequency spectra in the mHz range and the detectability of these GW signals by computing the characteristic strain via a discrete Fourier transform on the time-domain waveforms, comparing the results with the sensitivity curves of space-based GW detectors such as LISA, Taiji, and TianQin. Our results show that intrinsically magnetic fields modify spacetime and leave observable imprints on extreme mass-ratio inspiral GWs, which may be tested by future observations."

Various training-free flow matching approaches have been developed to improve image generation through flow velocity field adjustment, eliminating the need for costly retraining. However, Modifying the velocity field $v$ introduces errors that propagate through the full generation path, whereas adjustments to the latent trajectory $z$ are naturally corrected by the pretrained velocity network, reducing error accumulation. In this paper, we propose two complementary training-free latent-trajectory adjustment approaches based on future and past velocity $v$ and latent trajectory $z$ information that refine the generative path directly in latent space. We propose two training-free trajectory smoothing schemes: \\emph{Look-Ahead}, which averages the current and next-step latents using a curvature-gated weight, and \\emph{Look-Back}, which smoothes latents using an exponential moving average with decay. We demonstrate through extensive experiments and comprehensive evaluation metrics that the proposed training-free trajectory smoothing models substantially outperform various state-of-the-art models across multiple datasets including COCO17, CUB-200, and Flickr30K."

We introduce SWE-AGI, an open-source benchmark for evaluating end-to-end, specification-driven construction of software systems written in MoonBit. SWE-AGI tasks require LLM-based agents to implement parsers, interpreters, binary decoders, and SAT solvers strictly from authoritative standards and RFCs under a fixed API scaffold. Each task involves implementing 1,000-10,000 lines of core logic, corresponding to weeks or months of engineering effort for an experienced human developer. By leveraging the nascent MoonBit ecosystem, SWE-AGI minimizes data leakage, forcing agents to rely on long-horizon architectural reasoning rather than code retrieval. Across frontier models, gpt-5.3-codex achieves the best overall performance (solving 19/22 tasks, 86.4%), outperforming claude-opus-4.6 (15/22, 68.2%), and kimi-2.5 exhibits the strongest performance among open-source models. Performance degrades sharply with increasing task difficulty, particularly on hard, specification-intensive systems. Behavioral analysis further reveals that as codebases scale, code reading, rather than writing, becomes the dominant bottleneck in AI-assisted development. Overall, while specification-driven autonomous software engineering is increasingly viable, substantial challenges remain before it can reliably support production-scale development."

At the Olympiad level, diagrams are often constitutive rather than illustrative, containing essential constraints, such as boundary conditions and spatial symmetries, that are absent from the text. To bridge this visual-logical gap, we introduce P1-VL, a family of open-source vision-language models engineered for advanced scientific reasoning. Our method harmonizes Curriculum Reinforcement Learning, which employs progressive difficulty expansion to stabilize post-training, with Agentic Augmentation, enabling iterative self-verification at inference.

Our agent-augmented system achieves the No.2 overall rank globally, trailing only Gemini-3-Pro. Beyond physics, P1-VL demonstrates remarkable scientific reasoning capacity and generalizability, establishing significant leads over base models in STEM benchmarks.

Morimoto et al., New J. Phys. 24, 033051 (2022)]. By distinguishing contributions from individual orbitals, our results validate the two-level system approximation and also emphasize that the first-principles approach agrees better with experimental results for light-driven residual current, especially in extremely strong fields. Furthermore, our 3D model reveals that the real-space atomic-scale current induced by strong laser fields is concentrated slightly above and below the graphene basal plane, rather than strictly within it. The two oppositely directed currents exhibit a pronounced height separation in the out-of-plane direction, indicating that the ring current is not confined to the graphene plane but forms a rotating 3D circulation loop which is absent in the reduced-dimensional model."

In this work, we present Fine-T2I, a large-scale, high-quality, and fully open dataset for T2I fine-tuning. Fine-T2I spans 10 task combinations, 32 prompt categories, 11 visual styles, and 5 prompt templates, and combines synthetic images generated by strong modern models with carefully curated real images from professional photographers.

Existing encoder-based attacks perturb the input image by optimizing solely on the vision encoder, rather than the entire LVLM, offering a computationally efficient alternative to end-to-end optimization. However, their transferability across different LVLM architectures in realistic black-box scenarios remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we present the first systematic study towards encoder-based adversarial transferability in LVLMs. Our contributions are threefold. First, through large-scale benchmarking over eight diverse LVLMs, we reveal that existing attacks exhibit severely limited transferability. Second, we perform in-depth analysis, disclosing two root causes that hinder the transferability: (1) inconsistent visual grounding across models, where different models focus their attention on distinct regions; (2) redundant semantic alignment within models, where a single object is dispersed across multiple overlapping token representations. Third, we propose Semantic-Guided Multimodal Attack (SGMA), a novel framework to enhance the transferability. Inspired by the discovered causes in our analysis, SGMA directs perturbations toward semantically critical regions and disrupts cross-modal grounding at both global and local levels. Extensive experiments across different victim models and tasks show that SGMA achieves higher transferability than existing attacks. These results expose critical security risks in LVLM deployment and underscore the urgent need for robust multimodal defenses."

Existing task-vector merging methods such as TIES, TSV-M, and Iso-C/CTS differ in their aggregation rules but treat all layers nearly uniformly. This assumption overlooks the strong layer-wise heterogeneity in large vision transformers, where shallow layers are sensitive to interference while deeper layers encode stable task-specific features. We introduce LARV, a training-free, data-free, merger-agnostic Layer-wise Adaptive Rescaling Veneer that plugs into any task-vector merger and assigns a per-layer scale to each task vector before aggregation, and show it consistently boosts diverse merging rules. LARV adaptively suppresses shallow-layer interference and amplifies deeper-layer alignment using a simple deterministic schedule, requiring no retraining or modification to existing mergers. To our knowledge, this is the first work to perform layer-aware scaling for task-vector merging. LARV computes simple data-free layer proxies and turns them into scales through a lightweight rule; we study several instantiations within one framework (e.g., tiered two/three-level scaling with fixed values, or continuous mappings) and show that tiered choices offer the best robustness, while continuous mappings remain an ablation. LARV is orthogonal to the base merger and adds negligible cost. On FusionBench with Vision Transformers, LARV consistently improves all task-vector baselines across 8/14/20-task settings; for example, Iso-C + LARV reaches 85.9% on ViT-B/32, 89.2% on ViT-B/16, and 92.6% on ViT-L/14. Layerwise analysis and corruption tests further indicate that LARV suppresses shallow-layer interference while modestly amplifying deeper, task-stable features, turning model merging into a robust, layer-aware procedure rather than a uniform one."

    "abstract": "This paper provides a detailed historical account of early debates over wave-function realism, the modern term for the view that the wave function of quantum theory is physically real. As this paper will show, the idea of physical waves associated with particles had its roots in work by Einstein and de Broglie, who both originally thought of these waves as propagating in three-dimensional physical space. De Broglie quickly turned this wave-particle duality into an early pilot-wave theory, on which a particle's associated phase wave piloted or guided the particle along its trajectory. Schrödinger built on de Broglie's phase-wave hypothesis to provide a comprehensive account of the nascent quantum theory. However, Schrödinger's new undulatory mechanics came at the cost of replacing de Broglie's phase waves propagating in physical space with a wave function propagating in a system's abstract configuration space. The present work will argue that this move from three-dimensional physical space to a many-dimensional configuration space was a key reason why the founders of quantum theory uniformly abandoned the physical reality of the wave function. This paper will further clarify that de Broglie introduced two distinct pilot-wave theories, and will then argue that it was Bohm's rediscovery of the second of these two pilot-wave theories over two decades later, as well as Bohm's vociferous defense of wave-function realism, that were responsible for resurrecting the idea of an ontological wave function. This idea ended up playing a central role in Everett's development of the many-worlds interpretation."

    "abstract": "Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) seeks the minima with a flat loss landscape to improve the generalization performance in machine learning tasks, including fine-tuning. However, its extra parameter perturbation step doubles the computation cost, which becomes the bottleneck of SAM in the practical implementation. In this work, we propose an approach SL-SAM to break this bottleneck by introducing the sparse technique to layers. Our key innovation is to frame the dynamic selection of layers for both the gradient ascent (perturbation) and descent (update) steps as a multi-armed bandit problem. At the beginning of each iteration, SL-SAM samples a part of the layers of the model according to the gradient norm to participate in the backpropagation of the following parameter perturbation and update steps, thereby reducing the computation complexity. We then provide the analysis to guarantee the convergence of SL-SAM. In the experiments of fine-tuning models in several tasks, SL-SAM achieves the performances comparable to the state-of-the-art baselines, including a \\#1 rank on LLM fine-tuning. Meanwhile, SL-SAM significantly reduces the ratio of active parameters in backpropagation compared to vanilla SAM (SL-SAM activates 47\\%, 22\\% and 21\\% parameters on the vision, moderate and large language model respectively while vanilla SAM always activates 100\\%), verifying the efficiency of our proposed algorithm."

    "abstract": "Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are a major driver of space weather as they propagate through the heliosphere. Many CMEs have associated prominence material entangled in their magnetic structure which contains cooler plasma. This cooler CME component contains significant amounts of neutral elements, which emit brightly in permitted atomic lines. It has been hypothesized that permitted transitions of neutral elements in eruptions could be used for inferring the magnetic field in CMEs, which is crucial for space weather forecasting. We present observations made with the Upgraded Coronal Multi-channel Polarimeter (UCoMP) in He I 1083 nm that clearly show the presence of neutral helium in eruptive prominences associated with CMEs as they propagate through the lower and middle corona. We find that solar prominence eruptions can be detected in He I 1083 nm observations up to the edge of the instrument field of view at about 2 solar radii, providing valuable spectral information that complements existing extreme ultraviolet and white-light coronal imaging observatories. These results illustrate the capability of UCoMP to probe the dynamic behavior of prominence eruptions, allowing for their line-of-sight velocity estimation, and potentially improving space weather forecasting by enabling earlier and more accurate identification of Earth-directed eruptions."

And yet, the drafting of contracts is often presented as a typical legal task that could be facilitated by this technology. This paper seeks to put an end to such unreasonable ideas. Predicting words differs from using language in the circumstances of specific transactions and reconstituting common contractual phrases differs from reasoning about the law. LLMs seem to be able to generate generic and superficially plausible contractual documents. In the cold light of day, such documents may turn out to be useless assemblages of inconsistent provisions or contracts that are enforceable but unsuitable for a given transaction. This paper casts a shadow on the simplistic assumption that LLMs threaten the continued viability of the legal industry."

A core challenge it faces is bias, which has primarily been studied in terms of known biases and their impact on evaluation outcomes, while automated and systematic exploration of potential unknown biases is still lacking. Nevertheless, such exploration is crucial for enhancing the robustness and reliability of evaluations. To bridge this gap, we propose BiasScope, a LLM-driven framework for automatically and at scale discovering potential biases that may arise during model evaluation. BiasScope can uncover potential biases across different model families and scales, with its generality and effectiveness validated on the JudgeBench dataset. It overcomes the limitations of existing approaches, transforming bias discovery from a passive process relying on manual effort and predefined bias lists into an active and comprehensive automated exploration. Moreover, based on BiasScope, we propose JudgeBench-Pro, an extended version of JudgeBench and a more challenging benchmark for evaluating the robustness of LLM-as-a-judge. Strikingly, even powerful LLMs as evaluators show error rates above 50\\% on JudgeBench-Pro, underscoring the urgent need to strengthen evaluation robustness and to mitigate potential biases further."

    "abstract": "Multiple rotation averaging (MRA) is a fundamental optimization problem in 3D vision and robotics that aims to recover globally consistent absolute rotations from noisy relative measurements. Established classical methods, such as L1-IRLS and Shonan, face limitations including local minima susceptibility and reliance on convex relaxations that fail to preserve the exact manifold geometry, leading to reduced accuracy in high-noise scenarios. We introduce IQARS (Iterative Quantum Annealing for Rotation Synchronization), the first algorithm that reformulates MRA as a sequence of local quadratic non-convex sub-problems executable on quantum annealers after binarization, to leverage inherent hardware advantages. IQARS removes convex relaxation dependence and better preserves non-Euclidean rotation manifold geometry while leveraging quantum tunneling and parallelism for efficient solution space exploration. We evaluate IQARS's performance on synthetic and real-world datasets. While current annealers remain in their nascent phase and only support solving problems of limited scale with constrained performance, we observed that IQARS on D-Wave annealers can already achieve ca. 12% higher accuracy than Shonan, i.e., the best-performing classical method evaluated empirically."

Unlike text-to-video models, existing I2V pipelines often suffer from appearance drift and geometric distortion, artifacts we attribute to the sparsity of single-view 2D observations and weak cross-modal alignment. Here we address this problem from both data and model perspectives. First, we curate ConsIDVid, a large-scale object-centric dataset built with a scalable pipeline for high-quality, temporally aligned videos, and establish ConsIDVid-Bench, where we present a novel benchmarking and evaluation framework for multi-view consistency using metrics sensitive to subtle geometric and appearance deviations. We further propose ConsID-Gen, a view-assisted I2V generation framework that augments the first frame with unposed auxiliary views and fuses semantic and structural cues via a dual-stream visual-geometric encoder as well as a text-visual connector, yielding unified conditioning for a Diffusion Transformer backbone. Experiments across ConsIDVid-Bench demonstrate that ConsID-Gen consistently outperforms in multiple metrics, with the best overall performance surpassing leading video generation models like Wan2.1 and HunyuanVideo, delivering superior identity fidelity and temporal coherence under challenging real-world scenarios.

However, thermal freeze-out of electroweak doublet dark matter is generically strongly excluded by direct detection. We show that SU(2)${}_L$ doublet fermion dark matter evades direct detection if its mass exceeds $10^{10}$ GeV. If the neutral Dirac fermion is split into a pseudo-Dirac pair (via high dimension operator) this limit can be relaxed to 300 GeV. Provided the dark matter mass is above the reheat temperature of the Universe, the production rate never exceeds the Hubble rate in cases of interest, thus the dark matter never thermalizes. We apply constraints from direct detection (e.g. LZ) and consider the discovery potential of Darwin. This scenario presents the most minimal model of freeze-in dark matter, and is both elegant and highly predictive."

We introduce ST4VLA, a dual-system Vision-Language-Action framework that leverages Spatial Guided Training to align action learning with spatial priors in VLMs. ST4VLA includes two stages: (i) spatial grounding pre-training, which equips the VLM with transferable priors via scalable point, box, and trajectory prediction from both web-scale and robot-specific data, and (ii) spatially guided action post-training, which encourages the model to produce richer spatial priors to guide action generation via spatial prompting. This design preserves spatial grounding during policy learning and promotes consistent optimization across spatial and action objectives. Empirically, ST4VLA achieves substantial improvements over vanilla VLA, with performance increasing from 66.1 -> 84.6 on Google Robot and from 54.7 -> 73.2 on WidowX Robot, establishing new state-of-the-art results on SimplerEnv. It also demonstrates stronger generalization to unseen objects and paraphrased instructions, as well as robustness to long-horizon perturbations in real-world settings. These results highlight scalable spatially guided training as a promising direction for robust, generalizable robot learning.

This work presents VideoWorld 2, which extends VideoWorld and offers the first investigation into learning transferable knowledge directly from raw real-world videos. At its core, VideoWorld 2 introduces a dynamic-enhanced Latent Dynamics Model (dLDM) that decouples action dynamics from visual appearance: a pretrained video diffusion model handles visual appearance modeling, enabling the dLDM to learn latent codes that focus on compact and meaningful task-related dynamics. These latent codes are then modeled autoregressively to learn task policies and support long-horizon reasoning. We evaluate VideoWorld 2 on challenging real-world handcraft making tasks, where prior video generation and latent-dynamics models struggle to operate reliably. Remarkably, VideoWorld 2 achieves up to 70% improvement in task success rate and produces coherent long execution videos. In robotics, we show that VideoWorld 2 can acquire effective manipulation knowledge from the Open-X dataset, which substantially improves task performance on CALVIN.

Using neural quantum states (NQS), and in particular Gutzwiller-projected Hidden Fermion Pfaffian State, we access the ground-state properties on large lattices up to $8\\times 8\\times 2$ sites. We show that this model exhibits superconductivity across a wide range of dopings and couplings, and analyze the pairing behavior in detail. We identify a crossover from tightly bound, Bose-Einstein-condensed interlayer pairs at strong interlayer exchange to more spatially extended Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer-like pairs as the interlayer exchange is decreased. Furthermore, upon tuning the intralayer exchange, we observe a sharp transition from interlayer $s$-wave pairing to intralayer $d$-wave pairing, consistent with a first-order change in the pairing symmetry. We verify that our simulations are accurate by comparing with matrix product state simulations on coupled ladders. Our results represent the first simulation of a fermionic multi-orbital system with NQS, and provide the first evidence for superconductivity in two-dimensonal bilayers using high-precision numerics. These findings provide insight into superconductivity in bilayer nickelates and cold atom quantum simulation platforms."

We show that the spin wave dispersion beyond the strong coupling limit can be mapped to the spin wave dispersion of a Heisenberg ferromagnet with farther neighbor exchange couplings, and discuss how this affects instabilities towards antiferromagnetism. Second, we examine the effect of including electronic spin-orbit coupling in the spin wave theory of Kondo ferromagnets. Including spin-orbit coupling is natural and straightforward in the formulation of the canonical spin wave expansion. Our key result is to demonstrate that the linear spin wave Hamiltonian of the itinerant Kondo ferromagnet can be mapped to the spin wave Hamiltonian of a Heisenberg ferromagnet with easy-axis Ising anisotropy and antisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya exchange interaction. We show that in the case of the Kane-Mele honeycomb lattice Kondo ferromagnet this leads to topological magnon bands, and discuss the implications of this result for itinerant ferromagnets more broadly."

A voting rule is allocation proportional if each party's share of elected candidates equals that party's aggregate score. Recognizing that no committee scoring rule can universally satisfy allocation proportionality in practice, we introduce a new measure of allocation proportionality degree and discuss how it relates to other quantitative measures of proportionality. This measure allows us to compare OWA-based committee scoring rules according to how much they diverge from the ideal of allocation proportionality.

Forensim outputs three-class masks (pristine, source, target) and supports detection of both splicing and copy-move forgeries within a unified architecture.

Our method is based on the introduction of `observers', which are randomly chosen nodes monitoring the local connectivity of a network. To demonstrate efficiency of the method, we derive explicit equations determining the susceptibility and study its critical behavior near continuous and mixed-order phase transitions in uncorrelated random undirected and directed networks, networks with dependency links, and $k$-cores of networks. The universality of the critical behavior is supported by the phenomenological Landau theory of phase transitions."

When the Hamming distance is considered as the underlying metric, this problem has extensive applications, ranging from bioinformatics to pattern recognition. However, modern applications often require the generation of multiple (near-)optimal yet diverse median strings to enhance flexibility and robustness in decision-making. In this study, we address this need by focusing on two prominent diversity measures: sum dispersion and min dispersion. We first introduce an exact algorithm for the diameter variant of the problem, which identifies pairs of near-optimal medians that are maximally diverse. Subsequently, we propose a $(1-ε)$-approximation algorithm (for any $ε>0$) for sum dispersion, as well as a bi-criteria approximation algorithm for the more challenging min dispersion case, allowing the generation of multiple (more than two) diverse near-optimal Hamming medians.

    "abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated that incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning into the detection process can enhance a model's ability to detect synthetic images. However, excessively lengthy reasoning incurs substantial resource overhead, including token consumption and latency, which is particularly redundant when handling obviously generated forgeries. To address this issue, we propose Fake-HR1, a large-scale hybrid-reasoning model that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to adaptively determine whether reasoning is necessary based on the characteristics of the generative detection task. To achieve this, we design a two-stage training framework: we first perform Hybrid Fine-Tuning (HFT) for cold-start initialization, followed by online reinforcement learning with Hybrid-Reasoning Grouped Policy Optimization (HGRPO) to implicitly learn when to select an appropriate reasoning mode. Experimental results show that Fake-HR1 adaptively performs reasoning across different types of queries, surpassing existing LLMs in both reasoning ability and generative detection performance, while significantly improving response efficiency."

    "abstract": "In 3D Aerial-Ground Integrated Networks (AGINs), ensuring continuous service coverage under unexpected hardware failures is critical for mission-critical applications. While Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has shown promise in autonomous coordination, its resilience under sudden node failures remains a challenge due to dynamic topology deformation. This paper proposes a Topology-Aware Graph MAPPO (TAG-MAPPO) framework designed to enhance system survivability through autonomous 3D spatial reconfiguration. Our framework incorporates graph-based feature aggregation with a residual ego-state fusion mechanism to capture intricate inter-agent dependencies. This architecture enables the surviving swarm to rapidly adapt its topology compared to conventional Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) based approaches. Extensive simulations across heterogeneous environments, ranging from interference-limited Crowded Urban to sparse Rural areas, validate the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that TAG-MAPPO consistently outperforms baselines in both stability and efficiency; specifically, it reduces redundant handoffs by up to 50 percent while maintaining a lead in energy efficiency. Most notably, the framework exhibits exceptional self-healing capabilities following a catastrophic node failure. TAG-MAPPO restores over 90 percent of the pre-failure service coverage within 15 time steps, exhibiting a significantly faster V-shaped recovery trajectory than MLP baselines. Furthermore, in dense urban scenarios, the framework achieves a post-failure Jain's Fairness Index that even surpasses its original four-UAV configuration by effectively resolving service overlaps. These findings suggest that topology-aware coordination is essential for the realization of resilient 6G aerial networks and provides a robust foundation for adaptive deployments in volatile environments."

    "abstract": "Linear mixed models are widely used for pharmaceutical stability trending when sufficient lots are available. Expiry support is typically based on whether lot-specific conditional-mean confidence limits remain within specification through a proposed expiry. These limits depend on the denominator degrees-of-freedom (DDF) method used for $t$-based inference. We document an operationally important boundary-proximal phenomenon: when a fitted random-effect variance component is close to zero, Satterthwaite DDF for conditional-mean predictions can collapse, inflating $t$ critical values and producing unnecessarily wide and sometimes nonmonotone pointwise confidence limits on scheduled time grids. In contrast, containment DDF yields stable degrees of freedom and avoids sharp discontinuities as variance components approach the boundary. Using a worked example and simulation studies, we show that DDF choice can materially change pass/fail conclusions even when observed data comfortably meet specifications. Containment-based inference with the full random-effects model provides a single modeling framework that avoids the discontinuities introduced by data-dependent model reduction at arbitrary cutoffs. When containment is unavailable, a 10\\% variance-contribution reduction workflow mitigates extreme Satterthwaite behavior by simplifying the random-effects structure only when fitted contributions at the proposed expiry are negligible. An AICc step-down is also evaluated but is best treated as a sensitivity analysis, as it can be liberal when the margin between the mean trend and the specification limit at the proposed expiry is small."

However, most claim verification works mainly focus on the reasoning over textual evidence only or ignore the explainability, resulting in inaccurate and unconvincing verification. To address this problem, we propose a novel model that jointly achieves evidence retrieval, multi-modal claim verification, and explanation generation. For evidence retrieval, we construct a two-layer multi-modal graph for claims and evidence, where we design image-to-text and text-to-image reasoning for multi-modal retrieval. For claim verification, we propose token- and evidence-level fusion to integrate claim and evidence embeddings for multi-modal verification. For explanation generation, we introduce multi-modal Fusion-in-Decoder for explainability. Finally, since almost all the datasets are in general domain, we create a scientific dataset, AIChartClaim, in AI domain to complement claim verification community. Experiments show the strength of our model."

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning has become a cornerstone technique for developing reasoning models in complex tasks, ranging from mathematical problem-solving to imaginary reasoning. The optimization of these models typically relies on policy gradient methods, whose efficacy hinges on the accurate estimation of an advantage function. However, prevailing methods typically employ static advantage estimation, a practice that leads to inefficient credit assignment by neglecting the dynamic utility of training samples over time. This limitation results in suboptimal policy updates, which in turn manifest as slower convergence rates and increased learning instability, as models fail to adapt to evolving sample utilities effectively. To address this problem, we introduce \\textbf{ADORA} (\\textbf{A}dvantage \\textbf{D}ynamics via \\textbf{O}nline \\textbf{R}ollout \\textbf{A}daptation), a novel framework for policy optimization. ADORA dynamically adjusts the advantage function's weighting by adaptively categorizing training data into temporarily advantageous and disadvantageous samples, based on their evolving utility during online model rollouts. This tailored data differentiation strategy allows ADORA to be seamlessly integrated into existing policy optimization algorithms without significant architectural modifications, enabling the policy to prioritize learning from more informative experiences and thereby achieve more efficient policy updates. Extensive evaluations across diverse model families and varying data scales demonstrate that ADORA is a robust and efficient framework. It significantly enhances long reasoning in both geometric and mathematical tasks, consistently achieving notable performance gains without requiring sensitive hyperparameter tuning."

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) agents embedded in environments with physics-based interaction face many challenges including reasoning, planning, summarization, and question answering. This problem is exacerbated when a human user wishes to either guide or interact with the agent in natural language. Although the use of Language Models (LMs) is the default choice, as an AI tool, they struggle with tasks involving physics. The LM's capability for physical reasoning is learned from observational data, rather than being grounded in simulation. A common approach is to include simulation traces as context, but this suffers from poor scalability as simulation traces contain larger volumes of fine-grained numerical and semantic data. In this paper, we propose a natural language guided method to discover coarse-grained patterns (e.g., 'rigid-body collision', 'stable support', etc.) from detailed simulation logs. Specifically, we synthesize programs that operate on simulation logs and map them to a series of high level activated patterns. We show, through two physics benchmarks, that this annotated representation of the simulation log is more amenable to natural language reasoning about physical systems. We demonstrate how this method enables LMs to generate effective reward programs from goals specified in natural language, which may be used within the context of planning or supervised learning."

    "abstract": "Building a search relevance model that achieves both low latency and high performance is a long-standing challenge in the search industry. To satisfy the millisecond-level response requirements of online systems while retaining the interpretable reasoning traces of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose a novel \\textbf{Answer-First, Reason Later (AFRL)} paradigm. This paradigm requires the model to output the definitive relevance score in the very first token, followed by a structured logical explanation. Inspired by the success of reasoning models, we adopt a \"Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) + Reinforcement Learning (RL)\" pipeline to achieve AFRL. However, directly applying existing RL training often leads to \\textbf{mode collapse} in the search relevance task, where the model forgets complex long-tail rules in pursuit of high rewards. From an information theory perspective: RL inherently minimizes the \\textbf{Reverse KL divergence}, which tends to seek probability peaks (mode-seeking) and is prone to \"reward hacking.\" On the other hand, SFT minimizes the \\textbf{Forward KL divergence}, forcing the model to cover the data distribution (mode-covering) and effectively anchoring expert rules. Based on this insight, we propose a \\textbf{Mode-Balanced Optimization} strategy, incorporating an SFT auxiliary loss into Stepwise-GRPO training to balance these two properties. Furthermore, we construct an automated instruction evolution system and a multi-stage curriculum to ensure expert-level data quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our 32B teacher model achieves state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, the AFRL architecture enables efficient knowledge distillation, successfully transferring expert-level logic to a 0.6B model, thereby reconciling reasoning depth with deployment latency."

Two pairs of ears, a pair of blowouts in the north and south along the long axis of this SNR, and a pair of dents compose the point symmetric morphology. The fact that the symmetry axes of two pairs include pairs of opposite structural features in the inner ejecta implies that the shaping is by jets and not due to an interaction with an ambient material. While the JJEM predicts such morphologies, the competing neutrino-driven mechanism cannot account for point-symmetric morphologies. This study provides strong support for the claim that the JJEM is the primary CCSN explosion mechanism."

While numerous studies have focused on UAV detection or localization, little attention has been given to delivery events identification. This study presents the first acoustic package delivery detection algorithm using a ground-based microphone array. The proposed method estimates both the drone's propeller speed and the delivery event using solely acoustic features. A deep neural network detects the presence of a drone and estimates the propeller's rotation speed or blade passing frequency (BPF) from a mel spectrogram. The algorithm analyzes the BPFs to identify probable delivery moments based on sudden changes before and after a specific time. Results demonstrate a mean absolute error of the blade passing frequency estimator of 16 Hz when the drone is less than 150 meters away from the microphone array. The drone presence detection estimator has a accuracy of 97%. The delivery detection algorithm correctly identifies 96% of events with a false positive rate of 8%. This study shows that deliveries can be identified using acoustic signals up to a range of 100 meters."

Our framework, Infusion, uses scalable influence-function approximations to compute small perturbations to training documents that induce targeted changes in model behavior through parameter shifts. We evaluate Infusion on data poisoning tasks across vision and language domains. On CIFAR-10, we show that making subtle edits via Infusion to just 0.2% (100/45,000) of the training documents can be competitive with the baseline of inserting a small number of explicit behavior examples. We also find that Infusion transfers across architectures (ResNet $\\leftrightarrow$ CNN), suggesting a single poisoned corpus can affect multiple independently trained models. In preliminary language experiments, we characterize when our approach increases the probability of target behaviors and when it fails, finding it most effective at amplifying behaviors the model has already learned. Taken together, these results show that small, subtle edits to training data can systematically shape model behavior, underscoring the importance of training data interpretability for adversaries and defenders alike.

Effective recognition, reasoning, and editing often require not only forming such compositional representations, but also solving the decomposition problem. One popular choice for constructing these representations is through the binding operation. Resonator networks, which can be understood as coupled Hopfield networks, were proposed as a way to perform decomposition on such bound representations. Recent works have shown notable similarities between Hopfield networks and diffusion models. Motivated by these observations, we introduce a framework for semantic decomposition using coupled inference in diffusion models. Our method frames semantic decomposition as an inverse problem and couples the diffusion processes using a reconstruction-driven guidance term that encourages the composition of factor estimates to match the bound vector. We also introduce a novel iterative sampling scheme that improves the performance of our model. Finally, we show that attention-based resonator networks are a special case of our framework. Empirically, we demonstrate that our coupled inference framework outperforms resonator networks across a range of synthetic semantic decomposition tasks."

From reference reasoning rationales (e.g., physician-authored clinical rationale, clinical guidelines, or outputs from more capable models) and the agent's free-form chain-of-thought (CoT), DRL extracts reasoning graphs as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and performs a clinically weighted graph edit distance (GED)-based discrepancy analysis. An LLM-as-a-judge aligns semantically equivalent nodes and diagnoses discrepancies between graphs. These graph-level discrepancy diagnostics are converted into natural-language instructions and stored in a Differential Reasoning Knowledge Base (DR-KB). At inference, we retrieve top-$k$ instructions via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to augment the agent prompt and patch likely logic gaps. Evaluation on open medical question answering (QA) benchmarks and a Return Visit Admissions (RVA) prediction task from internal clinical data demonstrates gains over baselines, improving both final-answer accuracy and reasoning fidelity. Ablation studies confirm gains from infusing reference reasoning rationales and the top-$k$ retrieval strategy. Clinicians' review of the output provides further assurance of the approach. Together, results suggest that DRL supports more reliable clinical decision-making in complex reasoning scenarios and offers a practical mechanism for deployment under limited token budgets."

Recent efforts leverage Large Language Model (LLM) agents to automate this task, yet existing systems exhibit low detection accuracy even with capable models, and current evaluation frameworks assess only final answer correctness without revealing why the agent's reasoning failed. This paper presents a process level failure analysis of LLM-based RCA agents. We execute the full OpenRCA benchmark across five LLM models, producing 1,675 agent runs, and classify observed failures into 12 pitfall types across intra-agent reasoning, inter-agent communication, and agent-environment interaction. Our analysis reveals that the most prevalent pitfalls, notably hallucinated data interpretation and incomplete exploration, persist across all models regardless of capability tier, indicating that these failures originate from the shared agent architecture rather than from individual model limitations. Controlled mitigation experiments further show that prompt engineering alone cannot resolve the dominant pitfalls, whereas enriching the inter-agent communication protocol reduces communication-related failures by up to 15 percentage points. The pitfall taxonomy and diagnostic methodology developed in this work provide a foundation for designing more reliable autonomous agents for cloud RCA."

Excitation spectra allow us to distinguish the pure Zeeman $g$-factor from orbital contributions to the magnetic field splitting of states despite the strong spin-orbit coupling.

While the dissipative phase diagram of the transverse DIM is only slightly shifted upward compared with its ground-state counterpart, dissipation in the longitudinal DIM stabilizes bistable nonequilibrium steady states and induces first-order phase transitions that are absent in the ground-state phase diagram. This bistable phase is characterized by the coexistence of superradiant and antiferromagnetic orders, and it converts a ground-state triple point into a tetracritical point, at which the boundaries of the first- and second-order transitions intersect. Our results reveal that the interplay among spin interactions, light-matter coupling, and dissipation supports a diverse set of nonequilibrium phase transitions and provides broad tunability of the phase diagram.

    "abstract": "Quantum state preparation is a fundamental component of quantum algorithms, particularly in quantum machine learning and data processing, where classical data must be encoded efficiently into quantum states. Existing amplitude encoding techniques often rely on recursive bipartitions or tensor decompositions, which either lead to deep circuits or lack practical guidance for circuit construction. In this work, we introduce Tucker Iterative Quantum State Preparation (Q-Tucker), a novel method that adaptively constructs shallow, deterministic quantum circuits by exploiting the global entanglement structure of target states. Building upon the Tucker decomposition, our method factors the target quantum state into a core tensor and mode-specific operators, enabling direct decompositions across multiple subsystems."

    "abstract": "College students increasingly use AI chatbots to support academic reading, yet we lack granular understanding of how these interactions shape their reading experience and cognitive engagement. We conducted an eight-week longitudinal study with 15 undergraduates who used AI to support assigned readings in a course. We collected 838 prompts across 239 reading sessions and developed a coding schema categorizing prompts into four cognitive themes: Decoding, Comprehension, Reasoning, and Metacognition. Comprehension prompts dominated (59.6%), with Reasoning (29.8%), Metacognition (8.5%), and Decoding (2.1%) less frequent. Most sessions (72%) contained exactly three prompts, the required minimum of the reading assignment. Within sessions, students showed natural cognitive progression from comprehension toward reasoning, but this progression was truncated. Across eight weeks, students' engagement patterns remained stable, with substantial individual differences persisting throughout. Qualitative analysis revealed an intention-behavior gap: students recognized that effective prompting required effort but rarely applied this knowledge, with efficiency emerging as the primary driver. Students also strategically triaged their engagement based on interest and academic pressures, exhibiting a novel pattern of reading through AI rather than with it: using AI-generated summaries as primary material to filter which sections merited deeper attention. We discuss design implications for AI reading systems that scaffold sustained cognitive engagement."

    "abstract": "The quantum steering ellipsoid (QSE) provides a geometric representation, within the Bloch picture, of all possible states to which one qubit can be steered through measurements performed on another correlated qubit. However, in most realistic settings, quantum systems are inevitably coupled to their surrounding environment, resulting in decoherence and the consequent degradation of the QSE. Here, by investigating how local dissipative environments coupled separately to each qubit affect the steering properties geometrized by the QSE within an exact non-Markovian framework, we find that the geometry of each party's QSE is closely tied to whether a bound state forms in the energy spectrum of the total qubit-environment system. We systematically examine the characteristics of QSEs under three distinct scenarios: two-sided bound states, one-sided bound states, and no bound state, revealing a diverse range of steering types. Our work establishes quantum reservoir engineering as a tunable strategy for protecting and controlling quantum steering in open systems, offering a practical pathway toward robust steering-based quantum technologies."

    "abstract": "We investigate homological and depth-theoretic properties of finitely generated modules of finite projective dimension over Noetherian local rings. A central theme is the study of criteria for freeness and reflexivity derived from the torsion-freeness or reflexivity of tensor products of the form \\( M \\otimes_R M \\) and \\( M \\otimes_R M^* \\). Under mild homological assumptions, we prove that such properties of these tensor products impose strong structural constraints on \\( M \\), often forcing it to be free. These results generalize classical theorems of Auslander beyond the regular case and contribute to the broader understanding of rigidity phenomena in commutative algebra. The second part of the paper is devoted to the dimension and support of Ext-modules, particularly \\( {Ext}^i_R(M, R) \\) for critical values of i, when \\( M \\) has finite projective dimension. We establish sharp bounds on their Krull dimensions, analyze their behavior for prime and equidimensional modules, and relate these findings to the grade conjecture and other homological conjectures. Applications include new cases of a question of Jorgensen, which asks whether \\( {pd}(M) < i \\) whenever \\({Ext}^i_R(M, M) = 0 \\) and M has finite projective dimension over a complete intersection ring. Finally, we examine the projective dimension of prime ideals in rings that fail chain conditions. We show that in non-catenary or pathological saturated chain settings, such prime ideals often have infinite projective dimension."

This notion plays a crucial role in verification, automata theory and synthesis. Casares and Ohlmann recently gave several characterizations of Eve-positionallity of $ω$-regular languages. For this, they introduce the notion $\\varepsilon$-complete parity automaton and show (among other results) that an $ω$-regular language is Eve-positional if and only if it can be recognized by some $\\varepsilon$-completion of a deterministic parity automaton. Colcombet and Idir extended on their work, and obtained a more direct semantic characterization of Eve-positionality. We introduce a new formalism that characterizes the Eve-positional languages, consisting in a restriction of non-deterministic Büchi automata. This allows us to complete a missing implication in Casares and Ohlmann's work. We then use this formalism to describe a determinization procedure for non-deterministic Büchi automaton recognizing such languages, with size blow-up at most factorial. We also show that this construction is, in a suitable sense, optimal."

Existing interfaces are predominantly hand-centric (e.g., VR controllers and joysticks), leaving foot-operated channels underexplored for continuous base control. We present TriPilot-FF, an open-source whole-body teleoperation system for a custom bimanual mobile manipulator that introduces a foot-operated pedal with lidar-driven pedal haptics, coupled with upper-body bimanual leader-follower teleoperation. Using only a low-cost base-mounted lidar, TriPilot-FF renders a resistive pedal cue from proximity-to-obstacle signals in the commanded direction, shaping operator commands toward collision-averse behaviour without an explicit collision-avoidance controller. The system also supports arm-side force reflection for contact awareness and provides real-time force and visual guidance of bimanual manipulability to prompt mobile base repositioning, thereby improving reach. We demonstrate the capability of TriPilot-FF to effectively ``co-pilot'' the human operator over long time-horizons and tasks requiring precise mobile base movement and coordination. Finally, we incorporate teleoperation feedback signals into an Action Chunking with Transformers (ACT) policy and demonstrate improved performance when the additional information is available. We release the pedal device design, full software stack, and conduct extensive real-world evaluations on a bimanual wheeled platform. The project page of TriPilot-FF is http://bit.ly/46H3ZJT."

    "abstract": "Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have emerged as the state-of-the-art backbone for high-fidelity image and video generation. However, their massive computational cost and memory footprint hinder deployment on edge devices. While post-training quantization (PTQ) has proven effective for large language models (LLMs), directly applying existing methods to DiTs yields suboptimal results due to the neglect of the unique temporal dynamics inherent in diffusion processes. In this paper, we propose AdaTSQ, a novel PTQ framework that pushes the Pareto frontier of efficiency and quality by exploiting the temporal sensitivity of DiTs. First, we propose a Pareto-aware timestep-dynamic bit-width allocation strategy. We model the quantization policy search as a constrained pathfinding problem. We utilize a beam search algorithm guided by end-to-end reconstruction error to dynamically assign layer-wise bit-widths across different timesteps. Second, we propose a Fisher-guided temporal calibration mechanism. It leverages temporal Fisher information to prioritize calibration data from highly sensitive timesteps, seamlessly integrating with Hessian-based weight optimization. Extensive experiments on four advanced DiTs (e.g., Flux-Dev, Flux-Schnell, Z-Image, and Wan2.1) demonstrate that AdaTSQ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods like SVDQuant and ViDiT-Q.

In quantum systems, numerous works have demonstrated this phenomenon under both non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and Lindblad evolution. However, despite considerable progress, the physical mechanism behind it has been a subject of debate. In this work, we present a unified framework that explains CSC in any non-Hermitian system, encompassing non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, Lindblad, and hybrid settings. Our framework relies on perturbative, non-adiabatic corrections to adiabatic evolution and consistently predicts CSC with only the lowest-order corrections. We demonstrate its efficacy with models of single and coupled dissipative qubits, obtaining analytical solutions for the conversion fidelity. Our analysis further reveals the role of non-perturbative dynamics, which can be present even in apparently slow trajectories. We show that this property can be utilised to considerably enhance state conversion. Finally, we demonstrate that CSC can be observed in a model without the presence of exceptional points."

    "abstract": "Contrastive learning (CL) is a predominant technique in image classification, but they showed limited performance with an imbalanced dataset. Recently, several supervised CL methods have been proposed to promote an ideal regular simplex geometric configuration in the representation space-characterized by intra-class feature collapse and uniform inter-class mean spacing, especially for imbalanced datasets. In particular, existing prototype-based methods include class prototypes, as additional samples to consider all classes. However, the existing CL methods suffer from two limitations. First, they do not consider the alignment between the class means/prototypes and classifiers, which could lead to poor generalization. Second, existing prototype-based methods treat prototypes as only one additional sample per class, making their influence depend on the number of class instances in a batch and causing unbalanced contributions across classes. To address these limitations, we propose Equilibrium Contrastive Learning (ECL), a supervised CL framework designed to promote geometric equilibrium, where class features, means, and classifiers are harmoniously balanced under data imbalance. The proposed ECL framework uses two main components. First, ECL promotes the representation geometric equilibrium (i.e., a regular simplex geometry characterized by collapsed class samples and uniformly distributed class means), while balancing the contributions of class-average features and class prototypes. Second, ECL establishes a classifier-class center geometric equilibrium by aligning classifier weights and class prototypes. We ran experiments with three long-tailed datasets, the CIFAR-10(0)-LT, ImageNet-LT, and the two imbalanced medical datasets, the ISIC 2019 and our constructed LCCT dataset. Results show that ECL outperforms existing SOTA supervised CL methods designed for imbalanced classification."

    "abstract": "Increasing penetration of inverter-based resources, flexible loads, and rapidly changing operating conditions make higher-order $N\\!-\\!k$ contingency assessment increasingly important but computationally prohibitive. Exhaustive evaluation of all outage combinations using AC power-flow or ACOPF is infeasible in routine operation. This fact forces operators to rely on heuristic screening methods whose ability to consistently retain all critical contingencies is not formally established. This paper proposes a scalable, state-aware contingency inference framework designed to directly generate high-impact $N\\!-\\!k$ outage scenarios without enumerating the combinatorial contingency space. The framework employs a conditional diffusion model to produce candidate contingencies tailored to the current operating state, while a topology-aware graph neural network trained only on base and $N\\!-\\!1$ cases efficiently constructs high-risk training samples offline. Finally, the framework is developed to provide controllable coverage guarantees for severe contingencies, allowing operators to explicitly manage the risk of missing critical events under limited AC power-flow evaluation budgets. Experiments on IEEE benchmark systems show that, for a given evaluation budget, the proposed approach consistently evaluates higher-severity contingencies than uniform sampling. This allows critical outages to be identified more reliably with reduced computational effort."

While Attention-FFN Disaggregation (AFD) has emerged as a potential architecture to decouple compute and memory resources, its performance boundaries compared to standard large-scale Expert Parallelism (EP) remain underexplored. In this paper, we conduct a systematic analysis of AFD by extending the roofline model to the communication level, correlating interconnect bandwidth, arithmetic intensity, and Hardware FLOPS Utilization (HFU). Our analysis reveals a dead zone on standard clusters: increasing FFN instance count fails to improve HFU as computational workload is capped by scale-out bandwidth, causing operator active time to shrink relative to the fixed latency budget. We further show that AFD's discrete node-level scaling incurs higher imbalance penalties than EP's continuous batch adjustment. Nevertheless, these limitations diminish under specific conditions: Superpod-class hardware with abundant interconnect bandwidth and models with coarse-grained experts and lower sparsity are more likely to benefit from AFD. These findings position AFD as a promising approach for specific hardware-model combinations rather than a universal solution."

However, real-world videos typically contain long sequences with irregular camera trajectories and unknown poses, leading to pose drift, feature misalignment, and geometric distortion during reconstruction. Moreover, lossy compression amplifies these issues by introducing inconsistencies that gradually degrade geometry and rendering quality. While recent studies have addressed either long-sequence NVS or unposed reconstruction, compression-aware approaches still focus on specific artifacts or limited scenarios, leaving diverse compression patterns in long videos insufficiently explored. In this paper, we propose CompSplat, a compression-aware training framework that explicitly models frame-wise compression characteristics to mitigate inter-frame inconsistency and accumulated geometric errors. CompSplat incorporates compression-aware frame weighting and an adaptive pruning strategy to enhance robustness and geometric consistency, particularly under heavy compression. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks, including Tanks and Temples, Free, and Hike, demonstrate that CompSplat achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and pose accuracy, significantly surpassing most recent state-of-the-art NVS approaches under severe compression conditions."

Yet some tests suffer from flakiness, where their outcomes vary non-deterministically. Flakiness erodes developer trust in test results, wastes computational resources, and undermines CI reliability. While prior research has examined test flakiness within individual projects, its broader ecosystem-wide impact remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present an empirical study of test flakiness in the OpenStack ecosystem, which focuses on (1) cross-project flakiness, where flaky tests impact multiple projects, and (2) inconsistent flakiness, where a test exhibits flakiness in some projects but remains stable in others. By analyzing 649 OpenStack projects, we identify 1,535 cross-project flaky tests and 1,105 inconsistently flaky tests. We find that cross-project flakiness affects 55% of OpenStack projects and significantly increases both review time and computational costs. Surprisingly, 70% of unit tests exhibit cross-project flakiness, challenging the assumption that unit tests are inherently insulated from issues that span modules like integration and system-level tests. Through qualitative analysis, we observe that race conditions in CI, inconsistent build configurations, and dependency mismatches are the primary causes of inconsistent flakiness. These findings underline the need for better coordination across complex ecosystems, standardized CI configurations, and improved test isolation strategies."

The resulting model exhibits a counter-intuitive phenomenon: despite symmetric in-group preferences, the system undergoes a tipping transition at a critical preference level, beyond which one agent type dominates. We characterize this asymmetric phase transition in details using mean-field analysis, numerical simulations and finite size scaling methods.

Our key insight is that although actions are unobserved, their semantic effects are observable and can serve as a shared reference. We introduce Seq$Δ$-REPA, a sequence-level control-effect alignment objective that anchors integrated latent action to temporal feature differences from a frozen, self-supervised video encoder. Building on this, we present Olaf-World, a pipeline that pretrains action-conditioned video world models from large-scale passive video. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method learns a more structured latent action space, leading to stronger zero-shot action transfer and more data-efficient adaptation to new control interfaces than state-of-the-art baselines."

However, standard diffusion transformers fail to converge on these representations directly. While recent work attributes this to a capacity bottleneck proposing computationally expensive width scaling of diffusion transformers we demonstrate that the failure is fundamentally geometric. We identify Geometric Interference as the root cause: standard Euclidean flow matching forces probability paths through the low-density interior of the hyperspherical feature space of representation encoders, rather than following the manifold surface. To resolve this, we propose Riemannian Flow Matching with Jacobi Regularization (RJF). By constraining the generative process to the manifold geodesics and correcting for curvature-induced error propagation, RJF enables standard Diffusion Transformer architectures to converge without width scaling. Our method RJF enables the standard DiT-B architecture (131M parameters) to converge effectively, achieving an FID of 3.37 where prior methods fail to converge. Code: https://github.com/amandpkr/RJF"

    "abstract": "Recent advances in large language model (LLM) have empowered autonomous agents to perform complex tasks that require multi-turn interactions with tools and environments. However, scaling such agent training is limited by the lack of diverse and reliable environments. In this paper, we propose Agent World Model (AWM), a fully synthetic environment generation pipeline. Using this pipeline, we scale to 1,000 environments covering everyday scenarios, in which agents can interact with rich toolsets (35 tools per environment on average) and obtain high-quality observations. Notably, these environments are code-driven and backed by databases, providing more reliable and consistent state transitions than environments simulated by LLMs. Moreover, they enable more efficient agent interaction compared with collecting trajectories from realistic environments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this resource, we perform large-scale reinforcement learning for multi-turn tool-use agents. Thanks to the fully executable environments and accessible database states, we can also design reliable reward functions. Experiments on three benchmarks show that training exclusively in synthetic environments, rather than benchmark-specific ones, yields strong out-of-distribution generalization.

Specifically, we derive universal interpolation formulas for the total energy emitted in gravitational waves out to infinity and down the event horizon of the large black hole, valid to leading order in the small mass ratio. We test our formulas using numerical results from direct calculations in black hole perturbation theory. The central idea of our approach is to utilize as a strong-field diagnostic the known form of divergence in the radiated energy along geodesics near the parameter-space separatrix between scattering and plunge. The dominant, logarithmic term of this divergence can be expressed in terms of instantaneous energy fluxes calculated along the unstable circular geodesics that form the separatrix, fluxes that we obtain using interpolation of highly accurate numerical data. The same idea could be applied to bound-orbit radiative observables via either unbound-to-bound mapping or a direct resummation of bound-orbit post-Newtonian expressions."

    "abstract": "In enzymatic recycling or biodegradation of semi-crystalline plastic waste, crystalline spherulites embedded into an amorphous matrix hinder and slow down depolymerisation. When the enzymatic depolymerisation temperature exceeds the glass transition temperature, these spherulites tend to grow. The depolymerisation process is thus controlled by a competition between erosion of the amorphous matrix from the particle surface and the growth of recalcitrant spherulites within the particle bulk and at its surface. We present a geometric model that captures this competition, together with an algorithm to solve the equations numerically. Our algorithm introduces a new extension of Voronoi/Delaunay tessellation in space. We extract the parameters for the model from experimental data on the enzymatic depolymerization by hydrolase LCC-ICCG of PET bottle flakes and textile waste, in order to make a prediction of the observed degradation yield as a function of time. Both the final yield and the degradation kinetics are correctly predicted. Most importantly, the model clarifies how and to which extent nucleating agents, impurities, additives, and/or rapid crystal growth present in the waste can undermine pretreatment efforts aiming to initiate depolymerisation from a material with a low initial crystallinity."

    "abstract": "Mixing by hydrodynamical instabilities plays a key role in cloud-wind interactions, causing cloud destruction in the adiabatic limit and facilitating cloud survival with efficient radiative cooling. However, the rate of mixing in numerical simulations is sensitive to the smallest resolved scale, and the relationship between resolution and cloud evolution is under-explored. Using a set of cloud-crushing simulations, we investigate the effects of numerical resolution on cloud survival and acceleration. Modeling both adiabatic and radiative cases, in a subsonic and supersonic wind, we find that cloud survival and velocity does depend on the numerical resolution, however, no single resolution requirement can be applied to all scenarios. In the radiative subsonic case, we find that mass growth and acceleration appear converged at only 4 cells per cloud radius. Conversely, in the supersonic regime, we see a clear dependence of cloud destruction and velocity on resolution that is not converged even at 48 cells per cloud radius, implying that accurately capturing cloud destruction may require higher resolution than capturing growth. We also present a simple model illustrating how ram pressure accelerates cool clouds at early times before mixing kicks in as an acceleration mechanism."

However, existing GPU-based solutions remain inefficient, as they typically rely on a single, fixed queue design that incurs severe synchronization overhead, high memory latency, and poor adaptivity to diverse inputs. To address these inefficiencies, we propose MultiLevelMultiQueue (MLMQ), a novel data structure that distributes multiple queues across the GPU's multi-level parallelism and memory hierarchy. To realize MLMQ, we introduce a cache-like collaboration mechanism for efficient inter-queue coordination, and develop a modular queue design based on unified Read and Write primitives. Within this framework, we expand the optimization space by designing a set of GPU-friendly queues, composing them across multiple levels, and further providing an input-adaptive MLMQ configuration scheme. Our MLMQ design achieves average speedups of 1.87x to 17.13x over state-of-the-art implementations. Our code is open-sourced at https://github.com/Leo9660/MLMQ.git."

This paper presents a structured review of deep learning methods for EPF in day-ahead, intraday, and balancing markets. Specifically, We introduce a unified taxonomy that decomposes deep learning models into backbone, head, and loss components, providing a consistent evaluation perspective across studies. Using this framework, we analyze recent trends in deep learning components across markets. Our study highlights the shift toward probabilistic, microstructure-centric, and market-aware designs. We further identify key gaps in the literature, including limited attention to intraday and balancing markets and the need for market-specific modeling strategies, thereby helping to consolidate and advance existing review studies."

From these data, we study ~140 million galaxies (8.29 galaxies/arcmin$^2$) that are 50% complete at i=24.0 and extend beyond z=1.2. We divide the galaxies into four redshift bins, and obtain cosmic shear measurement with a signal-to-noise of 83, a factor of 2 higher than the Year 3 analysis. We model the uncertainties due to shear and redshift calibrations, and discard measurements on small angular scales to mitigate baryon feedback and other small-scale uncertainties. We consider two fiducial models to account for the intrinsic alignment (IA) of the galaxies. We conduct a blind analysis in the context of the $Λ$CDM model and find $S_8 \\equiv σ_8(Ω_m/0.3)^{0.5}=0.798^{+0.014}_{-0.015}$ (marginalized mean with 68% CL) when using the non-linear alignment model (NLA) and $S_{8} = 0.783^{+0.019}_{-0.015}$ with the tidal alignment and tidal torque model (TATT), providing 1.8% and 2.5% uncertainty on $S_8$. Compared to constraints from the cosmic microwave background from Planck 2018, ACT DR6 and SPT-3G DR1, we find consistency in the full parameter space at 1.1$σ$ (1.7$σ$) and in $S_8$ at 2.0$σ$ (2.3$σ$) for NLA (TATT). The result using the NLA model is preferred according to the Bayesian evidence. We find that the model choice for IA and baryon feedback can impact the value of our $S_8$ constraint up to $1σ$. For our fiducial model choices, the resultant uncertainties in $S_8$ are primarily degraded by the removal of scales, as well as the marginalization over the IA parameters. We demonstrate that our result is internally consistent and robust to different choices in calibrating the data, owing to methodological improvements in shear and redshift measurement, laying the foundation for next-generation cosmic shear programs."

    "abstract": "Human problem-solving is never the repetition of a single mindset, by which we mean a distinct mode of cognitive processing. When tackling a specific task, we do not rely on a single mindset; instead, we integrate multiple mindsets within the single solution process. However, existing LLM reasoning methods fall into a common trap: they apply the same fixed mindset across all steps, overlooking that different stages of solving the same problem require fundamentally different mindsets. This single-minded assumption prevents models from reaching the next level of intelligence. To address this limitation, we propose Chain of Mindset (CoM), a training-free agentic framework that enables step-level adaptive mindset orchestration. CoM decomposes reasoning into four functionally heterogeneous mindsets: Spatial, Convergent, Divergent, and Algorithmic. A Meta-Agent dynamically selects the optimal mindset based on the evolving reasoning state, while a bidirectional Context Gate filters cross-module information flow to maintain effectiveness and efficiency. Experiments across six challenging benchmarks spanning mathematics, code generation, scientific QA, and spatial reasoning demonstrate that CoM achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the strongest baseline by 4.96\\% and 4.72\\% in overall accuracy on Qwen3-VL-32B-Instruct and Gemini-2.0-Flash, while balancing reasoning efficiency.

We propose the Vendi Novelty Score (VNS), an OOD detector based on the Vendi Scores (VS), a family of similarity-based diversity metrics. VNS quantifies how much a test sample increases the VS of the in-distribution feature set, providing a principled notion of novelty that does not require density modeling. VNS is linear-time, non-parametric, and naturally combines class-conditional (local) and dataset-level (global) novelty signals. Across multiple image classification benchmarks and network architectures, VNS achieves state-of-the-art OOD detection performance. Remarkably, VNS retains this performance when computed using only 1% of the training data, enabling deployment in memory- or access-constrained settings."

We introduce the ``Connected Minds'' model, which unifies these frameworks by integrating iterative reasoning with a parameterized network bias. We posit that agents do not observe the global population; rather, they observe a sample biased by their network position, governed by a locality parameter $p$ representing algorithmic ranking, social homophily, or information disclosure. We show that this parameter acts as a continuous bridge: the model collapses to the myopic Level-$k$ recursion as networks become opaque ($p \\to 0$) and recovers the standard Cognitive Hierarchy model under full transparency ($p=1$). Theoretically, we establish that network opacity induces a \\emph{Sophisticated Bias}, causing agents to systematically overestimate the cognitive depth of their opponents while preserving the log-concavity of belief distributions. This makes $p$ an actionable lever: a planner or platform can tune transparency -- globally or by segment (a personalized $p_k$) -- to shape equilibrium behavior. From a mechanism design perspective, we derive the \\emph{Escalation Principle}: in games of strategic complements, restricting information can maximize aggregate effort by trapping agents in echo chambers where they compete against hallucinated, high-sophistication peers. Conversely, we identify a \\emph{Transparency Reversal} for coordination games, where maximizing network visibility is required to minimize variance and stabilize outcomes. Our results suggest that network topology functions as a cognitive zoom lens, determining whether agents behave as local imitators or global optimizers."

We consider a host spacecraft that dispenses a small CubeSat, which acts as a test-mass. Both spacecraft perform approach maneuvers to target their flyby locations, with the host targeting a close proximity flyby and the CubeSat targeting a distant flyby. By incorporating short-range intersatellite measurements between the host and the CubeSat, the mass measurement sensitivity is substantially improved. We evaluate a set of proposed host and CubeSat hardware options against the 2023 and 2025 Planetary Defense Conference hypothetical threats, as well as a hypothetical flyby of 2024 YR4. These scenarios differ predominantly in their flyby speeds, which span from 1.7 to 22 km/s. Based on these scenarios, we demonstrate that a typical radio-frequency intersatellite measurement is ineffective for asteroids with diameters relevant to planetary defense (i.e., 50 - 500 m). However, we find that augmenting the system with a laser-based intersatellite ranging system or a high-precision Doppler system can enable mass measurements of asteroids as small as 100 m across all cases, and as small as 50 m for the slower (< 8 km/s) cases. The results are very sensitive to the timing of the final maneuver, which is used to target the low-altitude flyby point. This presents an operational challenge for the smallest objects, where optical detection times are comparatively late and the optical navigation targeting knowledge converges too slowly."

Our approach integrates LiDAR-based environment mapping directly into the MPC using online Euclidean distance fields (EDF), enabling real-time environmental adaptation. The controller simultaneously enforces collision constraints while damping payload sway, allowing it to (i) replan upon quasi-static environmental changes, (ii) maintain collision-free operation under disturbances, and (iii) provide safe stopping when no bypass exists. Experimental validation on a real forestry crane demonstrates effective sway damping and successful obstacle avoidance. A video can be found at https://youtu.be/tEXDoeLLTxA."

Data warehouses commonly partition large tables and store row group statistics for them to accelerate searches and joins, rather than maintaining indexes. AkNN joins can benefit from such statistics by constructing bounds and localizing join evaluations to a few partitions before loading them to build spatial indexes. Existing pruning methods are overly conservative for bounds-only spatial data because they do not fully capture its directional semantics, thereby missing opportunities to skip unneeded partitions at the earliest stages of a join. We propose a three-bound proximity test to determine whether all points within a partition have a closer neighbor in one partition than in another, potentially occluded partition. We show that our algorithm is both optimal and efficient."

A crude comparison of the primary endpoint without covariate adjustment will suffer from biases, and the addition of regression models could improve precision by incorporating imbalanced covariates and thus help make correct inference. Desirability of outcome ranking (DOOR) is a patient-centric benefit-risk evaluation methodology designed for randomized clinical trials. Still, robust covariate adjustment methods could further expand the compatibility of this method in observational studies. In DOOR analysis, each participant's outcome is ranked based on pre-specified clinical criteria, where the most desirable rank represents a good outcome with no side effects and the least desirable rank is the worst possible clinical outcome. We develop a causal framework for estimating the population-level DOOR probability, via the inverse probability of treatment weighting method, G-Computation method, and a Doubly Robust method that combines both. The performance of the proposed methodologies is examined through simulations.

    "abstract": "Lane changing in dense traffic is a significant challenge for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). Existing lane change controllers primarily either ensure safety or collaboratively improve traffic efficiency, but do not consider these conflicting objectives together. To address this, we propose the Multi-Agent Safety Shield (MASS), designed using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to enable safe and collaborative lane changes. The MASS enables collaboration by capturing multi-agent interactions among CAVs through interaction topologies constructed as a graph using a simple algorithm. Further, a state-of-the-art Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) lane change controller is extended by integrating MASS to ensure safety and defining a customised reward function to prioritise efficiency improvements. As a result, we propose a lane change controller, known as MARL-MASS, and evaluate it in a congested on-ramp merging simulation. The results demonstrate that MASS enables collaborative lane changes with safety guarantees by strictly respecting the safety constraints. Moreover, the proposed custom reward function improves the stability of MARL policies trained with a safety shield. Overall, by encouraging the exploration of a collaborative lane change policy while respecting safety constraints, MARL-MASS effectively balances the trade-off between ensuring safety and improving traffic efficiency in congested traffic.

Exploiting this high grapheme-phoneme transparency, we propose ViSpeechFormer (\\textbf{Vi}etnamese \\textbf{Speech} Trans\\textbf{Former}), a phoneme-based approach for Vietnamese Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Vietnamese ASR framework that explicitly models phonemic representations. Experiments on two publicly available Vietnamese ASR datasets show that ViSpeechFormer achieves strong performance, generalizes better to out-of-vocabulary words, and is less affected by training bias. This phoneme-based paradigm is also promising for other languages with phonetic orthographies. The code will be released upon acceptance of this paper."

However, many proposed methods entangle implementation-level improvements with fundamental algorithmic modifications or trade performance for fidelity, leading to a fragmented research landscape that complicates fair comparison. In this work, we consolidate and evaluate the most effective and broadly applicable strategies from prior 3DGS research and augment them with several novel optimizations. We further investigate underexplored aspects of the framework, including numerical stability, Gaussian truncation, and gradient approximation. The resulting system, Faster-GS, provides a rigorously optimized algorithm that we evaluate across a comprehensive suite of benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that Faster-GS achieves up to 5$\\times$ faster training while maintaining visual quality, establishing a new cost-effective and resource efficient baseline for 3DGS optimization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that optimizations can be applied to 4D Gaussian reconstruction, leading to efficient non-rigid scene optimization."

Yet, the effects of popularity feedback on collective creativity remain poorly understood. We investigate how popularity ratings influence cultural dynamics in a large-scale online experiment where participants ($N = 1\\,008$) iteratively \\textit{select} images from evolving markets and \\textit{produce} their own modifications. Results show that exposing the popularity of images reduces cultural diversity and slows innovation, delaying aesthetic improvements. These findings are mediated by alterations of both selection and creation. During selection, popularity information triggers cumulative advantage, with participants preferentially building upon popular images, reducing diversity. During creation, participants make less disruptive changes, and are more likely to expand existing visual patterns. Feedback loops in cultural markets thus not only shape selection, but also, directly or indirectly, the form and direction of cultural innovation."

    "abstract": "Outer-approximation-based branch-and-bound is a common algorithmic framework for solving MINLPs (mixed-integer nonlinear programs) to global optimality, with branching variable selection critically influencing overall performance. In modern global MINLP solvers, it is unclear whether branching on fractional integer variables should be prioritized over spatial branching on variables, potentially continuous, that show constraint violations, with different solvers following different defaults. We address this question using a data-driven approach. Based on a test set of hundreds of heterogeneous public and industrial MINLP instances, we train linear and random forest regression models to predict the relative speedup of the FICO(R) Xpress Global solver when using a branching rule that always prioritizes variables with violated integralities versus a mixed rule, allowing for early spatial branches. We introduce a practical evaluation methodology that measures the effect of the learned model directly in terms of the shifted geometric mean runtime. Using only four features derived from strong branching and the nonlinear structure, our linear regression model achieves an 8-9% reduction in geometric-mean solving time for the Xpress solver, with over 10% improvement on hard instances. We also analyze a random regression forest model. Experiments across solver versions show that a model trained on Xpress 9.6 still yields significant improvements on Xpress 9.8 without retraining. Our results demonstrate how regression models can successfully guide the branching-rule selection and improve the performance of a state-of-the-art commercial MINLP solver."

    "abstract": "In the era of 6G Air-Ground Integrated Networks (AGINs), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are pivotal for providing on-demand wireless coverage in mission-critical environments, such as post-disaster rescue operations. However, traditional Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approaches for multi-UAV orchestration often face critical challenges: instability due to the non-stationarity of multi-agent environments and the difficulty of balancing energy efficiency with service equity. To address these issues, this paper proposes ORCHID (Orchestration of Resilient Coverage via Hybrid Intelligent Deployment), a novel stability-enhanced two-stage learning framework. First, ORCHID leverages a GBS-aware topology partitioning strategy to mitigate the exploration cold-start problem. Second, we introduce a Reset-and-Finetune (R\\&F) mechanism within the MAPPO architecture that stabilizes the learning process via synchronized learning rate decay and optimizer state resetting. This mechanism effectively suppresses gradient variance to prevent policy degradation, thereby ensuring algorithmic resilience in dynamic environments. Furthermore, we uncover a counter-intuitive efficiency-fairness synergy: contrary to the conventional trade-off, our results demonstrate that the proposed Max-Min Fairness (MMF) design not only guarantees service for cell-edge users but also achieves superior energy efficiency compared to Proportional Fairness (PF), which tends to converge to suboptimal greedy equilibria. Extensive experiments confirm that ORCHID occupies a superior Pareto-dominant position compared to state-of-the-art baselines, ensuring robust convergence and resilient connectivity in mission-critical scenarios."

    "abstract": "As autonomous vehicles are rolled out, measures must be taken to ensure their safe operation. In order to supervise a system that is already in operation, monitoring frameworks are frequently employed. These run continuously online in the background, supervising the system status and recording anomalies. This work proposes an online monitoring framework to detect anomalies in object state representations. Thereby, a key challenge is creating a framework for anomaly detection without anomaly labels, which are usually unavailable for unknown anomalies. To address this issue, this work applies a self-supervised embedding method to translate object data into a latent representation space. For this, a JEPA-based self-supervised prediction task is constructed, allowing training without anomaly labels and the creation of rich object embeddings. The resulting expressive JEPA embeddings serve as input for established anomaly detection methods, in order to identify anomalies within object state representations. This framework is particularly useful for applications in real-world environments, where new or unknown anomalies may occur during operation for which there are no labels available. Experiments performed on the publicly available, real-world nuScenes dataset illustrate the framework's capabilities."

We provide the first systematic study of the parameterized complexity of recognizing geometric 1-planar graphs. By substantially extending a technique of Bannister, Cabello, and Eppstein, combined with Thomassen's characterization of 1-planar embeddings that can be straightened, we show that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by treedepth. Furthermore, we obtain a kernel for Geometric 1-Planarity parameterized by the feedback edge number $\\ell$. As a by-product, we improve the best known kernel size of $O((3\\ell)!)$ for 1-Planarity and $k$-Planarity under the same parameterization to $O(\\ell \\cdot 8^{\\ell})$. Our approach naturally extends to Geometric $k$-Planarity, yielding a kernelization under the same parameterization, albeit with a larger kernel. Complementing these results, we provide matching lower bounds: Geometric 1-Planarity remains \\NP-complete even for graphs of bounded pathwidth, bounded feedback vertex number, and bounded bandwidth."

Meanwhile, recent attempts to inject reasoning into VLM-based agents improve success rates but incur substantial computational overhead. To address both the ineffectiveness and inefficiency of existing approaches, we introduce Hydra-Nav, a unified VLM architecture that adaptively switches between a deliberative slow system for analyzing exploration history and formulating high-level plans, and a reactive fast system for efficient execution. We train Hydra-Nav through a three-stage curriculum: (i) spatial-action alignment to strengthen trajectory planning, (ii) memory-reasoning integration to enhance temporal-spatial reasoning over long-horizon exploration, and (iii) iterative rejection fine-tuning to enable selective reasoning at critical decision points. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Hydra-Nav achieves state-of-the-art performance on the HM3D, MP3D, and OVON benchmarks, outperforming the second-best methods by 11.1%, 17.4%, and 21.2%, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce SOT (Success weighted by Operation Time), a new metric to measure search efficiency across VLMs with varying reasoning intensity. Results show that adaptive reasoning significantly enhances search efficiency over fixed-frequency baselines."

    "abstract": "We study a monopolistic insurance market with hidden information, where the agent's type $θ$ is private information that is unobservable to the insurer, and it is drawn from a continuum of types. The hidden type affects both the loss distribution and the risk attitude of the agent. Within this framework, we show that a menu of contracts is incentive efficient if and only if it maximizes social welfare, subject to incentive compatibility and individual rationality constraints. This equivalence holds for general concave utility functionals. In the special case of Yaari Dual Utility, we provide a semi-explicit characterization of optimal incentive-efficient menus of contracts. We do this under two different settings: (i) the first assumes that types are ordered in a way such that larger values of $θ$ correspond to more risk-averse types who face stochastically larger losses; whereas (ii) the second assumes that larger values of $θ$ correspond to less risk-averse types who face stochastically larger losses. In both settings, the structure of optimal incentive-efficient menus of contracts depends on the level of the social welfare weight. Moreover, at the optimum, higher types receive greater coverage in exchange for higher premia. Additionally, optimal menus leave the lowest type indifferent, with the insurer absorbing all surplus from the lowest type; and they exhibit efficiency at the top, that is, the highest type receives full coverage."

Exploiting the equivariance of this problem under the orthogonal group $\\mathcal{O}_d$, we obtain a sharp harmonic-analytic characterization of the learning complexity for MIMs with spherically symmetric inputs -- which refines and generalizes previous Gaussian-specific analyses. Specifically, we derive statistical and computational complexity lower bounds within the Statistical Query (SQ) and Low-Degree Polynomial (LDP) frameworks. These bounds decompose naturally across spherical harmonic subspaces. Guided by this decomposition, we construct a family of spectral algorithms based on harmonic tensor unfolding that sequentially recover the latent directions and (nearly) achieve these SQ and LDP lower bounds. Depending on the choice of harmonic degree sequence, these estimators can realize a broad range of trade-offs between sample and runtime complexity. From a technical standpoint, our results build on the semisimple decomposition of the $\\mathcal{O}_d$-action on $L^2 (\\mathbb{S}^{d-1})$ and the intertwining isomorphism between spherical harmonics and traceless symmetric tensors."

While blood vessels visible during endoscopy offer a patient-specific \"vascular fingerprint\" for navigation, automated segmentation is challenged by imperfect endoscopic data, including sparse labels, artifacts like bubbles or variable lighting, continuous deformation, and mucosal folds that mimic vessels. State-of-the-art vessel segmentation methods often fail to address these domain-specific complexities. We introduce a Hybrid Attention-Convolution (HAC) architecture that combines Transformers to capture global vessel topology prior with a CNN that learns a residual refinement map to precisely recover thin-vessel details. To prioritize structural connectivity, the Transformer is trained on optimized ground truth data that exclude short and terminal branches. Furthermore, to address data scarcity, we employ a physics-aware pretraining, that is a self-supervised strategy using clinically grounded augmentations on unlabeled data. Evaluated on the BlaVeS dataset, consisting of endoscopic video frames, our approach achieves high accuracy (0.94) and superior precision (0.61) and clDice (0.66) compared to state-of-the-art medical segmentation models. Crucially, our method successfully suppresses false positives from mucosal folds that dynamically appear and vanish as the bladder fills and empties during surgery. Hence, HAC provides the reliable structural stability required for clinical navigation."

We show that this creates a negative feedback loop, which we call \\textit{Increasing Gap Dynamics} (IGD): when a server is assigned a spatial gap forms, which is more likely to attract new users that further widen the gap. The simplest version of our model is a one-dimensional circle, for which we derive analytical results showing that the system converges to an inefficient equilibrium, worse than both balanced and fully random distributions of servers. We prove that an optimal assignment policy always matches the user to one of its two neighbouring servers so that long gaps tend to widen. Hence, the IGD persists even when assigning optimally rather than greedily. In two dimensions, the appearance of the IGD is illustrated through simulations on a square region. Finally, simulations of a proper ride-hailing system using real data from Manhattan confirms that the IGD arises and that it is responsible for the appearance of the well-known Wild Goose Chase."

A primary bottleneck is the conversion of PQC reference codes from C to high-level synthesis (HLS) specifications, which requires extensive manual refactoring [1]-[3]. Another bottleneck is the scalability of synthesis for complex PQC primitives, including number theoretic transform (NTT) accelerators and wide memory interfaces. While large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable results for coding in general-purpose languages like Python, coding for hardware design is more challenging; feedback-driven and agentic integration are key principles of successful state-of-the-art approaches. Here, we propose LLM4PQC, an LLM-based agentic framework that refactors high-level PQC specifications and reference C codes into HLS-ready and synthesizable C code. Our framework generates and verifies the resulting RTL code. For correctness, we leverage a hierarchy of checks, covering fast C compilation and simulation as well as RTL simulation. Case studies on NIST PQC reference designs demonstrate a reduction in manual effort and accelerated design-space exploration compared to traditional flows. Overall, LLM4PQC provides a powerful and efficient pathway for synthesizing complex hardware accelerators."

Mind wandering and disengagement can be detrimental to learning outcomes, making their automated detection via video-based indicators a promising approach for real-time learner support. However, machine learning-based approaches often require sharing sensitive data, raising privacy concerns. Federated learning offers a privacy-preserving alternative by enabling decentralized model training while also distributing computational load. We propose a framework exploiting cross-device federated learning to address different manifestations of behavioral and cognitive disengagement during remote learning, specifically behavioral disengagement, mind wandering, and boredom. We fit video-based cognitive disengagement detection models using facial expressions and gaze features. By adopting federated learning, we safeguard users' data privacy through privacy-by-design and introduce a novel solution with the potential for real-time learner support. We further address challenges posed by eyeglasses by incorporating related features, enhancing overall model performance. To validate the performance of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on five datasets and benchmark multiple federated learning algorithms. Our results show great promise for privacy-preserving educational technologies promoting learner engagement."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a quantum generalization of the multinomial distribution for the transition probabilities of $m$ identical photons in a $k$-port linear optical interferometer: two multinomial coefficients (one for the input configuration, one for the output) times the squared modulus of a coherent sum over routing matrices, weighted by the multivariate hypergeometric distribution; no Hilbert space formalism is needed to state or evaluate it. The classical multinomial is recovered when all photons enter through a single port, the coherent sum degenerating to a single term with no interference; the quantum family is not a generalization in the Askey sense but a parallel family that departs from classical statistics through the coherence of the amplitude summation. The $r$-th factorial moment carries a squared multinomial coefficient in place of the classical single one, the extra factor arising from the two copies of the amplitude expansion whose indices the Fock state forces to agree; for the beam splitter, the third cumulant is invariant under bosonic interference and the quantum departure first appears in the fourth cumulant as negative excess kurtosis; for multiport interferometers, however, three-body interference breaks this invariance and the departure enters already at the third cumulant. Cross-mode covariances involve the phases of the scattering matrix through coherence terms that strengthen output anti-correlations beyond the classical value; together with the squared-coefficient signature in the single-mode moments, these provide low-order statistical witnesses for boson sampling verification without requiring the full permanent computation."

    "abstract": "Music stem generation, the task of producing musically-synchronized and isolated instrument audio clips, offers the potential of greater user control and better alignment with musician workflows compared to conventional text-to-music models. Existing stem generation approaches, however, either rely on fixed architectures that output a predefined set of stems in parallel, or generate only one stem at a time, resulting in slow inference despite flexibility in stem combination. We propose Stemphonic, a diffusion-/flow-based framework that overcomes this trade-off and generates a variable set of synchronized stems in one inference pass. During training, we treat each stem as a batch element, group synchronized stems in a batch, and apply a shared noise latent to each group. At inference-time, we use a shared initial noise latent and stem-specific text inputs to generate synchronized multi-stem outputs in one pass. We further expand our approach to enable one-pass conditional multi-stem generation and stem-wise activity controls to empower users to iteratively generate and orchestrate the temporal layering of a mix. We benchmark our results on multiple open-source stem evaluation sets and show that Stemphonic produces higher-quality outputs while accelerating the full mix generation process by 25 to 50%.

As an application, we introduce a higher version of the van Est map and prove a van Est isomorphism theorem in cohomology, under natural connectivity assumptions. Finally, we identify the algebraic mechanism underlying geometric differentiation as a monoidal refinement of the dual Dold-Kan correspondence, providing a conceptual explanation of the construction and relating it to earlier homotopical and functor-of-points approaches."

    "abstract": "Feature Engineering (FE) is pivotal in automated machine learning (AutoML) but remains a bottleneck for traditional methods, which treat it as a black-box search, operating within rigid, predefined search spaces and lacking domain awareness. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative by leveraging semantic reasoning to generate unbounded operators, existing methods fail to construct free-form FE pipelines, remaining confined to isolated subtasks such as feature generation. Most importantly, they are rarely optimized jointly with hyperparameter optimization (HPO) of the ML model, leading to greedy \"FE-then-HPO\" workflows that cannot capture strong FE-HPO interactions. In this paper, we present CoFEH, a collaborative framework that interleaves LLM-based FE and Bayesian HPO for robust end-to-end AutoML. CoFEH uses an LLM-driven FE optimizer powered by Tree of Thought (ToT) to explore flexible FE pipelines, a Bayesian optimization (BO) module to solve HPO, and a dynamic optimizer selector that realizes interleaved optimization by adaptively scheduling FE and HPO steps. Crucially, we introduce a mutual conditioning mechanism that shares context between LLM and BO, enabling mutually informed decisions. Experiments show that CoFEH not only outperforms traditional and LLM-based FE baselines, but also achieves superior end-to-end performance under joint optimization."

Second, we review recent robust signal processing solutions for WSC that address model mismatch, data scarcity, adversarial perturbation, and distributional shift. Specific applications include robust ranging-based localization, modality sensing, channel estimation, receive combining, waveform design, and federated learning.

Extending this paradigm to multimodal data requires a shared, discrete representation across modalities. However, most vision-language models (VLMs) still rely on a hybrid interface: discrete text tokens paired with continuous Vision Transformer (ViT) features. Because supervision is largely text-driven, these models are often biased toward understanding and cannot fully leverage large-scale self-supervised learning on non-text data. Recent work has explored discrete visual tokenization to enable fully autoregressive multimodal modeling, showing promising progress toward unified understanding and generation. Yet existing discrete vision tokens frequently lose information due to limited code capacity, resulting in noticeably weaker understanding than continuous-feature VLMs. We present Kelix, a fully discrete autoregressive unified model that closes the understanding gap between discrete and continuous visual representations."

We investigate quantification in Mandarin Chinese using a picture-based elicited description task in which speakers freely described scenes containing multiple objects, without explicit instructions to count or quantify. Across both spoken and written modalities, we examine three aspects of quantification: whether speakers choose to quantify at all, how precise their quantification is, and which quantificational strategies they adopt. Results show that object numerosity, animacy, and production modality systematically shape quantificational behaviour. In particular, increasing numerosity reduces both the likelihood and the precision of quantification, while animate referents and modality selectively modulate strategy choice. This study demonstrates how quantification can be examined under unconstrained production conditions and provides a naturalistic dataset for further analyses of quantity expression in language production."

The nested excitation and velocity structure of the collimated jet and wide-angle wind suggests a magnetohydrodynamic wind as a likely launching mechanism, similar to findings in other protostars and Class~II sources.

Inspired by the observation that humans are more error-prone when uncertain or hesitant, we investigate how instability in a model 's internal knowledge contributes to LVLM hallucinations. We conduct extensive empirical analyses from three perspectives, namely attention heads, model layers, and decoding tokens, and identify three key hallucination patterns: (i) visual activation drift across attention heads, (ii) pronounced knowledge fluctuations across layers, and (iii) visual focus distraction between neighboring output tokens. Building on these findings, we propose Stability-Aware Knowledge-Enhanced Decoding (SAKED), which introduces a layer-wise Knowledge Stability Score (KSS) to quantify knowledge stability throughout the model. By contrasting the most stability-aware and stability-agnostic layers, SAKED suppresses decoding noise and dynamically leverages the most reliable internal knowledge for faithful token generation. Moreover, SAKED is training-free and can be seamlessly integrated into different architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAKED achieves state-of-the-art performance for hallucination mitigation on various models, tasks, and benchmarks."

We formulate the collision-streaming evolution of the LBM as a compact time-marching scheme and rigorously establish its stability under low Mach number conditions. This unified formulation eliminates the need for classical measurement at each time step, enabling a systematic and fully quantum implementation. Building upon this representation, we investigate two distinct quantum algorithmic approaches. The first is a time-marching quantum algorithm realized through sequential evolution operators, for which we provide a detailed implementation-including block-encoding and dilating unitarization-along with a full complexity analysis. The second employs a quantum linear systems algorithm, which encodes the entire time evolution into a single global linear system. We demonstrate that both methods achieve comparable asymptotic time complexities. The proposed algorithms are validated through numerical simulations of benchmark problems in one and two dimensions. This work provides a systematic, measurement-free pathway for the quantum simulation of advection-diffusion processes via the lattice Boltzmann paradigm."

The pattern is then encoded in a SMT formula whose models correspond to valid plans. If the suggestion by the pattern is inaccurate and no valid plan can be found, the pattern is extended until it contains the causal order of actions in a valid plan, making the approach complete. In this paper, we extend the SPP approach to the temporal planning with Intermediate Conditions and Effects (ICEs) fragment, where $(i)$ actions are durative (and thus can overlap over time) and have conditions/effects which can be checked/applied at any time during an action's execution, and $(ii)$ one can specify plan's conditions/effects that must be checked/applied at specific times during the plan execution. Experimental results show that our SPP planner Patty $(i)$ outperforms all other planners in the literature in the majority of temporal domains without ICEs, $(ii)$ obtains comparable results with the SoTA search planner for ICS in literature domains with ICEs, and $(iii)$ outperforms the same planner in a novel domain based on a real-world application."

However, due to the autoregressive, step-by-step generation paradigm, existing CoT methods suffer from two fundamental limitations. First, the reasoning process is highly sensitive to early decisions: once an initial error is introduced, it tends to propagate and amplify through subsequent steps, while the lack of a global coordination and revision mechanism makes such errors difficult to correct, ultimately leading to distorted reasoning chains. Second, current CoT approaches lack structured analysis techniques for filtering redundant reasoning and extracting key reasoning features, resulting in unstable reasoning processes and limited interpretability. To address these issues, we propose GHS-TDA. GHS-TDA first constructs a semantically enriched global hypothesis graph to aggregate, align, and coordinate multiple candidate reasoning paths, thereby providing alternative global correction routes when local reasoning fails. It then applies topological data analysis based on persistent homology to capture stable multi-scale structures, remove redundancy and inconsistencies, and extract a more reliable reasoning skeleton. By jointly leveraging reasoning diversity and topological stability, GHS-TDA achieves self-adaptive convergence, produces high-confidence and interpretable reasoning paths, and consistently outperforms strong baselines in terms of both accuracy and robustness across multiple reasoning benchmarks."

    "abstract": "This study investigates the explainability of generative diffusion models in the context of medical imaging, focusing on Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) synthesis. Although diffusion models have shown strong performance in generating realistic medical images, their internal decision making process remains largely opaque. We present a faithfulness-based explainability framework that analyzes how prototype-based explainability methods like ProtoPNet (PPNet), Enhanced ProtoPNet (EPPNet), and ProtoPool can link the relationship between generated and training features. Our study focuses on understanding the reasoning behind image formation through denoising trajectory of diffusion model and subsequently prototype explainability with faithfulness analysis. Experimental analysis shows that EPPNet achieves the highest faithfulness (with score 0.1534), offering more reliable insights, and explainability into the generative process. The results highlight that diffusion models can be made more transparent and trustworthy through faithfulness-based explanations, contributing to safer and more interpretable applications of generative AI in healthcare."

    "abstract": "Stellar outbursts from variable or periodic accretion are thought to be ubiquitous across young stellar populations. However, relatively few outbursting objects have been discovered to date. Here, we present the characterisation of a new EXor-type episodic accretor. We aim to characterise the nature of the 2023 outburst of SPICY 97589/Gaia23bab and characterise the stellar source for the first time, while exploring how an accretion outburst contributes to disk evolution. We employ multi-waveband medium-resolution spectroscopy with UVB-VIS-NIR coverage during the peak of the 2023 outburst and the post-outburst quiescent object. The broad wavelength coverage of the dataset allows for robust measurements of the accretion rate using known line tracers. The addition of quiescent spectra provides a good estimation of stellar parameters of the central star while also informing us on the evolution of the disk during outburst phases. We find the stellar source to be a 3410\\,K, M3.0 type star with a luminosity of 0.41 $L_\\odot$ and an estimated stellar mass of 0.29 $M_\\odot$. We measure the accretion rate of SPICY 97589 to be $\\dot M = 2.38\\pm0.58\\times10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{M_\\odot yr^{-1}}$. This value is at two orders of magnitude greater than the quiescent accretion rate. Thus, we confirm that the 2023 outburst was driven by an influx of material from the surrounding environment to the central star, an accretion outburst. The spectral fingerprint of emission lines is also characteristic of an outbursting EXor-type source, including variable disk winds."

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning necessitates meticulous reward shaping by specialists to elicit target behaviors, while imitation learning relies on costly task-specific data. In contrast, unsupervised skill discovery can potentially reduce these burdens by learning a diverse repertoire of useful skills driven by intrinsic motivation. However, existing methods exhibit two key limitations: they typically rely on a single policy to master a versatile repertoire of behaviors without modeling the shared structure or distinctions among them, which results in low learning efficiency; moreover, they are susceptible to reward hacking, where the reward signal increases and converges rapidly while the learned skills display insufficient actual diversity. In this work, we introduce an Orthogonal Mixture-of-Experts (OMoE) architecture that prevents diverse behaviors from collapsing into overlapping representations, enabling a single policy to master a wide spectrum of locomotion skills. In addition, we design a multi-discriminator framework in which different discriminators operate on distinct observation spaces, effectively mitigating reward hacking. We evaluated our method on the 12-DOF Unitree A1 quadruped robot, demonstrating a diverse set of locomotion skills. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework boosts training efficiency and yields an 18.3\\% expansion in state-space coverage compared to the baseline."

When $A(q)$ is modular (typically an $η$--quotient), this yields (quasi)modular forms whose coefficients can be projected to arithmetic progressions and certified modulo primes by a Sturm bound, giving an effective pipeline for detecting and proving Ramanujan--type congruences for frequency moments. For ordinary partitions we recover and certify several congruences for odd moments in nonzero residue classes (e.g.\\ $M_3(7n+5)\\equiv 0\\pmod7$ and $M_3(11n+6)\\equiv 0\\pmod{11}$). As a second input, we apply the same pipeline to overpartitions and certify a family of zero--class congruences $M_m^{\\overline{\\ }}(\\ell n)\\equiv 0\\pmod{\\ell}$ (including $m=5,7,11,13$), exhibiting a sharp contrast with the ordinary partition case: no nonzero residue--class congruences are observed for overpartition moments in our scan range. We also demonstrate that filtering the statistic via the Glaisher--character dictionary can itself create new Ramanujan--type progressions, e.g.\\ a quadratic twist yields the certified congruence $\\widehat{M}^{χ_5}_3(5n+4)\\equiv 0\\pmod{5}$."

In the same region we observe a highly unusual behavior of the thermopower with two sign changes and giant extrema. The overall variation of the thermopower exceeds 4 000 muV/K and takes place in an extremely narrow temperature region of less than 5 K. The anomaly is suppressed completely in a small magnetic field of 0.5 T. We discuss this observation using a simple drift-diffusion picture and taking into account that the temperature gradient inducing the thermopower voltage is accompanied by a gradient of the electrical resistivity. Our simple estimation yields the correct magnitude, shape, and field dependence of the thermopower anomaly observed in EuCd2P2. These results open a new route to giant thermopower values via gradients of electronic properties."

To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel Bayesian-Stackelberg framework that jointly optimizes sensing, beamforming, and communication. The dual-algorithm design integrates (i) Adaptive Hybrid Node Role Switching between secure transmission and cooperative jamming (ii) Belief-Driven Sensing and Beamforming for confidence based resource allocation. The proposed unified framework significantly improves robustness against attacks while preserving linear computational complexity. Simulation results across carrier frequencies ranging from 28 to 410 GHz demonstrate that the method achieves up to a 35% increase in secrecy rates and a success rate exceeding 98%, outperforming conventional communication systems with minimal runtime overhead. These findings underscore the scalability of belief-driven ISAC security solutions for low-complexity deployment in next generation communications."

However, experimental data on internal TPMS flow behaviour are still limited. To address this gap, the flow behaviour in additively manufactured TPMS structures is analysed using three-dimensional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) velocimetry in a large-bore vertical 3 T MRI system, in cylindrical columns of 38 mm diameter and Reynolds numbers between 50 and 300. Three different TPMS geometries are investigated, and consistency between Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations and experimentally measured MRI velocity fields is established through cross-validation. The MRI system provides fully three-dimensional velocity fields with a divergence deviation below 6 %. MRI revealed distinct flow features: the Gyroid TPnS exhibited pronounced channelling, while the Schwarz-Diamond TPSf showed merge-split behaviour, achieving a 46 % increase in lateral mixing compared to the Gyroid TPnS structures. Numerical simulations reproduce the flow features and show agreement with the MRI data. The combined methodology demonstrates the suitability of MRI velocimetry for the experimental validation of CFD simulations and establishes a robust foundation for future studies of heat and mass transfer, as well as reactive flow, in structured reactor systems."

Due to an increasing demand for explanations, this may involve counterfactual queries besides the typically considered factual queries. In this work, we consider linear models and three types of queries: factual, counterfactual, and robust counterfactual. First, for an arbitrary set of queries, we derive novel mathematical formulations for the classification regions for which the decision of the unknown model is known, without recovering any of the model parameters. Second, we derive bounds on the number of queries needed to extract the model's parameters for (robust) counterfactual queries under arbitrary norm-based distances. We show that the full model can be recovered using just a single counterfactual query when differentiable distance measures are employed. In contrast, when using polyhedral distances for instance, the number of required queries grows linearly with the dimension of the data space. For robust counterfactuals, the latter number of queries doubles. Consequently, the applied distance function and robustness of counterfactuals have a significant impact on the model's security."

Incorporating existing constraints together with improved limits obtained here further excludes axial-vector scenarios. Within the single-boson framework considered in this work, only a narrowly constrained scalar-mediated interaction remains viable. The remaining parameter space could be probed, for example, by modest improvements in the determination of the electron gyromagnetic ratio."

The nonrelativistic spin-momentum coupling inherent to altermagnets generates a giant momentum dependent spin splitting, leading to strong spin-flip scattering in the presence of a precessing magnetic order driving the altermagnetic system out of equilibrium. Our simulations reveal the emission of hundreds of harmonics under realistic conditions, with amplitudes far exceeding those obtained in light-driven schemes. Notably, in contrast to ferromagnetic and conventional antiferromagnetic systems, where nonlinear emission typically requires additional spin-orbit coupling, altermagnets intrinsically support high-harmonic spin and charge pumping. These results identify altermagnetic systems as a promising platform for efficient THz emitters and highly nonlinear spintronic devices."

However, achieving precise control over fine-grained facial movements remains a significant challenge, particularly due to lip-synchronization inaccuracies and facial jitter, both of which can contribute to the uncanny valley effect. To address these challenges, we propose Fine-Grained 3D Gaussian Splatting (FG-3DGS), a novel framework that enables temporally consistent and high-fidelity talking head generation. Our method introduces a frequency-aware disentanglement strategy to explicitly model facial regions based on their motion characteristics. Low-frequency regions, such as the cheeks, nose, and forehead, are jointly modeled using a standard MLP, while high-frequency regions, including the eyes and mouth, are captured separately using a dedicated network guided by facial area masks. The predicted motion dynamics, represented as Gaussian deltas, are applied to the static Gaussians to generate the final head frames, which are rendered via a rasterizer using frame-specific camera parameters. Additionally, a high-frequency-refined post-rendering alignment mechanism, learned from large-scale audio-video pairs by a pretrained model, is incorporated to enhance per-frame generation and achieve more accurate lip synchronization. Extensive experiments on widely used datasets for talking head generation demonstrate that our method outperforms recent state-of-the-art approaches in producing high-fidelity, lip-synced talking head videos."

    "abstract": "Computing node importance in networks is a long-standing fundamental problem that has driven extensive study of various centrality measures. A particularly well-known centrality measure is betweenness centrality, which becomes computationally prohibitive on large-scale networks. Graph Neural Network (GNN) models have thus been proposed to predict node rankings according to their relative betweenness centrality. However, state-of-the-art methods fail to generalize to high-diameter graphs such as road networks. We propose BRAVA-GNN, a lightweight GNN architecture that leverages the empirically observed correlation linking betweenness centrality to degree-based quantities, in particular multi-hop degree mass. This correlation motivates the use of degree masses as size-invariant node features and synthetic training graphs that closely match the degree distributions of real networks. Furthermore, while previous work relies on scale-free synthetic graphs, we leverage the hyperbolic random graph model, which reproduces power-law exponents outside the scale-free regime, better capturing the structure of real-world graphs like road networks. This design enables BRAVA-GNN to generalize across diverse graph families while using 54x fewer parameters than the most lightweight existing GNN baseline. Extensive experiments on 19 real-world networks, spanning social, web, email, and road graphs, show that BRAVA-GNN achieves up to 214% improvement in Kendall-Tau correlation and up to 70x speedup in inference time over state-of-the-art GNN-based approaches, particularly on challenging road networks."

However, existing 3D generation methods face challenges in generating animatable geometry, while rigging techniques lack fine-grained structural control over skeleton creation. To address these limitations, we introduce Stroke3D, a novel framework that directly generates rigged meshes from user inputs: 2D drawn strokes and a descriptive text prompt. Our approach pioneers a two-stage pipeline that separates the generation into: 1) Controllable Skeleton Generation, we employ the Skeletal Graph VAE (Sk-VAE) to encode the skeleton's graph structure into a latent space, where the Skeletal Graph DiT (Sk-DiT) generates a skeletal embedding. The generation process is conditioned on both the text for semantics and the 2D strokes for explicit structural control, with the VAE's decoder reconstructing the final high-quality 3D skeleton; and 2) Enhanced Mesh Synthesis via TextuRig and SKA-DPO, where we then synthesize a textured mesh conditioned on the generated skeleton. For this stage, we first enhance an existing skeleton-to-mesh model by augmenting its training data with TextuRig: a dataset of textured and rigged meshes with captions, curated from Objaverse-XL. Additionally, we employ a preference optimization strategy, SKA-DPO, guided by a skeleton-mesh alignment score, to further improve geometric fidelity. Together, our framework enables a more intuitive workflow for creating ready to animate 3D content. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to generate rigged 3D meshes conditioned on user-drawn 2D strokes.

    "abstract": "Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 devices provide efficient hardware-based cryptographic security through tamper-resistant key storage and computation, making them ideal building blocks for multi-party signature schemes in distributed systems. However, existing TPM-based multi-signature constructions suffer from a fundamental limitation, they require interactive protocols where all participants must coordinate during the commitment phase, before any signature can be computed. This interactive requirement creates several critical problems, such as synchronization bottlenecks, quadratic communication complexity, and aborted protocols as a result of participant failure. These limitations become particularly heightened for applications that require cross-device cryptographic operations. This paper presents PiTPM, an Aggregator Framework built upon Schnorr's digital signature. Our protocol eliminates the interactive requirement using a hybrid trust architecture. The proposed framework uses pre-shared randomness seeds stored securely in an Aggregator, enabling deterministic computation of global commitments without inter-participant communication. The resulting signatures of the proposed framework are of constant size regardless of signer count. Our experimental results show a possible paradigm shift in TPM-based cryptographic system design, demonstrating that hybrid trust architectures can achieve significant performance improvements while maintaining rigorous security guarantees. We provide a comprehensive formal security analysis proving EU-CMA security under the discrete logarithm assumption in the random oracle model."

Two events (SO2 in Sectors 87+88 and SO3 in Sector 93) exhibit a pronounced, temporally pronounced precursor-dip followed by a rapid rise into the main superoutburst plateau. This morphology, previously seen in Kepler light curves of V1504 Cyg and V344 Lyr, is a key prediction of the thermal-tidal instability (TTI) model when a normal (precursor) outburst expands the disk only marginally beyond the 3:1 resonance radius, allowing the tidal instability to grow slowly and produce a deep dip approaching quiescence before rapid amplification drives the main superoutburst. A sliding-window time-frequency analysis reveals superhump power already during the decline and near minimum light, with a smooth period evolution across the dip and stabilization after the system returns to the hot state, consistent with the growth and saturation of disk eccentricity at the 3:1 resonance. From the stabilized Stage A superhump periods, we infer a representative mass ratio $q = 0.131 \\pm 0.002$. Combined with either a typical SU UMa white-dwarf mass prior or the semi-empirical donor sequence at an orbital period of 107~min, the implied component masses are $M_1 \\simeq 0.6$--$1.0\\,M_\\odot$ and $M_2 \\simeq 0.08$--$0.14\\,M_\\odot$, ruling out a brown-dwarf donor and establishing VW~Hyi as a benchmark system for testing tidal-instability models in low-$q$ dwarf novae."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a systematic review of recent advances in nonlinear filtering algorithms, structured into three principal categories: Kalman-type methods, Monte Carlo methods, and the Yau-Yau algorithm. For each category, we provide a comprehensive synthesis of theoretical developments, algorithmic variants, and practical applications that have emerged in recent years. Importantly, this review addresses both continuous-time and discrete-time system formulations, offering a unified review of filtering methodologies across different frameworks. Furthermore, our analysis reveals the transformative influence of artificial intelligence breakthroughs on the entire nonlinear filtering field, particularly in areas such as learning-based filters, neural network-augmented algorithms, and data-driven approaches."

    "abstract": "Since 1887, administrative law has navigated a \"capability-accountability trap\": technological change forces government to become more sophisticated, but sophistication renders agencies opaque to generalist overseers like the courts and Congress. The law's response--substituting procedural review for substantive oversight--has produced a sedimentary accretion of requirements that ossify capacity without ensuring democratic control. This Article argues that the Supreme Court's post-Loper Bright retrenchment is best understood as an effort to shrink administration back to comprehensible size in response to this complexification. But reducing complexity in this way sacrifices capability precisely when climate change, pandemics, and AI risks demand more sophisticated governance. AI offers a different path. Unlike many prior administrative technologies that increased opacity alongside capacity, AI can help build \"scrutability\" in government, translating technical complexity into accessible terms, surfacing the assumptions that matter for oversight, and enabling substantive verification of agency reasoning. This Article proposes three doctrinal innovations within administrative law to realize this potential: a Model and System Dossier (documenting model purpose, evaluation, monitoring, and versioning) extending the administrative record to AI decision-making; a material-model-change trigger specifying when AI updates require new process; and a \"deference to audit\" standard that rewards agencies for auditable evaluation of their AI tools. The result is a framework for what this Article calls the \"Fourth Settlement,\" administrative law that escapes the capability-accountability trap by preserving capability while restoring comprehensible oversight of administration."

    "abstract": "Relying on atomic scattering factors from evaluated databases, a new model for the reflectivity of x rays on solid surfaces has been developed for FLUKA v4-6.0. This model accounts for the variation of reflectivity as a function of the photon energy, its incidence angle, and linear polarisation; surface roughness effects are also taken into account. FLUKA reflectivities agree well with those obtained from state-of-the-art codes used for the characterization of optical devices, both for homogeneous solids and for multilayer mirrors. This new capability renders FLUKA a nearly one-stop shop for synchrotron radiation simulations: emission from bending magnets and wigglers, photon transport and interaction, electromagnetic (and hadronic when applicable) shower development in complex geometries, as well as x-ray reflection at designated solid surfaces can now be all accounted for in a single FLUKA run. This streamlined FLUKA simulation workflow greatly simplifies the plethora of simulation tools that Monte Carlo practitioners previously needed to rely on. Two application scenarios of this new reflectivity model are showcased: first, the use of a multilayer mirror to deflect x rays from an optical hutch onto an experimental hall at the MINERVA beamline of the ALBA synchrotron and, second, the assessment of the photon flux near the interaction point at the CERN's Future Circular Collider (in its electron-positron stage) as a result of upstream x-ray reflections."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved table understanding tasks such as Table Question Answering (TableQA), yet challenges remain in ensuring reliability, scalability, and efficiency, especially in resource-constrained or privacy-sensitive environments. In this paper, we introduce MATA, a multi-agent TableQA framework that leverages multiple complementary reasoning paths and a set of tools built with small language models. MATA generates candidate answers through diverse reasoning styles for a given table and question, then refines or selects the optimal answer with the help of these tools. Furthermore, it incorporates an algorithm designed to minimize expensive LLM agent calls, enhancing overall efficiency. MATA maintains strong performance with small, open-source models and adapts easily across various LLM types. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks of varying difficulty with ten different LLMs demonstrate that MATA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and highly efficient reasoning while avoiding excessive LLM inference. Our results highlight that careful orchestration of multiple reasoning pathways yields scalable and reliable TableQA. The code is available at https://github.com/AIDAS-Lab/MATA."

By treating the $S$-matrix as a quantum operator acting on the spin states, we quantify its ability to generate entanglement and identify the conditions on the phase shifts of the spin channels that minimize entanglement generation in the system. In $ΩΩ$ scattering, only antisymmetric spin channels are allowed due to Fermi-Dirac statistics. Applying the entanglement-suppression framework to $ΩΩ$ scattering, we find two solutions for the phase shifts: one leading to a spin SU(4) symmetry and the other to a nonrelativistic conformal symmetry. We show that the solution associated with the nonrelativistic conformal symmetry originates from the specific structure of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients in the $3/2 \\otimes 3/2$ system."

    "abstract": "Differential Privacy (DP) considers a scenario in which an adversary has almost complete information about the entries of a database. This worst-case assumption is likely to overestimate the privacy threat faced by an individual in practice. In contrast, Statistical Privacy (SP), as well as related notions such as noiseless privacy or limited background knowledge privacy, describe a setting in which the adversary knows the distribution of the database entries, but not their exact realizations. In this case, privacy analysis must account for the interaction between uncertainty induced by the entropy of the underlying distributions and privacy mechanisms that distort query answers, which can be highly non-trivial. This paper investigates this problem for multiple queries (composition). A privacy mechanism is proposed that is based on subsampling and randomly partitioning the database to bound the dependency among queries. This way for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, upper privacy bounds against limited adversaries are obtained without any further restriction on the database. These bounds show that in realistic application scenarios taking the entropy of distributions into account yields improvements of privacy and precision guarantees. We illustrate examples where for fixed privacy parameters and utility loss SP allows significantly more queries than DP."

    "abstract": "Watermarking has emerged as a pivotal solution for content traceability and intellectual property protection in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). However, vision-agnostic watermarks may introduce visually irrelevant tokens and disrupt visual grounding by enforcing indiscriminate pseudo-random biases. Additionally, current vision-specific watermarks rely on a static, one-time estimation of vision critical weights and ignore the weight distribution density when determining the proportion of protected tokens. This design fails to account for dynamic changes in visual dependence during generation and may introduce low-quality tokens in the long tail. To address these challenges, we propose Attention-Guided Dynamic Watermarking (AGMark), a novel framework that embeds detectable signals while strictly preserving visual fidelity. At each decoding step, AGMark first dynamically identifies semantic-critical evidence based on attention weights for visual relevance, together with context-aware coherence cues, resulting in a more adaptive and well-calibrated evidence-weight distribution. It then determines the proportion of semantic-critical tokens by jointly considering uncertainty awareness (token entropy) and evidence calibration (weight density), thereby enabling adaptive vocabulary partitioning to avoid irrelevant tokens. Empirical results confirm that AGMark outperforms conventional methods, observably improving generation quality and yielding particularly strong gains in visual semantic fidelity in the later stages of generation. The framework maintains highly competitive detection accuracy (at least 99.36\\% AUC) and robust attack resilience (at least 88.61\\% AUC) without sacrificing inference efficiency, effectively establishing a new standard for reliability-preserving multi-modal watermarking."

During May-June 2006, while passing near Earth, multiple fragments of comet 73P passed sunward of Sun-Earth Lagrange Point 1, while cometary pickup ions were detected concurrently by instruments on both the ACE and Wind spacecraft, implying the crossing of one or more ion tail. Additionally, during August 2011, a fragment of 73P passed directly sunward of spacecraft STEREO-B. A detection of cometary ions is shown to originate at fragment 73P-AM. Solar wind velocity measurements are used to extrapolate the flow of the solar wind in 3 dimensions and, when compared with the positions of known comets and cometary fragments, estimate the separation between the cometary ion tail and the spacecraft. Using this technique, it is shown that the alignment of the major cometary fragments with the spacecraft was poor for the transport of cometary ions via the solar wind, but the encounter was near enough for immersion in the diffuse ion tail surrounding an extended dust trail within which the nucleus fragments reside. This implies that, at this distance, the extended trail of cometary debris was a significant source of cometary ions in the case of comet 73P."

We investigate the timing and spectral properties of the Seyfert galaxy Mrk 110 using six XMM-Newton observations. A frequency-dependent lag analysis in the 7-9 $\\times 10^{-5}$ Hz range reveals a soft X-ray lag of 889-3000s in the combined 2019 data, detected with a significance of 80%. The cross-correlation function analysis, supported by simulations, also detects lags of similar nature. Spectral modeling performed by adopting both proposed black hole masses in the literature for Mrk 110 confirms the presence of a warm corona in all observations, along with a weak relativistic reflection component and the reflection fraction remains low (Rf < 1). Interpreting the measured soft lag in terms of light travel time implies an emission radius 4.5 Rg for a supermassive black hole mass of $M = 1.4 \\times 10^8$ solar mass , favoring a reflection scenario. However, if a lower mass of $M = 2 \\times 10^7$ solar mass is adopted, the inferred radius increases, and both relativistic reflection and warm Comptonization can plausibly contribute to the observed soft lag. The warm corona radius appears larger in the high accretion state and smaller in a lower accretion state, although no trend can be established. The persistently low reflection fraction suggests an outflowing inner corona in Mrk 110, consistent with the recent detection of jet activity in this source."

However, existing BDLMs have limited exploration under the test-time scaling setting and face more severe decoding challenges in long Chain-of-Thought reasoning, particularly in balancing the decoding speed and effectiveness. In this work, we propose a unified framework for test-time scaling in BDLMs that introduces adaptivity in both decoding and block-wise generation. At the decoding level, we propose Bounded Adaptive Confidence Decoding (BACD), a difficulty-aware sampling strategy that dynamically adjusts denoising based on model confidence, accelerating inference while controlling error accumulation. Beyond step-wise adaptivity, we introduce Think Coarse, Critic Fine (TCCF), a test-time scaling paradigm that allocates large block sizes to exploratory reasoning and smaller block sizes to refinement, achieving an effective efficiency-effectiveness balance. To enable efficient and effective decoding with a large block size, we adopt Progressive Block Size Extension, which mitigates performance degradation when scaling block sizes. Extensive experiments show that applying BACD and TCCF to TDAR-8B yields significant improvements over strong baselines such as TraDo-8B (2.26x speedup, +11.2 points on AIME24). These results mark an important step toward unlocking the potential of BDLMs for test-time scaling in complex reasoning tasks."

We establish theoretical properties of the test statistic and develop a multiplier bootstrap procedure to approximate its distribution. The method provides a flexible and powerful tool for the validation and comparative backtesting of value-at-risk. Simulations show superior performance in high-dimensional settings, and a real-data application demonstrates its practical effectiveness in backtesting."

Inspired by multistate formulations, we extend the joint characterization of binary health states and mortality to continuous QoL outcomes. Because treatment effects cannot be meaningfully summarized in a single one-dimensional estimand without strong assumptions, our approach simultaneously considers both survival and the joint distribution of QoL and survival with the latter conveniently displayed in a simplex. We develop assumption-lean, semiparametric estimators based on efficient influence functions, yielding flexible, root-n consistent estimators that accommodate machine-learning methods while making transparent the conditions these must satisfy.

Moreover, only a single scalar macroscopic observable from the finite network is assumed to be measurable. Using time-series data of this observable, we infer the unknown parameters of the mean-field equations and reconstruct the dynamics of unobserved (hidden) macroscopic variables. Parameter estimation is carried out using the differential evolution algorithm. To remove the dependence of the loss function on the unknown initial conditions of the hidden variables, we synchronize the mean-field model with the finite network throughout the optimization process. We demonstrate the methodology on two networks of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons: one exhibiting periodic collective oscillations and another displaying chaotic collective dynamics.

Our model incorporates several key innovations: a novel Difference Pyramid Block for multi-scale change analysis, an Adaptive Multi-scale Processing module combining shape-aware and high-resolution enhancement blocks, and multi-level attention mechanisms (PPM and CSAGate) for joint contextual and detail processing. Furthermore, a dynamic composite loss function and a four-phase training strategy are introduced to stabilize training and accelerate convergence. Comprehensive evaluations on the LEVIR-CD and LEVIR-MCI datasets demonstrate SCA-Net's superior performance over Change-Agent and other state-of-the-art methods. Our approach achieves a significant 2.64% improvement in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) on LEVIR-MCI and a remarkable 57.9% increase in IoU for small buildings, while reducing the training time by 61%.

    "abstract": "Moiré superlattices formed in WS$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterobilayers have emerged as an exciting platform to explore the quantum many-body physics. The key mechanism is the introduction of moiré potentials for the band-edge carriers induced by the lateral modulation of interlayer interactions. This trapping potential results in the formation of flat bands, which enhances the strong correlation effect. However, a full understanding of the origin of this intriguing potential remains elusive. In this paper, we present a comprehensive investigation of the origin of moiré potentials in both R-type and H-type moiré patterns formed in WS$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterobilayers. We show that both lattice reconstruction and interlayer charge transfer contribute significantly to the formation of moiré potentials. In particular, the lattice reconstruction induces a nonuniform local strain, which creates an energy modulation of 200 meV for the conduction band-edge state located at WS$_2$ layer and 20 meV for the valence band-edge state located at WSe$_2$ layer. In addition, the lattice reconstruction also introduces a piezopotential energy, whose amplitude ranges from 40 meV to 90 meV depending on the stacking and band-edge carrier. The interlayer charge transfer induces a built-in electric field, resulting in an energy modulation of 80 meV for an R-type moiré and 40 meV for an H-type moiré. Taking into account both effects from lattice reconstruction and interlayer charge transfer, the formation of moiré potential is well understood for both R-type and H-type moirés. This trapping potential localizes the wavefunctions of conduction and valence bands around the same moiré site for an R-type moiré, while around different moiré site for an H-type one."

Early approaches from the 1970s to the 1990s relied on hand-crafted edge detection, segmentation, and low-level features such as color, shape, and texture to locate objects and infer their identities-an inherently ill-posed problem. Behavior analysis in this era typically proceeded by tracking identified objects over time and modeling their trajectories using sparse feature points, which further limited robustness and generalization. A major shift occurred with the introduction of ImageNet by Deng and Li in 2010, which enabled large-scale visual recognition through deep neural networks and effectively served as a comprehensive visual dictionary. This development allowed object recognition to move beyond complex low-level processing toward learned high-level representations. In this work, we follow this paradigm to build a large-scale Universal Action Space (UAS) using existing labeled human-action datasets. We then use this UAS as the foundation for analyzing and categorizing mammalian and chimpanzee behavior datasets.

A popular class of dependence models for spatial extremes is that of random location-scale mixtures, in which a spatial \"baseline\" process is multiplied or shifted by a random variable, potentially altering its extremal dependence behaviour. Gaussian location-scale mixtures retain benefits of their Gaussian baseline processes while overcoming some of their limitations, such as symmetry, light tails and weak tail dependence. We review properties of Gaussian location-scale mixtures and develop novel constructions with interesting features, together with a general algorithm for conditional simulation from these models. We leverage their flexibility to propose extended extreme-value models, that allow for appropriately modelling not only the tails but also the bulk of the data. This is important in many applications and avoids the need to explicitly select the events considered as extreme. We propose new solutions for likelihood inference in parametric models of Gaussian location-scale mixtures, in order to avoid the numerical bottleneck given by the latent location and scale variables that can lead to high computational cost of standard likelihood evaluations. The effectiveness of the models and of the inference methods is confirmed with simulated data examples, and we present an application to wildfire-related weather variables in Portugal. Although not detailed here, the approaches would also be straightforward to use for modelling multivariate (non spatial) data."

Goal-aware prompting shifts intermediate measures toward the disclosed downstream objective.

Statistically, it was known that differentially private learning and replicable learning are equivalent and strictly more powerful than SQ-learning. Yet, computationally, all previously known efficient (i.e., polynomial-time) replicable learning algorithms were confined to SQ-learnable tasks or restricted distributions, in contrast to differentially private learning. Our main contribution is the first computationally efficient replicable algorithm for realizable learning of parities over arbitrary distributions, a task that is known to be hard in the SQ-model, but possible under differential privacy. This result provides the first evidence that efficient replicable learning over general distributions strictly extends efficient SQ-learning, and is closer in power to efficient differentially private learning, despite computational separations between replicability and privacy. Our main building block is a new, efficient, and replicable algorithm that, given a set of vectors, outputs a subspace of their linear span that covers most of them."

Evaluating them requires approximating a large number of conditional expectations, either via Monte Carlo integration or regression. Until recently it has not been possible to fully exploit deep learning for the regression approach, because retraining for each conditional expectation takes too long. Tabular foundation models such as TabPFN overcome this computational hurdle by leveraging in-context learning, so each conditional expectation can be approximated without any re-training. In this paper, we compute Shapley values with multiple variants of TabPFN and compare their performance with state-of-the-art methods on both simulated and real datasets. In most cases, TabPFN yields the best performance; where it does not, it is only marginally worse than the best method, at a fraction of the runtime.

Unpaired synthetic-to-real translation can reduce this gap without paired supervision, yet existing methods often face a trade-off between photorealism and structural stability: unconstrained generation may introduce deformation or spurious textures, while overly rigid constraints limit adaptation to real-domain statistics. We propose FD-DB, a frequency-decoupled dual-branch model that separates appearance transfer into low-frequency interpretable editing and high-frequency residual compensation. The interpretable branch predicts physically meaningful editing parameters (white balance, exposure, contrast, saturation, blur, and grain) to build a stable low-frequency appearance base with strong content preservation. The free branch complements fine details through residual generation, and a gated fusion mechanism combines the two branches under explicit frequency constraints to limit low-frequency drift. We further adopt a two-stage training schedule that first stabilizes the editing branch and then releases the residual branch to improve optimization stability. Experiments on the YCB-V dataset show that FD-DB improves real-domain appearance consistency and significantly boosts downstream semantic segmentation performance while preserving geometric and semantic structures."

    "abstract": "Modern image generators produce strikingly realistic images, where only artifacts like distorted hands or warped objects reveal their synthetic origin. Detecting these artifacts is essential: without detection, we cannot benchmark generators or train reward models to improve them. Current detectors fine-tune VLMs on tens of thousands of labeled images, but this is expensive to repeat whenever generators evolve or new artifact types emerge. We show that pretrained VLMs already encode the knowledge needed to detect artifacts - with the right scaffolding, this capability can be unlocked using only a few hundred labeled examples per artifact category. Our system, ArtifactLens, achieves state-of-the-art on five human artifact benchmarks (the first evaluation across multiple datasets) while requiring orders of magnitude less labeled data. The scaffolding consists of a multi-component architecture with in-context learning and text instruction optimization, with novel improvements to each. Our methods generalize to other artifact types - object morphology, animal anatomy, and entity interactions - and to the distinct task of AIGC detection."

    "abstract": "While Large Language Models (LLM) enable non-experts to specify open-world multi-robot tasks, the generated plans often lack kinematic feasibility and are not efficient, especially in long-horizon scenarios. Formal methods like Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) offer correctness and optimal guarantees, but are typically confined to static, offline settings and struggle with computational scalability. To bridge this gap, we propose a neuro-symbolic framework that grounds LLM reasoning into hierarchical LTL specifications and solves the corresponding Simultaneous Task Allocation and Planning (STAP) problem. Unlike static approaches, our system resolves stochastic environmental changes, such as moving users or updated instructions via a receding horizon planning (RHP) loop with real-time perception, which dynamically refines plans through a hierarchical state space. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods in success rate and interaction fluency while minimizing planning latency."

In open-source software (OSS) projects, such links play an important role, particularly between the contributions (e.g., GitHub issues) and the corresponding source code. Through these links, developers can trace the discussions in contributions and uncover design rationales, constraints, and security concerns. Previous studies have mainly examined accepted contributions, while those declined after discussion have been overlooked. The discussions behind declined contributions contain valuable design rationales and implicit knowledge about software decision-making, as the reasons behind the decline often reveal the criteria used to judge what should or should not be implemented. In this study, we present the first attempt to establish traceability links between declined contributions and related source code. We propose an initial linking approach and conduct an empirical analysis of the generated links to discuss factors affecting link generation. As our dataset, we use proposals from the official Go repository, which are GitHub issues used to propose new features or language changes. To link declined proposals to source code, we designed an LLM-driven pipeline. Our results showed that the pipeline selected the correct granularity for each declined proposal with an accuracy of 0.836, and generated correct links at that granularity with a mean precision of 0.643. To clarify the challenges of linking declined proposals, we performed a failure analysis. In the declined proposals where the pipeline failed to generate links, the discussions were often redundant and lacked concrete information (e.g., how the feature should be implemented)."

Intuitionistic relations capture scoping through persistence, reflecting the availability of resources from outer scopes, while modal relations model resource isolation introduced for various purposes. Traditional modal languages, however, describe only modal transitions and thus provide limited support for expressing fine-grained control over resource availability. Motivated by this limitation, we introduce \\emph{Bounded Modal Logic (\\textbf{BML})}, an experimental extension of constructive modal logic whose language explicitly accounts for both intuitionistic and modal transitions. We present a natural-deduction proof system and a Kripke semantics for \\textbf{BML}, together with a Curry--Howard interpretation via a corresponding typed lambda-calculus. We establish metatheoretic properties of the calculus, showing that \\textbf{BML} forms a well-disciplined logical system. This provides theoretical support for our proposed perspective on fine-grained resource control in programming languages."

Building on the batch-to-online conversion by Dong and Yoshida (2023), we show that if an offline algorithm admits a $(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximation guarantee and the effect of $\\varepsilon$ on its average sensitivity is characterized by a function $\\varphi(\\varepsilon)$, then an adaptive choice of $\\varepsilon$ yields a small-loss regret bound of $\\tilde O(\\varphi^{\\star}(\\mathrm{OPT}_T))$, where $\\varphi^{\\star}$ is the concave conjugate of $\\varphi$, $\\mathrm{OPT}_T$ is the offline optimum over $T$ rounds, and $\\tilde O$ hides polylogarithmic factors in $T$. Our method requires no regularity assumptions on loss functions, such as smoothness, and can be viewed as a generalization of the AdaGrad-style tuning applied to the approximation parameter $\\varepsilon$. Our result recovers and strengthens the $(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximate regret bounds of Dong and Yoshida (2023) and yields small-loss regret bounds for online $k$-means clustering, low-rank approximation, and regression. We further apply our framework to online submodular function minimization using $(1\\pm\\varepsilon)$-cut sparsifiers of submodular hypergraphs, obtaining a small-loss regret bound of $\\tilde O(n^{3/4}(1 + \\mathrm{OPT}_T^{3/4}))$, where $n$ is the ground-set size.

However, the quality of ISAR images degrades due to road clutter and when translational and higher order rotational motions of the targets are not suitably compensated. One method to enhance the signal-to-clutter-and-noise ratio (SCNR) of the systems is to leverage the advantages of the multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) framework available in commercial automotive radars to generate MIMO-ISAR images. While substantial research has been devoted to motion compensation of single-channel ISAR images, the effectiveness of these methods for MIMO-ISAR has not been studied extensively. This paper analyzes the performance of three popular motion compensation techniques - entropy minimization, cross-correlation, and phase gradient autofocus - on MIMO-ISAR. The algorithms are evaluated on the measurement data collected using Texas Instruments millimeter-wave MIMO radar. The results indicate that the cross-correlation MOCOMP performs better than the other two MOCOMP algorithms in the MIMO configuration, with an overall improvement of 36%."

However, deploying separate radars and communication devices involves the allocation of individual frequency bands and hardware platforms. Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) offers a robust solution to the challenges of spectral congestion by utilizing a shared waveform, hardware, and spectrum for both localization of mobile users and communication. Various waveforms, including phase-modulated continuous waves (PMCW) and frequency-modulated continuous waves (FMCW), have been explored for target localization using traditional radar. On the other hand, new protocols such as the IEEE 802.11ad have been proposed to support wideband communication between vehicles. This paper compares both traditional radar and communication candidate waveforms for ISAC to detect single-point and extended targets. We show that the response of FMCW to mobile targets is poorer than that of PMCW. However, the IEEE 802.11ad radar outperforms PMCW radar and FMCW radar. Additionally, the radar signal processing algorithms are implemented on Zynq system-on-chip through hardware-software co-design and fixed-point analysis to evaluate their computational complexity in real-world implementations."

This formulation enables users to operationally control the scope of culture via comparison settings and provides interpretability, since the score derives from the underlying generality estimates. We validate CCI on 400 sentences (200 culture-specific and 200 general), and the resulting score distribution exhibits the anticipated pattern: higher for culture-specific sentences and lower for general ones. For binary separability, CCI outperforms direct LLM scoring, yielding more than a 10-point improvement in AUC for models specialized to the target culture.

By applying the theory of resolvent positive operators and their perturbations, we first establish criteria for the existence of the principal eigenvalue. We then construct sequences of smooth upper and lower approximating matrix-valued functions, each of whose corresponding operators satisfies the principal eigenvalue existence condition. This approximation framework allows the principal spectrum point to effectively substitute for the principal eigenvalue in characterizing the global dynamics of the nonlinear system. Moreover, it facilitates the study of the asymptotic behavior of the principal spectrum point with respect to parameters under fairly general assumptions. Subsequently, for systems with both coupled and uncoupled nonlocal terms, we analyze the asymptotic behavior of the principal spectrum point in terms of the dispersal rate, dispersal range, and frequency. Finally, we illustrate the applicability of our theoretical results through a Zika virus model and a stem cell model."

However, many rate-dependent formulations are built on empirical considerations, whereas physical derivations may offer greater interpretability. In this context, starting from fundamental physical principles, this paper introduces a novel class of first-order dynamic friction models that approximate the dynamics of a bristle element by inverting the friction characteristic. Amongst the developed models, a specific formulation closely resembling the LuGre model is derived using a simple rheological equation for the bristle element. This model is rigorously analyzed in terms of stability and passivity -- important properties that support the synthesis of observers and controllers. Furthermore, a distributed version, formulated as a hyperbolic partial differential equation (PDE), is presented, which enables the modeling of frictional processes commonly encountered in rolling contact phenomena. The tribological behavior of the proposed description is evaluated through classical experiments and validated against the response predicted by the LuGre model, revealing both notable similarities and key differences."

    "abstract": "Fine-grained truck classification is critical for intelligent transportation systems (ITS), yet current LiDAR-based methods face scalability challenges due to their reliance on supervised deep learning and labor-intensive manual annotation. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer promising few-shot generalization, but their application to roadside LiDAR is limited by a modality gap between sparse 3D point clouds and dense 2D imagery. We propose a framework that bridges this gap by adapting off-the-shelf VLMs for fine-grained truck classification without parameter fine-tuning. Our new depth-aware image generation pipeline applies noise removal, spatial and temporal registration, orientation rectification, morphological operations, and anisotropic smoothing to transform sparse, occluded LiDAR scans into depth-encoded 2D visual proxies. Validated on a real-world dataset of 20 vehicle classes, our approach achieves competitive classification accuracy with as few as 16-30 examples per class, offering a scalable alternative to data-intensive supervised baselines. We further observe a \"Semantic Anchor\" effect: text-based guidance regularizes performance in ultra-low-shot regimes $k < 4$, but degrades accuracy in more-shot settings due to semantic mismatch. Furthermore, we demonstrate the efficacy of this framework as a Cold Start strategy, using VLM-generated labels to bootstrap lightweight supervised models. Notably, the few-shot VLM-based model achieves over correct classification rate of 75 percent for specific drayage categories (20ft, 40ft, and 53ft containers) entirely without the costly training or fine-tuning, significantly reducing the intensive demands of initial manual labeling, thus achieving a method of practical use in ITS applications."

Under a unified set of assumptions combining blockwise Lipschitz geometry, local identifiability, and sub-Gaussian noise, we establish deterministic stability inequalities, global Lipschitz bounds for least-squares misfit functionals, and nonasymptotic concentration estimates. These results yield high-probability parameter error bounds that are intrinsic to the forward operator and independent of any specific reconstruction algorithm. As a concrete instantiation, we verify that the Gaussian Splatting rendering operator satisfies the proposed assumptions and derive explicit constants governing its Lipschitz continuity and resolution-dependent observability. This leads to a fundamental stability--resolution tradeoff, showing that estimation error is inherently constrained by the ratio between image resolution and model complexity. Overall, the analysis characterizes operator-level limits for a broad class of high-dimensional nonlinear inverse problems arising in modern imaging and differentiable rendering."

The FTS-PE is a full-state observer for the pose (position and orientation) and velocities and is obtained through a Lyapunov analysis that shows its stability in finite time and its robustness to bounded measurement noise. Further, this observer is designed directly on the state space, the tangent bundle of the Lie group of rigid body motions, SE(3), without using local coordinates or (dual) quaternion representations. Therefore, it can estimate arbitrary rigid body motions without encountering singularities or the unwinding phenomenon and be readily applied to autonomous vehicles. A version of this observer that does not need translational velocity measurements and uses only point clouds and angular velocity measurements from rate gyros, is also obtained. It is discretized using the framework of geometric mechanics for numerical and experimental implementations. The numerical simulations compare the FTS-PE with a dual-quaternion extended Kalman filter and our previously developed variational pose estimator (VPE). The experimental results are obtained using point cloud images and rate gyro measurements obtained from a Zed 2i stereo depth camera sensor. These results validate the stability and robustness of the FTS-PE."

    "abstract": "The rapid development of visual generative models raises the need for more scalable and human-aligned evaluation methods. While the crowdsourced Arena platforms offer human preference assessments by collecting human votes, they are costly and time-consuming, inherently limiting their scalability. Leveraging vision-language model (VLMs) as substitutes for manual judgments presents a promising solution. However, the inherent hallucinations and biases of VLMs hinder alignment with human preferences, thus compromising evaluation reliability. Additionally, the static evaluation approach lead to low efficiency. In this paper, we propose K-Sort Eval, a reliable and efficient VLM-based evaluation framework that integrates posterior correction and dynamic matching. Specifically, we curate a high-quality dataset from thousands of human votes in K-Sort Arena, with each instance containing the outputs and rankings of K models. When evaluating a new model, it undergoes (K+1)-wise free-for-all comparisons with existing models, and the VLM provide the rankings. To enhance alignment and reliability, we propose a posterior correction method, which adaptively corrects the posterior probability in Bayesian updating based on the consistency between the VLM prediction and human supervision. Moreover, we propose a dynamic matching strategy, which balances uncertainty and diversity to maximize the expected benefit of each comparison, thus ensuring more efficient evaluation. Extensive experiments show that K-Sort Eval delivers evaluation results consistent with K-Sort Arena, typically requiring fewer than 90 model runs, demonstrating both its efficiency and reliability."

In this paper, we explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to accelerate the hardware-software co-design process for PQC, with a focus on the FALCON digital signature scheme. We present a novel framework that leverages LLMs to analyze PQC algorithms, identify performance-critical components, and generate candidate hardware descriptions for FPGA implementation. We present the first quantitative comparison between LLM-driven synthesis and conventional HLS-based approaches for low-level compute-intensive kernels in FALCON, showing that human-in-the-loop LLM-generated accelerators can achieve up to 2.6x speedup in kernel execution time with shorter critical paths, while highlighting trade-offs in resource utilization and power consumption. Our results suggest that LLMs can minimize design effort and development time by automating FPGA accelerator design iterations for PQC algorithms, offering a promising new direction for rapid and adaptive PQC accelerator design on FPGAs."

Current approaches, such as Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), and Discretionary Access Control (DAC), were designed for specific purposes. They cannot effectively manage the dynamic, situation-dependent workflows that modern systems require. In this research, we introduce LLMAC, a new unified approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) to combine these different access control methods into one comprehensive, understandable system. We used an extensive synthetic dataset that represents complex real-world scenarios, including policies for ownership verification, version management, workflow processes, and dynamic role separation. Using Mistral 7B, our trained LLM model achieved outstanding results with 98.5% accuracy, significantly outperforming traditional methods (RBAC: 14.5%, ABAC: 58.5%, DAC: 27.5%) while providing clear, human readable explanations for each decision. Performance testing shows that the system can be practically deployed with reasonable response times and computing resources."

Current systems have a core representational mismatch: content is time-varying, while speaker identity is injected as a static global embedding. We introduce a streamable speech synthesizer that aligns the temporal granularity of identity and content via a content-synchronous, time-varying timbre (TVT) representation. A Global Timbre Memory expands a global timbre instance into multiple compact facets; frame-level content attends to this memory, a gate regulates variation, and spherical interpolation preserves identity geometry while enabling smooth local changes. In addition, a factorized vector-quantized bottleneck regularizes content to reduce residual speaker leakage. The resulting system is streamable end-to-end, with <80 ms GPU latency. Experiments show improvements in naturalness, speaker transfer, and anonymization compared to SOTA streaming baselines, establishing TVT as a scalable approach for privacy-preserving and expressive speech synthesis under strict latency budgets."

The recently surged Generative AI shows promise to mitigate these gaps with its advanced information understanding and generation capabilities. As an exploratory step, we conducted co-design sessions with 20 university students diagnosed with ADHD, followed by interviews with five experts specialized in ADHD intervention. Adopting a metacognitive lens, we examined participants' ideas on GenAI-based task management support and experts' assessments, which led to three design directions: providing cognitive scaffolding to enhance task and self-awareness, promoting reflective task execution for building metacognitive abilities, and facilitating emotional regulation to sustain task engagement. Drawing on these findings, we discuss opportunities for GenAI to support the metacognitive needs of neurodivergent populations, offering future directions for both research and practice."

    "abstract": "In quantum theory, a weak value is a complex number with a somewhat technical definition: it is a ratio whose numerator is the matrix element of a self-adjoint operator and whose denominator is the inner product of a corresponding pair of state vectors. Weak values first appeared in the research literature in a pair of papers in 1987 and 1988, and were originally defined as the results of a special kind of experimental protocol involving non-disturbing measurements combined with an explicit form of post-selection. In the years since, subsequent papers on weak values have produced a number of important practical spin-offs, including new methods for signal amplification and quantum-state tomography. The present work is not concerned with those practical spin-offs, but with historical and ongoing attempts to assign weak values a transparent, single-system interpretation, as well as efforts that invoke weak values to make a number of exotic claims about the properties and behavior of individual quantum systems. This paper challenges these interpretational claims by arguing that they involve several forms of fallacious reasoning."

Progress in AI-assisted psychiatric diagnosis is constrained by the absence of benchmarks that simultaneously provide realistic patient simulation, clinician-verified diagnostic labels, and support for dynamic multi-turn consultation. We present LingxiDiagBench, a large-scale multi-agent benchmark that evaluates LLMs on both static diagnostic inference and dynamic multi-turn psychiatric consultation in Chinese. At its core is LingxiDiag-16K, a dataset of 16,000 EMR-aligned synthetic consultation dialogues designed to reproduce real clinical demographic and diagnostic distributions across 12 ICD-10 psychiatric categories. Through extensive experiments across state-of-the-art LLMs, we establish key findings: (1) although LLMs achieve high accuracy on binary depression--anxiety classification (up to 92.3%), performance deteriorates substantially for depression--anxiety comorbidity recognition (43.0%) and 12-way differential diagnosis (28.5%); (2) dynamic consultation often underperforms static evaluation, indicating that ineffective information-gathering strategies significantly impair downstream diagnostic reasoning; (3) consultation quality assessed by LLM-as-a-Judge shows only moderate correlation with diagnostic accuracy, suggesting that well-structured questioning alone does not ensure correct diagnostic decisions. We release LingxiDiag-16K and the full evaluation framework to support reproducible research at https://github.com/Lingxi-mental-health/LingxiDiagBench."

We propose AgentSkiller, a fully automated framework synthesizing multi-turn interaction data across realistic, semantically linked domains. It employs a DAG-based architecture with explicit state transitions to ensure determinism and recoverability. The pipeline builds a domain ontology and Person-Centric Entity Graph, defines tool interfaces via Service Blueprints for Model Context Protocol servers, and populates environments with consistent databases and strict Domain Policies. A cross-domain fusion mechanism links services to simulate complex tasks. Finally, the pipeline creates user tasks by verifying solution paths, filtering via execution-based validation, and generating queries using a Persona-based Simulator for automated rollout. This produces reliable environments with clear state changes. To demonstrate effectiveness, we synthesized $\\approx$ 11K interaction samples; experimental results indicate that models trained on this dataset achieve significant improvements on function calling over baselines, particularly in larger parameter regimes."

Surface roughness usually manifests in the early stages of film growth and diminishes beyond a critical thickness. In this work, we employ molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) to grow Sn(100) islands with varying thickness N on bilayer graphene-terminated 6H-SiC(0001) substrates. Scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy measurements reveal an inverse surface roughness effect that highlights the interplay of QSE and misfit strain in shaping the surface morphology of Sn(100) islands. For N =< 10, the islands exhibit flat surfaces, while for N >= 26, the island surfaces become corrugated and patterned. For the intermediate range, i.e., 12 =< N =<24, both flat and patterned surfaces coexist, with the percentage coverage of the patterned surface oscillating as a function of N. By performing density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that the unusual surface pattern evolution in our MBE-grown Sn(100) islands is a result of the interplay between QSE-induced surface roughing and tensile strain-induced smoothening effect."

They are obtained through the minimization of a non-smooth convex objective function. As a result, the singularity of the directional derivatives leads to numerical instabilities and poor sample properties as well as surprising `phase transitions' from empirical to population distributions. To solve these issues, we introduce a regularized version of geometric distribution functions and quantiles that are provably close to the usual geometric concepts and share their qualitative properties, both in the empirical and continuous case, while allowing for a much broader applicability of asymptotic results without any moment condition. We also show that any linear assignment of probability measures (such as the univariate distribution function), that is also translation- and orthogonal-equivariant, necessarily coincides with one of our regularized geometric distribution functions."

    "abstract": "The analysis of complex computer simulations, often involving functional data, presents unique statistical challenges. Conventional regression methods, such as function-on-function regression, typically associate functional outcomes with both scalar and functional predictors on a per-realization basis. However, simulation studies often demand a more nuanced approach to disentangle nonlinear relationships of functional outcome with predictors observed at multiple scales: domain-specific functional predictors that are fixed across simulation runs, and realization-specific global predictors that vary between runs. In this article, we develop a novel supervised learning framework tailored to this setting. We propose an additive nonlinear regression model that flexibly captures the influence of both predictor types. The effects of functional predictors are modeled through spatially-varying coefficients governed by a Gaussian process prior. Crucially, to capture the impact of global predictors on the functional outcome, we introduce a functional Gaussian process (fGP) prior. This new prior jointly models the entire collection of unknown, spatially-indexed nonlinear functions that encode the effects of the global predictors over the entire domain, explicitly accounting for their spatial dependence. This integrated architecture enables simultaneous learning from both predictor types, provides a principled strategies to quantify their respective contributions in predicting the functional outcome, and delivers rigorous uncertainty estimates for both model parameters and predictions. The utility and robustness of our approach are demonstrated through multiple synthetic datasets and a real-world application involving outputs from the Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model."

    "abstract": "Effective Field Theories (EFTs) are the primary tool for interpreting precision collider data in the absence of new resonances. However, in the dimension-8 Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), the utility of traditional algebraically minimal bases is fundamentally limited by kinematic mixing: multiple operators contribute to a single high-energy amplitude, creating degeneracies that obscure ultraviolet interpretations and complicate the application of theoretical constraints. We introduce a generative framework that resolves this by constructing operators directly from the conserved Noether currents of the Standard Model. The resulting Kinematically Diagonalized Current Basis (KDCB) ensures that each operator maps to a unique asymptotic energy scaling ($E^4$, $E^2$, $E^0$) in scattering amplitudes. This organization makes S-matrix positivity bounds manifest, enables a stable auxiliary-field formulation for Monte Carlo simulation, and provides direct diagnostics for universal versus non-universal ultraviolet completions through current decomposition. By rotating the operator space into physically interpretable sectors, the KDCB offers a transformative framework for global fits and a clear pathway from high-energy data to the structure of new physics."

Our method requires no auxiliary models or external annotation, instead importance is estimated directly from the policy model's own probability shifts. Experiments on GSM8K across three models spanning the Qwen and Llama families demonstrate consistent improvements over uniform baselines and faster convergence to equivalent accuracy. Inverting the importance signal hurts performance, confirming we capture genuine causal structure rather than noise. Analysis shows the method correctly prioritizes calculation steps over scaffolding text. We view these findings as establishing counterfactual importance weighting as a foundation for further research rather than a complete solution."

We find that an initially unentangled spin-state can evolve into an entangled state. This is contrary to the common case when coupling a quantum system to hot degrees of freedom leads to loss of entanglement and not its generation. Moreover, we show that the generated entanglement is technologically useful as it, in principle, can enhance the sensitivity of measurements beyond the standard quantum limit. This may provide a promising avenue for robust entanglement generation for future technologies."

RADII provides frontier-specific diagnostics: per-radius error profiles pinpoint each architecture's scaling ceiling, surface-interior decomposition tests whether failures originate at boundaries or in bulk, and cross-metric failure sequencing reveals which aspect of structural fidelity breaks first. Benchmarking five state-of-the-art architectures, we find that: (i) all models degrade by ${\\sim}13\\%$ in global positional error beyond training radii, yet local bond fidelity diverges wildly across architectures -- from near-zero to over $2\\times$ collapse; (ii) no two architectures share the same failure sequence, revealing the frontier as a multi-dimensional surface shaped by model family; and (iii) well-behaved models obey a power-law scaling exponent $α\\approx 1/3$ whose in-distribution fit accurately predicts out-of-distribution error, making their frontiers quantitatively forecastable.

Reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning is a key mechanism for improvement, but its effectiveness is fundamentally governed by reward design. Despite its importance, the relationship between reward modeling and core LLM challenges--such as evaluation bias, hallucination, distribution shift, and efficient learning--remains poorly understood. This work argues that reward modeling is not merely an implementation detail but a central architect of reasoning alignment, shaping what models learn, how they generalize, and whether their outputs can be trusted. We introduce Reasoning-Aligned Reinforcement Learning (RARL), a unifying framework that systematizes diverse reward paradigms for multi-step reasoning. Within this framework, we present a taxonomy of reward mechanisms, analyze reward hacking as a pervasive failure mode, and examine how reward signals unify challenges ranging from inference-time scaling to hallucination mitigation. We further critically evaluate existing benchmarks, highlighting vulnerabilities such as data contamination and reward misalignment, and outline directions for more robust evaluation. By integrating fragmented research threads and clarifying the interplay between reward design and fundamental reasoning capabilities, this work provides a foundational roadmap for building reasoning models that are robust, verifiable, and trustworthy."

However, the complexity beyond normal-form games -- in particular, for extensive-form games (EFGs) -- was a long-standing open problem first highlighted by Miltersen and Sørensen (SODA '08). In this paper, we resolve this problem by establishing PPAD- and FIXP$_a$-membership (and hence completeness) of normal-form proper equilibria in two-player and multi-player EFGs respectively. Our main ingredient is a technique for computing a perturbed (proper) best response that can be computed efficiently in EFGs. This is despite the fact that, as we show, computing a best response using the classic perturbation of Kohlberg and Mertens based on the permutahedron is #P-hard even in Bayesian games. In stark contrast, we show that computing a proper equilibrium in polytope games is NP-hard. This marks the first natural class in which the complexity of computing equilibrium refinements does not collapse to that of Nash equilibria, and the first problem in which equilibrium computation in polytope games is strictly harder -- unless there is a collapse in the complexity hierarchy -- relative to extensive-form games."

Current approaches mainly redact all PII, disregarding the fact that some of them may be contextually relevant to the user's question, resulting in a degradation of response quality. Large language models (LLMs) might be able to help determine which PII are relevant, but due to their closed source nature and lack of privacy guarantees, they are unsuitable for sensitive data processing. To achieve privacy-preserving PII detection, we propose CAPID, a practical approach that fine-tunes a locally owned small language model (SLM) that filters sensitive information before it is passed to LLMs for QA. However, existing datasets do not capture the context-dependent relevance of PII needed to train such a model effectively. To fill this gap, we propose a synthetic data generation pipeline that leverages LLMs to produce a diverse, domain-rich dataset spanning multiple PII types and relevance levels. Using this dataset, we fine-tune an SLM to detect PII spans, classify their types, and estimate contextual relevance. Our experiments show that relevance-aware PII detection with a fine-tuned SLM substantially outperforms existing baselines in span, relevance and type accuracy while preserving significantly higher downstream utility under anonymization."

    "abstract": "Equipping embodied agents with the ability to reason about tasks, foresee physical outcomes, and generate precise actions is essential for general-purpose manipulation. While recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have leveraged pre-trained foundation models, they typically focus on either linguistic planning or visual forecasting in isolation. These methods rarely integrate both capabilities simultaneously to guide action generation, leading to suboptimal performance in complex, long-horizon manipulation tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose BagelVLA, a unified model that integrates linguistic planning, visual forecasting, and action generation within a single framework. Initialized from a pretrained unified understanding and generative model, BagelVLA is trained to interleave textual reasoning and visual prediction directly into the action execution loop. To efficiently couple these modalities, we introduce Residual Flow Guidance (RFG), which initializes from current observation and leverages single-step denoising to extract predictive visual features, guiding action generation with minimal latency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BagelVLA outperforms existing baselines by a significant margin on multiple simulated and real-world benchmarks, particularly in tasks requiring multi-stage reasoning."

    "abstract": "Direct fidelity estimation (DFE) is a famous tool for estimating the fidelity with a target pure state. However, such a method generally requires exponentially many sampling copies due to the large magic of the target state. This work proposes a sample- and gate-efficient fidelity estimation algorithm that is affordable within feasible quantum devices. We show that the fidelity estimation with pure states close to the structure of phase states, for which sample-efficient DFE is limited by their strong entanglement and magic, can be done by using $\\mathcal{O}(\\mathrm{poly}(n))$ sampling copies, with a single $n$-qubit fan-out gate. As the target state becomes a phase state, the sampling complexity reaches $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. Such a drastic improvement stems from a crucial step in our scheme, the so-called phase stripping, which can significantly reduce the target-state magic. Furthermore, we convert a complex diagonal gate resource, which is needed to design a phase-stripping-adapted algorithm, into nonlinear classical post-processing of Pauli measurements so that we only require a single fan-out gate. Additionally, as another variant using the nonlinear post-processing, we propose a nonlinear extension of the conventional DFE scheme. Here, the sampling reduction compared to DFE is also guaranteed, while preserving the Pauli measurement as the only circuit resource. We expect our work to contribute to establishing noise-resilient quantum algorithms by enabling a significant reduction in sampling overhead for fidelity estimation under the restricted gate resources, and ultimately to clarifying a fundamental gap between the resource overhead required to understand complex physical properties and that required to generate them."

We study this problem under three feedback models. For each model, we characterize the optimal mistake bound in the realizable setting using an appropriate combinatorial dimension. We then establish a trichotomy of regret bounds across the three models in the agnostic setting. Our results also imply sample complexity bounds for the batch setup that depend on the respective combinatorial dimensions."

We address this gap with a lightweight, fully on-device pipeline that converts natural-language commands into reliable manipulation. Our approach has two stages: (i) the instruction to actions module (Instruct2Act), a compact BiLSTM with a multi-head-attention autoencoder that parses an instruction into an ordered sequence of atomic actions (e.g., reach, grasp, move, place); and (ii) the robot action network (RAN), which uses the dynamic adaptive trajectory radial network (DATRN) together with a vision-based environment analyzer (YOLOv8) to generate precise control trajectories for each sub-action. The entire system runs on a modest system with no cloud services. On our custom proprietary dataset, Instruct2Act attains 91.5% sub-actions prediction accuracy while retaining a small footprint. Real-robot evaluations across four tasks (pick-place, pick-pour, wipe, and pick-give) yield an overall 90% success; sub-action inference completes in < 3.8s, with end-to-end executions in 30-60s depending on task complexity. These results demonstrate that fine-grained instruction-to-action parsing, coupled with DATRN-based trajectory generation and vision-guided grounding, provides a practical path to deterministic, real-time manipulation in resource-constrained, single-camera settings."

In response, we revisit Design-by-Analogy (DbA), a cognitively grounded approach that fosters novel solutions by mapping inspiration across domains. However, prevailing perspectives often restrict DbA to early ideation or specific data modalities, while reducing AI-driven design to simplified input-output pipelines. Such conceptual limitations inadvertently foster widespread design fixation. To address this, we expand the understanding of DbA by embedding it into the entire creative process, thereby demonstrating its capacity to mitigate such fixation. Through a systematic review of 85 studies, we identify six forms of representation and classify techniques across seven stages of the creative process. We further discuss three major application domains: creative industries, intelligent manufacturing, and education and services, demonstrating DbA's practical relevance. Building on this synthesis, we frame DbA as a mediating technology for human-AI collaboration and outline the potential opportunities and inherent risks for advancing creativity support in HCI and design research."

When this assumption fails, their coverage can be quite poor. In this paper, we introduce a new CI for the AR parameter whose coverage probability is completely robust to the initial condition, both asymptotically and in finite samples. This CI pays only a small price in terms of its length when the initial condition is stationary or fixed. The new CI also is robust to conditional heteroskedasticity of the errors."

    "abstract": "Learning-based controllers have achieved impressive performance in agile quadrotor flight but typically rely on massive training in simulation, necessitating accurate system identification for effective Sim2Real transfer. However, even with precise modeling, fixed policies remain susceptible to out-of-distribution scenarios, ranging from external aerodynamic disturbances to internal hardware degradation. To ensure safety under these evolving uncertainties, such controllers are forced to operate with conservative safety margins, inherently constraining their agility outside of controlled settings. While online adaptation offers a potential remedy, safely exploring physical limits remains a critical bottleneck due to data scarcity and safety risks. To bridge this gap, we propose a self-adaptive framework that eliminates the need for precise system identification or offline Sim2Real transfer. We introduce Adaptive Temporal Scaling (ATS) to actively explore platform physical limits, and employ online residual learning to augment a simple nominal model. {Based on the learned hybrid model, we further propose Real-world Anchored Short-horizon Backpropagation Through Time (RASH-BPTT) to achieve efficient and robust in-flight policy updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our quadrotor reliably executes agile maneuvers near actuator saturation limits. The system evolves a conservative base policy with a peak speed of 1.9 m/s to 7.3 m/s within approximately 100 seconds of flight time. These findings underscore that real-world adaptation serves not merely to compensate for modeling errors, but as a practical mechanism for sustained performance improvement in aggressive flight regimes."

Such DS decays into Standard Model (SM) states can modify the late-time thermal history of the IGM, making Lyman-$α$ data a sensitive probe of hidden sectors with cosmologically long lifetimes. Our analysis demonstrates that constraints from late-time IGM heating offer a complementary window to those from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), in constraining dark sector parameter space. We further revisit limits on such decaying DS models from Planck's measurements of the optical depth to reionization and provide updates relevant for DS lifetimes longer than $10^{14}$ s. The model-independent constraints on the DS parameter space we derive in this work can be reinterpreted for a wide range of decaying hidden-sector scenarios, including evaporating primordial black holes and SM-coupled dark photons."

The current estimate of the global warming threshold for the onset of an AMOC collapse is +4C. However, such a threshold may not be meaningful because AMOC stability depends on the rate of radiative forcing and background climate state. Here, we identify an AMOC stabilising mechanism that operates on timescales longer than present-day radiative forcing increase. Slow forcing permits coherent adjustment of surface and interior ocean properties, supported by enhanced evaporation and reduced sea-ice extent, counteracting destabilising feedbacks. This mechanism is explicitly demonstrated in a slow CO2 increase experiment (+0.5 ppm/yr), in which the AMOC remains stable up to +5.5C of global warming. By contrast, under intermediate- and high-emission scenarios, the AMOC collapses at substantially lower warming levels (+2.2C and +2.8C, respectively). Our findings demonstrate the strong radiative forcing path dependence of AMOC tipping and imply that limiting the rate of radiative forcing is critical for reducing the near-term risk of an AMOC collapse."

It has been shown that such sensitivity is maximized when a system operates near the critical point of a phase transition. However, proximity to criticality introduces large fluctuations and diverging timescales. Hence, to leverage the maximal sensitivity, it would require impractically long integration periods. Here, we analytically and computationally demonstrate how the optimal tuning of a recurrent neural network is determined given a finite integration time. Rather than maximizing the theoretically available sensitivity, we find networks attain different sensitivities depending on the available time. Consequently, the optimal dynamic regime can shift away from criticality when integration times are finite, highlighting the necessity of incorporating finite-time considerations into studies of information processing."

The first handles arbitrary adversarial steps and achieves regret $\\tilde{O}(H S^Λ\\sqrt{K S A^{Λ+1}})$, where $K$ is the number of episodes, $S$ is the number of state, $A$ is the number of actions and $H$ is the episode's horizon.

We further give a $K^{2/3}$-regret reduction that removes the need to know which steps are the $Λ$ adversarial steps.

Monitoring models via their stated reasoning is therefore unreliable, and existing bias evaluations typically require predefined categories and hand-crafted datasets. In this work, we introduce a fully automated, black-box pipeline for detecting task-specific unverbalized biases. Given a task dataset, the pipeline uses LLM autoraters to generate candidate bias concepts. It then tests each concept on progressively larger input samples by generating positive and negative variations, and applies statistical techniques for multiple testing and early stopping. A concept is flagged as an unverbalized bias if it yields statistically significant performance differences while not being cited as justification in the model's CoTs. We evaluate our pipeline across six LLMs on three decision tasks (hiring, loan approval, and university admissions). Our technique automatically discovers previously unknown biases in these models (e.g., Spanish fluency, English proficiency, writing formality). In the same run, the pipeline also validates biases that were manually identified by prior work (gender, race, religion, ethnicity). More broadly, our proposed approach provides a practical, scalable path to automatic task-specific bias discovery."

Robo3R jointly infers scale-invariant local geometry and relative camera poses, which are unified into the scene representation in the canonical robot frame via a learned global similarity transformation. To meet the precision demands of manipulation, Robo3R employs a masked point head for sharp, fine-grained point clouds, and a keypoint-based Perspective-n-Point (PnP) formulation to refine camera extrinsics and global alignment. Trained on Robo3R-4M, a curated large-scale synthetic dataset with four million high-fidelity annotated frames, Robo3R consistently outperforms state-of-the-art reconstruction methods and depth sensors.

To enhance data privacy, recent machine learning models have been designed as a Federated Learning (FL) system. On top of that, additional privacy layers can be added, via Differential Privacy (DP). On the other hand, to improve explainability, ML must consider more interpretable approaches with reduced number of features and less complex internal architecture. In this context, this paper aims to achieve a machine learning (ML) model that combines enhanced data privacy with explainability. So, we propose a FL solution, called Federated EXplainable Trees with Differential Privacy (FEXT-DP), that: (i) is based on Decision Trees, since they are lightweight and have superior explainability than neural networks-based FL systems; (ii) provides additional layer of data privacy protection applying Differential Privacy (DP) to the Tree-Based model. However, there is a side effect adding DP: it harms the explainability of the system. So, this paper also presents the impact of DP protection on the explainability of the ML model. The carried out performance assessment shows improvements of FEXT-DP in terms of a faster training, i.e., numbers of rounds, Mean Squared Error and explainability."

    "abstract": "Developing agents capable of open-endedly discovering and learning novel skills is a grand challenge in Artificial Intelligence. While reinforcement learning offers a powerful framework for training agents to master complex skills, it typically relies on hand-designed reward functions. This is infeasible for open-ended skill discovery, where the set of meaningful skills is not known a priori. While recent methods have shown promising results towards automating reward function design, they remain limited to refining rewards for pre-defined tasks. To address this limitation, we introduce Continuous Open-ended Discovery and Evolution of Skills as Hierarchical Reward Programs (CODE-SHARP), a novel framework leveraging Foundation Models (FM) to open-endedly expand and refine a hierarchical skill archive, structured as a directed graph of executable reward functions in code.

When composed by a high-level FM-based planner, the discovered skills enable a single goal-conditioned agent to solve complex, long-horizon tasks, outperforming both pretrained agents and task-specific expert policies by over $134$% on average.

Here, $A$ is a very general operator depending on $u$ and arbitrary higher-order derivatives of $u$, whose growth is governed by an Orlicz function, and $h$ is a lower order term. Combining the theories of pseudomonotone operators with complementary systems, we prove that this eigenvalue problem has an infinite number of eigenfunctions and that the corresponding sequence of eigenvalues tends to infinity. We point out that the $Δ_2$-condition is not assumed for the involved Orlicz functions. Finally, we prove a first regularity result for eigenfunctions by following a De Giorgi's iteration scheme."

Despite some partial improvements, we identify a structural obstruction: the new Peccei-Quinn spurion breaks the accidental isospin symmetry of the chiral Lagrangian, leading to an enhanced higher-order operator. As a consequence, pion scatterings too are distorted. We also examine the limit in which the axion becomes light, finding that it is excluded by fifth-force constraints."

Furthermore, there exists a symplectic form on $X$ compatible with all such pencils, and similarly for the fibrations in $X\\#4\\overline{\\mathbb{CP}^2}$.

    "abstract": "Artifact evaluation has become standard practice in the software engineering community to ensure the reproducibility of research results. However, the current manual process is labor-intensive, and hence, done only as a one-time assessment for a subset of all papers. To support the artifact evaluation effort, we present Artisan, an automated LLM agent for reproducing research results given a paper and its artifact. The approach is enabled by two key contributions: First, we frame the reproduction problem as a code generation task where the goal is to generate a reproduction script that, when executed, reproduces the results reported in a paper. Unlike prior work on automatically reproducing research results in other domains, this formulation allows for running the script independently of the agent and for assessing the reproduction process at a fine-grained level. Second, we design automated judging mechanism that guides the agent toward the expected results without revealing them and that prevent trivial solutions, such as simply copying checked-in results. To evaluate Artisan, we introduce Artisan-Bench, the first benchmark assessing the ability to generate reproduction scripts and the first benchmark for automated artifact evaluation in software engineering. Artisan-Bench comprises 60 tasks derived from 23 software engineering papers, covering different research areas and programming languages. We validate all tasks in Artisan-Bench for reproducibility to ensure that the tasks are feasible. Our experiments show that Artisan is effective, producing 44/60 reproduction scripts and outperforming the best available baseline, a vanilla LLM agent (mini-swe-agent), by 3.14$\\times$ in terms of reproduction scripts generated while taking $0.45 and 48 minutes, on average per task.

We introduce Optimistic World Models (OWMs), a principled and scalable framework for optimistic exploration that brings classical reward-biased maximum likelihood estimation (RBMLE) from adaptive control into deep RL. In contrast to upper confidence bound (UCB)-style exploration methods, OWMs incorporate optimism directly into model learning by augmentation with an optimistic dynamics loss that biases imagined transitions toward higher-reward outcomes. This fully gradient-based loss requires neither uncertainty estimates nor constrained optimization. Our approach is plug-and-play with existing world model frameworks, preserving scalability while requiring only minimal modifications to standard training procedures. We instantiate OWMs within two state-of-the-art world model architectures, leading to Optimistic DreamerV3 and Optimistic STORM, which demonstrate significant improvements in sample efficiency and cumulative return compared to their baseline counterparts."

    "abstract": "Head Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is routinely collected and shared for research under strict regulatory frameworks. These frameworks require removing potential identifiers before sharing. But, even after skull stripping, the brain parenchyma contains unique signatures that can match other MRIs from the same participants across databases, posing a privacy risk if additional data features are available. Current regulatory frameworks often mandate evaluating such risks based on the assessment of a certain level of reasonableness. Prior studies have already suggested that a brain MRI could enable participant linkage, but they have relied on training-based or computationally intensive methods. Here, we demonstrate that linking an individual's skull-stripped T1-weighted MRI, which may lead to re-identification if other identifiers are available, is possible using standard preprocessing followed by image similarity computation. Nearly perfect linkage accuracy was achieved in matching data samples across various time intervals, scanner types, spatial resolutions, and acquisition protocols, despite potential cognitive decline, simulating MRI matching across databases. These results aim to contribute meaningfully to the development of thoughtful, forward-looking policies in medical data sharing."

In this paper, we present a new experimental platform that produces a weakly collisional high-\\b{eta} plasma expected to be susceptible to the whistler heat-flux instability. This platform, to be fielded on the Orion laser, enables characterisation of whistler-regulated thermal conductivity. The platform design is assessed using radiation-magnetohydrodynamics simulations with the code FLASH. Simulations using three thermal conduction models predict conductivity suppression by over an order of magnitude relative to the Spitzer value at whistler saturation, demonstrating the efficacy of the platform."

    "abstract": "In black-box combinatorial optimization, objective evaluations are often expensive, so high quality solutions must be found under a limited budget. Factorization machine with quantum annealing (FMQA) builds a quadratic surrogate model from evaluated samples and optimizes it on an Ising machine. However, FMQA requires binary decision variables, and for nonbinary structures such as integer permutations, the choice of binary encoding strongly affects search efficiency. If the encoding fails to reflect the original neighborhood structure, small Hamming moves may not correspond to meaningful modifications in the original solution space, and constrained problems can yield many infeasible candidates that waste evaluations. Recent work combines FMQA with a binary autoencoder (bAE) that learns a compact binary latent code from feasible solutions, yet the mechanism behind its performance gains is unclear. Using a small traveling salesman problem as an interpretable testbed, we show that the bAE reconstructs feasible tours accurately and, compared with manually designed encodings at similar compression, better aligns tour distances with latent Hamming distances, yields smoother neighborhoods under small bit flips, and produces fewer local optima. These geometric properties explain why bAE+FMQA improves the approximation ratio faster while maintaining feasibility throughout optimization, and they provide guidance for designing latent representations for black-box optimization."

We propose a viewpoint in which both MPNNs and spectral GNNs are understood as different parametrizations of permutation-equivariant operators acting on graph signals. From this perspective, many popular architectures are equivalent in expressive power, while genuine gaps arise only in specific regimes. We further argue that MPNNs and spectral GNNs offer complementary strengths. That is, MPNNs provide a natural language for discrete structure and expressivity analysis using tools from logic and graph isomorphism research, while the spectral perspective provides principled tools for understanding smoothing, bottlenecks, stability, and community structure. Overall, we posit that progress in graph learning will be accelerated by clearly understanding the key similarities and differences between these two types of GNNs, and by working towards unifying these perspectives within a common theoretical and conceptual framework rather than treating them as competing paradigms."

Viola's celebrated construction gives a PRG over the binary field, but with seed length exponential in the degree $d$. This exponential dependence can be avoided over sufficiently large fields. In particular, Dwivedi, Guo, and Volk constructed PRGs with optimal seed length over fields of size exponential in $d$. The latter builds on the framework of Derksen and Viola, who obtained optimal-seed constructions over fields of size polynomial in $d$, although growing with the number of variables $n$. In this work, we construct the first PRG with optimal seed length for degree-$d$ polynomials over fields of polynomial size, specifically $q \\approx d^4$, assuming sufficiently large characteristic. Our construction follows the framework of prior work and reduces the required field size by replacing the hitting-set generator used in previous constructions with a new pseudorandom object. We also observe a threshold phenomenon in the field-size dependence. Specifically, we prove that constructing PRGs over fields of sublinear size, for example $q = d^{0.99}$ where $q$ is a power of two, would already yield PRGs for the binary field with comparable seed length via our reduction, provided that the construction imposes no restriction on the characteristic. While a breakdown of existing techniques has been noted before, we prove that this phenomenon is inherent to the problem itself, irrespective of the technique used."

To bridge this gap, the literature has proposed strongly quasar-convex functions as an intermediate non-convex class, for which accelerated bounds have been suggested to persist. We show that this is not true in general: the additional structure of strong quasar-convexity does not suffice to guaranty better worst-case bounds for momentum compared to gradient descent. As an alternative, we study PL functions under an aiming condition that measures how well the descent direction points toward a minimizer. This perspective clarifies the geometric ingredient enabling provable acceleration by momentum when minimizing PL functions."

    "abstract": "Selective conformal prediction aims to construct prediction sets with valid coverage for a test unit conditional on it being selected by a data-driven mechanism. While existing methods in the offline setting handle any selection mechanism that is permutation invariant to the labeled data, their extension to the online setting -- where data arrives sequentially and later decisions depend on earlier ones -- is challenged by the fact that the selection mechanism is naturally asymmetric. As such, existing methods only address a limited collection of selection mechanisms. In this paper, we propose PErmutation-based Mondrian Conformal Inference (PEMI), a general permutation-based framework for selective conformal prediction with arbitrary asymmetric selection rules. Motivated by full and Mondrian conformal prediction, PEMI identifies all permutations of the observed data (or a Monte-Carlo subset thereof) that lead to the same selection event, and calibrates a prediction set using conformity scores over this selection-preserving reference set. Under standard exchangeability conditions, our prediction sets achieve finite-sample exact selection-conditional coverage for any asymmetric selection mechanism and any prediction model. PEMI naturally incorporates additional offline labeled data, extends to selection mechanisms with multiple test samples, and achieves FCR control with fine-grained selection taxonomies. We further work out several efficient instantiations for commonly-used online selection rules, including covariate-based rules, conformal p/e-values-based procedures, and selection based on earlier outcomes. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our methods across various selection rules on a real drug discovery dataset and investigate their performance via simulations."

We make progress toward this goal by modeling each round of self-improvement as maximum-likelihood fine-tuning on a reward-filtered distribution and deriving finite-sample guarantees for the expected reward. Our analysis reveals an explicit feedback loop where better models accept more data per iteration, supporting sustained self-improvement while explaining eventual saturation of such improvement. Adopting a task-centric view by considering reasoning tasks with multiple difficulty levels, we further prove quantifiable conditions on model initialization, task difficulty, and sample budget where easy-to-hard curricula provably achieve better guarantees than training on fixed mixtures of tasks. Our analyses are validated via Monte-Carlo simulations and controlled experiments on graph-based reasoning tasks."

In this paper, we present a universal formulation of the elementary foundations of thermodynamics, in which entropy and energy are defined and employed beyond equilibrium and without assuming extensivity. The formulation applies to all systems -- large and small, with many or few particles -- and to all states, whether equilibrium or nonequilibrium, by relying on carefully stated operational definitions and existence principles rather than macroscopic idealizations. Key thermodynamic concepts, including adiabatic availability and available energy, are developed and illustrated using the energy-entropy diagram representation of nonequilibrium states, which provides geometric insight into irreversibility and the limits of work extraction for systems of any size. A substantial part of the paper is devoted to the analysis of entropy transfer in non-work interactions, leading to precise definitions of heat interactions and heat-and-diffusion interactions of central importance in mesoscopic continuum theories of nonequilibrium behavior in simple and complex solids and fluids. As a direct consequence of this analysis, Clausius inequalities and the Clausius statement of the second law are derived in forms explicitly extended to nonequilibrium processes. The resulting framework presents thermodynamics as a universal theory whose concepts apply uniformly to all systems, large and small, and provides a coherent foundation for both teaching and modern applications."

    "abstract": "Passive acoustic monitoring has become a key strategy in biodiversity assessment, conservation, and behavioral ecology, especially as Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices enable continuous in situ audio collection at scale. While recent self-supervised learning (SSL)-based audio encoders, such as BEATs and AVES, have shown strong performance in bioacoustic tasks, their computational cost and limited robustness to unseen environments hinder deployment on resource-constrained platforms. In this work, we introduce BioME, a resource-efficient audio encoder designed for bioacoustic applications. BioME is trained via layer-to-layer distillation from a high-capacity teacher model, enabling strong representational transfer while reducing the parameter count by 75%. To further improve ecological generalization, the model is pretrained on multi-domain data spanning speech, environmental sounds, and animal vocalizations. A key contribution is the integration of modulation-aware acoustic features via FiLM conditioning, injecting a DSP-inspired inductive bias that enhances feature disentanglement in low-capacity regimes. Across multiple bioacoustic tasks, BioME matches or surpasses the performance of larger models, including its teacher, while being suitable for resource-constrained IoT deployments. For reproducibility, code and pretrained checkpoints are publicly available."

The cornerstone of our approach is a procedure to obtain a convergent $q$-series representation of elliptic multiple polylogarithms. Its coefficients are expressed in terms of ordinary multiple polylogarithms, which can be evaluated efficiently using existing libraries. In a series of preparation steps the elliptic polylogarithms are mapped into a region where the $q$-series converges rapidly. We also present an implementation of our algorithm into the \\texttt{GiNaC} framework.

    "abstract": "Large reasoning models trained with reinforcement learning and verifiable rewards (RLVR) achieve strong performance on complex reasoning tasks, yet often overthink, generating redundant reasoning without performance gains. Existing trajectory-level length penalties often fail to effectively shorten reasoning length and degrade accuracy, as they uniformly treat all reasoning steps and lack fine-grained signals to distinguish redundancy from necessity. Meanwhile, process-supervised methods are typically resource-intensive and suffer from inaccurate credit assignment. To address these issues, we propose ATTNPO, a low-overhead process-supervised RL framework that leverages the model's intrinsic attention signals for step-level credit assignment. We first identify a set of special attention heads that naturally focus on essential steps while suppressing redundant ones. By leveraging the attention scores of these heads, We then employ two sub-strategies to mitigate overthinking by discouraging redundant steps while preserving accuracy by reducing penalties on essential steps. Experimental results show that ATTNPO substantially reduces reasoning length while significantly improving performance across 9 benchmarks."

We first collected a dataset of function pairs from open-source repositories, but limitations in data quality led us to construct a refined dataset covering eight categories of deprecated APIs. Using this dataset, the Mistral Codestral model was evaluated with CodeBLEU and keyword-based metrics to measure lexical and semantic similarity as well as migration correctness. Results show that the evaluated model (Mistral Codestral) can handle trivial one-to-one API substitutions with moderate success, achieving identical migrations in 11.11% of the cases, but it struggles with more complex migrations such as CORBA or JAX-WS. These findings suggest Mistral Codestral can partially reduce developer effort by automating repetitive migration tasks but cannot yet replace humans within the scope of the JMigBench benchmark. The benchmark and analysis provide a foundation for future work on expanding datasets, refining prompting strategies, and improving migration performance across different LLMs."

To address this gap, we introduce the Laparoscopic Skill Analysis and Assessment (LASANA) dataset, comprising 1270 stereo video recordings of four basic laparoscopic training tasks. Each recording is annotated with a structured skill rating, aggregated from three independent raters, as well as binary labels indicating the presence or absence of task-specific errors. The majority of recordings originate from a laparoscopic training course, thereby reflecting a natural variation in the skill of participants. To facilitate benchmarking of both existing and novel approaches for video-based skill assessment and error recognition, we provide predefined data splits for each task. Furthermore, we present baseline results from a deep learning model as a reference point for future comparisons."

However, efficient tactile data compression, which is essential for real-time robotic applications under strict bandwidth constraints, remains underexplored. The inherent heterogeneity and spatiotemporal complexity of tactile data further complicate this challenge. To bridge this gap, we introduce TaCo, the first comprehensive benchmark for Tactile data Codecs. TaCo evaluates 30 compression methods, including off-the-shelf compression algorithms and neural codecs, across five diverse datasets from various sensor types. We systematically assess both lossless and lossy compression schemes on four key tasks: lossless storage, human visualization, material and object classification, and dexterous robotic grasping. Notably, we pioneer the development of data-driven codecs explicitly trained on tactile data, TaCo-LL (lossless) and TaCo-L (lossy). Results have validated the superior performance of our TaCo-LL and TaCo-L. This benchmark provides a foundational framework for understanding the critical trade-offs between compression efficiency and task performance, paving the way for future advances in tactile perception."

A large fraction of the available data is still largely untouched, due to the complexity of analysis. We describe the latest in-flight calibration of the Compton mode of the INTEGRAL/IBIS telescope, taking into account more than twenty years of data. The spectroscopy and polarization of the standard candle that is the Crab Nebula is analyzed in detail. We operate the IBIS telescope as a Coded mask Compton telescope, using the Crab Nebula to refine the calibration, as is usually done for high-energy instruments. We have determined the spectroscopic and polarimetric properties of the IBIS Compton mode and their evolution along the entire duration of the mission. In addition, the long-term evolution of the Crab Nebula's polarization has been successfully measured and compared with other high-energy experiments. We could estimate the energy dependence of the Crab Nebula polarization in four bands between 200 keV and 1 MeV. In particular, the detection of polarized emissions strictly above 400 keV makes it the highest energy measurement ever performed for the Crab Nebula. A Python library was also made publicly available to analyze processed data."

    "abstract": "We study the half-filled Haldane-Holstein model, where a paradigmatic Chern insulator is coupled to fully dynamical phonons, and provide an unbiased characterization of how retarded electron-phonon interactions destabilize Chern topology. Using determinant quantum Monte Carlo, we find that increasing the coupling drives an abrupt, first-order transition from a Chern insulator to a staggered charge-density wave that acts as a dynamical sublattice (Semenoff) mass. The transition is simultaneously signaled by a nearly quantized many-body Bott index and a real-space local Chern marker constructed from the interacting Green's function, both of which collapse as the charge order parameter becomes extensive. Spectral and open-boundary calculations reveal concomitant gap closing and the loss of boundary spectral weight at the critical coupling. Despite the generic phase problem induced by broken time-reversal symmetry, we show that it remains mild in the low-frequency regime and that the average phase factor sharply tracks the CI-CDW boundary. Our results establish a concrete route by which electron-phonon coupling can trigger a discontinuous collapse of Chern topology and provide experimentally relevant signatures for correlated topological platforms."

Early results from a recent Submillimeter Array (SMA) survey of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) include the first detections of resolved dust continuum emission from individual giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in an external spiral galaxy. This paper updates on the now-complete SMA survey of 80 Herschel-identified giant molecular associations (GMAs) in M31. The SMA survey simultaneously probes dust continuum emission at 230 GHz and the $J = 2 \\rightarrow 1$ transitions of the CO isotopologues, $^{12}\\rm CO$, $^{13}\\rm CO$, and $\\rm C^{18}O$ at a spatial resolution of $\\lesssim 15~\\mathrm{pc}$. Dust continuum emission was detected in 71 cloud cores, of which 26 were resolved. This more than doubles the size of the previous sample. By comparing dust and CO observations with identical astrometry, we directly measure the dust mass to-light ratios, $\\rm α^{\\prime}_{^{12}CO}$, and $\\rm α^{\\prime}_{^{13}CO}$. We derive $<α^{\\prime}_{\\rm ^{12}\\rm CO}>~=~0.070~\\pm~0.031~M_{\\odot}\\,(\\rm K~km~s^{-1}~pc^{2})^{-1}$ and $<α^{\\prime}_{\\rm ^{13}\\rm CO}>~=~0.37~\\pm~0.20~M_{\\odot}\\,(\\rm K~km~s^{-1}~pc^{2})^{-1}$ for the increased sample, which are in agreement with previously reported values. From virial analysis, we find that 80% of the GMC regions traced by resolved dust emission are bound and close to virial equilibrium. Finally, we update our analysis on the metallicity dependence of $\\rm α^{\\prime}_{\\rm CO}$ by combining SMA observations with existing MMT/Hectospec optical spectroscopy toward H II regions. We find no trend in $\\rm α^{\\prime}_{\\rm CO}$ with metallicity, supporting the previous findings."

We show that two-way attention transformers, which alternate between temporal and cross-sectional self-attention, can outperform standard baselines-Lasso, boosting methods, and fully connected multilayer perceptrons-across a wide range of settings, including low signal-to-noise regimes. We further introduce a dynamic sparsification procedure for attention matrices applied during training, and demonstrate that it becomes significantly effective in noisy environments, where the correlation between the target variable and the optimal predictor is on the order of a few percent. Analysis of the learned attention patterns reveals interpretable structure and suggests connections to sparsity-inducing regularization in classical regression, providing insight into why these models generalize effectively under noise."

For the time-like and light-like realizations the deformation induces momentum-dependent effective mass operators, which makes the coordinate-space formulation sensitive to operator ordering. To retain locality and obtain solvable second-order equations we adopt a reverted-product ordering prescription. Closed-form relativistic energy spectra and eigenfunctions are obtained in all three geometries, and the standard Dirac-oscillator results are recovered smoothly in the limit $\\Ep\\to\\infty$. Finally, we derive the nonrelativistic expansion of the positive-energy branch and show that the deformation geometry controls the leading rest-energy shift and the renormalization of the oscillator level spacing."

Theoretically, half of the observed value can be attributed to the exchange enhancement of SOS in a finite-density electron gas, but explaining the rest requires refining the DFT approach. As the conduction band SOS in MoS$_2$ is set by a delicate balance between the contribution of sulphur $p_x$ and $p_y$ orbitals and $d_{z^2}-d_{xz}$ and $d_{z^2}-d_{yz}$ mixing in molybdenum, we use a DFT+U+V framework for fine-tuning the orbital composition of the relevant band-edge states. An optimised choice of Hubbard U/V parameters produces close agreement with the experimentally observed conduction band SOS in MoS$_2$, simultaneously resulting in the valence-band SOS and the quasi-particle band gap which are closer to their values established in the earlier-published experiments."

First, a retrieval-augmented knowledge module incorporates category-specific textual descriptions into the model input, enabling context-aware reasoning over domain-specific defects. Second, an entropy-driven latent reasoning mechanism conducts iterative exploration within a compact latent space using optimizable latent think tokens, guided by an entropy-based reward that encourages confident and stable predictions. Furthermore, a dynamic visual injection strategy selectively incorporates the most informative image patches into the latent sequence, directing the reasoning process toward regions critical for anomaly detection. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Reason-IAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/chenpeng052/Reason-IAD."

Most importantly, our analysis provides direct theoretical evidence that adaptive step-size methods, such as SPS or NGN, are more robust than SGD. This allows us to quantify the advantage of these adaptive methods beyond empirical evaluation. Finally, we show through experiments that our theoretical bound qualitatively mirrors the actual performance as a function of the step size, even for nonconvex problems."

Specifically, ARK evaluates retrieval with both unimodal and multimodal queries and candidates, covering 16 heterogeneous visual data types. To avoid shortcut matching during evaluation, most queries are paired with targeted hard negatives that require multi-step reasoning. We evaluate 23 representative text-based and multimodal retrievers on ARK and observe a pronounced gap between knowledge-intensive and reasoning-intensive retrieval, with fine-grained visual and spatial reasoning emerging as persistent bottlenecks.

Our results indicate that transfer is possible but disproportionate across dialects, which we find to be partially explained by their geographic proximity. Furthermore, we find evidence for negative interference in models trained to support all Arabic dialects.

    "abstract": "Transfer learning in deep reinforcement learning is often motivated by improved stability and reduced training cost, but it can also fail under substantial domain shift. This paper presents a controlled empirical study examining how architectural differences between Double Deep Q-Networks (DDQN) and Dueling DQN influence transfer behavior across environments. Using CartPole as a source task and LunarLander as a structurally distinct target task, we evaluate a fixed layer-wise representation transfer protocol under identical hyperparameters and training conditions, with baseline agents trained from scratch used to contextualize transfer effects. Empirical results show that DDQN consistently avoids negative transfer under the examined setup and maintains learning dynamics comparable to baseline performance in the target environment. In contrast, Dueling DQN consistently exhibits negative transfer under identical conditions, characterized by degraded rewards and unstable optimization behavior. Statistical analysis across multiple random seeds confirms a significant performance gap under transfer. These findings suggest that architectural inductive bias is strongly associated with robustness to cross-environment transfer in value-based deep reinforcement learning under the examined transfer protocol."

    "abstract": "Scientific diagrams convey explicit structural information, yet modern text-to-image models often produce visually plausible but structurally incorrect results. Existing benchmarks either rely on image-centric or subjective metrics insensitive to structure, or evaluate intermediate symbolic representations rather than final rendered images, leaving pixel-based diagram generation underexplored. We introduce SciFlow-Bench, a structure-first benchmark for evaluating scientific diagram generation directly from pixel-level outputs. Built from real scientific PDFs, SciFlow-Bench pairs each source framework figure with a canonical ground-truth graph and evaluates models as black-box image generators under a closed-loop, round-trip protocol that inverse-parses generated diagram images back into structured graphs for comparison. This design enforces evaluation by structural recoverability rather than visual similarity alone, and is enabled by a hierarchical multi-agent system that coordinates planning, perception, and structural reasoning. Experiments show that preserving structural correctness remains a fundamental challenge, particularly for diagrams with complex topology, underscoring the need for structure-aware evaluation."

    "abstract": "Existence of solutions to doubly nonlinear equations in reflexive Banach spaces is established by resorting to a global-in-time variational approach inspired by De Giorgi's principle, which characterizes the associated flows as null-minimizers of a suitable energy-dissipation functional defined on trajectories. In contrast to the celebrated minimizing movements scheme, the proposed strategy does not rely on any time-discretization or iterative constructions. Instead, it provides a direct method based on the relaxation of the problem in spaces of measures, constrained by the continuity equation: in this procedure, no gap is introduced due to the Ambrosio's superposition principle. Within this weak convex framework, the validity of the null-minimization property is recovered through two further steps. First, a careful application of the Von Neumann minimax theorem yields an identification of the dual problem as a supremum over the set of smooth and bounded cylinder functions, solving an Hamilton-Jacobi-type inequality. Secondly, a suitable \"backward boundedness\" property of solutions to such Hamilton-Jacobi system gives a proper bound of the dual problem, ensuring that the minimum value of the original functional is actually zero. The proposed strategy naturally extends to non-autonomous equations, encompassing time- and space-dependent dissipation potentials and time-dependent potential energies."

    "abstract": "Most machine learning approaches to scientific discovery frame hypotheses as end-to-end predictions, obscuring the incremental structure of scientific reasoning. We propose The Hypothesis Game, a symbolic formalism for hypothesis refinement in which LLM agents operate on a shared hypothesis state using a fixed grammar of reasoning moves. The framework is motivated by the observation that scientific progress often proceeds through small, localized revisions, grounded in domain context, rather than extensive rewrites. We instantiate a minimal game with LLM agents and evaluate it on pathway-level mechanistic refinement tasks. In the primary setting of corruption recovery, where hypotheses contain controlled errors, the game-based approach consistently removes more errors and achieves higher precision than strong prompting baselines, while preserving valid structure through incremental edits. In a secondary reconstruction setting from partial cues, it performs comparably to the strongest baseline, indicating that explicit move-based refinement remains competitive even when ground-truth recovery is difficult. These findings support game-based reasoning as a principled route to more controllable, interpretable, and transferable hypothesis refinement systems for scientific discovery."

    "abstract": "Isolated REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) is a key prodromal marker of Parkinson's disease (PD), and video-polysomnography (vPSG) remains the diagnostic gold standard. However, manual sleep staging is particularly challenging in neurodegenerative diseases due to EEG abnormalities and fragmented sleep, making PSG assessments a bottleneck for deploying new RBD screening technologies at scale. We adapted U-Sleep, a deep neural network, for generalizable sleep staging in PD and iRBD. A pretrained U-Sleep model, based on a large publicly available, multisite non-neurodegenerative dataset (PUB; 19,236 PSGs across 12 sites), was fine-tuned on research datasets from two centers (Lundbeck Foundation Parkinson's Disease Research Center (PACE) and the Cologne-Bonn Cohort (CBC); 112 PD, 138 iRBD, 89 age-matched controls. The resulting model was evaluated on an independent dataset from the Danish Center for Sleep Medicine (DCSM; 81 PD, 36 iRBD, 87 sleep-clinic controls). A subset of PSGs with low agreement between the human rater and the model (\\k{appa} < 0.6) was re-scored by a second blinded human rater to identify sources of disagreement. Finally, we applied confidence-based thresholds to optimize REM sleep staging. The pretrained model achieved mean \\k{appa} = 0.81 in PUB, but \\k{appa} = 0.66 when applied directly to PACE/CBC. By fine-tuning the model, we developed a generalized model with \\k{appa} = 0.74 on PACE/CBC (p < 0.001 vs. the pretrained model). In DCSM, mean and median \\k{appa} increased from 0.60 to 0.64 (p < 0.001) and 0.64 to 0.69 (p < 0.001), respectively. In the interrater study, PSGs with low agreement between the model and the initial scorer showed similarly low agreement between human scorers. Applying a confidence threshold increased the proportion of correctly identified REM sleep epochs from 85% to 95.5%, while preserving sufficient (> 5 min) REM sleep for 95% of subjects."

We develop station-level detection probabilities using logistic regression and combine them across a seismic network to compute spatial magnitude-of-completeness fields. We apply this approach to two catalogs from the 2016-2017 Central Italy sequence that were constructed from the same seismic network, one routine and one ML based. At the station level, the ML picker increases detection sensitivity by identifying smaller magnitude events and detecting earthquakes at greater distances. Spatially, the magnitude-of-completeness decreases substantially, with median values shifting from 1.6 to 0.5 for P waves and from 1.7 to 0.5 for S waves. However, the ML catalog also shows greater variability in station-level performance than the routine catalog. These results demonstrate that ML-based improvements in detectability are widespread but spatially non-uniform, highlighting their benefits, their limitations, and the potential for further improvements."

    "abstract": "Scaling up model parameters has long been a prevalent training paradigm driven by the assumption that larger models yield superior generation capabilities. However, under lossy context compression in a compressor-decoder setup, we observe a Size-Fidelity Paradox: increasing the compressor size can lessen the faithfulness of reconstructed contexts though training loss decreases. Through extensive experiments across models from 0.6B to 90B, we coin this paradox arising from two dominant factors: 1) knowledge overwriting: larger models increasingly replace source facts with their own prior beliefs, e.g., ``the white strawberry'' $\\to$ ``the red strawberry''; and 2) semantic drift: larger models tend to paraphrase or restructure content instead of reproducing it verbatim, e.g., ``Alice hit Bob'' $\\to$ ``Bob hit Alice''. By holding model size fixed, we reflect on the emergent properties of compressed context representations. We show that the culprit is not parameter count itself, but the excessive semantic capacity and amplified generative uncertainty that accompany scaling. Specifically, the increased rank of context embeddings facilitates prior knowledge intrusion, whereas higher entropy over token prediction distributions promotes rewriting. Our results complement existing evaluations over context compression paradigm, underpinning a breakdown in scaling laws for faithful preservation in open-ended generation."

This study presents a novel approach that combines 4D-STEM tomography with object tracking and segmentation algorithms to overcome these limitations and achieve single-crystalline 3D ED datasets from nanopowder samples. The method and data quality are assessed on brookite TiO2 nanorods and beam-sensitive CsPbBr3 nanoparticles. To finely sample the reciprocal-space, the data acquisition was automated to acquire hundreds of 4D-STEM scans using a slightly convergent beam and at fine tilt steps. The proposed method provides enhanced signal-to-noise ratio, low illumination time for reducing beam damage, and the ability to analyze multiple particles from a single tomographic dataset. The procedure is optimized to be feasible using commercially available desktops and detectors. This extends the method applicability in the community to the systems and samples that were previously inaccessible for conventional 3D ED methods, particularly breaking the technical challenges for the data acquisition."

In this paper, we present asymptotic analysis of the Gaussian kernel matrix in high dimension under a statistical model of noisy data. The main result is a nice combination of Karoui's asymptotic analysis with procedures of constrained low rank matrix approximations. More specifically, Karouli clarified an important asymptotic structure of the Gaussian kernel matrix, leading to strong consistency of the eigenvectors, though the eigenvalues are inconsistent. This paper focuses on the above results and presents a consistent estimator with the use of the smallest eigenvalue, whenever the target kernel matrix tends to low rank in the asymptotic regime. Importantly, asymptotic analysis is given under a statistical model representing partial noise. Although a naive estimator is inconsistent, applying an optimization method for low rank approximations with constraints, we overcome the difficulty caused by the inconsistency, resulting in a new estimator with strong consistency in rank deficient cases."

Most studies on LSC focus on improving the performance of estimating the degree of LSC, however, it is often difficult to interpret how the meaning of a word change. Enhancing the interpretability of LSC is a significant challenge as it could lead to novel insights in this field. To tackle this challenge, we propose a method to map the semantic space of contextualized embeddings of words obtained by a pre-trained language model to a neurobiological feature space. In the neurobiological feature space, each dimension corresponds to a primitive feature of words, and its value represents the intensity of that feature. This enables humans to interpret LSC systematically. When employed for the estimation of the degree of LSC, our method demonstrates superior performance in comparison to the majority of the previous methods. In addition, given the high interpretability of the proposed method, several analyses on LSC are carried out. The results demonstrate that our method not only discovers interesting types of LSC that have been overlooked in previous studies but also effectively searches for words with specific types of LSC."

SNN models with either axonal or dendritic delays achieve up to $95.58\\%$ on the Google Speech Command (GSC) and $80.97\\%$ on the Spiking Speech Command (SSC) datasets, matching or exceeding prior methods based on synaptic delays or more complex neuron models.

We find that axonal delays offer the most favorable trade-off, combining lower buffering requirements with slightly higher accuracy than dendritic delays. We further show that the performance of axonal and dendritic delay models is largely preserved under strong delay sparsity, with as few as $20\\%$ of delays remaining active, further reducing buffering requirements. Overall, our results indicate that learnable axonal and dendritic delays provide a resource-efficient and effective mechanism for temporal representation in SNNs.

Using Fourier ptychographic microscopy (FPM) and lensless digital holographic microscopy with pixel super-resolution (LDHM-PSR), we demonstrate markedly improved high-throughput visualization of microstructural features after GTS immersion compared with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The improvement is confirmed quantitatively by a significant increase in the one-pixel-lag autocorrelation of phase-gradient values, indicating reduced scattering-driven phase artifacts and enhanced structural continuity in reconstructed phase maps. We further show that GTS is stable for months at room temperature, provides instant yet durable clearing that improves over time, and can be removed by brief PBS washing, enabling downstream multimodal analyses on the same specimen. Finally, we benchmark GTS against the state-of-the-art clearing agent Ce3D, highlighting GTS as a low-cost, safe, operationally straightforward alternative with strong potential for routine, high-throughput QPI-based histopathology workflows."

Under an applied external field, the Kitaev spin liquids turn into a topologically non-trivial chiral spin-liquid state with non-abelian anionic excitations, which is crucial for quantum computing. Earlier theoretical predictions advocated that Kitaev physics can be realized in spin-orbit-coupled Mott insulators such as honeycomb irradiates and ruthenates. However, the experimental findings continuously challenge the theoretical aspects, indicating the presence of non-Kitaev interactions in real materials, where the dimensionality, disorder (vacancy), chemical composition, generalized spin-S, and external perturbations (pressure, magnetic field, temperature) can actively tune the Kitaev interactions and the ground state excitations.

    "abstract": "Rolling element bearings are critical components in rotating machinery, and their condition significantly influences system performance, reliability, and operational lifespan. Timely and accurate fault detection is essential to prevent unexpected failures and reduce maintenance costs. Traditional diagnostic methods often rely on manual feature extraction and shallow classifiers, which may be inadequate for capturing the complex patterns embedded in raw vibration signals. In this study, a compact one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) is developed for automated bearing fault diagnosis using raw time-domain vibration data, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering. The model is trained and evaluated on two established benchmark datasets: the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) dataset and the Paderborn University (PU) dataset. The CWRU data were segmented based on four distinct motor load conditions (0 HP to 3 HP), with each load scenario trained and tested independently to ensure strict separation and prevent data leakage. The CNN achieved high average test accuracies of 99.14%, 98.85%, 97.42%, and 95.14% for 0 HP, 1 HP, 2 HP, and 3 HP, respectively. On the PU dataset, known for its naturally induced faults and greater operational variability the model achieved a robust average testing accuracy of 95.63%. These results affirm the model ability to generalize across datasets and varying operating conditions. Further improvements were observed through hyperparameter tuning, particularly window length and training epochs, underscoring the importance of tailored configurations for specific datasets and load conditions. Overall, the proposed method demonstrates the effectiveness and scalability of 1D CNNs for real-time, data-driven bearing fault diagnosis, offering a reliable foundation for condition monitoring in industrial applications."

CS-LSTMs are built upon a noise decomposition strategy and jointly leverage contextual dependencies and seasonal patterns, thereby strengthening the detection of subtle anomalies. By integrating both time-domain and frequency-domain representations, CS-LSTMs achieve more accurate modeling of periodic trends and anomaly localization.

    "abstract": "Beamforming (BF) is essential for enhancing system capacity in fifth generation (5G) and beyond wireless networks, yet exhaustive beam training in ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems incurs substantial overhead. To address this challenge, we propose a deep learning based framework that leverages position-aware features to improve beam prediction accuracy while reducing training costs. The proposed approach uses spatial coordinate labels to supervise a position extraction branch and integrates the resulting representations with beam-domain features through a feature fusion module. A dual-branch RegNet architecture is adopted to jointly learn location related and communication features for beam prediction. Two fusion strategies, namely adaptive fusion and adversarial fusion, are introduced to enable efficient feature integration. The proposed framework is evaluated on datasets generated by the DeepMIMO simulator across four urban scenarios at 3.5 GHz following 3GPP specifications, where both reference signal received power and user equipment location information are available. Simulation results under both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently outperforms traditional baselines and achieves more accurate and robust beam prediction by effectively incorporating positioning information."

    "abstract": "Urban energy systems face increasing challenges due to high penetration of renewable energy sources, extreme weather events, and other high-impact, low-probability disruptions. This project proposes a community-centered, open-access framework to enhance the resilience and reliability of urban power and gas networks by integrating microgrid partitioning, mobile energy storage deployment, and data-driven risk assessment. The approach involves converting passive distribution networks into active, self-healing microgrids using distributed energy resources and remotely controlled switches to enable flexible reconfiguration during normal and emergency operations. To address uncertainties from intermittent renewable generation and variable load, an adjustable interval optimization method combined with a column and constraint generation algorithm is developed, providing robust planning solutions without requiring probabilistic information. Additionally, a real-time online risk assessment tool is proposed, leveraging 25 multi-dimensional indices including load, grid status, resilient resources, emergency response, and meteorological factors to support operational decision-making during extreme events. The framework also optimizes the long-term sizing and allocation of mobile energy storage units while incorporating urban traffic data for effective routing during emergencies. Finally, a novel time-dependent resilience and reliability index is introduced to quantify system performance under diverse operating conditions. The proposed methodology aims to enable resilient, efficient, and adaptable urban energy networks capable of withstanding high-impact disruptions while maximizing operational and economic benefits."

RANT combines particle-filter localisation, a behaviour-based controller with gradient-driven hotspot exploitation, and a lightweight no-revisit coordination mechanism based on virtual pheromone blocking. We experimentally analyse how team size, localisation fidelity, and coordination influence coverage, hotspot recall, and redundancy. Results show that particle filtering is essential for reliable hotspot engagement, coordination substantially reduces overlap, and increasing team size improves coverage but yields diminishing returns due to interference."

In this work, a field-material couple neural network (FMCNN) is proposed to retrieve the complex dielectric constant directly from THz measurements. The FMCNN consists of a field neural network and a material neural network that are strongly coupled through the frequency-domain Maxwell equations in the form of a Helmholtz equation, with the governing physics enforced by partial differential equation (PDE) and boundary condition constraints. This formulation enables prior-free and data-free inversion, requiring only measured test data as input. The extracted dielectric constants are validated by comparison with results from a one-dimensional normal-incidence model and the Drude-Lorentz model, showing good agreement over a broad frequency range, particularly above 0.2 THz. These results demonstrate that the FMCNN provides a physics-consistent and data-efficient approach for material parameter extraction in the THz band, offering an alternative to conventional model-based methods."

To investigate these phenomena, we utilize a modified version of the Schnakenberg model called the ligand internalisation (LI) model. In a one-dimensional domain, a linear relationship has been observed between the gene expression time delay and the time it takes for patterns to form. We extend the model to the two-dimensional domain and confirm that a similar relationship holds there as well. However, our exploration reveals a non-monotonic correlation between domain size and the time required for pattern emergence. To unravel these dynamics, we consider a range of initial conditions, including random perturbations of the spatially homogeneous steady state and initial conditions from its unstable manifold. We compute a two-parameter chart of patterns with respect to time delay and domain size."

Recent discussions at the Magnet Technology Conference (MT29) in Boston (2025) highlighted the need for standardized characterization of these tapes. Without a shared understanding of the physical phenomena governing critical currents, progress in this area remains difficult. We propose to analyze existing data using a model that explains most observed features. Although the model proposed by P. Mathieu and Y. Simon was published 20 years ago, it remains relatively unknown among engineers in the field, despite many physicists being convinced of its validity, a consensus not reflected in the literature. The Mathieu Simon (MS) model emphasizes the importance of surface pinning mechanisms, which dominate critical currents across the entire phase diagram of YBaCuO. Unlike strong and weak pinning mechanisms, which are commonly assumed to be dominant, the MS model accurately predicts the order of magnitude of experimentally measured values, suggesting it should at least be considered as the dominant mechanism. The results of calculations based on this model are presented and compared with experimental data, offering directions for the development of new materials."

Assuming that the data distribution has low intrinsic dimensionality, we prove that blind denoising diffusion models (BDDMs), despite not having access to the noise amplitude, \\emph{automatically} track a particular \\emph{implicit} noise schedule along the reverse process. Our analysis shows that BDDMs can accurately sample from the data distribution in polynomially many steps as a function of the intrinsic dimension. Empirical results corroborate these mathematical findings on both synthetic and image data, demonstrating that the noise variance is accurately estimated from the noisy image. Remarkably, we observe that schedule-free BDDMs produce samples of higher quality compared to their non-blind counterparts. We provide evidence that this performance gain arises because BDDMs correct the mismatch between the true residual noise (of the image) and the noise assumed by the schedule used in non-blind diffusion models."

Its class of fibrant objects is generated by the weakly Ding injective $R$-modules, a class of modules recently studied by Iacob. We give several characterizations of the fibrant modules, one being that they are the cycle modules of certain acyclic complexes of FP-injective (i.e., absolutely pure) $R$-modules. In the case that $R$ is a Ding-Chen ring, we show that they are precisely the modules appearing as cycles of acyclic complexes of FP-injectives. This leads to a new description of the stable module category of a Ding-Chen ring $R$, by way of modules we call Gorenstein FP-pro-injective. These are modules that appear as a cycle module of a totally acyclic complex of FP-projective-injective modules. As a completely separate application of the new model category method, we show that all complete cotorsion pairs, even non-hereditary ones, lift to abelian models for the derived category of a ring."

    "abstract": "The rapid expansion of GPU-accelerated computing has enabled major advances in large-scale artificial intelligence (AI), while heightening concerns about how accelerators are observed or governed once deployed. Governance is essential to ensure that large-scale compute infrastructure is not silently repurposed for training models, circumventing usage policies, or operating outside legal oversight. Because current GPUs expose limited trusted telemetry and can be modified or virtualized by adversaries, we explore whether compute-based measurements can provide actionable signals of utilization when host and device are untrusted. We introduce a measurement framework that leverages architectural characteristics of modern GPUs to generate timing- and memory-based observables that correlate with compute activity. Our design draws on four complementary primitives: (1) a probabilistic, workload-driven mechanism inspired by Proof-of-Work (PoW) to expose parallel effort, (2) sequential, latency-sensitive workloads derived via Verifiable Delay Functions (VDFs) to characterize scalar execution pressure, (3) General Matrix Multiplication (GEMM)-based tensor-core measurements that reflect dense linear-algebra throughput, and (4) a VRAM-residency test that distinguishes on-device memory locality from off-chip access through bandwidth-dependent hashing. These primitives provide statistical and behavioral indicators of GPU engagement that remain observable even without trusted firmware, enclaves, or vendor-controlled counters. We evaluate their responses to contention, architectural alignment, memory pressure, and power overhead, showing that timing shifts and residency latencies reveal meaningful utilization patterns. Our results illustrate why compute-based telemetry can complement future accountability mechanisms by exposing architectural signals relevant to post-deployment GPU governance."

The main tools in our proofs are Demazure crystals, and the recently defined shuffle tableaux of Nguyen and Pylyavskyy. In order to prove our main results, we must develop a new characterization of Demazure crystals, which builds off of prior work of Assaf and Gonzalez. This characterization may be useful in other contexts."

They noted that if each of the quadratic irrationals $A$, $B$ and $C$ is replaced by their conjugates, that is, each number $a+b\\sqrt{61}$ is changed to $a-b\\sqrt{61}$, then the resulting series also converges to a rational multiple of $1/π$. They gave several other examples of quadratic irrational series for $1/π$, and noted that the conjugate series converges to another rational multiple of $1/π$ or in some cases the conjugate series diverges. The purpose of this work is to provide an explanation and classification of such series. Our classification includes Ramanujan's 17 original series, as well as series of the Borweins, Chudnovskys, Sato and others.

The recognition processing part adopts a clustering based approach to recognize middle-points that delimit the line-segments that construct the illustrated curves. The analysis processing part parses the extracted line-segments of curves to capture behavioral features such as direction, trend and etc. These associations assist the conversion of recognized segments' relations into attributed graphs, for the preservation of the curves' structural characteristics.

As a first result, we prove the global well-posedness of the Cauchy problem with initial data near equilibrium in the full-frequency $L^{p}$-type critical Besov space \\emph{without relying on hyperbolic symmetrization}. Compared with the Poisson-free case studied in several milestone works [Charve and Danchin, Arch. Rational Mech. Anal., 198 (2010), 233-271; Chen, Miao and Zhang, Commun. Pure Appl. Math., 63 (2010), 1173-1224; Haspot, Arch. Rational Mech.

This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first result in compressible fluids that allows the initial velocity field to be highly oscillatory across all frequencies. Furthermore, stemming from the Poisson coupling, the density and velocity exhibit distinct low-frequency behaviors. Motivated by this feature, we propose a general $L^p$-type low-frequency assumption and establish the optimal convergence rates of global solutions toward equilibrium. For a broad class of indices, this assumption yields faster decay than those obtained under the classical $L^1$ framework. To this end, we develop a time-weighted energy method, which is of interest and enables us to capture maximal decay estimates without additional smallness of initial data."

Rather than attempting to checkpoint quantum states, our approach redefines checkpointing as a control flow and algorithmic state problem. By exploiting mid-circuit measurements, classical feed forward, and conditional execution supported by dynamic circuits, we capture sufficient program state to allow correct restoration of quantum workflows after interruption or failure. This design aligns naturally with iterative and staged quantum algorithms such as variational eigensolvers, quantum approximate optimization, and time-stepping methods commonly used in quantum simulation and scientific computing."

However, recent studies show that knowledge-extraction attacks can recover sensitive knowledge-base content through maliciously crafted queries, raising serious concerns about intellectual property theft and privacy leakage. While prior work has explored individual attack and defense techniques, the research landscape remains fragmented, spanning heterogeneous retrieval embeddings, diverse generation models, and evaluations based on non-standardized metrics and inconsistent datasets. To address this gap, we introduce the first systematic benchmark for knowledge-extraction attacks on RAG systems. Our benchmark covers a broad spectrum of attack and defense strategies, representative retrieval embedding models, and both open- and closed-source generators, all evaluated under a unified experimental framework with standardized protocols across multiple datasets. By consolidating the experimental landscape and enabling reproducible, comparable evaluation, this benchmark provides actionable insights and a practical foundation for developing privacy-preserving RAG systems in the face of emerging knowledge extraction threats.

    "abstract": "Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) based Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved superior performance, yet the massive memory overhead caused by storing multiple expert networks severely hinders their practical deployment. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)-based compression has emerged as a promising post-training technique; however, most existing methods apply uniform rank allocation or rely solely on static weight properties. This overlooks the substantial heterogeneity in expert utilization observed in MoE models, where frequent routing patterns and intrinsic information density vary significantly across experts. In this work, we propose RFID-MoE, an effective framework for MoE compression by exploiting heterogeneous Routing Frequency and Information Density. We first introduce a fused metric that combines expert activation frequency with effective rank to measure expert importance, adaptively allocating higher ranks to critical expert groups under a fixed budget. Moreover, instead of discarding compression residuals, we reconstruct them via a parameter-efficient sparse projection mechanism to recover lost information with minimal parameter overhead. Extensive experiments on representative MoE LLMs (e.g., Qwen3, DeepSeekMoE) across multiple compression ratios demonstrate that RFID-MoE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods like MoBE and D2-MoE. Notably, RFID-MoE achieves a perplexity of 16.92 on PTB with the Qwen3-30B model at a 60% compression ratio, reducing perplexity by over 8.0 compared to baselines, and improves zero-shot accuracy on HellaSwag by approximately 8%."

Many existing approaches attempt to compensate through manual data augmentation or additional server-side constraints, but these strategies either introduce limited semantic diversity or increase system overhead. To overcome these challenges, we propose \\textbf{LUMOS}, a parameter-isolated FedSeqRec architecture that integrates large language models (LLMs) as \\emph{local semantic generators}. Instead of sharing gradients or auxiliary parameters, LUMOS privately invokes an on-device LLM to construct three complementary sequence variants from each user history: (i) \\emph{future-oriented} trajectories that infer plausible behavioural continuations, (ii) \\emph{semantically equivalent rephrasings} that retain user intent while diversifying interaction patterns, and (iii) \\emph{preference-inconsistent counterfactuals} that serve as informative negatives. These synthesized sequences are jointly encoded within the federated backbone through a tri-view contrastive optimisation scheme, enabling richer representation learning without exposing sensitive information. Experimental results across three public benchmarks show that LUMOS achieves consistent gains over competitive centralised and federated baselines on HR@20 and NDCG@20. In addition, the use of semantically grounded positive signals and counterfactual negatives improves robustness under noisy and adversarial environments, even without dedicated server-side protection modules. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of LLM-driven semantic generation as a new paradigm for advancing privacy-preserving federated recommendation."

    "abstract": "Machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of a designated forget set from a trained model while preserving utility on the retained data. In modern deep networks, approximate unlearning frequently fails under large or adversarial deletions due to pronounced layer-wise heterogeneity: some layers exhibit stable, well-regularized representations while others are brittle, undertrained, or overfit, so naive update allocation can trigger catastrophic forgetting or unstable dynamics. We propose Statistical-Roughness Adaptive Gradient Unlearning (SRAGU), a mechanism-first unlearning algorithm that reallocates unlearning updates using layer-wise statistical roughness operationalized via heavy-tailed spectral diagnostics of layer weight matrices. Starting from an Adaptive Gradient Unlearning (AGU) sensitivity signal computed on the forget set, SRAGU estimates a WeightWatcher-style heavy-tailed exponent for each layer, maps it to a bounded spectral stability weight, and uses this stability signal to spectrally reweight the AGU sensitivities before applying the same minibatch update form. This concentrates unlearning motion in spectrally stable layers while damping updates in unstable or overfit layers, improving stability under hard deletions. We evaluate unlearning via behavioral alignment to a gold retrained reference model trained from scratch on the retained data, using empirical prediction-divergence and KL-to-gold proxies on a forget-focused query set; we additionally report membership inference auditing as a complementary leakage signal, treating forget-set points as should-be-forgotten members during evaluation."

Under plausible assumptions, $APX_1$ is strictly weaker than previously proposed frameworks, such as the theory $APC_1$ introduced in the seminal work of Jerabek (2007). From a computational standpoint, $APX_1$ is closely tied to approximate counting and to the central question in derandomization, the prBPP versus prP problem, whereas $APC_1$ is linked to the dual weak pigeonhole principle and to the existence of Boolean functions with exponential circuit complexity. A key motivation for introducing $APX_1$ is that its weaker axioms expose finer proof-theoretic structure, making it a natural setting for several lines of research, including unprovability of complexity conjectures and reverse mathematics of randomized lower bounds. In particular, the framework we develop for $APX_1$ enables the formulation of precise questions concerning the provability of prBPP=prP in deterministic feasible mathematics. Since the (un)provability of P versus NP in bounded arithmetic has long served as a central theme in the field, we expect this line of investigation to be of particular interest. Our technical contributions include developing a comprehensive foundation for probabilistic reasoning from weaker axioms, formalizing non-trivial results from theoretical computer science in $APX_1$, and establishing a tailored witnessing theorem for its provably total TFNP problems. As a byproduct of our analysis of the minimal proof-theoretic strength required to formalize statements arising in theoretical computer science, we resolve an open problem regarding the provability of $AC^0$ lower bounds in $PV_1$, which was considered in earlier works by Razborov (1995), Krajicek (1995), and Muller and Pich (2020)."

This model acts as a simplified representation of an enveloped virus bearing peplomers immersed in a coarse-grained fluid. Using dissipative particle dynamics, we explicitly study the hydrodynamic effects on the rotational diffusion of this virus-inspired particle subjected to oscillatory shear flow and confined between two solid-like surfaces. Since the rotational response depends on the type of imposed flow, we first characterize the oscillatory shear, identifying distinct flow regimes in terms of the so-called Péclet number, $Pe$. Our findings indicate that, under confinement, the rotational diffusivity is strongly modulated by the oscillatory flow amplitude and only weakly affected by the number of peplomers, since their effect is mainly determined by their dimeric structure and associated effective size. For high $Pe$, the rotational diffusion coefficient, $D_{r}$, tends to decrease as the number of peplomers ($N_{s}$) increases, whereas at low $Pe$, rotational diffusion becomes weakly dependent on the number of peplomers. However, at intermediate values of $Pe$, the interplay between oscillatory forcing and thermal fluctuations prevents the emergence of a clear trend between $D_{r}$ and $N_{s}$. Our results provide a clear picture of how, in confined environments, the interplay between fluid flow and thermal fluctuations affects the rotational diffusion of spiked particles, thereby helping to explain how fluid conditions can modify the alignment of peplomers with their potential targets."

Next, we study how the Laplacian mechanism impacts the geometry of token representations using various tools: 1) principal component analysis, 2) cosine similarity metric, 3) analysis of variance, and 4) Neural Collapse metrics. Our investigation shows that the Laplacian mechanism reshapes token embeddings toward a geometry of maximal separability: tokens collapse according to their classes, and the class means exhibit Neural Collapse."

While existing research demonstrates that jailbreak attacks succeed, it does not explain \\textit{where} defenses fail or \\textit{why}. To address this gap, we propose that LLM safety operates as a sequential pipeline with distinct checkpoints. We introduce the \\textbf{Four-Checkpoint Framework}, which organizes safety mechanisms along two dimensions: processing stage (input vs.\\ output) and detection level (literal vs.\\ intent). This creates four checkpoints, CP1 through CP4, each representing a defensive layer that can be independently evaluated. We design 13 evasion techniques, each targeting a specific checkpoint, enabling controlled testing of individual defensive layers. Using this framework, we evaluate GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro across 3,312 single-turn, black-box test cases. We employ an LLM-as-judge approach for response classification and introduce Weighted Attack Success Rate (WASR), a severity-adjusted metric that captures partial information leakage overlooked by binary evaluation. Our evaluation reveals clear patterns. Traditional Binary ASR reports 22.6\\% attack success. However, WASR reveals 52.7\\%, a 2.3$\\times$ higher vulnerability. Output-stage defenses (CP3, CP4) prove weakest at 72--79\\% WASR, while input-literal defenses (CP1) are strongest at 13\\% WASR. Claude achieves the strongest safety (42.8\\% WASR), followed by GPT-5 (55.9\\%) and Gemini (59.5\\%). These findings suggest that current defenses are strongest at input-literal checkpoints but remain vulnerable to intent-level manipulation and output-stage techniques. The Four-Checkpoint Framework provides a structured approach for identifying and addressing safety vulnerabilities in deployed systems."

This is achieved while at the same time providing relevant additional features, namely an improved order of convergence for the (asymptotic) diffusion-dominated regime, a small stencil (owing to the absence of inter-element penalty terms), and the possibility to significantly reduce the size of the algebraic problems through static condensation.

Our main results provide sufficient conditions for shellability and related decomposability properties of $t$-clique-free complexes. In particular, we show that if $G$ is a $t$-diamond-free chordal graph (in particular, a block graph), then $\\mathsf{CF}_t(G)$ is $(t-2)$-decomposable and hence shellable. We also investigate how graph modifications via clique attachments influence shellability. Generalizing earlier constructions involving whiskers and clique extensions, we introduce the following operation: given a graph $H$, a subset $S \\subseteq V(H)$, and an integer $t \\ge 2$, we form a graph $\\operatorname{Cl}(H,S,t)$ by attaching to each vertex in $S$ a clique of size at least $t$. We prove that $\\mathsf{CF}_t(H\\setminus S)$ is shellable if and only if $\\mathsf{CF}_t(\\operatorname{Cl}(H,S,t))$ is shellable.

In addition, we extend the notion of clique whiskering and show that for any graph admitting a clique vertex-partition, the resulting $t$-clique whiskering produces a pure and shellable, and hence Cohen-Macaulay, $t$-clique-free complex. Finally, we establish a Fröberg-type result linking chordality and linear resolutions.

UniShare models the share probability through an enhanced representation learning module that incorporates pre-trained GNN and multi-modal embeddings, alongside explicit bilateral interest and relationship matching. A key innovation is our joint training paradigm, which leverages signals from both tasks to mutually enhance each other, mitigating data sparsity and improving bilateral satisfaction.

Although optical tactile sensors are uniquely capable of providing such rich information, existing tactile datasets and models remain limited. These resources primarily focus on object-level attributes (e.g., material) while largely overlooking fine-grained tactile temporal dynamics during physical interactions. We consider that advancing dynamic tactile perception requires a systematic hierarchy of dynamic perception capabilities to guide both data collection and model design. To address the lack of tactile data with rich dynamic information, we present ToucHD, a large-scale hierarchical tactile dataset spanning tactile atomic actions, real-world manipulations, and touch-force paired data. Beyond scale, ToucHD establishes a comprehensive tactile dynamic data ecosystem that explicitly supports hierarchical perception capabilities from the data perspective. Building on it, we propose AnyTouch 2, a general tactile representation learning framework for diverse optical tactile sensors that unifies object-level understanding with fine-grained, force-aware dynamic perception. The framework captures both pixel-level and action-specific deformations across frames, while explicitly modeling physical force dynamics, thereby learning multi-level dynamic perception capabilities from the model perspective. We evaluate our model on benchmarks that covers static object properties and dynamic physical attributes, as well as real-world manipulation tasks spanning multiple tiers of dynamic perception capabilities-from basic object-level understanding to force-aware dexterous manipulation.

Unlike free-space electromagnetic waves, whose polarization degeneracy enables flexible polarization manipulation, planar integrated optical structures lack such degree of freedom owing to intrinsic structural anisotropy. Here, we propose a planar optical ring resonator based on a subwavelength grating waveguide that supports two quasi-degenerate modes. We demonstrate that coupling of these modes in the ring resonator leads to the formation of the resonances with a predominant direction of electric-field rotation in the vicinity of the resonator, resulting in the non-zero transverse optical spin. The average degree of circular polarization in the proposed structures reaches values of up to 70%. The theoretical predictions are corroborated by experimental validation in the microwave spectral range. Our findings suggest a viable route toward realization of on-chip optical spintronic and valleytronic interfaces."

We develop a sensitivity analysis framework that bounds how much conclusions can change when this transportability assumption is violated. Our approach constrains the likelihood ratio between target and trial outcome densities by a scalar parameter $Λ\\geq 1$, with $Λ= 1$ recovering standard transportability. For each $Λ$, we derive sharp bounds on the target average treatment effect -- the tightest interval guaranteed to contain the true effect under all data-generating processes compatible with the observed data and the sensitivity model. We show that the optimal likelihood ratios have a simple threshold structure, leading to a closed-form greedy algorithm that requires only sorting trial outcomes and redistributing probability mass. The resulting estimator runs in $O(n \\log n)$ time and is consistent under standard regularity conditions. Simulations demonstrate that our bounds achieve nominal coverage when the true outcome shift falls within the specified $Λ$, provide substantially tighter intervals than worst-case bounds, and remain informative across a range of realistic violations of transportability."

    "abstract": "A challenge in mitigating social bias in fine-tuned language models (LMs) is the potential reduction in language modeling capability, which can harm downstream performance. Counterfactual data augmentation (CDA), a widely used method for fine-tuning, highlights this issue by generating synthetic data that may align poorly with real-world distributions or creating overly simplistic counterfactuals that ignore the social context of altered sensitive attributes (e.g., gender) in the pretraining corpus. To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective context-augmented CDA method, Context-CDA, which uses large LMs to enhance the diversity and contextual relevance of the debiasing corpus. By minimizing discrepancies between the debiasing corpus and pretraining data through augmented context, this approach ensures better alignment, enhancing language modeling capability. We then employ uncertainty-based filtering to exclude generated counterfactuals considered low-quality by the target smaller LMs (i.e., LMs to be debiased), further improving the fine-tuning corpus quality. Experimental results on gender bias benchmarks demonstrate that Context-CDA effectively mitigates bias without sacrificing language modeling performance while offering insights into social biases by analyzing distribution shifts in next-token generation probabilities."

    "abstract": "The joint communications and sensing (JCAS) paradigm is envisioned as a core capability of sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks, enabling the integration of data communication and environmental sensing within a unified system. By reusing spectrum, waveforms, and hardware resources, JCAS improves spectral efficiency, reduces system complexity, and hardware cost, while enabling new use cases. Nevertheless, the realization of JCAS is hindered by inherent trade-offs between communication and sensing objectives, limited controllability of wireless propagation, and stringent hardware and design constraints. Simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RIS) have recently emerged as a promising technology to address these challenges by enabling full-space programmable manipulation of electromagnetic waves. This survey provides a systematic and in-depth review of STAR-RIS-enabled JCAS systems. Specifically, we first introduce the fundamental principles of JCAS and STAR-RIS. We then classify and review the state-of-the-art research on STAR-RIS-assisted JCAS from multiple perspectives, encompassing system architectures, waveform and beamforming design, resource allocation, optimization frameworks, and learning-based control. Finally, we identify key open challenges that remain unsolved and outline promising future research directions toward intelligent, flexible, and perceptive 6G wireless networks."

We mitigate this likelihood paradox by manipulating input entropy based on semantic similarity, applying stronger perturbations to inputs that are less similar to an in-distribution memory bank. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that entropy control increases the expected log-likelihood gap between in-distribution and OOD samples in favor of the in-distribution, and we explain why the procedure works without any additional training of the density model. We then evaluate our method against likelihood-based OOD detectors on standard benchmarks and find consistent AUROC improvements over baselines, supporting our explanation."

Existing training frameworks primarily optimize for single-agent scenarios and fail to address the unique system-level challenges of MARL, including rollout-training synchronization barriers, rollout load imbalance, and training resource underutilization. To bridge this gap, we propose FlexMARL, the first end-to-end training framework that holistically optimizes rollout, training, and their orchestration for large-scale LLM-based MARL. Specifically, FlexMARL introduces the joint orchestrator to manage data flow under the rollout-training disaggregated architecture. Building upon the experience store, a novel micro-batch driven asynchronous pipeline eliminates the synchronization barriers while providing strong consistency guarantees. Rollout engine adopts a parallel sampling scheme combined with hierarchical load balancing, which adapts to skewed inter/intra-agent request patterns. Training engine achieves on-demand hardware binding through agent-centric resource allocation. The training states of different agents are swapped via unified and location-agnostic communication. Empirical results on a large-scale production cluster demonstrate that FlexMARL achieves up to 7.3x speedup and improves hardware utilization by up to 5.6x compared to existing frameworks."

    "abstract": "The purpose of predictive modeling on relational data is to predict future or missing values in a relational database, for example, future purchases of a user, risk of readmission of the patient, or the likelihood that a financial transaction is fraudulent. Typically powered by machine learning methods, predictive models are used in recommendations, financial fraud detection, supply chain optimization, and other systems, providing billions of predictions every day. However, training a machine learning model requires manual work to extract the required training examples - prediction entities and target labels - from the database, which is slow, laborious, and prone to mistakes. Here, we present the Predictive Query Language (PQL), a SQL-inspired declarative language for defining predictive tasks on relational databases. PQL allows specifying a predictive task in a single declarative query, enabling the automatic computation training labels for a large variety of machine learning tasks, such as regression, classification, time-series forecasting, and recommender systems. PQL is already successfully integrated and used in a collection of use cases as part of a predictive AI platform. The versatility of the language can be demonstrated through its many ongoing use cases, including financial fraud, item recommendations, and workload prediction. We demonstrate its versatile design through two implementations; one for small-scale, low-latency use and one that can handle large-scale databases."

Yet, their deployment in multilingual legal settings is constrained by unreliable retrieval and the lack of domain-adapted, open-embedding models. In particular, existing multilingual legal corpora are not designed for semantic retrieval, and PDF-based legislative sources introduce substantial noise due to imperfect text extraction. To address these challenges, we introduce LEMUR, a large-scale multilingual corpus of EU environmental legislation constructed from 24,953 official EUR-Lex PDF documents covering 25 languages. We quantify the fidelity of PDF-to-text conversion by measuring lexical consistency against authoritative HTML versions using the Lexical Content Score (LCS). Building on LEMUR, we fine-tune three state-of-the-art multilingual embedding models using contrastive objectives in both monolingual and bilingual settings, reflecting realistic legal-retrieval scenarios. Experiments across low- and high-resource languages demonstrate that legal-domain fine-tuning consistently improves Top-k retrieval accuracy relative to strong baselines, with particularly pronounced gains for low-resource languages. Cross-lingual evaluations show that these improvements transfer to unseen languages, indicating that fine-tuning primarily enhances language-independent, content-level legal representations rather than language-specific cues.

Here, we implement XUV-TGS by generating a transient grating in germanium solid using two few-cycle near-infrared pulses and probing it with an attosecond XUV pulse, produced via tabletop high-harmonic generation. The spectrally resolved, diffracted XUV pulses directly visualize the separate ultrashort decay times of both photoexcited electrons and holes, without the need for iterative deconvolution. By combining XUV-TA and -TG spectroscopy, we extract the evolution of the complex refractive index, ñ, without the need for Kramers-Kronig reconstruction, as required in XUV-TR, allowing us to extract the roots of the induced optical response. We find reflectivity changes of up to 34% via the real part of ñ, whereas changes in the imaginary part only result in a variation in reflectivity of around 0.5%."

A detailed robot's design and CAD modeling, with a particular focus on a torque transmission mechanism that simplifies the motion of two cables using a single motor is presented. Two degrees of freedom are driven by cables, while the remaining three are driven by a Sarrus-type mechanism and a pan-tilt mechanism. The inverse kinematics models are also developed.

However, a direct macroscopic probe for crystal chirality remains a significant challenge, especially in time reversal symmetric systems with weak circular dichroism signal. Here, we propose the ``Chiralometer'', a mechanical detection method that probes chirality by driving angular momentum carriers out of equilibrium. Using first-principles calculations and semiclassical transport theory, we demonstrate that a temperature gradient in insulators or an electric field in metals induces uncompensated angular momentum in phonons and electrons, respectively. This imbalance generates a macroscopic mechanical torque ($τ\\sim 10^{-11} N \\cdot m$) well within the sensitivity of modern torque magnetometry and cantilever-based sensors. We identify robust signatures in chiral crystals such as Te, SiO$_2$, and the topological semimetal CoSi. Our work establishes mechanical torque as a fundamental order parameter for chirality, offering a transformative tool for orbitronics and chiral quantum materials."

Motivated by recent interpretations of JWST observations suggesting a hydrogen-rich atmosphere consistent with Hycean-world scenarios, we conducted a coordinated, multi-epoch search for narrowband radio technosignatures using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array equipped with the COSMIC backend and the MeerKAT telescope with the BLUSE backend. Our observations span frequencies from 544MHz to 9.8GHz and include multiple epochs that cover at least one full orbital period of the planet. In this work, we outline, create, and apply a comprehensive post-processing framework that incorporates observatory-informed RFI masking, drift-rate filtering based on the expected dynamics of the K2-18 system, multibeam spatial discrimination, primary and secondary transit filtering (when applicable), and SNR-based excision of weak and strong spurious signals. Across all bands and epochs, no signals consistent with an astrophysical or artificial origin were identified at a limit of 10^12 to 10^13W. These non-detections allow us to place upper limits on the presence of persistent, isotropic narrowband transmitters within the K2-18 system, providing the first interferometric technosignature constraints for a Hycean-planet candidate. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of coordinated multiepoch interferometric searches and establish a methodological framework for future technosignature studies of nearby potentially habitable exoplanets."

Within a continuum magnetoelastic framework, we show that the strain fields generated by dislocations induce equilibrium magnetic textures. The morphology of these textures depends sensitively on the dislocation type and acts as a localized scattering potential for spin-wave excitations. As a result, the scattering response exhibits pronounced asymmetries and interference effects governed by the magnetoelastic coupling and the dislocation type. By combining numerical simulations with analytical scattering theory, we compute differential cross sections and frequency-dependent transmission coefficients. Furthermore, analysis of the effective potential landscape reveals that the defect forms a barrier that modulates spin-wave transport and, crucially, breaks the intrinsic reflectionless nature of magnetic domain walls. Our findings identify lattice dislocations as tunable scattering centers, opening new avenues for defect engineering in magnonic devices."

In this paper, we propose HLGFA, a high-low resolution guided feature alignment framework that learns normality by modeling cross-resolution feature consistency between high-resolution and low-resolution representations of normal samples, instead of relying on pixel-level reconstruction. Dual-resolution inputs are processed by a shared frozen backbone to extract multi-level features, and high-resolution representations are decomposed into structure and detail priors to guide the refinement of low-resolution features through conditional modulation and gated residual correction. During inference, anomalies are naturally identified as regions where cross-resolution alignment breaks down. In addition, a noise-aware data augmentation strategy is introduced to suppress nuisance-induced responses commonly observed in industrial environments. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of HLGFA, achieving 97.9% pixel-level AUROC and 97.5% image-level AUROC on the MVTec AD dataset, outperforming representative reconstruction-based and feature-based methods."

We present Earinter, a commodity-earbud-based closed-loop system that integrates in-the-wild sensing, real-time reasoning, and theory-grounded just-in-time (JIT) intervention to regulate eating pace during daily meals. Earinter repurposes the earbud's bone-conduction voice sensor to capture chewing-related vibrations and estimate eating pace as chews per swallow (CPS) for on-device inference. With data collected equally across in-lab and in-the-wild sessions, Earinter achieves reliable chewing detection (F1 = 0.97) and accurate eating pace estimation (MAE: 0.18 $\\pm$ 0.13 chews/min, 3.65 $\\pm$ 3.86 chews/swallow), enabling robust tracking for closed-loop use. Guided by Dual Systems Theory and refined through two Wizard-of-Oz pilots, Earinter adopts a user-friendly design for JIT intervention content and delivery policy in daily meals. In a 13-day within-subject field study (N=14), the closed-loop system significantly increased CPS and reduced food-consumption speed, with statistical signs of carryover on retention-probe days and acceptable user burden. Our findings highlight how single-modality commodity earables can support practical, theory-driven closed-loop JIT interventions for regulating eating pace in the wild."

However, there exist large gaps between their approximate regret bounds and the regret bounds achieved in the convex setting. Moreover, if focusing on projection-free algorithms, which can efficiently handle complex decision sets, they cannot even recover the approximate regret bounds achieved in the centralized setting. In this paper, we first demonstrate that for D-OCSM over general convex decision sets, these two issues can be addressed simultaneously. Furthermore, for D-OCSM over downward-closed decision sets, we show that the second issue can be addressed while significantly alleviating the first issue. Our key techniques are two reductions from D-OCSM to decentralized online convex optimization (D-OCO), which can exploit D-OCO algorithms to improve the approximate regret of D-OCSM in these two cases, respectively."

In this work we study an early dark energy scalar field coupled to radiation prior to recombination. The interaction leads to energy exchange between the two components and modifies the standard cosmic microwave background temperature redshift relation. We derive the modified temperature evolution from the background equations and interpret it in terms of effective photon non-conservation. We also study linear scalar perturbations in the tight-coupling regime relevant for cosmic microwave background acoustic physics. We show that the interaction affects the background evolution without introducing new dynamical degrees of freedom at the perturbation level. The dominant observational effect arises through a shift in the sound horizon at recombination, which modifies the angular acoustic scale. Using the Planck constraint on the acoustic scale we obtain a consistency bound on the coupling strength and show that deviations from the standard temperature redshift relation are tightly constrained."

We focus on minimizing \\emph{recourse} which equals the number of recolored edges per edge updates. We present a new technique based on an object which we call a \\emph{shift-tree}. This object tracks multiple possible recolorings of $G$ and enables us to maintain a proper coloring with small recourse in polynomial time. We shift colors over a path of edges, but unlike many other algorithms, we do not use \\emph{fans} and \\emph{alternating bicolored paths}. We combine the shift-tree with additional techniques to obtain an algorithm with a \\emph{tight} recourse of $O\\big( \\frac{\\log n}{\\log \\frac{Δ+C}{Δ-C}}\\big)$ for all $C \\ge 0.62Δ$ where $Δ-C = O(n^{1-δ})$. Our algorithm is the first deterministic algorithm to establish tight bounds for large palettes, and the first to do so when $Δ-C=o(Δ)$. This result settles the theoretical complexity of the recourse for large palettes. Furthermore, we believe that viewing the possible shifts as a tree can lead to similar tree-based techniques that extend to lower values of $C$, and to improved update times. A second application is to graphs with low arboricity $α$. Previous works [BCPS24, CRV24] achieve $O(ε^{-1}\\log n)$ recourse per update with $C\\ge (4+ε)α$, and we improve by achieving the same recourse while only requiring $C \\ge (2+ε)α- 1$. This result is $Δ$-adaptive, i.e., it uses $Δ_t+C$ colors where $Δ_t$ is the current maximum degree. Trying to understand the limitations of our technique, and shift-based algorithms in general, we show a separation between the recourse achievable by algorithms that only shift colors along a path, and more general algorithms such as ones using the Nibbling Method [BGW21, BCPS24]."

OSI reformulates watermark extraction as a learnable sign classification problem, which eliminates the need for precise regression of the initial noise. Then, we initialize the OSI model from the diffusion backbone and finetune it on synthesized noise-image pairs with a sign classification objective. In this manner, the OSI model is able to accomplish the watermark extraction efficiently in only one step. Our OSI substantially outperforms the multi-step diffusion inversion method: it is 20x faster, achieves higher extraction accuracy, and doubles the watermark payload capacity. Extensive experiments across diverse schedulers, diffusion backbones, and cryptographic schemes consistently show improvements, demonstrating the generality of our OSI framework."

    "abstract": "The interconnection of 5G and non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) has been actively studied to expand connectivity beyond conventional terrestrial infrastructure. In the 3GPP standardization of 5G systems, the 5G Quality of Service (QoS) Identifier (5QI) is defined to characterize the QoS requirements of different traffic requirements. However, it falls short in capturing the diverse latency, capacity, and reliability profiles of NTN environments, particularly when NTNs are used as backhaul. Furthermore, it is difficult to manage individual traffic flows and perform efficient resource allocation and routing when a large number of 5G traffic flows are present in NTN systems. To address these challenges, we propose an optimization framework that enhances QoS handling by introducing an NTN QoS Identifier (NQI) and grouping 5G traffic into NTN slices based on similar requirements. This enables unified resource control and routing for a large number of 5G flows in NTN systems. In this paper, we present the detailed procedure of the proposed framework, which consists of 5QI to NQI mapping, NTN traffic to NTN slice mapping, and slice-level flow and routing optimization. We evaluate the framework by comparing multiple mapping schemes through numerical simulations and analyze their impact on overall network performance."

We further propose a proxy-based, cost-efficient strategy for batch size tuning, revealing the impact of rank, dataset size, and model capacity on the optimal batch size. Our findings elevate batch size from a minor implementation detail to a first-order design parameter, reconciling prior inconsistencies and enabling more reliable evaluations of LoRA variants."

    "abstract": "Preloading is widely used in short video platforms to minimize playback stalls by downloading future content in advance. However, existing strategies face a tradeoff. Aggressive preloading reduces stalls but wastes bandwidth, while conservative strategies save data but increase the risk of playback stalls. This paper presents PromptPream, a computation powered preloading paradigm that breaks this tradeoff by using local computation to reduce bandwidth demand. Instead of transmitting pixel level video chunks, PromptPream sends compact semantic prompts that are decoded into high quality frames using generative models such as Stable Diffusion. We propose three core techniques to enable this paradigm: (1) a gradient based prompt inversion method that compresses frames into small sets of compact token embeddings; (2) a computation aware scheduling strategy that jointly optimizes network and compute resource usage; and (3) a scalable searching algorithm that addresses the enlarged scheduling space introduced by scheduler. Evaluations show that PromptStream reduces both stalls and bandwidth waste by over 31%, and improves Quality of Experience (QoE) by 45%, compared to traditional strategies."

    "abstract": "This study presents the development of a compact gas-kinetic scheme using an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulation for structured meshes. Unlike the Eulerian formulation, the ALE approach effectively tracks flow discontinuities, such as shock waves and contact discontinuities. However, mesh motion alters the geometry and increases computational costs. To address this, two key strategies were introduced to reduce costs and enhance accuracy. The first strategy is to use the gas-kinetic scheme to construct a third-order gas-kinetic flux, rather than the Runge-Kutta method to achieve high-order time accuracy, which allows a single reconstruction and flux calculation per time step. This approach enables direct updates of both cell-averaged flow variables and their gradients using a time-accurate flux function, facilitating compact reconstruction. Second, the significant computational expense is spent on reconstruction, which requires recalculating the reconstruction matrix at each time step due to mesh changes. A simplified fourth-order compact reconstruction using a small matrix was used to mitigate this cost. The combination of fourth-order spatial reconstruction and third-order time-accurate flux evolution ensures both high resolution and computational efficiency in the ALE framework. The tests shows that the current reconstruction is 2.4x to 3.0x faster than the previous reconstruction. Additionally, a generalized ENO(GENO) method for handling discontinuities enhances the scheme's robustness. The numerical test cases, such as the Riemann problem, Sedov problem, Noh problem, and Saltzmann problem, demonstrated the robustness and accuracy of our method."

Non-coplanar spin textures in these systems have been realized only in low temperature spin-glass states or at interfaces with heavy metals. Here, we report an intrinsic non-coplanar spin configuration persisting up to 400 K in cubic-phase Mn3Ge, originating from coexisting symmetric and antisymmetric exchange interactions. Competing magnetic states associated with this non-coplanar spin configuration give rise to an unconventional AHE with a magnetic-field-induced sign reversal and a hump-like feature.

    "abstract": "We investigate the quantum advantage in quantum illumination using two-qubit mixed states as the initial resource. We show that in quantum illumination, the achievable advantage is determined by an interplay between initial entanglement and discord. First, we rigorously show that the quantum advantage for a given state equals the amount of discord consumed for illumination. Subsequently, we find that states with identical initial discord can lead to varying advantages, indicating that the usable portion of discord for illumination depends on additional structural features of the state. Then, we consider the relation between the advantage and both entanglement and discord by performing a conditional extremal analysis. To this end, for states clustered by identical advantage and initial discord, we compute the maximum and minimum initial entanglement within each cluster. We demonstrate that, for states with fixed initial discord, the maximum (and not minimum) entanglement increases by increment of the advantage. We conclude that for any given initial discord, higher entanglement is a sufficient (but not necessary) resource for higher advantage. On the other hand, for states clustered by identical advantage and initial entanglement, we compute the maximum and minimum initial discord in each group. Here, the minimum (and not always maximum) discord scales monotonically with advantage. It shows that, for fixed initial entanglement, higher discord is a necessary (but not always sufficient) resource for higher advantage. This result provides a refined, operational perspective on how different forms of quantum correlations govern the performance of the illumination protocol. We finally find a persistent linear dependence of the advantage on initial discord in the high-noise regime, highlighting discord as the key resource for resilience to noise in the protocol."

Here, we investigate the ANE in epitaxial thin films of the Weyl ferromagnet candidate Fe5Si3. A pronounced transverse Nernst response exceeding approximately 1.50 microvolt per kelvin is observed at room temperature, together with a giant anomalous Nernst angle of about 0.56, indicating highly efficient conversion between thermal gradients and transverse electric fields. Beyond the anomalous contribution, a sizable topological Nernst signal of approximately 0.43 microvolt per kelvin persists above room temperature, suggesting the possible presence of real-space Berry curvature associated with nontrivial spin textures. First-principles density functional theory calculations combined with symmetry analysis reveal an unconventional electronic structure in which Weyl nodal lines, nodal surfaces, and nearly flat bands coexist near the Fermi level. This rare concurrence of multiple topological band features produces a strongly enhanced and sharply energy-dependent Berry curvature, which governs both the magnitude and temperature evolution of the observed Nernst response. The close quantitative agreement between calculated anomalous Nernst conductivity and experimental results establishes the topological electronic structure as the dominant origin of the observed thermomagnetic transport, highlighting Fe5Si3 as a chemically simple, low-cost binary topological magnet for exploring both real-space and momentum-space Berry-curvature-driven thermoelectric phenomena."

Here, we propose generalized CRIT via a spinor representation with dual-channel gauge fields, enabling fully programmable CRIT featuring dynamical spectral engineering. We generalize the traditional EIT framework by introducing a spinor representation of bright- and dark-mode resonances, yielding a unified description of design parameters through universal unitary operations. Implementing a coupled-resonator building block that accesses the entire design space through dual-channel gauge fields, we demonstrate a programmable slow-light band in a one-dimensional CRIT lattice. These results address urgent needs in optical interconnects, such as tunable delay lines, reconfigurable synchronization, and linear frequency conversion."

Here, we propose hyperuniformity and stealthiness in non-Hermitian systems as a generalization of PT-symmetric crystals to correlated disorder. We extend the scattering-microstructure correspondence to open systems, formulating non-Hermitian hyperuniformity and stealthiness that encompass their Hermitian counterparts. This approach, incorporating a statistical crystallography framework for non-Hermitian materials, demonstrates that real-imaginary cross-correlations of the material potential are irrelevant for achieving hyperuniformity but are essential for characterizing stealthiness, revealing unidirectional scattering phases that are inaccessible in Hermitian materials and in non-Hermitian crystals. By analysing the microstructural statistics of the resulting materials, our results, building on non-Hermitian wave physics, establish a connection to materials science, encompassing conventional descriptors of correlated disorder."

Most research focuses on specific pollutant categories and employs variations of YOLO, Faster R-CNN, and EfficientDet architectures. Although several datasets exist, they are limited to specific areas and lack standardized taxonomies. Few studies integrate detection into real-time application systems, yet they tend to be geographically skewed. We proposed a framework for monitoring visual pollution that integrates a visual pollution index to assess the severity of visual pollution for a certain area. This review highlights the need for a unified UVP management system that incorporates pollutant taxonomy, a cross-city benchmark dataset, a generalized deep learning model, and an assessment index that supports sustainable urban aesthetics and enhances the well-being of urban dwellers."

    "abstract": "In recent years, substantial research has integrated multimodal item metadata into recommender systems, often by using pre-trained multimodal foundation models to encode such data. Since these models are not originally trained for recommendation tasks, recent works efficiently adapt them via parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). However, even with PEFT, item embeddings from multimodal foundation models remain user-blind: item embeddings are not conditioned on user interests, despite the fact that users with diverse interests attend to different item aspects. To address this limitation, we propose PerPEFT, a personalized PEFT strategy for multimodal recommendation. Specifically, PerPEFT groups users by interest and assigns a distinct PEFT module to each group, enabling each module to capture the fine-grained item aspects most predictive of that group`s purchase decisions. We further introduce a specialized training technique that strengthens this user-group conditioning. Notably, PerPEFT is PEFT-agnostic and can be paired with any PEFT method applicable to multimodal foundation models. Through extensive experiments, we show that (1) PerPEFT outperforms the strongest baseline by up to 15.3% (NDCG@20) and (2) delivers consistent gains across diverse PEFT variants. It is noteworthy that, even with personalization, PEFT remains lightweight, adding only 1.3% of the parameter count of the foundation model.

However, existing contrastive and masked autoencoder methods typically rely on naive random dropping or masking for augmentation, which is ill-suited for brain graphs and hypergraphs as it disrupts semantically meaningful connectivity patterns. Moreover, commonly used graph-level readout and reconstruction schemes fail to capture global structural information, limiting the robustness of learned representations. In this work, we propose a unified diffusion-based pretraining framework that addresses both limitations. First, diffusion is designed to guide structure-aware dropping and masking strategies, preserving brain graph semantics while maintaining effective pretraining diversity. Second, diffusion enables topology-aware graph-level readout and node-level global reconstruction by allowing graph embeddings and masked nodes to aggregate information from globally related regions. Extensive experiments across multiple neuroimaging datasets with over 25,000 subjects and 60,000 scans involving various mental disorders and brain atlases demonstrate consistent performance improvements."

This Coordination Criterion is stated directly over Lamport histories -- partially ordered executions under happens-before -- and specification-defined observable outcomes, without assuming any particular programming language, object implementation, or protocol structure. It yields a sharp boundary between specifications that can be implemented without coordination and those for which coordination is unavoidable. The criterion provides a uniform explanation for a range of classical results, including CAP-style impossibility, CALM-style coordination-freedom, agreement and snapshot tasks, transactional isolation levels, and invariant confluence -- all instances of the same underlying semantic phenomenon."

    "abstract": "Robotic laboratories play a critical role in autonomous scientific discovery by enabling scalable, continuous experimental execution. Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models offer a promising foundation for robotic laboratories. However, scientific experiments typically involve long-horizon tasks composed of multiple atomic tasks, posing a fundamental challenge to existing VLA models. While VLA models fine-tuned for scientific tasks can reliably execute atomic experimental actions seen during training, they often fail to perform composite tasks formed by reordering and composing these known atomic actions. This limitation arises from a distributional mismatch between training-time atomic tasks and inference-time composite tasks, which prevents VLA models from executing necessary transitional operations between atomic tasks. To address this challenge, we propose an Agentic VLA Inference Plugin for Long-Horizon Tasks in Scientific Experiments. It introduces an LLM-based agentic inference mechanism that intervenes when executing sequential manipulation tasks. By performing explicit transition inference and generating transitional robotic action code, the proposed plugin guides VLA models through missing transitional steps, enabling reliable execution of composite scientific workflows without any additional training. This inference-only intervention makes our method computationally efficient, data-efficient, and well-suited for open-ended and long-horizon robotic laboratory tasks. We build 3D assets of scientific instruments and common scientific operating scenes within an existing simulation environment. In these scenes, we have verified that our method increases the average success rate per atomic task by 42\\% during inference. Furthermore, we show that our method can be easily transferred from the simulation to real scientific laboratories."

    "abstract": "The accurate characterization of tire dynamics is critical for advancing control strategies in autonomous road vehicles, as tire behavior significantly influences handling and stability through the generation of forces and moments at the tire-road interface. Smart tire technologies have emerged as a promising tool for sensing key variables such as road friction, tire pressure, and wear states, and for estimating kinematic and dynamic states like vehicle speed and tire forces. However, most existing estimation and control algorithms rely on empirical correlations or machine learning approaches, which require extensive calibration and can be sensitive to variations in operating conditions. In contrast, model-based techniques, which leverage infinite-dimensional representations of tire dynamics using partial differential equations (PDEs), offer a more robust approach. This paper proposes a novel model-based, output-feedback lateral tracking control strategy for all-wheel steering vehicles that integrates distributed tire dynamics with smart tire technologies. The primary contributions include the suppression of micro-shimmy phenomena at low speeds and path-following via force control, achieved through the estimation of tire slip angles, vehicle kinematics, and lateral tire forces. The proposed controller and observer are based on formulations using ODE-PDE systems, representing rigid body dynamics and distributed tire behavior. This work marks the first rigorous control strategy for vehicular systems equipped with distributed tire representations in conjunction with smart tire technologies."

The complexity of several topics is asymptotic to that encountered in research-level studies, however, the analysis is presented in a step-by-step manner to facilitate access to commonly used methods and tools. The material is divided into three main parts. Part I introduces multiagent systems and basic graph-theoretic concepts. Part II addresses the design and analysis of linear consensus algorithms. Part III covers selected applications and research directions, including formation control, network localization, distributed optimization, opinion dynamics, and matrix-weighted networks.

Image-to-3D foundations models can solve this issue by reconstructing 3D data from 2D modalites. Current foundation models are trained on natural image distributions to reconstruct naturalistic objects from a single image by leveraging geometric priors across pixels. However, it is unclear whether these learned geometric priors transfer to medical data. In this study, we present a controlled zero-shot benchmark of single slice medical image-to-3D reconstruction across five state-of-the-art image-to-3D models: SAM3D, Hunyuan3D-2.1, Direct3D, Hi3DGen, and TripoSG. These are evaluated across six medical datasets spanning anatomical and pathological structures and two natrual datasets, using voxel based metrics and point cloud distance metrics. Across medical datasets, voxel based overlap remains moderate for all models, consistent with a depth reconstruction failure mode when inferring volume from a single slice. In contrast, global distance metrics show more separation between methods: SAM3D achieves the strongest overall topological similarity to ground truth medical 3D data, while alternative models are more prone to over-simplication of reconstruction. Our results quantify the limits of single-slice medical reconstruction and highlight depth ambiguity caused by the planar nature of 2D medical data, motivating multi-view image-to-3D reconstruction to enable reliable medical 3D inference."

The system exhibits a distinctly unipolar high-velocity jet with velocity offsets of +44 to +66 km s-1, unlike the predominantly bipolar morphology characteristic of most protostellar jets. While the low-velocity outflow, with velocity offsets of -20 to +30 km s-1, is detected in both directions, the high-velocity jet appears only on one side, and this monopolarity is consistent across all tracers. Given the nearly edge-on geometry and low submillimeter extinction, comparable emission would normally be expected from both lobes. The shock tracer SiO emission confirms a genuine, highly collimated jet rather than cloud contamination, and no ambient structure is capable of obscuring a counterjet. We argue that intrinsically asymmetric mass loading along the disk magnetic field lines provides the most plausible explanation for the observed monopolarity."

However, both limits mentioned above apply for the time-invariant injection condition and the role of time-varying current density for injection remains elusive. In this paper, we numerically investigate the SCL electron flow with time-variant injection. Using particle-in-cell simulation, four different time-variant profiles for electron injection are enforced, and the maximum current densities are determined resulting from the space charge effect for various pulse lengths. We speculate that the time-variant density of injection via the diode cathode will contribute to transport enhancement in the short-pulse condition."

In this paper, we develop a finite-time analytical framework for constant-temperature SA by studying a piecewise linear cost function that permits exact characterization. We model SA as a discrete-state Markov chain and first derive a closed-form expression for the expected time to escape a single linear basin in a one-dimensional landscape. We show that this expression also accurately predicts the behavior of continuous-state searches up to a constant scaling factor, which we analyze empirically and explain via variance matching, demonstrating convergence to a factor of sqrt(3) in certain regimes. We then extend the analysis to a two-basin landscape containing a local and a global optimum, obtaining exact expressions for the expected time to reach the global optimum starting from the local optimum, as a function of basin geometry, neighborhood radius, and temperature. Finally, we demonstrate how the predicted basin escape time can be used to guide the design of a simple two-temperature switching strategy."

Based on the hybrid encoding, CNOT and Fredkin gates are constructed in a deterministic way without any borrowed ancillary photons or measurement-induced nonlinearities. Remarkably, the number of linear optics required to implement a CNOT gate has been reduced to one polarization beam splitter (PBS), while only $d$ PBSs are necessary to implement a generalized Fredkin gate. The optical depths of all schemes are reduced to one and dimension-independent. Besides, the fidelity of our three-qubit Fredkin gate is higher than 99.7\\% under realistic conditions, which is higher than the previous schemes."

The singlet-to-singlet gradient terms are quadratic in spatial derivatives, while, in the presence of spin-orbit coupling, linear-in-derivatives terms coupling singlet and triplet order parameters are also permitted. Through the minimal substitution procedure, these terms enable coupling between different superconducting order parameters via the vector potential, thereby leading to the generation of p-wave, d-wave, and other symmetry-allowed components. Such a manipulation of the superconducting state locally via a microwave beam could be considered as one more facet of the concept of quantum printing."

    "abstract": "Successfully manipulating many everyday objects, such as potato chips, requires precise force regulation. Failure to modulate force can lead to task failure or irreversible damage to the objects. Humans can precisely achieve this by adapting force from tactile feedback, even within a short period of physical contact. We aim to give robots this capability. However, commercial grippers exhibit high cost or high minimum force, making them unsuitable for studying force-controlled policy learning with everyday force-sensitive objects. We introduce TF-Gripper, a low-cost (~$150) force-controlled parallel-jaw gripper that integrates tactile sensing as feedback. It has an effective force range of 0.45-45N and is compatible with different robot arms. Additionally, we designed a teleoperation device paired with TF-Gripper to record human-applied grasping forces. While standard low-frequency policies can be trained on this data, they struggle with the reactive, contact-dependent nature of force regulation. To overcome this, we propose RETAF (REactive Tactile Adaptation of Force), a framework that decouples grasping force control from arm pose prediction. RETAF regulates force at high frequency using wrist images and tactile feedback, while a base policy predicts end-effector pose and gripper open/close action. We evaluate TF-Gripper and RETAF across five real-world tasks requiring precise force regulation. Results show that compared to position control, direct force control significantly improves grasp stability and task performance. We further show that tactile feedback is essential for force regulation, and that RETAF consistently outperforms baselines and can be integrated with various base policies. We hope this work opens a path for scaling the learning of force-controlled policies in robotic manipulation. Project page: https://force-gripper.github.io ."

To stabilize end-to-end training, we introduce adaptive relaxation, which designs a relaxed feasible set that snares the neural network at initialization and shrinks it into the feasible set, enabling early exploration and strict feasibility later in training. On optimization-learning and trajectory planning benchmarks, SnareNet consistently attains improved objective quality while satisfying constraints more reliably than prior work."

    "abstract": "Monocular normal estimation aims to estimate the normal map from a single RGB image of an object under arbitrary lights. Existing methods rely on deep models to directly predict normal maps. However, they often suffer from 3D misalignment: while the estimated normal maps may appear to have a correct appearance, the reconstructed surfaces often fail to align with the geometric details. We argue that this misalignment stems from the current paradigm: the model struggles to distinguish and reconstruct varying geometry represented in normal maps, as the differences in underlying geometry are reflected only through relatively subtle color variations. To address this issue, we propose a new paradigm that reformulates normal estimation as shading sequence estimation, where shading sequences are more sensitive to various geometric information. Building on this paradigm, we present RoSE, a method that leverages image-to-video generative models to predict shading sequences. The predicted shading sequences are then converted into normal maps by solving a simple ordinary least-squares problem. To enhance robustness and better handle complex objects, RoSE is trained on a synthetic dataset, MultiShade, with diverse shapes, materials, and light conditions. Experiments demonstrate that RoSE achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world benchmark datasets for object-based monocular normal estimation."

The data for this study was compiled from censuses, health research organisations, and data centres, among various other sources. We built regression models and used them to analyze trends across past decades and make projections for 2031. Our regression results show a strong inverse relationship between communicable disease DALYs and HDI. In other words, ongoing improvements in development and infrastructure significantly reduced communicable disease DALYs. In contrast, noncommunicable DALYs did not decrease despite rising HDI. And lastly, injury DALYs showed moderate declines with higher HDI, which reflects improvements in healthcare and safety systems. Gender analysis showed male overrepresentation among people with disabilities. These results from our study support that there is a need to shift public health focus toward chronic diseases and address gender disparities in disability outcomes."

It is closely related to other causal influence measures, such as transfer entropy, Granger causality, and Pearl's causal framework. This monograph provides an overview of DI and its main application in information theory, namely, characterizing the capacity of channels with feedback and memory. We begin by reviewing the definitions of DI, its basic properties, and its relation to Shannon's mutual information. Next, we provide a survey of DI estimation techniques, ranging from classic plug-in estimators to modern neural-network-based estimators. Considering the application of channel capacity estimation, we describe how such estimators numerically optimize DI rate over a class of joint distributions on input and output processes. A significant part of the monograph is devoted to techniques to compute the feedback capacity of finite-state channels (FSCs). The feedback capacity of a strongly connected FSC involves the maximization of the DI rate from the channel input process to the output process. This maximization is performed over the class of causal conditioned probability input distributions. When the FSC is also unifilar, i.e., the next state is given by a time-invariant function of the current state and the new input-output symbol pair, the feedback capacity is the optimal average reward of an appropriately formulated Markov decision process (MDP). This MDP formulation has been exploited to develop several methods to compute exactly, or at least estimate closely, the feedback capacity of a unifilar FSC. This monograph describes these methods, starting from the value iteration algorithm, to Q-graph methods, and reinforcement learning algorithms that can handle large input and output alphabets."

Most research on continual learning focuses on classification problems, while very few studies address regression tasks. We propose the first prototype-based generative replay framework designed for online task-free continual regression. Our approach defines an adaptive output-space discretization model, enabling prototype-based generative replay for continual regression without storing raw data. Evidence obtained from several benchmark datasets shows that our framework reduces forgetting and provides more stable performance than other state-of-the-art solutions."

For multiple uses, it is conventional to classify quantum metrological protocols as parallel, sequential, or indefinite causal order. Within each class, the central question is to determine the optimal strategy -- namely, the choice of optimal input state, control operations, measurement, and estimator(s) -- to perform the estimation task. Using the formalism of higher-order operations, we develop an algorithm that looks for the optimal solution, and we provide an efficient numerical implementation based on semidefinite programming. Our benchmark examples, specifically those against existing analytical solutions, demonstrate how powerful and precise our method is. We further explore the potential of greedy adaptive strategies, which are based on classical feedforward to design the optimal protocol for the next round. Using this framework, we compare the optimal achievable Bayesian score across classes. We demonstrate the strength of our algorithm in several examples, from single to multiparameter estimation and with various prior distributions. Particularly, we find examples in which there is a strict hierarchy between different classes. Nonetheless, the performance of the different quantum memory-assisted classes are not significantly different, while they may significantly outperform the adaptive greedy strategy."

Selective state space models (SSMs) offer linear time sequence processing with input dependent gating, presenting a compelling alternative to quadratic complexity attention mechanisms. However, the design space for deploying SSMs in the TinyML regime remains largely unexplored. In this paper, BabyMamba-HAR is introduced, a framework comprising two novel lightweight Mamba inspired architectures optimized for resource constrained HAR: (1) CI-BabyMamba-HAR, using a channel independent stem that processes each sensor channel through shared weight, but instance independent transformations to prevent cross channel noise propagation, and (2) Crossover-BiDir-BabyMamba-HAR, using an early fusion stem that achieves channel count independent computational complexity. Both variants incorporate weight tied bidirectional scanning and lightweight temporal attention pooling. Through evaluation across eight diverse benchmarks, it is demonstrated that Crossover-BiDir-BabyMamba-HAR achieves 86.52% average macro F1-score with approximately 27K parameters and 2.21M MACs, matching TinyHAR (86.16%) while requiring 11x fewer MACs on high channel datasets. Systematic ablation studies reveal that bidirectional scanning contributes up to 8.42% F1-score improvement, and gated temporal attention provides up to 8.94% F1-score gain over mean pooling. These findings establish practical design principles for deploying selective state space models as efficient TinyML backbones for HAR."

Among the most active players shaping the morphogenetic path are fine-tuned changes in cell adhesion.

    "abstract": "${\\rm{EuTe}}_{4}$ is a polar charge density wave (CDW) material, with giant thermal hysteresis and non-volatile state switching under electric and optical fields, attracting great attention in recent years. However, the in-depth understanding of these anomalous phenomena remains elusive. Herein, via first-principles calculations, we reveal that the polar CDW state in ${\\rm{EuTe}}_{4}$ hosts a novel layer-selective nature, wherein multiple energetically close CDW configurations coexist and exhibit low interconversion energy barriers. Monte Carlo simulations indicate that the giant thermal hysteresis in ${\\rm{EuTe}}_{4}$ originates from a phase transition mainly driven by the change of configurational entropy, around which the material hosts a metastable CDW state characterized by diverse local polar configurations breaking the out-of-plane translational symmetry. The configurational composition of this metastable CDW state can be effectively controlled by electric and optical fields, thereby enabling non-volatile state switching. Our theoretical findings align well with recent experimental observations in ${\\rm{EuTe}}_{4}$ and pave the way for exploring the emerging phenomena and applications of polar CDW in multilayered systems."

    "abstract": "Epileptic seizures are generated in cerebral networks that propagate ictal and interictal activity. The structure of cerebral networks underpinning epileptic activity can be inferred from diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI). However, publicly available DWI data in individuals with epilepsy are scarce, and processing is technically challenging due to scan-specific artifacts, limiting research progress. Here, we release raw DWI data from 216 individuals with epilepsy and 98 healthy controls. Subject identifiers align with our previous data release (IDEAS), which includes T1-weighted and FLAIR MRI, surgical details, and long-term seizure outcomes after surgery. Preprocessing reduced distortions and artifacts, while fully processed data include diffusion metric maps in native and template space. We also provide parcellated structural connectomes using multiple atlases and connectivity measures. To illustrate the utility of this IDEAS II data, we replicated ENIGMA consortium findings, observing widespread reductions of fractional anisotropy, particularly ipsilateral to the area of seizure onset. We further demonstrate localised abnormality, and network connectivity using streamline tractography in a patient who subsequently underwent temporal lobe resection. This open dataset offers a comprehensive resource to advance research on structural connectivity and surgical outcomes in epilepsy."

    "abstract": "Customer lifetime value (CLV) describes a customer's long-term economic value for a business. This metric is widely used in marketing, for example, to select customers for a marketing campaign. However, modeling CLV is challenging. When relying on customers' purchase histories, the input data is sparse. Additionally, given its long-term focus, prediction horizons are often longer than estimation periods. Probabilistic models are able to overcome these challenges and, thus, are a popular option among researchers and practitioners. The latter also appreciate their applicability for both small and big data as well as their robust predictive performance without any fine-tuning requirements. Their popularity is due to three characteristics: data parsimony, scalability, and predictive accuracy. The R package CLVTools provides an efficient and user-friendly implementation framework to apply key probabilistic models such as the Pareto/NBD and Gamma-Gamma model. Further, it provides access to the latest model extensions to include time-invariant and time-varying covariates, parameter regularization, and equality constraints. This article gives an overview of the fundamental ideas of these statistical models and illustrates their application to derive CLV predictions for existing and new customers."

Pollux will allow us to study stellar and (exo)planetary systems, as well as cosmic ecosystems. For example, Pollux will provide new insights on exoplanet formation and evolution, characterization of the atmospheres and magnetospheres of stars and planets, and star-planet interactions. It will also allow us to resolve narrow UV emission and absorption lines, enabling us to follow the baryon cycle over cosmic time -- from galaxies forming stars out of interstellar gas and grains, and planets forming in circumstellar disks, to the various forms of feedback into the interstellar and intergalactic medium -- and from active galactic nuclei. The most innovative characteristic of Pollux is its unique spectropolarimetric capability in the UV, which will open a new parameter space. Its very high spectral resolution (~70000 to ~100000) and stability over a very large wavelength range will also be a major asset. In this paper, we summarize the main scientific drivers of Pollux and present its current design, technological challenges, and the Pollux consortium organization."

A prototype HVLS circuit, along with impedance matching and a driver to enable high-speed off-chip testing, was fabricated in a 22-nm FD-SOI process technology. The prototype consumes a total die area, including the interface circuitry, of 477 x 462 um^2, while the active area of the level-shifter is 2 x 3.26 um^2. The average power consumption of the circuit is measured to be 4.43 uW per cycle, and the jitter is less than 150 fs-rms."

    "abstract": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in applications such as travel assistance and purchasing support, they are often required to make subjective choices on behalf of users in settings where no objectively correct answer exists. We study LLM decision-making in a travel-assistant context by presenting models with choice dilemmas and analyzing their responses using multinomial logit models to derive implied willingness to pay (WTP) estimates. These WTP values are subsequently compared to human benchmark values from the economics literature. In addition to a baseline setting, we examine how model behavior changes under more realistic conditions, including the provision of information about users' past choices and persona-based prompting. Our results show that while meaningful WTP values can be derived for larger LLMs, they also display systematic deviations at the attribute level. Additionally, they tend to overestimate human WTP overall, particularly when expensive options or business-oriented personas are introduced. Conditioning models on prior preferences for cheaper options yields valuations that are closer to human benchmarks. Overall, our findings highlight both the potential and the limitations of using LLMs for subjective decision support and underscore the importance of careful model selection, prompt design, and user representation when deploying such systems in practice."

Designed as a controlled reference set under near-optimal acoustic and linguistic conditions, the benchmark was used to evaluate 37 models, ranging from Bambara-trained systems to large-scale commercial models. Our findings reveal that current ASR performance remains significantly below deployment standards in a narrow formal domain; the top-performing system in terms of Word Error Rate (WER) achieved 46.76\\% and the best Character Error Rate (CER) of 13.00\\% was set by another model, while several prominent multilingual models exceeded 100\\% WER. These results suggest that multilingual pre-training and model scaling alone are insufficient for underrepresented languages. Furthermore, because this dataset represents a best-case scenario of the most simplified and formal form of spoken Bambara, these figures are yet to be tested against practical, real-world settings. We provide the benchmark and an accompanying public leaderboard to facilitate transparent evaluation and future research in Bambara speech technology."

We geographically profile large-scale multimodal datasets by mapping image-caption pairs to countries based on location information extracted from captions using LLMs. Studying English captions from three widely used datasets (Re-LAION, DataComp1B, and Conceptual Captions) across $20$ common entities (e.g., house, flag), we find that the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada account for $48.0\\%$ of samples, while South American and African countries are severely under-represented with only $1.8\\%$ and $3.8\\%$ of images, respectively. We observe a strong correlation between a country's GDP and its representation in the data ($ρ= 0.82$). Examining non-English subsets for $4$ languages from the Re-LAION dataset, we find that representation skews heavily toward countries where these languages are predominantly spoken. Additionally, we find that higher representation does not necessarily translate to greater visual or semantic diversity. Finally, analyzing country-specific images generated by Stable Diffusion v1.3 trained on Re-LAION, we show that while generations appear realistic, they are severely limited in their coverage compared to real-world images."

    "abstract": "Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools are integral to modern DevSecOps pipelines, yet tools like CodeQL, Semgrep, and SonarQube remain fundamentally constrained: they require expert-crafted queries, generate excessive false positives, and detect only predefined vulnerability patterns. Recent work has explored augmenting SAST with Large Language Models (LLMs), but these approaches typically use LLMs to triage existing tool outputs rather than to reason about vulnerability semantics directly. We introduce QRS (Query, Review, Sanitize), a neuro-symbolic framework that inverts this paradigm. Rather than filtering results from static rules, QRS employs three autonomous agents that generate CodeQL queries from a structured schema definition and few-shot examples, then validate findings through semantic reasoning and automated exploit synthesis. This architecture enables QRS to discover vulnerability classes beyond predefined patterns while substantially reducing false positives. We evaluate QRS on full Python packages rather than isolated snippets. In 20 historical CVEs in popular PyPI libraries, QRS achieves 90.6% detection accuracy. Applied to the 100 most-downloaded PyPI packages, QRS identified 39 medium-to-high-severity vulnerabilities, 5 of which were assigned new CVEs, 5 received documentation updates, while the remaining 29 were independently discovered by concurrent researchers, validating both the severity and discoverability of these findings. QRS accomplishes this with low time overhead and manageable token costs, demonstrating that LLM-driven query synthesis and code review can complement manually curated rule sets and uncover vulnerability patterns that evade existing industry tools."

Here, this challenge is tackled in a large-scale multimodal program involving fifteen laboratories and facilities across Europe. Coordinated multi-site experiments are performed on state-of-the-art graphite / LiNiO2 Li-ion full cells to address two archetypal scientific questions: is the electrolyte composition impacting electrode properties, and how do electrode materials evolve when cells are cycled to their end-of-life? A fully standardized and centralized workflow is demonstrated, from sample production and delivery, to metadata and data handling, generating seventy-five concatenated datasets shared among all partners. Their integrated analysis shows that scientific conclusions depend critically on both the observable chosen to describe electrode properties, and the measurement technique employed. Individual experiments provide detailed information into specific aspects, such as crystal structures, redox activity, surface processes, morphology, etc., but can also function as binary diagnostic tool. Two-dimensional observable-technique patterns are introduced, in which each pixel encodes a yes, no or uncertain answer to a given scientific question. These patterns serve as multi-property metaviews, e.g. visual genotypes, enabling to classify material behavior and technique suitability according to predefined user demand and criteria, highlighting the interdependencies between measurement choices, extracted parameters and scientific interpretation. This multimodal workflow establishes a proof-of-concept for correlative analysis and underscores challenges toward fully integrated, automated and holistic approaches in energy material science."

By considering rational approximants, and by making use of the relationship between these chains and two dimensional Quantum Hall problems, we write down a gap labeling scheme for finite systems, and extend it to the quasiperiodic limit. We show, by numerical computations on open chains, that the proposed scheme correctly yields the winding numbers of edge states in each of the gaps, in all of the quasicrystals. In the strict 1D limit, we discuss properties of a simplified Hofstadter ``butterfly\" diagram, with the analogues of Landau levels appearing in the asymptotic limit."

Yet existing approaches often rely on deterministic latent chains that accumulate noise and overlook the uncertainty inherent in user intent, and they are typically trained in staged pipelines that hinder joint optimization and exploration. To address these challenges, we propose DiffuReason, a unified \"Think-then-Diffuse\" framework for sequential recommendation. It integrates multi-step Thinking Tokens for latent reasoning, diffusion-based refinement for denoising intermediate representations, and end-to-end Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) alignment to optimize for ranking performance. In the Think stage, the model generates Thinking Tokens that reason over user history to form an initial intent hypothesis. In the Diffuse stage, rather than treating this hypothesis as the final output, we refine it through a diffusion process that models user intent as a probabilistic distribution, providing iterative denoising against reasoning noise. Finally, GRPO-based reinforcement learning enables the reasoning and refinement modules to co-evolve throughout training, without the constraints of staged optimization. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that DiffuReason consistently improves diverse backbone architectures. Online A/B tests on a large-scale industrial platform further validate its practical effectiveness."

    "abstract": "While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models show strong promise for generalist robot control, it remains unclear whether -- and under what conditions -- the standard \"scale data\" recipe translates to robotics, where training data is inherently heterogeneous across embodiments, sensors, and action spaces. We present a systematic, controlled study of VLA scaling that revisits core training choices for pretraining across diverse robots. Using a representative VLA framework that combines a vision-language backbone with flow-matching, we ablate key design decisions under matched conditions and evaluate in extensive simulation and real-robot experiments. To improve the reliability of real-world results, we introduce a Grouped Blind Ensemble protocol that blinds operators to model identity and separates policy execution from outcome judgment, reducing experimenter bias. Our analysis targets three dimensions of VLA scaling. (1) Physical alignment: we show that a unified end-effector (EEF)-relative action representation is critical for robust cross-embodiment transfer. (2) Embodiment mixture: we find that naively pooling heterogeneous robot datasets often induces negative transfer rather than gains, underscoring the fragility of indiscriminate data scaling. (3) Training regularization: we observe that intuitive strategies, such as sensory dropout and multi-stage fine-tuning, do not consistently improve performance at scale. Together, this study challenge some common assumptions about embodied scaling and provide practical guidance for training large-scale VLA policies from diverse robotic data.

    "abstract": "Test-time adaptation (TTA) for large language models (LLMs) updates model parameters at inference time using signals available at deployment. This paper focuses on a common yet under-explored regime: unsupervised, sample-specific TTA, where the model adapts independently for each prompt using only the prompt itself, without gold answers or external supervision. Although appealing, naive unsupervised TTA with a fixed, handcrafted learning rate can be unstable: updates may overfit to prompt-specific statistics, drift from the desired answer distribution, and ultimately degrade generation quality. This failure mode is not surprising, as in this case TTA must adapt to a single prompt within only a few gradient steps, unlike standard training that averages updates over large datasets and long optimization horizons. Therefore, we propose layer-wise dynamic test-time adaptation, a framework which explicitly modulates TTA strength as a function of prompt representation, LLM structure and adaptation step. In our setting, TTA updates only LoRA parameters, and a lightweight hypernetwork predicts per-layer, per-step learning-rate multipliers, enabling fine-grained control. Experiments across various datasets and LLMs consistently show that our method substantially strengthens TTA by learning effective scaling patterns over adaptation steps and transformer layer projections, improving stability while delivering better performance."

Conventional grid-based planners struggle with scalability, while many kinematically-feasible planners impose a significant computational burden due to their search space complexity. To overcome these limitations, our approach introduces a deterministic free-space decomposition that creates a compact graph of overlapping rectangular corridors. This method enables a significant reduction in the search space, without sacrificing path resolution. The framework then performs online motion planning by finding a sequence of rectangles and generating a near-time-optimal, kinematically-feasible trajectory using an analytical planner. The result is a highly efficient solution for large-scale navigation. We validate our framework through extensive simulations and on a physical robot. The implementation is publicly available as open-source software."

We learn the joint distribution of PDE parameters and solutions via a diffusion process in a latent space of scaled spectral representations, where Gaussian noise corresponds to functions with controlled regularity. This spectral formulation enables significant dimensionality reduction compared to grid-based diffusion models and ensures that the induced process in function space remains within a class of functions for which the PDE operators are well defined. Building on diffusion posterior sampling, we enforce physics-informed constraints and measurement conditions during inference, applying Adam-based updates at each diffusion step. We evaluate the proposed approach on Poisson, Helmholtz, and incompressible Navier--Stokes equations, demonstrating improved accuracy and computational efficiency compared with existing diffusion-based PDE solvers, which are state of the art for sparse observations.

Specifically, we consider \\[ λa(x)u(x)+H(x,Du(x))-Aλ=c_0, \\] with a suitably chosen constant $A>0$. By appropriately changing the signs of the function $a(x)$ on different static classes associated with $H$, we show that the maximal viscosity solution converges uniformly as $λ\\to 0^+$ and that all elementary solutions of the stationary equation \\[ H(x,Du(x))=c_0 \\] can be selected as limits. This provides the first result for selecting multiple viscosity solutions in vanishing discount problems beyond the usual monotonicity and integral assumptions, as long as $a(x)$ is positive on one static class. Our results highlight the crucial role of static classes in controlling the asymptotic behavior of viscosity solutions. Previously, under usual monotonicity assumptions, only a single solution could be selected (as discussed in \\cite{GL}), whereas our approach allows controlled selection of multiple solutions via static class-guided discount coefficients."

    "abstract": "Solving large-scale linear systems problems is a central task in scientific and industrial computing. Classical iterative solvers face increasing difficulty as the number of unknowns becomes large, while fully quantum linear solvers require fault-tolerant resources that remain far beyond near-term feasibility. Here we propose a quantum-accelerated conjugate gradient (QACG) framework in which a fault-tolerant quantum algorithm is used exclusively to construct a spectrally informed initial guess for a classical conjugate gradient (CG) solver. Rather than replacing classical kernels, the quantum subroutine functions as a cooperative accelerator that selectively suppresses low-energy spectral components responsible for slow classical convergence. We analyze the total runtime and resource requirements of this integrated quantum-HPC platform for the 3D Poisson equation. A central feature of QACG is a controllable decomposition of the condition number between the quantum and the classical solver, enabling flexible allocation of computational effort across quantum and classical resources. Under explicit architectural assumptions, we identify regimes in which this cooperative strategy yields a runtime advantage over purely classical approaches while requiring substantially fewer quantum resources than end-to-end quantum linear solvers. These results illustrate a concrete pathway toward the scientific and industrial use of early-stage fault-tolerant quantum computing and point to a scalable hybrid paradigm in which quantum devices act as accelerators within high-performance computing workflows rather than as standalone replacements."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel mechanism based on the instantaneous Bethe-Salpeter (Salpeter) equation for investigating wave function mixing in vector mesons such as $ψ(3770)$. Conventional theories typically treat $ψ(3770)$ as a $2S-1D$ mixed state; however, considering only tensor forces or relativistic corrections alone often leads to mixing angles that are too small and inconsistent with experimental data. Phenomenological $2S-1D$ mixing requires experimental data as input to determine the mixing angles, resulting in limited theoretical studies on states like $Υ(1D, 2D)$ in the absence of experimental data. To more accurately describe $S-D$ mixing and its relativistic effects, this paper systematically compares eight possible relativistic wave function representations ($\\varphi_1$ to $\\varphi_8$) by solving the Salpeter equation and calculates the mass spectra and dileptonic decay widths of charmonium and bottomonium. The study finds that the wave function representation $\\varphi_2$ can simultaneously reproduce the experimental data of both charmonium and bottomonium well. Further analysis reveals that, in addition to $S-D$ mixing, the wave functions of vector mesons contain a non-negligible $P$-wave component, meaning they are $S-P-D$ mixed states. We predict the mixing angles for bottomonium $Υ(1D)$ and $Υ(2D)$ to be $(1.78^{+0.32}_{-0.25})^\\circ$ and $(5.44^{+1.10}_{-0.76})^\\circ$, with dileptonic decay widths of $2.29^{+0.86}_{-0.69}$ eV and $10.5^{+4.2}_{-3.1}$ eV, respectively."

In machine translation, studies typically report only the translation quality of the student and omit the computational complexity of performing KD, making it difficult to select among the many available KD choices under compute-induced constraints. In this study, we evaluate representative KD methods by considering both translation quality and computational cost. We express computational cost as a carbon footprint using the machine learning life cycle assessment (MLCA) tool. This assessment accounts for runtime operational emissions and amortized hardware production costs throughout the KD model life cycle (teacher training, distillation, and inference). We find that (i) distillation overhead dominates the total footprint at small deployment volumes, (ii) inference dominates at scale, making KD beneficial only beyond a task-dependent usage threshold, and (iii) word-level distillation typically offers more favorable footprint-quality trade-offs than sequence-level distillation. Our protocol provides reproducible guidance for selecting KD methods under explicit quality and compute-induced constraints."

    "abstract": "Fine-tuning large pre-trained models on a target distribution often improves in-distribution (ID) accuracy, but at the cost of out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness as representations specialize to the fine-tuning data. Weight-space ensembling methods, such as Model Soups, mitigate this effect by averaging multiple checkpoints, but they are computationally prohibitive, requiring the training and storage of dozens of fine-tuned models. In this paper, we introduce MonoSoup, a simple, data-free, hyperparameter-free, post-hoc method that achieves a strong ID-OOD balance using only a single checkpoint. Our method applies Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to each layer's update and decomposes it into high-energy directions that capture task-specific adaptation and low-energy directions that introduce noise but may still encode residual signals useful for robustness. MonoSoup then uses entropy-based effective rank to automatically re-weigh these components with layer-wise coefficients that account for the spectral and geometric structure of the model. Experiments on CLIP models fine-tuned on ImageNet and evaluated under natural distribution shifts, as well as on Qwen language models tested on mathematical reasoning and multiple-choice benchmarks, show that this plug-and-play approach is a practical and effective alternative to multi-checkpoint methods, retaining much of their benefits without their computational overhead."

The QD dynamics are investigated in the framework of the extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation, which includes long-range dipole-dipole interactions (DDI) and the beyond-mean-field Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) term, revealing the emergence of self-bound states. Stable stationary solutions for multipole QDs with different values of the topological charge (vorticity $S$) are shaped as necklace-like modes, with the number of \\textquotedblleft beads\" (multipole's order) $n=2S$, up to $S=6$. The stability area of the multipoles shrinks with the increase of $S$. For higher values of $S$ the centrifugal effect associated with the phase winding destabilizes the annular density and drives the formation of fragmented multipole droplet states. The dependence of the chemical potential, total energy and peak density on the norm (number of particles) and $S$ is produced. These findings uncover the stabilizing effect of the LHY correction and DDI anisotropy in maintaining complex QD states in the non-rotating configurations."

After the calibration and correction of the data, we obtained for each H II region the de-reddened fluxes in the aforementioned lines, the size, the Hα equivalent width, and, using two different empirical calibrations, the metallicity. Employing a method based on the Delaunay triangulation, a two-dimensional (2D) representation of the metallicity was obtained. Data for 209 H II regions of NGC 628 and 226 H II regions of NGC 6946 are obtained. The radial behaviours of the Hα equivalent width, the excitation, and the oxygen abundance are derived. Two-dimensional representations of the metallicity and the excitation are calculated for the galaxies in the study. The two empirical calibrations of the metallicity are compared. The oxygen abundance gradients obtained in this study agree with previously published values. However, more regions were examined than in previous studies. We find a difference of about 0.6 dex between the two empirical calibrations employed. Finally, the 2D representations of the metallicity reveal high metallicity knots in NGC 628, and for NGC 6946 a high metallicity azimuthal structure is discovered. These high metallicity regions seem to be linked to the arms of the galaxies and are probably produced by an increase in the temperature of the ionizing clusters in the H II regions, which may be linked to variations in the initial mass functions of the galaxies between the arm and interarm regions."

For the cascaded system with a Dirichlet pointwise interconnection, the ODE takes the value of a Robin boundary condition at the ODE-PDE interface as its direct input, and the PDE is driven by a Dirichlet boundary input at the opposite end. We first employ the backstepping method to design a boundary controller and to decouple the cascaded system. This decoupling facilitates independent stability analysis of the PDE and ODE systems sequentially. Then, to address the challenges posed by Dirichlet boundary disturbances to the application of the classical Lyapunov method, we utilize the generalized Lyapunov method to establish the ISS in the max-norm for the cascaded system involving Dirichlet boundary disturbances and two other types of disturbances. The obtained result indicates that even in the presence of different types of disturbances, ISS analysis can still be conducted within the framework of Lyapunov stability theory. For the well-posedness of the target system, it is conducted by using the technique of lifting and the semigroup method. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme and ISS properties for a cascaded system with different disturbances."

Lions considered a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) of harmonic functions on a regular domain with Sobolev traces and obtained a formula that expresses the kernel of this space as an integral on the boundary of some derivatives of the Green function associated with the Laplace operator and the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition. This result was simplified and extended later by Englis, Lukkassen, Peetre, and Persson in \\cite{ELPL} to more general elliptic systems of even orders. In particular, they emphasized that the resemblance between Lions' type formula and the Hadamard variational formula only appears when the operator is of order $2$. In this paper, we investigate some RKHS of $a$-harmonic functions, where $a$ in $(0,1)$ refers to a fractional exponent of the Laplace operator. For such fractional order pseudo-differential operators, the local nonhomogeneous Dirichlet problem can be addressed by means of some $a$-transmission Sobolev spaces, which were introduced by Hörmander in the sixties and recently developed by Grubb in a series of papers. We deduce from these works a fractional Poisson formula, which is applied to obtain a Lions' type formula. We observe, in particular, that despite the order of the operator not being $2$, this formula resembles the Hadamard variational formula that we prove in the companion paper \\cite{sidy-franck_1}. As a complementary remark, we observe that for a family of RKHS associated with the steady Stokes system, a second order system, there is also a Lions' type formula for their two-point kernels, which turn out not to be similar to the corresponding Hadamard variation formula."

    "abstract": "In a dissipative system such as star or a galaxy, the emitted photons are decoupled from matter particles and may therefore be considered as part of a closed system to which the Second Law of Thermodynamics applies. In the present paper, we define a global entropy using a statistical approach that accounts for the contributions of both matter particles and photons. The statistical contribution of radiation is described as a photon gas in the definition of this global entropy. The increase in global entropy can foster structure formation -- rather than disorder -- because structures such as stars and galaxies are efficient at dissipating energy in the form of photons, and thus at producing entropy. We show that stars generate a nearly equal amount of specific entropy, and therefore a comparable number of photons per unit mass, over their lifetime on the main sequence of the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram. This suggests that the main sequence of the HR diagram constitutes a locus of convergence toward a universal specific entropy production by stars. We then examine the implications of this approach for the star-formation main sequence in galaxies, and find a similar result. The emergence of organized structures in cosmic history reflects the second law, as organized matter is efficient at generating entropy through the slicing of energy into lower-frequency photons. This is also reflected in the dominant contribution of low-frequency photons to the extragalactic background light. Finally, we briefly discuss how this perspective may inform us on the possibility of the existence of life elsewhere in the universe."

    "abstract": "Effectively scaling GUI automation is essential for computer-use agents (CUAs); however, existing work primarily focuses on scaling GUI grounding rather than the more crucial GUI planning, which requires more sophisticated data collection. In reality, the exploration process of a CUA across apps/desktops/web pages typically follows a tree structure, with earlier functional entry points often being explored more frequently. Thus, organizing large-scale trajectories into tree structures can reduce data cost and streamline the data scaling of GUI planning. In this work, we propose TreeCUA to efficiently scale GUI automation with tree-structured verifiable evolution. We propose a multi-agent collaborative framework to explore the environment, verify actions, summarize trajectories, and evaluate quality to generate high-quality and scalable GUI trajectories. To improve efficiency, we devise a novel tree-based topology to store and replay duplicate exploration nodes, and design an adaptive exploration algorithm to balance the depth (\\emph{i.e.}, trajectory difficulty) and breadth (\\emph{i.e.}, trajectory diversity). Moreover, we develop world knowledge guidance and global memory backtracking to avoid low-quality generation. Finally, we naturally extend and propose the TreeCUA-DPO method from abundant tree node information, improving GUI planning capability by referring to the branch information of adjacent trajectories. Experimental results show that TreeCUA and TreeCUA-DPO offer significant improvements, and out-of-domain (OOD) studies further demonstrate strong generalization.

Using Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) data, we detect extended radio emission extending outwards to the galactic axis, with a steep non-thermal spectral index ($α= -1.2 \\pm 0.2$) indicative of synchrotron radiation from an AGN jet. The jet has a physical extent of $\\approx 8.2\\,kpc$ (angular length of $64^{\\prime\\prime}$). Multi-wavelength data from The Dark Energy Camera Plane Survey 2 (DECaPS2), Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), and extended Roentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) provide further support for this interpretation. The colour-colour diagram presenting WISE infrared observations suggests the presence of dust and young stars that trace the galaxy's disk structure. Our analysis reveals a radio jet, alongside star formation traced by infrared emission, demonstrating the complex interplay of AGN activity and star formation in this well-resolved galaxy. Intriguingly, the spatial relationship reveals the brighter X-ray emission to be largely adjacent to and enveloping the extended radio emission. This suggests that the radio jet, while extending at a significant angle to the galactic disk, is confined by the larger X-ray gas halo, similar to other systems (i.e., ESO 295-IG022, Centaurus A) and may indicate jet collimation and channelling effects."

    "abstract": "Quantum phase transitions are an established setting for emergent phenomena driven by strong electronic correlations, including strange metals and unconventional superconductivity. These have been explored extensively in Kondo lattice materials tuned to an antiferromagnetic quantum critical point (QCP), but superconductivity emerging near ferromagnetic quantum criticality is not yet observed, and the conditions under which it occurs in proximity to ferromagnetism are undetermined. Here, we report a new setting for superconductivity in the ferromagnetic Kondo-lattice material Ce5CoGe2, where there is a ferromagnetic ground state at ambient pressure, which evolves to antiferromagnetism under applied pressures. The antiferromagnetic transition is suppressed to a zero-temperature QCP, which is accompanied by strange-metal behavior. Superconductivity does not occur at the QCP, but instead appears at pressures beyond the magnetic instability. These findings suggest that Ce5CoGe2 represents a distinct class of correlated materials exhibiting a unique scenario for the emergence of superconductivity, likely associated with unconventional pairing mechanisms beyond spin-fluctuations."

    "abstract": "Deterministic frequency deviations (DFDs) are systematic and predictable excursions of grid frequency that arise from synchronized generation ramps induced by electricity market scheduling. In this paper, we analyze the impact of the European day-ahead market reform of 1 October 2025, which replaced hourly trading blocks with quarter-hourly blocks, on DFDs in the Central European synchronous area. Using publicly available frequency measurements, we compare periods before and after the reform based on daily frequency profiles, indicators characterizing frequency deviations, principal component analysis, Fourier-based functional data analysis, and power spectral density analysis. We show that the reform substantially reduces characteristic hourly frequency deviations and suppresses dominant spectral components at hourly and half-hourly time scales, while quarter-hourly structures gain relative importance. While the likelihood of large frequency deviations decreases overall, reductions for extreme events are less clear and depend on the metric used. Our results demonstrate that market design reforms can effectively mitigate systematic frequency deviations, but also highlight that complementary technical and regulatory measures are required to further reduce large frequency excursions in low-inertia power systems."

Literacies have become an important concept in describing modern life skills, with visualization literacy generally referring to the use and interpretation of data visualizations. However, prior work on visualization literacy overlooks interaction and its associated challenges, despite it being an intrinsic aspect of using visualizations. Based on existing theoretical frameworks, we derive a two-dimensional model that combines four well-known literacies with five novel ones. We found evidence for our model through analyzing existing visualization systems as well as through observations from an exploratory study involving such systems. We conclude by outlining steps towards measuring, evaluating, designing for, and teaching interactive visualization literacy."

    "abstract": "Real-time whole-body teleoperation is a critical method for humanoid robots to perform complex tasks in unstructured environments. However, developing a unified controller that robustly supports diverse human motions remains a significant challenge. Existing methods typically distill multiple expert policies into a single general policy, which often inevitably leads to performance degradation, particularly on highly dynamic motions. This paper presents TeleGate, a unified whole-body teleoperation framework for humanoid robots that achieves high-precision tracking across various motions while avoiding the performance loss inherent in knowledge distillation. Our key idea is to preserve the full capability of domain-specific expert policies by training a lightweight gating network, which dynamically activates experts in real-time based on proprioceptive states and reference trajectories. Furthermore, to compensate for the absence of future reference trajectories in real-time teleoperation, we introduce a VAE-based motion prior module that extracts implicit future motion intent from historical observations, enabling anticipatory control for motions requiring prediction such as jumping and standing up. We conducted empirical evaluations in simulation and also deployed our technique on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot. Using only 2.5 hours of motion capture data for training, our TeleGate achieves high-precision real-time teleoperation across diverse dynamic motions (e.g., running, fall recovery, and jumping), significantly outperforming the baseline methods in both tracking accuracy and success rate."

    "abstract": "In this paper we produce evidence that confinement of colour is due to dual superconductivity of $QCD$ vacuum. To do that we put together results of old numerical simulations and results of more recent investigations. The starting point is the expectation that gauge theories admit a dual description in terms of monopoles. The strategy is then to construct the creation operator $μ$ of a monopole and to compute its vacuum expectation value $\\langle μ\\rangle$ , the disorder parameter which indicates dual superconductivity. The Imechanism of confinement is dual superconductivity of vacuum if $\\langle μ\\rangle \\neq 0 $ in the confined phase , and $\\langle μ\\rangle =0$ in the deconfined phase. Confinement has to be certified by independent methods. It is shown that gauge invariance requires that field strengths be replaced by gauge invariant field strengths, which are their parallel transports to infinity. The resulting disorder parameter is a sum of correlation functions of gauge invariant field strength, and its behaviour understood by use of existing lattice data of two-point gauge invariant correlations. As a byproduct an apparent existing inconsistency, the lack of preferred orientation in colour space of the chromo-electric field inside confining flux tubes, is resolved."

We propose a VLA design and optimization techniques critical for achieving high performance, including VLEN-adaptive memory layout adjustment, load buffering, fine-grained loop control, and gate fusion-based arithmetic intensity adaptation. We provide an implementation in Google's Qsim and evaluate five quantum circuits of up to 36 qubits on three ARM processors, including NVIDIA Grace, AWS Graviton3, and Fujitsu A64FX. By defining new metrics and PMU events to quantify vectorization activities, we draw generic insights for future VLA designs. Our single-source implementation of VLA quantum simulations achieves up to 4.5x speedup on A64FX, 2.5x speedup on Grace, and 1.5x speedup on Graviton."

In long-horizon TIR trajectories, an early irrecoverable mistake can determine success or failure, making it crucial to localize the first irrecoverable step and leverage it for fine-grained credit assignment. We propose Error-Localized Policy Optimization (ELPO), which localizes the first irrecoverable step via binary-search rollout trees under a fixed rollout budget, converts the resulting tree into stable learning signals through hierarchical advantage attribution, and applies error-localized adaptive clipping to strengthen corrective updates on the critical step and its suffix. Across TIR benchmarks in math, science QA, and code execution, ELPO consistently outperforms strong Agentic RL baselines under comparable sampling budgets, with additional gains in Pass@K and Major@K scaling, rollout ranking quality, and tool-call efficiency. Our code will be publicly released soon."

In addition, we introduce a semi-analytical, efficient, and reliable method for computing the Green's function in rectangular rooms, which is described and validated through numerical tests. With a sufficiently large truncation order, the resulting error becomes negligible, making the method suitable as a benchmark for numerical simulations. Additional aspects regarding the spectral basis orthogonality and completeness are also addressed, providing a general framework for the validity of the proposed approach."

    "abstract": "Given a simple graph $G$, its line graph, denoted by $L(G)$, is obtained by representing each edge of $G$ as a vertex, with two vertices in $L(G)$ adjacent whenever the corresponding edges in $G$ share a common endpoint. By applying the line graph operation repeatedly, we obtain higher order line graphs, denoted by $L^{r}(G)$. In other words, $L^{0}(G) = G$, and for any integer $r \\ge 1$, $L^{r}(G) = L(L^{r-1}(G))$. Given a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, we wish to efficiently find out (i) if $L^k(G)$ has an Euler path, (ii) the value of $Δ(L^k(G))$. Note that the size of a higher order line graph could be much larger than that of $G$. For the first question, we show that for a graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges the largest $k$ where $L^k(G)$ has an Euler path satisfies $k = \\mathcal O(nm)$. We also design an $\\mathcal{O}(n^2m)$-time algorithm to output all $k$ such that $L^k(G)$ has an Euler path. For the second question, we study the growth of maximum degree of $L^k(G)$, $k \\ge 0$. It is easy to calculate $Δ(L^k(G))$ when $G$ is a path, cycle or a claw. Any other connected graph is called a prolific graph and we denote the set of all prolific graphs by $\\mathcal G$. We extend the works of Hartke and Higgins to show that for any prolific graph $G$, there exists a constant rational number $dgc(G)$ and an integer $k_0$ such that for all $k \\ge k_0$, $Δ(L^k(G)) = dgc(G) \\cdot 2^{k-4} + 2$. We show that $\\{dgc(G) \\mid G \\in \\mathcal G\\}$ has first, second, third, fourth and fifth minimums, namely, $c_1 = 3$, $c_2 = 4$, $c_3 = 5.5$, $c_4 = 6$ and $c_5=7$; the third minimum stands out surprisingly from the other four. Moreover, for $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, we provide a complete characterization of $\\mathcal G_i = \\{dgc(G) = c_i \\mid G \\in \\mathcal G \\}$. Apart from this, we show that the set $\\{dgc(G) \\mid G \\in \\mathcal G, 7 < dgc(G) < 8\\}$ is countably infinite."

    "abstract": "Real-world fine-tuning of dexterous manipulation policies remains challenging due to limited real-world interaction budgets and highly multimodal action distributions. Diffusion-based policies, while expressive, do not permit conservative likelihood-based updates during fine-tuning because action probabilities are intractable. In contrast, conventional Gaussian policies collapse under multimodality, particularly when actions are executed in chunks, and standard per-step critics fail to align with chunked execution, leading to poor credit assignment. We present SOFT-FLOW, a sample-efficient off-policy fine-tuning framework with normalizing flow (NF) to address these challenges. The normalizing flow policy yields exact likelihoods for multimodal action chunks, allowing conservative, stable policy updates through likelihood regularization and thereby improving sample efficiency. An action-chunked critic evaluates entire action sequences, aligning value estimation with the policy's temporal structure and improving long-horizon credit assignment. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a likelihood-based, multimodal generative policy combined with chunk-level value learning on real robotic hardware. We evaluate SOFT-FLOW on two challenging dexterous manipulation tasks in the real world: cutting tape with scissors retrieved from a case, and in-hand cube rotation with a palm-down grasp -- both of which require precise, dexterous control over long horizons. On these tasks, SOFT-FLOW achieves stable, sample-efficient adaptation where standard methods struggle."

CO, p-H2O, CS, and HCN show similar velocity profiles with a narrow, blueshifted component, which may be linked to the outer outflow layer. Redshifted wings may indicate inner outflow activity. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo framework is employed to infer column densities and temperatures accurately. We also performed spectral energy distribution fitting to constrain the global physical parameters of G10, providing essential context for interpreting the molecular emission. The MCMC analysis revealed two excitation temperature components: a warm component (30-65 K) and a hot component (90-250 K). The higher temperatures indicate dense, hot gas typical of massive hot cores. The lower temperatures correspond to the warm, less dense envelope around the core. Transitions of H2O, high-excitation CO, and HCN indicate outflowing gas and high-density shocked regions. These findings highlight G10's complex dynamical environment."

Here we present studies of the optical conductivity of Nd1-xSrxNiO2 thin films spanning the full phase diagram 0.025 < x < 0.30 using spectroscopic ellipsometry. The data are consistent with a two-band Drude model, which allows the decomposition of the intraband response into distinct contributions. One is from a \"narrow\" Drude term which we associate with electron bands, and the other a \"broad\" Drude term linked to the hole band with strong correlations. Increasing Sr doping leads to an expansion of the hole band spectral weight, and a corresponding reduction in the electron band, indicative of the multiband electronic structure and a doping-dependent reconstruction of the Fermi surface. Both doping and temperature-dependent optical spectra display significant spectral weight transfer from high to low energy, a hallmark of strong electronic correlations. In the superconducting state at optimal doping (x = 0.15), both electron and hole bands contribute to the superconducting condensate, signifying multiband superconductivity."

This paradigm shift inherently and significantly increases the requirement for onboard computing performance and high-performance communication infrastructure. At the same time, Moore's Law and Dennard Scaling are grinding to a halt, in turn, driving computing systems to larger scales and higher levels of heterogeneity and specialization, through application-specific hardware accelerators, instead of relying on technological scaling only. Approaching ACES requires this substantial amount of compute at an increasingly high energy-efficiency, since most use cases are fundamentally resource-bound. This increase in compute performance and heterogeneity goes hand in hand with a growing demand for high memory bandwidth and capacity as the driving applications grow in complexity, operating on huge and progressively irregular data sets and further requiring a steady influx of sensor data, increasing pressure both on on-chip and off-chip interconnect systems. Further, ACES combines real-time time-critical with general compute tasks on the same physical platform, sharing communication, storage, and micro-architectural resources. These heterogeneous mixed-criticality systems (MCSs) place additional pressure on the interconnect, demanding minimal contention between the different criticality levels to sustain a high degree of predictability. Fulfilling the performance and energy-efficiency requirements across a wide range of industrial applications requires a carefully co-designed process of the memory system with the use cases as well as the compute units and accelerators."

Yet, most existing studies evaluate RAG methods in isolation and primarily focus on single-turn settings. This paper addresses the lack of a systematic comparison of RAG methods for multi-turn conversational QA, where dialogue history, coreference, and shifting user intent substantially complicate retrieval. We present a comprehensive empirical study of vanilla and advanced RAG methods across eight diverse conversational QA datasets spanning multiple domains. Using a unified experimental setup, we evaluate retrieval quality and answer generation using generator and retrieval metrics, and analyze how performance evolves across conversation turns. Our results show that robust yet straightforward methods, such as reranking, hybrid BM25, and HyDE, consistently outperform vanilla RAG. In contrast, several advanced techniques fail to yield gains and can even degrade performance below the No-RAG baseline. We further demonstrate that dataset characteristics and dialogue length strongly influence retrieval effectiveness, explaining why no single RAG strategy dominates across settings. Overall, our findings indicate that effective conversational RAG depends less on method complexity than on alignment between the retrieval strategy and the dataset structure.

It is demonstrated that the interaction-induced Hartree dispersion plays a decisive role in determining the momentum sector of low-energy spin polarons. Furthermore, by introducing a finite bandwidth, we unravel the underlying binding mechanisms: the formation of low-energy spin polarons is governed by the conventional virtual exchange mechanism, whereas the high-energy spin polarons arise from a joint effect of the effective attraction and virtual exchange. Our results suggest promising avenues for realizing spin polaron crystals and exploring novel superconducting pairing mechanisms in moiré materials like twisted WSe2 and MoTe2."

    "abstract": "GECAM is a constellation of all-sky monitors in hard X-ray and gamma-ray band primarily aimed at high energy transients such as gamma-ray bursts, soft gamma-ray repeaters, solar flares and terrestrial gamma-ray flashes. As GECAM has the highest temporal resolution (0.1~$μ$s) among instruments of its kind, it can identify the so-called simultaneous events (STE) that deposit signals in multiple detectors nearly at the same time (with a 0.3~$μ$s window). However, the properties and origin of STE have not yet been explored. In this work, we implemented, for the first time, a comprehensive analysis of the STE detected by GECAM, including their morphology, energy deposition, and the dependence on the geomagnetic coordinates. We find that these STE probably result from direct interactions between high-energy charged cosmic rays and satellite. These results demonstrate that GECAM can detect, identify, and characterize high-energy cosmic rays, making it a Micro Cosmic-Ray Observatory (MICRO) in low Earth orbit."

However, their use in high-stakes fields like healthcare remains limited due to persistent hallucinations, where generated text contradicts or ignores visual input. We contend that MLLMs can comprehend images but struggle to produce accurate token sequences. Minor perturbations can shift attention from truthful to untruthful states, and the autoregressive nature of text generation often prevents error correction. To address this, we propose SchröMind-a novel framework reducing hallucinations via solving the Schrödinger bridge problem. It establishes a token-level mapping between hallucinatory and truthful activations with minimal transport cost through lightweight training, while preserving the model's original capabilities. Extensive experiments on the POPE and MME benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of Schrödinger, which achieves state-of-the-art performance while introducing only minimal computational overhead."

To bridge this gap, we first develop a novel three-stage pipeline to synthesize a million-scale image-description dataset. The pipeline leverages multiple general-purpose MLLMs as weak annotators, refines their outputs through consensus fusion and expert knowledge injection, and produces high-fidelity descriptions of cell morphology. Using this dataset, we then fine-tune the Qwen3-VL-4B model via a multi-stage strategy to create a specialized cytopathology MLLM. The resulting model, named Singpath-VL, demonstrates superior performance in fine-grained morphological perception and cell-level diagnostic classification.

This method, with its shorter duration, is the most efficient and suitable for fast-object detection in IoT systems, which require energy-efficient applications compared to end-to-end methods. We have implemented this technique on three edge devices: AMD AlveoT M U50, Jetson Orin Nano, and Hailo-8T M AI Accelerator, and four models with artificial neural networks and transformer models. We examined various classes, including birds, cars, trains, and airplanes. Using the frame difference method, the MobileNet model consistently has high accuracy, low latency, and is highly energy-efficient. YOLOX consistently shows the lowest accuracy, lowest latency, and lowest efficiency. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has improved the average accuracy gain by 28.314%, the average efficiency gain by 3.6 times, and the average latency reduction by 39.305% compared to the end-to-end method. Of all these classes, the faster objects are trains and airplanes. Experiments show that the accuracy percentage for trains and airplanes is lower than other categories. So, in tasks that require fast detection and accurate results, end-to-end methods can be a disaster because they cannot handle fast object detection. To improve computational efficiency, we designed our proposed method as a lightweight detection algorithm. It is well suited for applications in IoT systems, especially those that require fast-moving object detection and higher accuracy."

EcoGym comprises three diverse environments: Vending, Freelance, and Operation, implemented in a unified decision-making process with standardized interfaces, and budgeted actions over an effectively unbounded horizon (1000+ steps if 365 day-loops for evaluation). The evaluation of EcoGym is based on business-relevant outcomes (e.g., net worth, income, and DAU), targeting long-term strategic coherence and robustness under partial observability and stochasticity. Experiments across eleven leading LLMs expose a systematic tension: no single model dominates across all three scenarios. Critically, we find that models exhibit significant suboptimality in either high-level strategies or efficient actions executions. EcoGym is released as an open, extensible testbed for transparent long-horizon agent evaluation and for studying controllability-utility trade-offs in realistic economic settings."

However, the inherent capacity gap often limits the performance of student networks. Inspired by the expressiveness of pretrained teacher networks, a compelling research question arises: is there a type of network that can not only inherit the teacher's structure but also maximize the inheritance of its knowledge? Furthermore, how does the performance of such an inheriting network compare to that of student networks, all benefiting from the same teacher network? To further explore this question, we propose InherNet, a neural network inheritance method that performs asymmetric low-rank decomposition on the teacher's weights and reconstructs a lightweight yet expressive network without significant architectural disruption. By leveraging Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for initialization to ensure the inheritance of principal knowledge, InherNet effectively balances depth, width, and compression efficiency. Experimental results across unimodal and multimodal tasks demonstrate that InherNet achieves higher performance compared to student networks of similar parameter sizes. Our findings reveal a promising direction for future research in efficient model compression beyond traditional distillation."

    "abstract": "Low-latency live streaming (LLS) has emerged as a popular web application, with many platforms adopting real-time protocols such as WebRTC to minimize end-to-end latency. However, we observe a counter-intuitive phenomenon: even when the actual encoded bitrate does not fully utilize the available bandwidth, stalling events remain frequent. This insufficient bandwidth utilization arises from the intrinsic temporal variations of real-time video encoding, which cause conventional packet-level congestion control algorithms to misestimate available bandwidth. When a high-bitrate frame is suddenly produced, sending at the wrong rate can either trigger packet loss or increase queueing delay, resulting in playback stalls. To address these issues, we present Camel, a novel frame-level congestion control algorithm (CCA) tailored for LLS. Our insight is to use frame-level network feedback to capture the true network capacity, immune to the irregular sending pattern caused by encoding. Camel comprises three key modules: the Bandwidth and Delay Estimator and the Congestion Detector, which jointly determine the average sending rate, and the Bursting Length Controller, which governs the emission pattern to prevent packet loss. We evaluate Camel on both large-scale real-world deployments and controlled simulations. In the real-world platform with 250M users and 2B sessions across 150+ countries, Camel achieves up to a 70.8% increase in 1080P resolution ratio, a 14.4% increase in media bitrate, and up to a 14.1% reduction in stalling ratio. In simulations under undershooting, shallow buffers, and network jitter, Camel outperforms existing congestion control algorithms, with up to 19.8% higher bitrate, 93.0% lower stalling ratio, and 23.9% improvement in bandwidth estimation accuracy."

We designed Jokeasy, a search-enabled prototype system that integrates a dual-role LLM agent acting as both a material scout and a prototype writer to support human-AI collaboration in thematic joke writing. Jokeasy provides a visual canvas in which retrieved web content is organized into editable inspiration blocks and developed through a multistage workflow. A qualitative study with 13 hobbyists and 5 expert participants (including professional comedians and HCI/AI specialists) showed that weaving real-time web material into this structured workflow enriches ideation and preserves author agency, while also revealing needs for finer search control, tighter chat-canvas integration, and more flexible visual editing.

We hypothesize that a generated text span's factuality is correlated with its representational instability across the model's internal layers. Based on this, we propose the CoCoA (Confusion and Consistency Aware) decoder, a novel, training-free decoding algorithm that mitigates hallucinations at inference time by listening to these signals in the middle layers. We propose two metrics to quantify this instability in the middle layers, and use it to penalize outputs that exhibit high internal confusion, thereby steering the model towards more internally consistent and factually grounded outputs. We further propose a self-information gated variant, CoCoA-SIG, that dynamically modulates this penalty to selectively target high-surprise, unstable generations. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks, including question-answering, summarization and code generation demonstrate that CoCoA significantly improves factual correctness across multiple model families (e.g., Llama-3, Qwen-2.5, Mistral). By leveraging model-intrinsic signals, CoCoA offers an effective and broadly applicable method for enhancing the trustworthiness of LLMs at inference time, without requiring any model retraining."

We address this gap with AlgoVeri, a benchmark that evaluates vericoding of $77$ classical algorithms in Dafny, Verus, and Lean. By enforcing identical functional contracts, AlgoVeri reveals critical capability gaps in verification systems. While frontier models achieve tractable success in Dafny ($40.3$% for Gemini-3 Flash), where high-level abstractions and SMT automation simplify the workflow, performance collapses under the systems-level memory constraints of Verus ($24.7$%) and the explicit proof construction required by Lean (7.8%). Beyond aggregate metrics, we uncover a sharp divergence in test-time compute dynamics: Gemini-3 effectively utilizes iterative repair to boost performance (e.g., tripling pass rates in Dafny), whereas GPT-OSS saturates early. Finally, our error analysis shows that language design affects the refinement trajectory: while Dafny allows models to focus on logical correctness, Verus and Lean trap models in persistent syntactic and semantic barriers.

In this paper, we propose Correlation-Aware AMA (CA-AMA), a novel framework that augments AMA with a new correlation-aware payment. We show that any CA-AMA preserves the DSIC property and formalize finding optimal CA-AMA as a constraint optimization problem subject to the IR constraint. Then, we theoretically characterize scenarios where classic AMAs can perform arbitrarily poorly compared to the optimal revenue, while the CA-AMA can reach the optimal revenue. For optimizing CA-AMA, we design a practical two-stage training algorithm. We derive that the target function's continuity and the generalization bound on the degree of deviation from strict IR.

When the transmitted power is raised to compensate the through-wall attenuation, the direct coupling between the transmitter and receiver can saturate the receiver because of which weaker reflections off the target may remain undetected. In this paper, we propose using transmitter and receiver antennas of orthogonal circular polarization to reduce the direct coupling between the transmitter and receiver while retaining the first bounce off the target. In our paper, we demonstrate that the quadrafilar helical antenna (QHA) is a good candidate for this operation since it is characterized by a small size, wide frequency band of operation, high gain and low axial ratio over a wide field of view. We compare the reduced mutual coupling between the transmitter and receiver elements for the oppositely polarized QHA antennas with other commonly used through-wall radar antennas such as the Vivaldi and horn antennas. The system is tested in through-wall conditions."

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures, which retrieve external knowledge sources to enhance the generative capabilities of LLMs, remain susceptible to the same bias-related challenges. This work focuses on evaluating and understanding the social bias implications of RAG. Through extensive experiments across various retrieval corpora, LLMs, and bias evaluation datasets, encompassing more than 13 different bias types, we surprisingly observe a reduction in bias in RAG. This suggests that the inclusion of external context can help counteract stereotype-driven predictions, potentially improving fairness by diversifying the contextual grounding of the model's outputs. To better understand this phenomenon, we then explore the model's reasoning process by integrating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting into RAG while assessing the faithfulness of the model's CoT. Our experiments reveal that the model's bias inclinations shift between stereotype and anti-stereotype responses as more contextual information is incorporated from the retrieved documents. Interestingly, we find that while CoT enhances accuracy, contrary to the bias reduction observed with RAG, it increases overall bias across datasets, highlighting the need for bias-aware reasoning frameworks that can mitigate this trade-off."

However, it suffers from substantial inference costs because it requires a large number of samples. To mitigate this issue, Difficulty-Adaptive Self-Consistency (DSC) was proposed to reduce unnecessary token usage for easy problems by adjusting the number of samples according to problem difficulty. However, DSC requires additional model calls and pre-sampling to estimate difficulty, and this process is repeated when applying to each dataset, leading to significant computational overhead. In this work, we propose Activation-Informed Difficulty-Aware Self-Consistency (ACTSC) to address these limitations. ACTSC leverages internal difficulty signals reflected in the feed-forward network neuron activations to construct a lightweight difficulty estimation probe, without any additional token generation or model calls. The probe dynamically adjusts the number of samples for SC and can be applied to new datasets without requiring pre-sampling for difficulty estimation. To validate its effectiveness, we conduct experiments on five benchmarks. Experimental results show that ACTSC effectively reduces inference costs while maintaining accuracy relative to existing methods."

These vectors, extracted from directional patterns in a model's internal representations when processing harmful versus harmless prompts, serve as robust behavioral fingerprints. Our contribution lies in developing a fingerprinting system around this concept and conducting extensive validation of its effectiveness for IP protection. We demonstrate that these behavioral fingerprints are highly robust against common modifications, including finetunes, merges, and quantization. Our experiments show that the fingerprint is unique to each model family, with low cosine similarity between independently trained models. In a large-scale identification task across 76 offspring models, our method achieves 100\\% accuracy in identifying the correct base model family. Furthermore, we analyze the fingerprint's behavior under alignment-breaking attacks, finding that while performance degrades significantly, detectable traces remain. Finally, we propose a theoretical framework to transform this private fingerprint into a publicly verifiable, privacy-preserving artifact using locality-sensitive hashing and zero-knowledge proofs."

    "abstract": "If our observable Universe is only a tiny region of a vastly larger and conformally older spacetime, then the usual formulations of the classical flatness and horizon problems of the Hot Big Bang can be reinterpreted as artifacts manifesting an observational selection effect; we occupy a small causal domain of a much larger causally-connected and possibly non-flat spacetime. A sufficiently large positive cosmological constant, $Λ$, sets the future asymptotic horizon scale of the observable Universe, $\\sim$$Λ^{-1/2}$, thereby implying that the observable Universe may simply be a minute patch of a far larger pre-existing one, hereafter a Small Patch Hypothesis. Importantly, this observational bound is purely geometric; regardless of when the Universe is observed, the maximum accessible scale is finite and fixed by $Λ$, independent of inflationary dynamics, anthropic arguments, or assumptions about the global hosting spacetime. In this sense, inflation becomes one viable realization of the proposed Small Patch Hypothesis. Here, one particular non-inflationary alternative is considered for illustrative purposes in which a primordial spectrum grows logarithmically toward large scales, and in fact diverges at some finite $k_{c}$. If $k_{c}\\ll Λ^{-1/2}$, then our local cosmic patch probes only the linear regime and appears exceptionally smooth. Over the comparatively narrow observable window, this power spectrum mimics a slightly red-tilted, inflation-like spectrum. Rather than introducing high-energy new fields, this perspective frames large-scale homogeneity, isotropy, Gaussianity, adiabaticity, and the observed thermodynamic Arrow of Time as possible consequences of restricted observational access to a much larger Universe in equilibrium, rather than signatures of a unique early-Universe mechanism.

In industrial deployment, two common approaches exhibit fundamental limitations: discrete semantic abstractions sacrifice descriptive precision through clustering, while dense multimodal embeddings are extracted independently and remain weakly aligned with ranking optimization, limiting fine-grained content-aware ranking. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{SARM}, an end-to-end ranking architecture that integrates natural-language semantic anchors directly into ranking optimization, enabling fine-grained author representations conditioned on multimodal content. Each semantic anchor is represented as learnable text tokens jointly optimized with ranking features, allowing the model to adapt content descriptions to ranking objectives. A lightweight dual-token gated design captures domain-specific live-streaming semantics, while an asymmetric deployment strategy preserves low-latency online training and serving. Extensive offline evaluation and large-scale A/B tests show consistent improvements over production baselines. SARM is fully deployed and serves over 400 million users daily."

We establish an information-theoretic barrier to this credit assignment problem: the signal connecting early steps to final outcomes decays exponentially with depth, creating a critical horizon beyond which no algorithm can learn from endpoint data alone. We prove four results. First, a Signal Decay Bound: sample complexity for attributing outcomes to early stages grows exponentially in the number of intervening steps. Second, Width Limits: parallel rollouts provide only logarithmic relief, with correlation capping the effective number of independent samples. Third, an Objective Mismatch: additive reward aggregation optimizes the wrong quantity when sequential validity requires all steps to be correct. Fourth, Optimal Inspection Design: uniform checkpoint spacing is minimax-optimal under homogeneous signal attenuation, while a greedy algorithm yields optimal non-uniform schedules under heterogeneous attenuation. Together, these results provide a common analytical foundation for inspection design in operations and supervision design in AI."

To further expand the range of languages these models can support, many works focus on continued pre-training of these models. However, few works address how to extend mPLMs to low-resource languages that were previously unsupported. To tackle this issue, we expand the model's vocabulary using a target language corpus. We then screen out a subset from the model's original vocabulary, which is biased towards representing the source language(e.g. English), and utilize bilingual dictionaries to initialize the representations of the expanded vocabulary. Subsequently, we continue to pre-train the mPLMs using the target language corpus, based on the representations of these expanded vocabulary. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the baseline, which uses randomly initialized expanded vocabulary for continued pre-training, in POS tagging and NER tasks, achieving improvements by 0.54% and 2.60%, respectively. Furthermore, our method demonstrates high robustness in selecting the training corpora, and the models' performance on the source language does not degrade after continued pre-training."

    "abstract": "Learning effective feature interactions is central to modern recommender systems, yet remains challenging in industrial settings due to sparse multi-field inputs and ultra-long user behavior sequences. While recent scaling efforts have improved model capacity, they often fail to construct both context-aware and context-independent user intent from the long-term and real-time behavior sequence. Meanwhile, recent work also suffers from inefficient and homogeneous interaction mechanisms, leading to suboptimal prediction performance. To address these limitations, we propose HeMix, a scalable ranking model that unifies adaptive sequence tokenization and heterogeneous interaction structure. Specifically, HeMix introduces a Query-Mixed Interest Extraction module that jointly models context-aware and context-independent user interests via dynamic and fixed queries over global and real-time behavior sequences. For interaction, we replace self-attention with the HeteroMixer block, enabling efficient, multi-granularity cross-feature interactions that adopt the multi-head token fusion, heterogeneous interaction and group-aligned reconstruction pipelines. HeMix demonstrates favorable scaling behavior, driven by the HeteroMixer block, where increasing model scale via parameter expansion leads to steady improvements in recommendation accuracy. Experiments on industrial-scale datasets show that HeMix scales effectively and consistently outperforms strong baselines. Most importantly, HeMix has been deployed on the AMAP platform, delivering significant online gains: +0.61% GMV, +2.32% PV_CTR, and +0.81% UV_CVR."

We fine-tune the pruned models on parallel corpora we curated for African languages, employing knowledge distillation from a larger teacher model. Our work aims at enabling efficient deployment of translation models for African languages in resource-constrained settings. Our evaluation results demonstrate that AfriNLLB models achieve performance comparable to the baseline while being significantly faster. We release two versions of the AfriNLLB models, a Transformers version that allows further fine-tuning and a CTranslate2 version for efficient inference. Moreover, we release all the training data that we used for fine-tuning the baseline and pruned models to facilitate further research."

PAPL leverages the cyclic nature of skateboarding by integrating phase-conditioned Feature-wise Linear Modulation layers into actor and critic networks, enabling a unified policy that captures phase-dependent behaviors while sharing robot-specific knowledge across phases. Our evaluations in simulation validate command-tracking accuracy and conduct ablation studies quantifying each component's contribution. We also compare locomotion efficiency against leg and wheel-leg baselines and show real-world transferability."

    "abstract": "Gradient-based methods can efficiently optimize controllers using physical priors and differentiable simulators, but contact-rich manipulation remains challenging due to discontinuous or vanishing gradients from hybrid contact dynamics. Smoothing the dynamics yields continuous gradients, but the resulting model mismatch can cause controller failures when executed on real systems. We address this trade-off by planning with smoothed dynamics while explicitly quantifying and compensating for the induced errors, providing formal guarantees of constraint satisfaction and goal reachability on the true hybrid dynamics. Our method smooths both contact dynamics and geometry via a novel differentiable simulator based on convex optimization, which enables us to characterize the discrepancy from the true dynamics as a set-valued deviation. This deviation constrains the optimization of time-varying affine feedback policies through analytical bounds on the system's reachable set, enabling robust constraint satisfaction guarantees for the true closed-loop hybrid dynamics, while relying solely on informative gradients from the smoothed dynamics. We evaluate our method on several contact-rich tasks, including planar pushing, object rotation, and in-hand dexterous manipulation, achieving guaranteed constraint satisfaction with lower safety violation and goal error than baselines. By bridging differentiable physics with set-valued robust control, our method is the first certifiable gradient-based policy synthesis method for contact-rich manipulation."

We propose CAPER, a framework for Constrained And ProcEdural Reasoning for robotic scientific experiments, which explicitly restricts where learning and reasoning occur in the planning and control pipeline. Rather than strengthening end-to-end policies, CAPER enforces a responsibility-separated structure: task-level reasoning generates procedurally valid action sequences under explicit constraints, mid-level multimodal grounding realizes subtasks without delegating spatial decision-making to large language models, and low-level control adapts to physical uncertainty via reinforcement learning with minimal demonstrations. By encoding procedural commitments through interpretable intermediate representations, CAPER prevents execution-time violations of experimental logic, improving controllability, robustness, and data efficiency. Experiments on a scientific workflow benchmark and a public long-horizon manipulation dataset demonstrate consistent improvements in success rate and procedural correctness, particularly in low-data and long-horizon settings."

Optical frequency standards are attractive for their improved stability over their microwave counterparts; however, increased complexities have anchored them in the laboratory. Sacrificing sensitivity of the most stable optical clocks has led to the recent development of deployable and portable optical frequency standards, leveraging hot atomic or molecular vapor. The short term limit for a majority of previous reports on two-photon rubidium standards is either the shot-noise or intermodulation limit hindering the one second fractional frequency stability to around $1\\times10^{-13}/\\sqrtτ$. The answer for the shot-noise limit is to increase optical power and collected fluorescence, while the intermodulation limit solution requires improvements in laser linewidth, stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) lasers are known to reduce frequency noise, suppressing noise of the pump laser at high ofset frequencies. We investigate an optical frequency standard based on the two-photon transition in $^{87}$Rb probed with a narrow linewidth photonic integrated circuit SBS laser with a quality factor over 130 million and instantaneous linewidth $<$ 10 Hz. The use of a narrow linewidth clock laser coupled with operating at higher optical intensities yields clock instabilities of $2\\times10^{-14}$ at one second, currently the best reported short-term stability for a two-photon rubidium optical frequency standard."

In this work, we employ molecular beam epitaxy to grow MnTe thin films with controlled thickness on InP(111)A substrates. By performing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements, we observe a large spin splitting of ~230 meV for bulk bands well below the Fermi level and identify surface states that cross the Fermi level. Electrical transport measurements reveal that a robust anomalous Hall (AH) effect persists down to 2 K and an AH sign reversal occurs near 175 K. By systematically tuning film thickness, growth conditions, and interfacial structure, we demonstrate that the AH response in MnTe films originates from the Berry curvature of surface states rather than from bulk bands. Our first-principles calculations reveal that this surface-state-driven AH effect is imprinted by the bulk altermagnetic order and remains unchanged for terminations with opposite Mn magnetic orientations. Our results establish a unique surface transport probe of bulk altermagnetism, demonstrate interface engineering as an effective route to generate and control the AH effect in altermagnets, and provide a unified understanding of the AH response in altermagentic MnTe films."

In this paper, we consider the totally nonnegative part of the $J$-twisted flag variety $G/{}^J B^+$, where ${}^J B^+$ is the Borel subgroup opposite to $B^+$ in the standard parabolic subgroup $P_J^+$ of $G$. The $J$-twisted flag varieties include the ordinary flag variety $G/B^+$ as a special case.

The main focus of PB is designing rules, functions that return feasible budget allocations for a set of projects subject to some budget constraint. Designing PB rules that optimize both utility and fairness objectives based on agent preferences had been challenging due to the extensive domain knowledge required and the proven trade-off between the two notions. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly employed for automated algorithmic design. Given the resemblance of PB rules to algorithms for classical knapsack problems, in this paper, we introduce a novel framework, named LLMRule, that addresses the limitations of existing works by incorporating LLMs into an evolutionary search procedure for automating the design of PB rules. Our experimental results, evaluated on more than 600 real-world PB instances obtained from the U.S., Canada, Poland, and the Netherlands with different representations of agent preferences, demonstrate that the LLM-generated rules generally outperform existing handcrafted rules in terms of overall utility while still maintaining a similar degree of fairness."

We propose the following to evaluate these deep models: 1) standard classification using 13 models (four CNNs and eight transormer-based models), 2) calibration analysis to examine if these models are well calibrated for bladder cancer classification, and 3) we use GradCAM++ to evaluate the interpretability of these models for clinical diagnosis. We simulate $\\sim 300$ experiments on a publicly multicenter bladder cancer dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate that the ConvNext series indicate limited generalization ability to classify bladder cancer images (e.g., $\\sim 60\\%$ accuracy). In addition, ViTs show better calibration effects compared to ConvNext and swin transformer series. We also involve test time augmentation to improve the models interpretability. Finally, no model provides a one-size-fits-all solution for a feasible interpretable model. ConvNext series are suitable for in-distribution samples, while ViT and its variants are suitable for interpreting out-of-distribution samples."

Our model is built upon the expansion of the corresponding natural language understanding (NLU) model into quantifiable terms using a Naive Bayes approach. Subsequently, we have introduced an attention mechanism and logarithmic nonlinearity to enhance its capability to capture topic continuity. This approach allows us to convert the NLU model into an interpretable analytical formula. In contrast to many NLU models constrained by token limits, our proposed model can seamlessly handle conversations of any length with linear time complexity. Furthermore, the attention mechanism significantly improves the model's ability to identify topic continuity in complex conversations. According to our experiments, our model consistently outperforms traditional methods, particularly in handling lengthy and intricate conversations. This unique capability offers us an opportunity to ensure the responsible and interpretable use of LLMs."

To address this, we extend STORM, a sampling-based model-predictive-control (MPC) motion planning algorithm, to handle multiple robots in a distributed fashion. First, we modify STORM to handle dynamic obstacles. Then, we let each arm compute its own motion plan prefix, which it shares with the other arms, which treat it as a dynamic obstacle. Finally, we add a dynamic priority scheme. The new algorithm, MR-STORM, demonstrates clear empirical advantages over SOTA algorithms when operating with both static and dynamic obstacles."

    "abstract": "Altermagnetism (AM) and its associated spin-transport phenomena are typically linked to spin-split electronic band structures in bulk materials. However, the crystal surface has a reduced symmetry with respect to the bulk, which can induce AM at the surface of conventional antiferromagnets (AFMs) -- a local effect which cannot be detected using bulk properties. In this work we define the symmetry conditions necessary for surface AM and show how it can be topologically protected, rendering it a robust effect. We provide a minimal model for one trivial and two topological examples of surface AM. We show that the spin spectral density, accessible by spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, can exhibit a $d$-wave-like altermagnetic character at the surface, even when the full band structure is completely spin degenerate. Our topological model describes the Dirac semimetal CuMnAs, which provides an existing realization of our theory. Our results identify crystal surfaces as a platform to realize robust, topology- and symmetry-driven unconventional magnetism beyond the bulk classification of magnetic materials."

    "abstract": "Human demonstrations offer rich environmental diversity and scale naturally, making them an appealing alternative to robot teleoperation. While this paradigm has advanced robot-arm manipulation, its potential for the more challenging, data-hungry problem of humanoid loco-manipulation remains largely unexplored. We present EgoHumanoid, the first framework to co-train a vision-language-action policy using abundant egocentric human demonstrations together with a limited amount of robot data, enabling humanoids to perform loco-manipulation across diverse real-world environments. To bridge the embodiment gap between humans and robots, including discrepancies in physical morphology and viewpoint, we introduce a systematic alignment pipeline spanning from hardware design to data processing. A portable system for scalable human data collection is developed, and we establish practical collection protocols to improve transferability. At the core of our human-to-humanoid alignment pipeline lies two key components. The view alignment reduces visual domain discrepancies caused by camera height and perspective variation. The action alignment maps human motions into a unified, kinematically feasible action space for humanoid control. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that incorporating robot-free egocentric data significantly outperforms robot-only baselines by 51\\%, particularly in unseen environments. Our analysis further reveals which behaviors transfer effectively and the potential for scaling human data."

    "abstract": "Data scarcity fundamentally limits the generalization of bimanual dexterous manipulation, as real-world data collection for dexterous hands is expensive and labor-intensive. Human manipulation videos, as a direct carrier of manipulation knowledge, offer significant potential for scaling up robot learning. However, the substantial embodiment gap between human hands and robotic dexterous hands makes direct pretraining from human videos extremely challenging. To bridge this gap and unleash the potential of large-scale human manipulation video data, we propose DexImit, an automated framework that converts monocular human manipulation videos into physically plausible robot data, without any additional information. DexImit employs a four-stage generation pipeline: (1) reconstructing hand-object interactions from arbitrary viewpoints with near-metric scale; (2) performing subtask decomposition and bimanual scheduling; (3) synthesizing robot trajectories consistent with the demonstrated interactions; (4) comprehensive data augmentation for zero-shot real-world deployment. Building on these designs, DexImit can generate large-scale robot data based on human videos, either from the Internet or video generation models. DexImit is capable of handling diverse manipulation tasks, including tool use (e.g., cutting an apple), long-horizon tasks (e.g., making a beverage), and fine-grained manipulations (e.g., stacking cups)."

We introduce VLA-JEPA, a JEPA-style pretraining framework that sidesteps these pitfalls by design. The key idea is \\emph{leakage-free state prediction}: a target encoder produces latent representations from future frames, while the student pathway sees only the current observation -- future information is used solely as supervision targets, never as input. By predicting in latent space rather than pixel space, VLA-JEPA learns dynamics abstractions that are robust to camera motion and irrelevant background changes. This yields a simple two-stage recipe -- JEPA pretraining followed by action-head fine-tuning -- without the multi-stage complexity of prior latent-action pipelines. Experiments on LIBERO, LIBERO-Plus, SimplerEnv and real-world manipulation tasks show that VLA-JEPA achieves consistent gains in generalization and robustness over existing methods."

We introduce \\textit{Step-Decomposed Influence (SDI)}, which decomposes TracIn into a length-$τ$ influence trajectory by unrolling the recurrent computation graph and attributing influence to specific loop iterations. To make SDI practical at transformer scale, we propose a TensorSketch implementation that never materialises per-example gradients. Experiments on looped GPT-style models and algorithmic reasoning tasks show that SDI scales excellently, matches full-gradient baselines with low error and supports a broad range of data attribution and interpretability tasks with per-step insights into the latent reasoning process."

A numerical study of the expectation value of the simplicity performed in the framework of Lattice Gauge Theories enables us to determine the deconfinement temperature to a higher degree of accuracy than that reached by conventional methods at a comparable computational effort.

Covering the full optical range (3600-9800 Å) over a contiguous ~ 0.5 degree field, the LVM data provide the first hexagonally sampled, wide-field emission-line maps of all major ionic species in this archetypal planetary nebula. The resulting flux, kinematic, and line-ratio maps reveal the well-known ionization stratification of the nebula, from the compact He++ core to the bright [O III] ring and the extended low-ionization envelope, enabling a detailed comparison with classical aperture spectroscopy. Owing to the sensitivity and uniform spatial sampling of the LVM, numerous faint auroral and diagnostic lines are detected across the nebula, including [O III] 4363, [N II] 5755, and He I lines, allowing precise measurements of weak-line morphology. The derived radial trends confirm the remarkably low dust content and the overall homogeneity of electron temperature and density across the main ring. Ionized-gas kinematics traced by Hα further support the scenario of a slowly expanding, limb-brightened shell consistent with previous studies. This work demonstrates the diagnostic power of LVM spectroscopy for extended nebulae and highlights its capability to recover both global and spatially resolved physical conditions across complex ionized structures."

    "abstract": "The presence of infrared excess flux observed in white dwarfs (WDs) is related to the existence of debris disks or substellar companions. These systems provide important clues in the study of extrasolar planetary material and binary evolution. However, fully characterising their properties requires a statistically significant, complete sample. This work aims to identify a complete sample of WDs with infrared excess emission within 100 pc of the Sun. We built the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the WDs using synthetic photometry in 56 optical filters of the J-PAS system, generated from Gaia Data Release 3 low-resolution spectra and complemented with the latest infrared photometry available at the Virtual Observatory (VO). VOSA was used to fit the SEDs with different atmospheric WD models depending on the source spectral type. We visually checked optical and infrared images to identify contaminated photometry. We built a catalogue of 456 infrared excess WDs, of which 292 are robust identifications, and 164 are candidates. 351 ($\\sim$75%) are new identifications. This implies a fraction of infrared excess WDs between 5.9$\\pm$0.3% and 9.2$\\pm$0.4%, higher than previous works, but in agreement with some more recent estimates. Furthermore, for the sample of infrared excess WDs, the fraction of sources with non-hydrogen atmosphere increases with the Gaia GBP-GRP colour, contrary to the general WD population. However, this result should be interpreted with caution. Additionally, a thorough comparison of our catalogue with those of previous studies was performed. The sample of WDs with infrared excess emission within 100 pc presented in this work is the largest, most complete and reliable to date. Due to their proximity, they are ideal targets for follow-up studies aimed at characterising circumstellar disks, substellar companions, and the composition of accreted planetary material."

Yet, as humanoid robots begin to share our workplaces, homes, and public spaces, the design challenge expands. We must now consider not only factors for humans but also factors for humanoids, since both will coexist and interact within the same environments. Unlike conventional machines, humanoids introduce expectations of human-like behavior, communication, and social presence, which reshape usability, trust, and safety considerations. In this article, we introduce the concept of humanoid factors as a framework structured around four pillars - physical, cognitive, social, and ethical - that shape the development of humanoids to help them effectively coexist and collaborate with humans. This framework characterizes the overlap and divergence between human capabilities and those of general-purpose humanoids powered by AI foundation models. To demonstrate our framework's practical utility, we then apply the framework to evaluate a real-world humanoid control algorithm, illustrating how conventional task completion metrics in robotics overlook key human cognitive and interaction principles. We thus position humanoid factors as a foundational framework for designing, evaluating, and governing sustained human-humanoid coexistence."

Their high energy cost in electronic processors motivate scalable photonic computing approaches that reduce the energy required per operation. Thin film lithium niobate (TFLN) is a dominant photonic platform due to its large electro-optic effect. However, it lacks nonvolatile index tuning mechanisms, which promise to pave the way for energy-efficient photonic computing. Here, we explore electrochemical lithiation as a route to nonvolatile matrix-vector multiplications in TFLN. The LiNbO3 phase is stable at room temperature over a 2% Li composition window with an associated composition-dependent refractive index. We computationally demonstrate this as a programmable, low-loss approach to perform matrix-vector multiplications by using composition to control matrix weights. We design Mach-Zehnder interferometers to perform image processing tasks under realistic material loss constraints. We also design microring resonators for iterative weight updates, using gradient descent training to program target matrix operations with matrix-vector multiplication accuracy validated at 1.5% average relative error. These demonstrations show a facile route towards nonvolatile photonic computing in TFLN, addressing a critical requirement for energy-efficient photonic matrix operations at scale."

The selected models reflect diverse unsupervised disentanglement strategies, including inductive biases, data augmentations, adversarial objectives, and staged training procedures. We further isolate specific strategies to analyze their effect. Our analysis spans four key axes: informativeness, equivariance, invariance, and disentanglement, which are assessed across datasets, tasks, and controlled transformations. Our findings reveal inconsistencies between intended and actual semantics of the embeddings, suggesting that current strategies fall short of producing truly disentangled representations, and prompting a re-examination of how controllability is approached in music generation."

While attention is a staple of modern network architectures, it is also notoriously expensive to deploy due to resource requirements that scale quadratically with the input sequence length $n$. WildCat avoids these quadratic costs by only attending over a small weighted coreset. Crucially, we select the coreset using a fast but spectrally-accurate subsampling algorithm -- randomly pivoted Cholesky -- and weight the elements optimally to minimise reconstruction error. Remarkably, given bounded inputs, WildCat approximates exact attention with super-polynomial $O(n^{-\\sqrt{\\log(\\log(n))}})$ error decay while running in near-linear $O(n^{1+o(1)})$ time. In contrast, prior practical approximations either lack error guarantees or require quadratic runtime to guarantee such high fidelity. We couple this advance with a GPU-optimized PyTorch implementation and a suite of benchmark experiments demonstrating the benefits of WildCat for image generation, image classification, and language model KV cache compression."

For uniform random geometric graph, where the nodes are uniformly distributed in a space, the friendship paradox index is asymptotically equal to $1/4$. On the contrary, in nonuniform random geometric graphs, the nonuniform node distribution leads to distinct limiting properties for the index. In the relatively sparse regime, the friendship paradox index is still asymptotically equal to $1/4$, the same as in the uniform case. In the intermediate sparse regime, however, the index converges in probability to $1/4$ plus a constant that is explicitly dependent on the node distribution. Finally, in the relatively dense case, the index diverges to infinity as the graph size increases. Our results highlight the sharp contrast between the uniform case and its nonuniform counterpart."

Our approach modifies standard self-attention to process spatio-temporal feature sequences while maintaining computational efficiency and requiring minimal changes to existing architectures. STA demonstrates broad applicability across diverse transformer architectures and remains effective across both lightweight and larger-scale models. A comprehensive evaluation on the Cityscapes and BDD100k datasets shows substantial improvements of 9.20 percentage points in temporal consistency metrics and up to 1.76 percentage points in mean intersection over union compared to single-frame baselines.

    "abstract": "Street-level bureaucrats, such as caseworkers and border guards routinely face the dilemma of whether to follow rigid policy or exercise discretion based on professional judgement. However, frequent overrides threaten consistency and introduce bias, explaining why bureaucracies often ration discretion as a finite resource. While prior work models discretion as a static cost-benefit tradeoff, we lack a principled model of how discretion should be rationed over time under real operational constraints. We formalize discretion as a dynamic allocation problem in which an agent receives stochastic opportunities to improve upon a default policy and must spend a limited override budget K over a finite horizon T. We show that overrides follow a dynamic threshold rule: use discretion only when the opportunity exceeds a time and budget-dependent cutoff. Our main theoretical contribution identifies a behavioral invariance: for location-scale families of improvement distributions, the rate at which an optimal agent exercises discretion is independent of the scale of potential gains and depends only on the distribution's shape (e.g., tail heaviness). This result implies systematic differences in discretionary \"policy personality.\" When gains are fat-tailed, optimal agents are patient, conserving discretion for outliers. When gains are thin-tailed, agents spend more routinely. We illustrate these implications using data from a homelessness services system. Discretionary overrides track operational constraints: they are higher at the start of the workweek, suppressed on weekends when intake is offline, and shift with short-run housing capacity. These results suggest that discretion can be both procedurally constrained and welfare-improving when treated as an explicitly budgeted resource, providing a foundation for auditing override patterns and designing decision-support systems."

The applied techniques range from molecular dynamics and nudged elastic band to electronic and thermal quantum transport. Such an approach drastically reduces the number of fitting parameters needed and makes the resulting modeling environment more accurate than traditional ones. The developed computational framework is then applied to the investigation of an Ag/a-SiO2/Pt CBRAM, reproducing experimental data very well.

In this context, we propose a passive beam-focusing technique to manipulate the propagation channel between each transmit-receive antenna pair and achieve a favorable propagation condition for rank improvement. The proposed algorithm is tested in two different channel scenarios: low and medium ranks. Experimental results show that, when the channel is rank-deficient, the RIS can significantly increase the rank by $112\\%$ from its default value without the RIS, providing a rank increment of $1.5$. When the rank has a medium value, a maximum of $61\\%$ enhancement can be achieved, corresponding to a rank increment of $1$. These results provide the first experimental evidence of RIS-driven rank manipulation with off-the-shelf WiFi hardware, offering practical insights into RIS deployment for spatial multiplexing gains."

    "abstract": "The integration of extensive, dynamic knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs) remains a significant challenge due to the inherent entanglement of factual data and reasoning patterns. Existing solutions, ranging from non-parametric Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to parametric knowledge editing, are often constrained in practice by finite context windows, retriever noise, or the risk of catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we propose DRIFT, a novel dual-model architecture designed to explicitly decouple knowledge extraction from the reasoning process. Unlike static prompt compression, DRIFT employs a lightweight knowledge model to dynamically compress document chunks into implicit fact tokens conditioned on the query. These dense representations are projected into the reasoning model's embedding space, replacing raw, redundant text while maintaining inference accuracy. Extensive experiments show that DRIFT significantly improves performance on long-context tasks, outperforming strong baselines among comparably sized models. Our approach provides a scalable and efficient paradigm for extending the effective context window and reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/Lancelot-Xie/DRIFT."

    "abstract": "Among the recognized sources of decoherence in superconducting qubits, the spatial inhomogeneity of the superconducting state and the possible presence of magnetic-flux vortices remain comparatively underexplored. Niobium is commonly used as a structural material in transmon qubits that host Josephson junctions, and excess dissipation anywhere in the transmon can become a bottleneck that limits overall quantum performance. The metal/substrate interfacial layer may simultaneously host pair-breaking loss channels (e.g., two-level systems, TLS) and control thermal transport, thereby affecting dissipation and temperature stability. Here, we use quantitative magneto-optical imaging of the magnetic-flux distribution to characterize the homogeneity of the superconducting state and the critical current density, $j_{c}$, in niobium films fabricated under different sputtering conditions. The imaging reveals distinct flux-penetration regimes, ranging from a nearly ideal Bean critical state to strongly nonuniform thermo-magnetic dendritic avalanches. By fitting the measured magnetic-induction profiles, we extract $j_{c}$ and correlate it with film physical properties and with measured qubit internal quality factors. Our results indicate that the Nb/Si interlayer can be a significant contributor to decoherence and should be considered an important factor that must be optimized."

However, there are many experimental examples of three-dimensional crystals that could host exotic low-temperature states of matter, such as quantum spin liquids. We calculate the ground-state phase diagrams of frustrated quantum spin models on the body-centered cubic lattice using neural quantum states. First, we study the antiferromagnetic $J_1-J_2$ model where we find a direct first-order phase transition between Néel and collinear long-range-ordered phases at $(J_2/J_1)_c = 0.705$, consistent with previous studies. Then, in a tetragonally-distorted variant, proposed as a minimal model of NaCa$_2$Cu$_2$(VO$_4$)$_3$, we find no evidence of a quantum paramagnetic ground state, with a first-order phase transition between Néel and chain phases at $(J_{2ab}/J_1)_c = 1.0375$. Therefore, the ground state of the tetragonally-distorted model does not reproduce the low-temperature magnetic properties of NaCa$_2$Cu$_2$(VO$_4$)$_3$, and the inclusion of other effects is necessary to rationalize experimental observations."

In this work, we compare two approaches for automated classification of stains using whole slide images, covering the 14 most commonly used special stains in our institute alongside standard and frozen-section H&E. We evaluate a Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) pipeline and a proposed lightweight thumbnail-based approach. On internal test data, MIL achieved the highest performance (macro F1: 0.941 for 16 classes; 0.969 for 14 merged classes), while the thumbnail approach remained competitive (0.897 and 0.953, respectively). On external TCGA data, the thumbnail model generalized best (weighted F1: 0.843 vs. 0.807 for MIL). The thumbnail approach also increased throughput by two orders of magnitude (5.635 vs. 0.018 slides/s for MIL with all patches). We conclude that thumbnail-based classification provides a scalable and robust solution for routine visual quality control in digital pathology workflows."

The growth or decline of each model's bankroll serves as the evaluation metric. Under this approach, market consensus probabilities and implied model credibilities can be updated real time as each model updates, and do not require one to wait for the final outcome. Using a simulation model, it will be shown that this method is in general more accurate than traditional average log-loss and Brier score methods at distinguishing a correct model from an incorrect model. This Kelly approach is shown to have a direct mathematical and conceptual analogue to Bayesian inference, with bankroll serving as a proxy for Bayesian credibility."

    "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-mounted Base Stations (UAV-BSs) offer a flexible solution for serving ground users in temporary hotspot scenarios. However, efficiently deploying UAV-BSs to satisfy heterogeneous user distributions remains a challenging optimization problem. While recent data-driven approaches, particularly Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), have shown promise in dynamic environments, they often suffer from prohibitive training overhead, poor generalization to topology changes, and high computational complexity. To address these limitations, this paper proposes Satisfaction-driven Coverage Optimization via Perimeter Extraction (SCOPE), a training-free and online 3D deployment framework. Unlike heuristic baselines that rely on fixed-altitude assumptions, SCOPE integrates a perimeter extraction mechanism with the Smallest Enclosing Circle (SEC) algorithm to dynamically optimize 3D UAV positions. Theoretically, we provide a rigorous convergence proof of the proposed algorithm and derive its polynomial time complexity of $O(N^2 \\log N)$. Experimentally, we conduct a comprehensive comparative study against state-of-the-art DRL baselines (e.g., PPO). Simulation results demonstrate that SCOPE achieves comparable user satisfaction to DRL methods but significantly lower computational latency (milliseconds vs. hours of training) and superior energy efficiency, making it an ideal solution for real-time, on-demand emergency deployment."

    "abstract": "We study a canonical multi-task demand learning problem motivated by retail pricing, in which a firm seeks to estimate heterogeneous linear price-response functions across a large collection of decision contexts. Each context is characterized by rich observable covariates yet typically exhibits only limited historical price variation, motivating the use of multi-task learning to borrow strength across tasks. A central challenge in this setting is endogeneity: historical prices are chosen by managers or algorithms and may be arbitrarily correlated with unobserved, task-level demand determinants. Under such confounding by latent fundamentals, commonly used approaches, such as pooled regression and meta-learning, fail to identify causal price effects. We propose a new estimation framework that achieves causal identification despite arbitrary dependence between prices and latent task structure. Our approach, Decision-Conditioned Masked-Outcome Meta-Learning (DCMOML), involves carefully designing the information set of a meta-learner to leverage cross-task heterogeneity while accounting for endogenous decision histories. Under a mild restriction on price adaptivity in each task, we establish that this method identifies the conditional mean of the task-specific causal parameters given the designed information set. Our results provide guarantees for large-scale demand estimation with endogenous prices and small per-task samples, offering a principled foundation for deploying causal, data-driven pricing models in operational environments."

    "abstract": "Accurate modeling of drug release is essential for designing and developing controlled-release systems. Classical models (Fick, Higuchi, Peppas) rely on simplifying assumptions that limit their accuracy in complex geometries and release mechanisms. Here, we propose a novel approach using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Bayesian PINNs (BPINNs) for predicting release from planar, 1D-wrinkled, and 2D-crumpled films. This approach uniquely integrates Fick's diffusion law with limited experimental data to enable accurate long-term predictions from short-term measurements, and is systematically benchmarked against classical drug release models. We embedded Fick's second law into PINN as loss with 10,000 Latin-hypercube collocation points and utilized previously published experimental datasets to assess drug release performance through mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE), considering noisy conditions and limited-data scenarios. Our approach reduced mean error by up to 40% relative to classical baselines across all film types. The PINN formulation achieved RMSE <0.05 utilizing only the first 6% of the release time data (reducing 94% of release time required for the experiments) for the planar film. For wrinkled and crumpled films, the PINN reached RMSE <0.05 in 33% of the release time data. BPINNs provide tighter and more reliable uncertainty quantification under noise. By combining physical laws with experimental data, the proposed framework yields highly accurate long-term release predictions from short-term measurements, offering a practical route for accelerated characterization and more efficient early-stage drug release system formulation."

Three additional heavy vector-like fermions, three light right-handed neutrinos and two heavy singlet scalars are added to complete the model framework for Dirac neutrinos. Another singlet vector-like fermion is added with a new gauge charge, which serves as a viable DM candidate, and the correct relic abundance is obtained via the resonance effect. The parameter space is considered after satisfying the current bounds on $M_{Z'}$ and the gauge coupling $g_{μτ}$. The influence of dark radiations coming from the additional light degrees of freedoms are studied in connection with the dark matter. After imposing all relevant theoretical and experimental constraints, the allowed parameter space is found to be highly restricted yet still accessible to ongoing and near-future experiments, rendering the scenario strongly predictive. Moreover, clear correlations among the relevant observables emerge throughout this study, making the model testable in current and future experimental searches."

To overcome these obstacles, high-altitude platform station (HAPS) equipped with a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), so-called HAPS-RIS, is a promising candidate. We propose a novel unified joint multi-objective framework where UAVs and HAPS-RIS are fully integrated to extend coverage and enhance network performance. This joint multi-objective design maximizes the number of users served by the HAPS-RIS, minimizes the number of UAVs deployed and minimizes the total average UAV path loss subject to quality-of-service (QoS) and resource constraints. We propose a novel low-complexity solution strategy by proving the equivalence between minimizing the total average UAV path loss upper bound and k-means clustering, deriving a practical closed-form RIS phase-shift design, and introducing a mapping technique that collapses the combinatorial assignments into a zone radius and a bandwidth-portioning factor. Then, we propose a dynamic Pareto optimization technique to solve the transformed optimization problem. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework adapts seamlessly across operating regimes. A HAPS-RIS-only setup achieves full coverage at low data rates, but UAV assistance becomes indispensable as rate demands increase. By tuning a single bandwidth portioning factor, the model recovers UAV-only, HAPS-RIS-only and equal bandwidth portioning baselines within one formulation and consistently surpasses them across diverse rate requirements. The simulations also quantify a tangible trade-off between RIS scale and UAV deployment, enabling designers to trade increased RIS elements for fewer UAVs as service demands evolve."

    "abstract": "Stellarator optimization is a multi-objective, non-convex problem characterized by a complex objective landscape containing many local minima. The solution resulting from a single optimization is highly sensitive to factors such as the initial guess, objective weights, and the optimization method employed. However, merely varying these factors does not guarantee that a physically distinct minimum will be found; optimizations often fail to converge to good minima or simply return to the same or very similar local minima despite large-scale parameter scans. This paper presents a novel application of deflation methods to effectively explore this landscape. By modifying the objective function to penalize and \"deflate\" away already-found solutions, this technique encourages the optimizer towards attractive, distinct new minima while using a single initial guess and optimization setup. We provide a primer on deflation for nonlinear systems and non-convex optimization before applying it to non-axisymmetric equilibrium and stellarator optimization problems. Key results include the discovery of families of global equilibria with similar core characteristics and the convergence to helical core equilibria without prescient initial guesses. Furthermore, we demonstrate that augmenting stage-one stellarator and stage-two coil optimization with deflation constraints readily produces multiple high-quality, distinct solutions, establishing the method's efficacy and ease of use."

This is a refinement to the recent partial positive answer to Tao's conjecture [Tao21] as given in [BP21b]. The proof requires new quantitative estimates for critically bounded solutions of the forced Navier-Stokes equations, where the forcing is induced by the localisation. A by-product of these new estimates is an application to the Boussinesq equations, where we prove a quantitative blow-up rate for the critical $L^3$ norm of the velocity. We prove these quantitative estimates using Carleman inequalities as in [Tao21], and subsequently in [BP21a], with an additional forcing term. An obstacle to doing this is that, in the Carleman inequalities, the forcing term is amplified on large scales. Additionally, the low regularity of the forcing requires the addition of Caccioppoli-type estimates to deal with the Carleman inequalities appropriately."

However, while research on automated code migration which including refactoring, API adaptation, and dependency updates has advanced rapidly, the exploration of the automated environment interaction that must accompany it remains relatively scarce. In practice, code and its environment are intricately intertwined. Relying solely on static analysis of the environment leads to an inadequate understanding of the target setting, prolongs feedback cycles, and consequently causes significant rework and project delays, thereby reducing overall efficiency. We contend that successful software evolution demands a holistic perspective that integrates both code and environment migration. To understand the current landscape and challenges, we first provide an overview of the status of automated environment construction. We then propose a novel framework paradigm that tightly integrates automated environment setup with the code migration workflow. Finally, we explore the challenges and future directions for automated environment interaction within the code migration domain. Our findings emphasize that without automated environment interaction, the automation of code migration is only half complete."

Existing metamorphic testing approaches often rely on equivalent circuit transformations, backend modifications, or parameter tuning to address this issue. In this work, inspired by Equivalence Modulo Inputs (EMI), we propose Quantum EMI (QEMI), a new testing approach for QSSes. Our key contributions include: (1) a random quantum program generator that produces code with dead code based on quantum control-flow structures, and (2) an adaptation of the EMI technique from classical compiler testing to generate variants by removing dead code. By comparing the behavior of these variants, we can detect potential bugs in QSS implementations. We applied QEMI to Qiskit, Q#, and Cirq, and successfully identified 11 crash bugs and 1 behavioral inconsistency. QEMI expands the limited set of testing techniques available for quantum software stacks by going beyond structural transformations and incorporating semantics-preserving ones into quantum program analysis."

In optics, customized spatiotemporally structured optical fields, especially spatiotemporal optical vortices (STOV), offer the potential to tailor light via coupled space-time degrees of freedom. However, the interaction mechanisms between multiple transverse orbital angular momentum singularities within a single wave packet remain elusive. This study explores the intrinsic dynamics of a STOV with three phase singularities, observing a pronounced vortex singularity oscillation phenomena by tuning the temporal dispersion. We show that these phenomena originate from the counterintuitive spatiotemporal attractive effect between vortices, which is closely related to the singularity distance. Furthermore, the stretching into filaments and annihilation behaviors is observed by introducing antivortex in the center of the wavepacket. Experimentally, we propose a Full Interferometric Retrieval of Spatiotemporal Tomography (FIRST) method that enables the complete, single-shot capture of wave packets, with excellent agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental results. To the best of our knowledge, the dynamics of transverse spatiotemporal singularities within a single wave packet are reported here for the first time. These findings confirm the existence of interesting interactions between STOV singularities, deepen our understanding of photonics and open a new direction for investigating the complex dynamics of vortex singularities in the spatiotemporal domain."

The overarching theme is that, while not Koszul (except for some small values of $n$), these rings have homological properties that extend those of Koszul rings. We establish that finitely generated modules over these rings have rational Poincaré series and we give concrete formulas for the Poincaré series of $\\sf{k}$ over both $A$ and $R$. We also show that $A$ has minimal rate and its Yoneda algebra $\\text{Ext}_A(\\sf{k},\\sf{k})$ is generated by its elements of degrees $1$ and $2$. While the graded Betti numbers of $R$ and $A$ over the polynomial ring are not known when $n$ is odd, our approach provides bounds and yields values for two of these Betti numbers, showing in particular that $R$ is level."

We propose GeoFormer, an open-source Swin Transformer framework that jointly estimates building height (BH) and footprint (BF) on a 100 m grid using only Sentinel-1/2 imagery and open DEM data. A geo-blocked splitting strategy ensures strict spatial independence between training and test sets. Evaluated over 54 diverse cities, GeoFormer achieves a BH RMSE of 3.19 m and a BF RMSE of 0.05, improving 7.5% and 15.3% over the strongest CNN baseline, while maintaining under 3.5 m BH RMSE in cross-continent transfer. Ablation studies confirm that DEM is indispensable for height estimation and that optical reflectance dominates over SAR, though multi-source fusion yields the best overall accuracy. All code, weights, and global products are publicly released."

    "abstract": "Motivated by the need to better understand flow unsteadiness in hydraulic turbines, we perform a local linear stability and adjoint-based sensitivity analysis of the turbulent swirling jet at the outlet of a Francis turbine. We use measured mean flow and turbulence profiles at several operating conditions (below, at, and above the best efficiency point (BEP) flow rate) and perform a stability analysis. Incorporating eddy viscosity $ν_t$ into the analysis strongly damps inviscid growth rates and restricts instability to low azimuthal modes $m\\in [-1,2]$, in better agreement with experiments. Three turbulent viscosity closures (constant, mixing-length and measured $k-\\varepsilon$ based) yield similar spectra, with close agreement between mixing length and measured models, all identify partial load (0.92 BEP) as the most unstable regime. Sensitivity results show that axial velocity modifications primarily control growth rates, whereas azimuthal velocity changes mainly shift frequencies. We also derive the sensitivity kernel of the spectrum to turbulent viscosity modifications and find that spatial variations of eddy viscosity are essential for predicting the unstable mode range. The predictions accurately estimate stability changes for small variations in operating point. We further analyze the flow using classical inviscid swirling jet instability criteria (the generalized Rayleigh discriminant) and WKB analysis to predict the stability to broader operating points and reconcile these results to the stability and sensitivity analyses. The approach used in this study is fast and simple to model, but it neglects draft tube geometry (non-parallel effects), motivating future global stability and sensitivity analyses."

Triplets are created through a combination of expert-curated queries, web-derived queries, and LLM-assisted generation, with positive/negative documents selected from the web or synthesized by LLMs and then validated by native speakers. The instruction prompt-response dataset comprises 6,285 Amharic prompt-response pairs spanning multiple domains and instruction types, generated with several LLMs and refined through manual review and correction for grammaticality, relevance, fluency, and factual plausibility.

Traditional QP systems rely on pipelines of isolated discriminative models (e.g., BERT), suffering from limited semantic understanding and high maintenance overhead. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a potential solution, existing approaches often optimize sub-tasks in isolation, neglecting intrinsic semantic synergy and necessitating independent iterations. Moreover, standard generative methods often lack grounding in SNS scenarios, failing to bridge the gap between open-domain corpora and informal SNS linguistic patterns, while struggling to adhere to rigorous business definitions. We present QP-OneModel, a Unified Generative LLM for Multi-Task Query Understanding in the SNS domain. We reformulate heterogeneous sub-tasks into a unified sequence generation paradigm, adopting a progressive three-stage alignment strategy culminating in multi-reward Reinforcement Learning. Furthermore, QP-OneModel generates intent descriptions as a novel high-fidelity semantic signal, effectively augmenting downstream tasks such as query rewriting and ranking. Offline evaluations show QP-OneModel achieves a 7.35% overall gain over discriminative baselines, with significant F1 boosts in NER (+9.01%) and Term Weighting (+9.31%). It also exhibits superior generalization, surpassing a 32B model by 7.60% accuracy on unseen tasks.

At the top of every block, such a division is done again to keep the active reserves always being \\(λ\\)-portion of total reserves, where \\(λ\\in (0, 1]\\) is an activeness parameter. We show that this simple mechanism reduces adverse selection costs, measured by loss-versus-rebalancing (LVR), and thereby improves the wealth of liquidity providers (LPs) relative to plain constant-function market makers (CFMMs). As a trade-off, the asset weights within a PA-AMM pool may deviate from their target weights implied by its invariant curve. Motivated by the optimal index-tracking problem literature, we also propose and solve an optimization problem that balances such deviation and the reduction of LVR."

    "abstract": "This study focuses on the modeling and dynamics of gravity-driven, axisymmetric thin liquid film flow along a conical surface. Spatial linear stability analysis is performed on the basis of a Benney-type equation derived for the present configuration. In particular, streamwise curvature of the free surface is found to exert a crucial influence on the stability threshold. For simulations of surface waves, a second-order low-dimensional model is developed under the long-wave assumption, achieving accuracy comparable to direct numerical simulations at far lower cost. With this model, the characteristics of both linear and nonlinear waves are examined. A key difference from the flow over a flat plate is the dependence of wave dynamics on radial distance from the cone apex. At relatively high flow rates, a transition from solitary to sinusoidal waves is observed, with the transition position correlating closely with the linear stability threshold. Within the parameter range investigated, quantitative results of the conical film flow are almost identical to those in the flat-plate case when local parameters are substituted, indicating that inertial effects of the conical geometry are negligible. The models and findings presented in this paper may aid the design and optimization of industrial processes such as film coating and liquid-film-based heat and mass transfer on conical surfaces."

It has recently been understood that two-particle correlations in the azimuthal distribution of final hadrons emitted in ultra-relativistic ultra-central ion-ion collisions can be used to quantify ground-state two-body correlations. Performing systematic ab initio nuclear structure calculations of light nuclei, we demonstrate that such an observable does provide a meaningful imaging of nuclear ground states, naturally leading to a robust interpretation of the various categories of two-nucleon correlations at play. This is at variance with the low-energy approach relying on Kumar operators whose traditional interpretation in terms of deformation parameters is shown to be inoperative. A future interesting development will consist of targeting specific three-particle correlations to isolate three-nucleon correlations in which additional nuclear structure information of interest leave their fingerprint."

Unlike generic activity recognition, collaborative manipulation requires sub-task labels that are directly robot-executable. We present RoboSubtaskNet, a multi-stage human-to-robot sub-task segmentation framework that couples attention-enhanced I3D features (RGB plus optical flow) with a modified MS-TCN employing a Fibonacci dilation schedule to capture better short-horizon transitions such as reach-pick-place. The network is trained with a composite objective comprising cross-entropy and temporal regularizers (truncated MSE and a transition-aware term) to reduce over-segmentation and to encourage valid sub-task progressions. To close the gap between vision benchmarks and control, we introduce RoboSubtask, a dataset of healthcare and industrial demonstrations annotated at the sub-task level and designed for deterministic mapping to manipulator primitives. Empirically, RoboSubtaskNet outperforms MS-TCN and MS-TCN++ on GTEA and our RoboSubtask benchmark (boundary-sensitive and sequence metrics), while remaining competitive on the long-horizon Breakfast benchmark. Specifically, RoboSubtaskNet attains F1 @ 50 = 79.5%, Edit = 88.6%, Acc = 78.9% on GTEA; F1 @ 50 = 30.4%, Edit = 52.0%, Acc = 53.5% on Breakfast; and F1 @ 50 = 94.2%, Edit = 95.6%, Acc = 92.2% on RoboSubtask.

From this holographic perspective, general anyon permutations in the $D(G)$ quantum double correspond to compositions of three classes of one-dimensional self-dualities, including gauging of certain subgroups of $G$, stacking with $G$ symmetry-protected topological phases, and outer automorphisms of the group $G$.

However, moral psychology research has shown that human moral judgements are sensitive to morally irrelevant situational factors, such as smelling cinnamon rolls or the level of ambient noise, thereby challenging moral theories that assume the stability of human moral judgements. Here, we draw inspiration from this \"situationist\" view of moral psychology to evaluate whether LLMs exhibit similar cognitive moral biases to humans. We curate a novel multimodal dataset of 60 \"moral distractors\" from existing psychological datasets of emotionally-valenced images and narratives which have no moral relevance to the situation presented. After injecting these distractors into existing moral benchmarks to measure their effects on LLM responses, we find that moral distractors can shift the moral judgements of LLMs by over 30% even in low-ambiguity scenarios, highlighting the need for more contextual moral evaluations and more nuanced cognitive moral modeling of LLMs."

    "abstract": "Forward Error Correction (FEC) remains essential for protecting video streaming against packet loss, yet most real deployments still rely on static, coarse-grained configurations that cannot react to rapid shifts in loss rate, goodput, or client buffer levels. These rigid settings often create inefficiencies: unnecessary redundancy that suppresses throughput during stable periods, and insufficient protection during bursty losses, especially when shallow buffers and oversized blocks increase stall risk. To address these challenges, we present TAROT, a cross-layer, optimization-driven FEC controller that selects redundancy, block size, and symbolization on a per-segment basis. TAROT is codec-agnostic--supporting Reed-Solomon, RaptorQ, and XOR-based codes--and evaluates a pre-computed candidate set using a fine-grained scoring model. The scoring function jointly incorporates transport-layer loss and goodput, application layer buffer dynamics, and block-level timing constraints to penalize insufficient coverage, excessive overhead, and slow block completion. To enable realistic testing, we extend the SABRE simulator 1 with two new modules: a high-fidelity packet-loss generator that replays diverse multi-trace loss patterns, and a modular FEC benchmarking layer supporting arbitrary code/parameter combinations. Across Low-Latency Live (LLL) and Video-on-Demand (VoD) streaming modes, diverse network traces, and multiple ABR algorithms, TAROT reduces FEC overhead by up to 43% while improving perceptual quality by 10 VMAF units with minimal rebuffering, achieving a stronger overhead-quality balance than static FECs."

This work proposes a novel embodied 4D world model that enables geometrically consistent, arbitrary-view RGBD generation: given only a single-view RGBD observation as input, the model imagines the remaining viewpoints, which can then be back-projected and fused to assemble a more complete 3D structure across time. To efficiently learn the multi-view, cross-modality generation, we explicitly design cross-view and cross-modality feature fusion that jointly encourage consistency between RGB and depth and enforce geometric alignment across views. Beyond prediction, converting generated futures into actions is often handled by inverse dynamics, which is ill-posed because multiple actions can explain the same transition. We address this with a test-time action optimization strategy that backpropagates through the generative model to infer a trajectory-level latent best matching the predicted future, and a residual inverse dynamics model that turns this trajectory prior into accurate executable actions. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate strong performance on both 4D scene generation and downstream manipulation, and ablations provide practical insights into the key design choices."

Ideally, such systems would achieve continuous self-improvement in a fully closed loop while maintaining robust safety alignment--a combination we term the self-evolution trilemma. However, we demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that an agent society satisfying continuous self-evolution, complete isolation, and safety invariance is impossible. Drawing on an information-theoretic framework, we formalize safety as the divergence degree from anthropic value distributions. We theoretically demonstrate that isolated self-evolution induces statistical blind spots, leading to the irreversible degradation of the system's safety alignment. Empirical and qualitative results from an open-ended agent community (Moltbook) and two closed self-evolving systems reveal phenomena that align with our theoretical prediction of inevitable safety erosion. We further propose several solution directions to alleviate the identified safety concern. Our work establishes a fundamental limit on the self-evolving AI societies and shifts the discourse from symptom-driven safety patches to a principled understanding of intrinsic dynamical risks, highlighting the need for external oversight or novel safety-preserving mechanisms."

    "abstract": "Steering methods influence Large Language Model behavior by identifying semantic directions in hidden representations, but are typically realized through inference-time activation interventions that apply a fixed, global modification to the model's internal states. While effective, such interventions often induce unfavorable attribute-utility trade-offs under strong control, as they ignore the fact that many behaviors are governed by a small and heterogeneous subset of model components. We propose Steer2Edit, a theoretically grounded, training-free framework that transforms steering vectors from inference-time control signals into diagnostic signals for component-level rank-1 weight editing. Instead of uniformly injecting a steering direction during generation, Steer2Edit selectively redistributes behavioral influence across individual attention heads and MLP neurons, yielding interpretable edits that preserve the standard forward pass and remain compatible with optimized parallel inference. Across safety alignment, hallucination mitigation, and reasoning efficiency, Steer2Edit consistently achieves more favorable attribute-utility trade-offs: at matched downstream performance, it improves safety by up to 17.2%, increases truthfulness by 9.8%, and reduces reasoning length by 12.2% on average. Overall, Steer2Edit provides a principled bridge between representation steering and weight editing by translating steering signals into interpretable, training-free parameter updates."

Our results show that filtergrams centered at 430.4 nm provide higher contrast across varying magnetic environments, particularly at narrow filter widths. This enhancement arises from its slightly higher formation height and greater sensitivity to temperature variations in magnetized regions. These findings indicate that G-band filtergrams centered at 430.4 nm show enhanced diagnostic potential under the assumptions of the present modeling. The obtained results are also relevant and suggest potential applications in stellar contexts, where molecular bands are often used as proxies for magnetic activity."

Overall, our results offer a natural and analytically tractable framework in which both strong forms of positive indecomposability and high degrees of PPT entanglement can be studied systematically. We present two further applications of symplectic group symmetry. First, we show that the PPT-squared conjecture holds within the class of PPT linear maps that are either symplectic-covariant or conjugate-symplectic-covariant.

Specifically, for SDEs driven by multiplicative noise, we first propose a tamed Euler method parameterized by $α\\in (0, 1]$ and establish that its strong convergence rate is $α\\wedge\\frac{1}{2}$. Notably, $α$ can take arbitrary positive values by adjusting the regularization coefficient without altering the strong convergence rate. We then derive the asymptotic error distribution for this tamed Euler method. Further, we infer from the limit equation that among the tamed Euler method of strong order $\\frac{1}{2}$, the one with $α= \\frac{1}{2}$ yields the largest mean-square error after a long time, while those of $α>\\frac{1}{2}$ share a unified asymptotic error distribution. In addition, our analysis is also extended to SDEs with additive noise and similar conclusions are obtained. Additional treatments are required to accommodate super-linearly growing coefficients, a feature that distinguishes our analysis on the asymptotic error distribution from established results."

    "abstract": "Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) is a central tail-risk measure in stochastic structural mechanics, yet its accurate evaluation under high-dimensional, spatially correlated material uncertainty remains computationally prohibitive for classical Monte Carlo methods. Leveraging bounded-expectation reformulations of CVaR compatible with quantum amplitude estimation, we develop a quantum-enhanced inference framework that casts CVaR evaluation as a statistically consistent, confidence-constrained maximum-likelihood amplitude estimation problem. The proposed method extends iterative quantum amplitude estimation (IQAE) by embedding explicit maximum-likelihood inference within a rigorously controlled interval-tracking architecture. To ensure global correctness under finite-shot noise and the non-injective oscillatory response induced by Grover amplification, we introduce a stabilized inference scheme incorporating multi-hypothesis feasibility tracking, periodic low-depth disambiguation, and a bounded restart mechanism governed by an explicit failure-probability budget. This formulation preserves the quadratic oracle-complexity advantage of amplitude estimation while providing finite-sample confidence guarantees and reduced estimator variance. The framework is demonstrated on benchmark problems with spatially correlated lognormal Young's modulus fields generated using a Nystrom low-rank Gaussian kernel model. Numerical results show that the proposed estimator achieves substantially lower oracle complexity than classical Monte Carlo CVaR estimation at comparable confidence levels, while maintaining rigorous statistical reliability. This work establishes a practically robust and theoretically grounded quantum-enhanced methodology for tail-risk quantification in stochastic continuum mechanics."

    "abstract": "The convergence of AI and 6G network automation introduces new challenges in maintaining transparency, fairness, and accountability across multivendor management systems. Although closed-loop AI orchestration improves adaptability and self-optimization, it also creates a responsibility gap, where violations of SLAs cannot be causally attributed to specific agents or vendors. This paper presents a hybrid responsible AI-stochastic learning framework that embeds fairness, robustness, and auditability directly into the network control loop. The framework integrates RAI games with stochastic optimization, enabling dynamic adversarial reweighting and probabilistic exploration across heterogeneous vendor domains. An RAAP continuously records AI-driven decision trajectories and produces dual accountability reports: user-level SLA summaries and operator-level responsibility analytics. Experimental evaluations on synthetic two-class multigroup datasets demonstrate that the proposed hybrid model improves the accuracy of the worst group by up to 10.5\\%. Specifically, hybrid RAI achieved a WGAcc of 60.5\\% and an AvgAcc of 72.7\\%, outperforming traditional RAI-GA (50.0\\%) and ERM (21.5\\%). The audit mechanism successfully traced 99\\% simulated SLA violations to the AI entities responsible, producing both vendor and agent-level accountability indices. These results confirm that the proposed hybrid approach enhances fairness and robustness as well as establishes a concrete accountability framework for autonomous SLA assurance in multivendor 6G networks."

For large $M$, inferring $p$ from a single observation has been shown to be essentially impossible.

To mitigate the high cost of deploying end-to-end LALMs for natural conversational systems, we propose an intelligence-speaker decoupling strategy that separates dialogue intelligence from voice rendering, enabling flexible voice customization with minimal text-to-speech (TTS) data while preserving dialogue performance. Overall, our results highlight the strong potential of 7B-scale models to integrate sophisticated audio intelligence with high-level semantic reasoning, and suggest a scalable path toward more capable and versatile LALMs."

This paper investigates whether new oracle designs have emerged for Bitcoin Layer 1 since the 2015 transition to the Ethereum smart contracts era and whether subsequent Bitcoin improvement proposals have expanded oracles' implementability. Using Scopus and Web of Science searches, complemented by Google Scholar to capture protocol proposals, we observe that the indexed academic coverage remains limited, and many contributions circulate outside journal venues. Within the retrieved corpus, the main post-2015 shift is from multisig-style, which envisioned oracles as co-signers, toward attestation-based designs, mainly represented by Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs), which show stronger Bitcoin community compliance, tool support, and evidence of practical implementations in real-world scenarios such as betting and prediction-market mechanisms."

Namely, the need for named-entity recognition of academic entities within questions and multi-faceted data retrieval involving scientometric indices, e.g. impact factors. Beyond their exceptional capacity for treating traditional natural language processing tasks, LLMs have shown great potential in more complex applications, such as task decomposition and planning and reasoning. In this paper, we explore the application of LLMs to scientometric question answering, and describe an end-to-end system implementing a sequential workflow with retrieval-augmented generation and agentic concepts. We also address the secondary task of effectively synthesizing the data into presentable and well-structured high-level analyses. As a database for retrieval-augmented generation, we leverage a proprietary research performance assessment platform.

When benchmark metadata provides per-instance workload proxies, we further factor verbosity into two components: mean verbalization overhead (tokens per work unit) and a coupling coefficient capturing how overhead scales with task workload. When reasoning traces are available, we add deterministic trace-quality measures (grounding, repetition, prompt copying) to separate degenerate looping from verbose-but-engaged reasoning, avoiding human labeling and LLM judges. Evaluating 25 models on CogniLoad, we find that accuracy and token-efficiency rankings diverge (Spearman $ρ=0.63$), efficiency gaps are often driven by conditional correctness, and verbalization overhead varies by about 9 times (only weakly related to model scale). Our decomposition reveals distinct bottleneck profiles that suggest different efficiency interventions."

Our main hypothesis is that video's ability to encode spatiotemporal information and physical dynamics, combined with internet-scale availability, enables strong zero-shot generalization in navigation. To mitigate the stochasticity of generative predictions, we introduce a sampling-based optimization method that utilizes a VLM for trajectory scoring and selection. An inverse dynamics model is employed to decode executable waypoints from generated video plans for navigation. To systematically evaluate this paradigm in several video model backbones, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark covering object navigation, precise navigation, spatial grounding, language control, and scene reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate robust generalization across novel objects and unseen environments, with ablation studies revealing that navigation's high-level decision-making nature makes it particularly suited for video-based planning."

Here, we investigate covert communications in the presence of a disco reconfigurable intelligent surface (DRIS) deployed by the warden Willie, which simultaneously reduces his detection error probabilities and degrades the communication performance between Alice and Bob, without relying on either channel state information (CSI) or additional jamming power. However, the introduction of the DRIS renders it intractable for Willie to construct a Neyman-Pearson (NP) detector, since the probability density function (PDF) of the test statistic is analytically intractable under the Alice-Bob transmission hypothesis. Moreover, given the adversarial relationship between Willie and Alice/Bob, it is unrealistic to assume that Willie has access to a labeled training dataset. To address these challenges, we propose an unsupervised masked autoregressive flow (MAF)-based NP detection framework that exploits prior knowledge inherent in covert communications. We further define the false alarm rate (FAR) and the missed detection rate (MDR) as monitoring performance metrics for Willie, and the signal-to-jamming-plus-noise ratio (SJNR) as a communication performance metric for Alice-Bob transmissions. Furthermore, we derive theoretical expressions for SJNR and uncover unique properties of covert communications in the presence of a DRIS. Simulations validate the theory and show that the proposed unsupervised MAF-based NP detector achieves performance comparable to its supervised counterpart."

While certified poisoning defenses provide provable robustness bounds for classification tasks, they are fundamentally ill-equipped for autoregressive generation: they cannot handle sequential predictions or the exponentially large output space of language models. To establish a framework for certified natural language generation, we formalize two security properties: stability (robustness to any change in generation) and validity (robustness to targeted, harmful changes in generation). We introduce Targeted Partition Aggregation (TPA), the first algorithm to certify validity/targeted attacks by computing the minimum poisoning budget needed to induce a specific harmful class, token, or phrase. Further, we extend TPA to provide tighter guarantees for multi-turn generations using mixed integer linear programming (MILP). Empirically, we demonstrate TPA's effectiveness across diverse settings including: certifying validity of agent tool-calling when adversaries modify up to 0.5% of the dataset and certifying 8-token stability horizons in preference-based alignment.

    "abstract": "In this article, we first introduce the one-sided BLO space $\\mathrm{BLO}^+(\\mathbb{R})$ and characterize it, respectively, in terms of the one-sided Muckenhoupt class $A_1^+(\\mathbb{R})$ and the one-sided John--Nirenberg inequality. Using these, we establish the Coifman--Rochberg type decomposition of $\\mathrm{BLO}^+(\\mathbb{R})$ functions and show that $\\mathrm{BLO}^+(\\mathbb{R})$ is independent of the distance between the two intervals, which further induces the characterization of this space in terms of the one-sided BMO space $\\mathrm{BMO}^+(\\mathbb{R})$ (the Bennett type lemma). As applications, we prove that any $\\mathrm{BMO}^+(\\mathbb{R})$ function can split into the sum of two $\\mathrm{BLO}^+(\\mathbb{R})$ functions and we provide an explicit description of the distance from $\\mathrm{BLO}^+(\\mathbb{R})$ functions to $L^\\infty(\\mathbb{R})$. Finally, as a higher-dimensional analogue we introduce the parabolic BLO space $\\mathrm{PBLO}_γ^-(\\mathbb{R}^{n+1})$ with time lag, and we extend all the above one-dimensional results to $\\mathrm{PBLO}_γ^-(\\mathbb{R}^{n+1})$; furthermore, as applications, we not only establish the relationships between $\\mathrm{PBLO}_γ^-(\\mathbb{R}^{n+1})$ and the solutions of doubly nonlinear parabolic equations, but also provide a necessary condition for the negative logarithm of the parabolic distance function to belong to $\\mathrm{PBLO}_γ^-(\\mathbb{R}^{n+1})$ in terms of the weak porosity of the set."

    "abstract": "Detecting early warning signals in climatic time series is essential for anticipating critical transitions and tipping points. Common statistical indicators include increased variance and lag-one autocorrelation prior to bifurcation points. However, these indicators are sensitive to observational noise, long-term mean trends, and long-memory dependence, all of which are prevalent in climatic time series. Such effects can easily obscure genuine signals or generate spurious detections. To address these challenges, we employ a flexible Bayesian framework for modelling time-varying autocorrelation in long-range dependent time series, also accounting for time-varying variance. The approach uses a mixture of two fractional Gaussian noise processes with a time-dependent weight function to represent fractional Gaussian noise with a time-varying Hurst exponent. Inference is performed via integrated nested Laplace approximation, enabling joint estimation of mean trends and handling of irregularly sampled observations. The strengths and limitations of detecting changes in the autocorrelation is investigated in extensive simulations. Applied to real climatic data sets, we find evidence of early warning signals in a reconstructed Atlantic multidecadal variability index, while dismissing such signals for paleoclimate records spanning the Dansgaard-Oeschger events."

    "abstract": "A prominent theme in behavioural contract theory is the study of present-biased agents represented through quasi-hyperbolic discounting. In a model of competitive credit provision, we study an alternative to this framework in which the agent has a private stochastic discount factor and may overestimate the likelihood of more patient values. Agent preferences, however, are timeconsistent. While a limiting case of our model corresponds to a \"fully naive\" agent in work on quasi-hyperbolic discounting, another case is where the agent has correct beliefs about future discounting. In equilibrium, the agent selects options with earlier consumption in case of less patient discount factor realisations, but is penalised by receiving worse terms. Our model thus accounts for an important feature of equilibrium contracts identified in Heidhues and Kőszegi (2010). Unlike Heidhues and Kőszegi, our framework often predicts excessively backloaded consumption, including when the agent holds correct beliefs about future discounting."

Here, we present a unified first-principles investigation of hydrostatic-pressure tuning in Ta2Se from 0 to 10 GPa, connecting the structural response, mechanical stability, thermophysical indicators, bonding evolution, electronic and optical behavior, lattice dynamics and superconductivity within a single framework. The derived thermophysical descriptors corroborate a pressure-stiffened lattice: density increases, Debye temperature rises, melting temperature is elevated and minimum thermal conductivity increases, whereas the Grüneisen parameter remains within a narrow window, suggesting no anomalous anharmonic softening. Bond population metrics and electron-density-difference analysis revealed a mixed metallic-covalent bonding picture dominated by a robust Ta-Ta metallic backbone, accompanied by pressure-strengthened Ta-Se hybridization. Electronic-structure calculations show persistent metallicity under compression; pressure broadens bands, reduces density of states at the Fermi level, reshapes the Fermi surface and points to a possible Lifshitz-type reconstruction without symmetry breaking. The optical response remained metallic with Drude-like low-energy behavior and pressure-tunable spectral features. The phonon dispersions exhibit no imaginary modes, confirming dynamical stability. Electron-phonon coupling calculations classify Ta2Se as a weak-coupling, phonon-mediated superconductor with Tc around 3.9 K, consistent with available experiments and establish pressure as a practical control knob for stability and superconductivity-relevant descriptors in this metal-rich layered platform."

While it excels in high-speed networks, its performance degrades significantly in bandwidth-limited scenarios. Recent studies address this by transmitting KV caches in compressed form, but the associated heavyweight decompression counteracts the KV reuse benefits. In this paper, we propose an efficient and widely deployable remote KV cache reuse solution that leverages GPU-native video codecs. Our system, KVFetcher, enables effective KV cache coding with two techniques. The codec-friendly tensor layout compresses the KV cache in a highly compact video format, enabling fast transmission. The efficient KV fetcher orchestrates the transmission, decoding, and restoration of compressed KV caches in an efficient pipelined manner, eliminating resource contention, masking network fluctuations, and achieving minimum time-to-first-token (TTFT). We prototype KVFetcher on diverse GPUs from high- to low-end. Experiments reveal that it reduces TTFT by up to 3.51 times while maintaining lossless accuracy, compared to SOTA methods."

Furthermore, it supports switching function bases, thus adaptable to various scenarios in numerical approximation and machine learning. Our model has asymptotic advantages over the best classical feed-forward neural networks in terms of circuit size and achieves optimal parameter complexity when approximating Sobolev functions under $L_2$ norm."

    "abstract": "Higher-order networks encode the many-body interactions of complex systems ranging from the brain to biological transportation networks. Simplicial and cell complexes are ideal higher-order network representations for investigating higher-order topological dynamics where dynamical variables are not only associated with nodes, but also with edges, triangles, and higher-order simplices and cells. Global Topological Synchronization (GTS) refers to the dynamical state in which identical oscillators associated with higher-dimensional simplices and cells oscillate in unison. On standard unweighted and undirected complexes this dynamical state can be achieved only under strict topological and combinatorial conditions on the underlying discrete support. In this work we consider generalized higher-order network representations including directed and hollow complexes. Based on an in depth investigation of their topology defined by their associated algebraic topology operators and Betti numbers, we determine under which conditions GTS can be observed. We show that directed complexes always admit a global topological synchronization state independently of their topology and structure. However, we demonstrate that for directed complexes this dynamical state cannot be asymptotically stable. While hollow complexes require more stringent topological conditions to sustain global topological synchronization, these topologies can favor both the existence and the stability of global topological synchronization with respect to undirected and unweighted complexes."

Doping N can substantially enhance the yield strength but often leads to a decreased ductility, revealing a strength-ductility trade-off phenomenon. Here, we simultaneously enhance the strength and ductility in a non-equiatomic CrMnFeCoNi high-entropy alloy via N alloying and unravel the underlying microscopic mechanisms. The N-doped alloy (1 at.% N) shows an excellent combination of higher yield strength (104% increase) and larger ductility (38% increase), with a two-stage strain hardening behavior, compared to the N-free alloy. Detailed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis reveals that N-doping introduces short-range order (SRO) domains within the microstructure, leads to pronounced planar slip, and promotes the formation of nano-spaced (6-15 nm) stacking faults and deformation twins. Continuous generation and interaction of the fine-spaced SFs act as a strong barrier for dislocation movement and provide ample room for dislocation storage. The interaction of SRO with dislocations and the evolution of SFs ascribe to the first strain hardening stage, and the disordering of the SRO along with the activation of deformation twins are attributed to the second strain hardening stage. Our work shows that N-doping is effective in simultaneously improving the strength-ductility synergy and provides novel insights into alloy design with slightly elevating the SFE, and manipulating the ordered structure within the HEA."

Based on the CARE Liver 2025 Track 4 Challenge, this study introduces a multi-task deep learning framework developed for liver segmentation (LiSeg) and liver fibrosis staging (LiFS) using multiparametric MRI. The LiSeg phase addresses the challenge of limited annotated images and the complexities of multi-parametric MRI data by employing a semi-supervised learning model that integrates image segmentation and registration. By leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data, the model overcomes the difficulties introduced by domain shifts and variations across modalities. In the LiFS phase, we employed a patchbased method which allows the visualization of liver fibrosis stages based on the classification outputs. Our approach effectively handles multimodality imaging data, limited labels, and domain shifts. The proposed method has been tested by the challenge organizer on an independent test set that includes in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) cases using three-channel MRIs (T1, T2, DWI) and seven-channel MRIs (T1, T2, DWI, GED1-GED4).

These states are expected to exhibit significantly enhanced lifetimes and correspondingly narrower decay widths compared to toponium, primarily because only a single top quark participates in the weak decay process. The numerical results indicate that the masses of topped mesons are close to the top-quark mass. For the $t\\bar{b}$ states, the $1S$ state is approximately 5.08~GeV heavier than the top quark, while the $2S$, $3S$, and $4S$ states are about 5.37~GeV, 5.57~GeV, and 5.74~GeV heavier, respectively.

A two-body decay \\BKX with an invisible $X$ provides a natural candidate explanation. This work provides a comprehensive test of this hypothesis using Belle II's public model-agnostic likelihood. Posterior distributions are derived for the resonance mass $m_X$ and the branching fraction, and a modified frequentist upper-limit mass scan is performed. The data favor a resonance with mass $m_X = 2.1^{+0.2}_{-0.1}$ GeV and the product $\\mathcal{B}(B^+\\to K^+ X) \\cdot \\mathcal{P}_{X,\\rm inv} = 9.2^{+1.8}_{-3.4} \\cdot 10^{-6}$, where $\\mathcal{P}_{X,\\rm inv}$ is the probability that $X$ (and its decay products) are undetected. Bayes factors indicate a very strong preference for the Standard Model plus resonance over the Standard Model-only hypothesis. A frequentist likelihood-ratio test favors the Standard Model plus resonance hypothesis by $3.0σ$. A light invisible resonance plus the Standard Model therefore provides a compelling description of the Belle II data."

Realizing such states at room temperature and on a macroscopic scale is essential for energy-efficient electronics and quantum technologies, yet remains a fundamental challenge due to material limitations. Here, using microwave impedance microscopy, we directly visualize robust QSH states persisting up to 300 K in α-Bi4Br4 nanowires. This stability and scalability are enabled by a stair stepped stacking configuration, a multilayer geometry in which QSH edge states from individual layers remain spatially decoupled. This configuration circumvents the stringent alignment and layer number constraints of previous proposals, allowing robust stair-stepped QSH (SS-QSH) conduction in structures several micrometers long and hundreds of nanometers high. Magnetic field and temperature dependent measurements confirm their intrinsic topological nature. Crucially, the SS-QSH and bulk signals scale with nanowire height, verifying the stair stepped origin. Our results are also successfully reproduced by finite-element analysis simulations. This work establishes α Bi4Br4 as a practical platform for high temperature topological electronics and demonstrates a generalizable stacking strategy for designing scalable QSH systems."

    "abstract": "Vision-language navigation (VLN) requires intelligent agents to navigate environments by interpreting linguistic instructions alongside visual observations, serving as a cornerstone task in Embodied AI. Current VLN research for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) relies on detailed, pre-specified instructions to guide the UAV along predetermined routes. However, real-world outdoor exploration typically occurs in unknown environments where detailed navigation instructions are unavailable. Instead, only coarse-grained positional or directional guidance can be provided, requiring UAVs to autonomously navigate through continuous planning and obstacle avoidance. To bridge this gap, we propose AutoFly, an end-to-end Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model for autonomous UAV navigation. AutoFly incorporates a pseudo-depth encoder that derives depth-aware features from RGB inputs to enhance spatial reasoning, coupled with a progressive two-stage training strategy that effectively aligns visual, depth, and linguistic representations with action policies. Moreover, existing VLN datasets have fundamental limitations for real-world autonomous navigation, stemming from their heavy reliance on explicit instruction-following over autonomous decision-making and insufficient real-world data. To address these issues, we construct a novel autonomous navigation dataset that shifts the paradigm from instruction-following to autonomous behavior modeling through: (1) trajectory collection emphasizing continuous obstacle avoidance, autonomous planning, and recognition workflows; (2) comprehensive real-world data integration. Experimental results demonstrate that AutoFly achieves a 3.9% higher success rate compared to state-of-the-art VLA baselines, with consistent performance across simulated and real environments."

Recent theoretical work attributes this transition to dynamical instabilities along class-separating directions, but practical methods to detect and exploit these windows in trained models are still limited. We show that tracking the class-conditional entropy of a latent semantic variable given the noisy state provides a reliable signature of these transition regimes. By restricting the entropy to semantic partitions, the entropy can furthermore resolve semantic decisions at different levels of abstraction. We analyze this behavior in high-dimensional Gaussian mixture models and show that the entropy rate concentrates on the same logarithmic time scale as the speciation symmetry-breaking instability previously identified in variance-preserving diffusion. We validate our method on EDM2-XS and Stable Diffusion 1.5, where class-conditional entropy consistently isolates the noise regimes critical for semantic structure formation. Finally, we use our framework to quantify how guidance redistributes semantic information over time. Together, these results connect information-theoretic and statistical physics perspectives on diffusion and provide a principled basis for time-localized control."

Based on \\textit{VIDA}, we propose a strong baseline: VideoAfford, which activates multimodal large language models with additional affordance segmentation capabilities, enabling both world knowledge reasoning and fine-grained affordance grounding within a unified framework. To enhance action understanding capability, we leverage a latent action encoder to extract dynamic interaction priors from HOI videos. Moreover, we introduce a \\textit{spatial-aware} loss function to enable VideoAfford to obtain comprehensive 3D spatial knowledge. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms well-established methods and exhibits strong open-world generalization with affordance reasoning abilities.

Our method decomposes a video into five modalities, including image, speech, OCR, music, and video context, and uses a multi-stage prompting scheme to compute fine-grained hateful scores for each frame. We further introduce a composition matching mechanism to enhance cross-modal reasoning.

As for other purposes, the use of GenAI in the legal domain comes with various risks and benefits that needs to be properly managed to ensure implementation in a way that serves public values and protect human rights. While the EU mandates risk assessment and audits before market introduction for some use cases (e.g., use by judges for administration of justice) other use cases do not fall under the AI Acts' high-risk classifications (e.g., use by citizens for legal consultation or drafting documents). Further, current risk management practices prioritize expert judgment on risk factor identification and prioritization without a corresponding legal requirement to consult with affected communities. Seeing the societal importance of the legal sector and the potentially transformative impact of GenAI in this sector, the acceptability and legitimacy of GenAI solutions also depends on public perceptions and a better understanding of the risks and benefits citizens associated with the use of AI in the legal sector. As a response, this papers presents data from a representative sample of German citizens (n=488) outlining citizens' perspectives on the use of GenAI for two legal tasks: legal consultation and legal mediation. Concretely, we i) systematically map risks and benefit factors for both legal tasks, ii) describe predictors that influence risk acceptance of the use of GenAI for those tasks, and iii) highlight emerging trade-off themes that citizens engage in when weighing up risk acceptability. Our results provides an empirical overview of citizens' concerns regarding risk management of GenAI for the legal domain, foregrounding critical themes that complement current risk assessment procedures."

This paper presents ISO FastLane, a gateway-less dual-stack approach that routes point-to-point ISOBUS traffic over Ethernet while keeping broadcast messages on the existing CAN bus. The solution requires no new state machines, no middleware, and no changes to application layer code: only a simple Layer~3 routing decision and a lightweight peer discovery mechanism called Augmented Address Claim (AACL). Legacy devices continue to operate unmodified and unaware of FastLane traffic. Preliminary tests reported on the paper demonstrate that ISO FastLane accelerates Virtual Terminal object pool uploads by factor of 8 and sustains Task Controller message rates over 100 times beyond the current specification limit. Because ISO FastLane builds entirely on existing J1939 and ISO~11783 conventions, it can be implemented by ISOBUS engineers in a matter of weeks. This is delivering tangible performance gains today, without waiting for the long-term High Speed ISOBUS solution."

    "abstract": "Objective: To validate a novel inter-electrode PWV method that directly measures pulse wave propagation between spatially separated electrodes, avoiding LVET estimation. Methods: We analyzed 43 multi-channel ECG recordings (3 channels, 1000 Hz) from the FELICITy 2 cohort (pregnant women, $\\sim$19 and $\\sim$35 weeks gestation). R-peaks were detected independently on each channel using an ensemble detector. Time lags ($Δt$) between matched R-peaks on electrode pairs were calculated, and PWV computed as PWV = $L$/$Δt$, where $L$ is an effective inter-electrode distance. Three channel pairs provided independent PWV estimates per recording. Temporal stability was assessed using sliding window analysis (1--15 minutes). To investigate whether $Δt$ reflects morphological distortion or vascular propagation, we performed signal origin analysis using three QRS fiducial points (R-peak maximum, QRS onset, maximum $|dV/dt|$) and two bandpass settings (0.5--40 and 0.5--100~Hz). Longitudinal changes were compared between Control (n=24) and prenatal Yoga intervention (n=20) groups. Results: Inter-electrode PWV yielded physiologically plausible values (Control First: 7.40$\\pm$1.51 m/s, Control Last: 6.98$\\pm$1.63 m/s; Yoga First: 7.10$\\pm$2.15 m/s, Yoga Last: 8.16$\\pm$0.91 m/s), consistent with literature values for aortic PWV (5--10 m/s). Temporal stability analysis demonstrated PWV stabilizes at 5 minutes (CV=12.3\\%), with 2.6--5.2$\\times$ better stability than heart rate and HRV metrics. Signal origin analysis showed that inter-electrode delays persisted across all QRS fiducial points (15--27~ms) and were insensitive to bandpass changes ($-$8.5\\%, NS), arguing against pure morphological distortion; all conditions yielded PWV within 6.8--9.1~m/s. Preliminary group comparison suggests different trajectories (Control: --5.7\\% decrease, Yoga: +14.9\\% increase, p=0.07 for interaction). Conclusions: Inter-electrode PWV provides direct spatial measurement of pulse wave propagation with physiologically valid values, independent of LVET estimation. Signal origin analysis supports the robustness of this empirical surrogate across fiducial and filter conditions. Method shows promise for pregnancy arterial stiffness assessment using standard multi-channel ECG equipment. Further validation against gold-standard measures and accurate electrode distance determination are needed."

    "abstract": "Constraint Answer Set Programming (CASP) is a hybrid paradigm that enriches Answer Set Programming (ASP) with numerical constraint processing, something required in many real-world applications. The usual specification of constraints in most CASP solvers is closer to the numerical back-end expressiveness and semantics, rather than to standard specification in ASP. In the latter, numerical attributes are represented with predicates and this allows declaring default values, leaving the attribute undefined, making non-deterministic assignments with choice rules or using aggregated values. In CASP, most (if not all) of these features are lost once we switch to a constraint-based representation of those same attributes. In this paper, we present the FLINGO language (and tool) that incorporates the aforementioned expressiveness inside the numerical constraints and we illustrate its use with several examples. Based on previous work that established its semantic foundations, we also present a translation from the newly introduced FLINGO syntax to regular CASP programs following the CLINGCON input format."

    "abstract": "We study discrete-time, discrete-state multistate Markov models from the perspective of algebraic statistics. These models are widely studied in event history analysis, and are characterized by the state space, the initial distribution and the transition probabilities. A finite path under the multistate Markov model is a particular set of states occupied at finite time instances $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$. The main goal of this paper is to establish a bridge between event history analysis and algebraic statistics. The joint probabilities of finite paths in these models have a natural monomial parametrization in terms of the initial distribution and the transition probabilities. We study the polynomial relations among joint path probabilities. When the statistical constraints on the parameters are disregarded, nonhomogeneous multistate Markov models of arbitrary order can be viewed as slices of decomposable hierarchical models. This yields a complete description of their vanishing ideals as toric ideals generated by explicit families of binomials. Moreover, the variety of this vanishing ideal equals the nonhomogeneous multistate Markov model on the probability simplex. In contrast, homogeneous multistate Markov models exhibit different algebraic behavior, as time homogeneity imposes additional polynomial relations, leading to vanishing ideals that are strictly larger than in the nonhomogeneous case. We also derive families of binomial relations that vanish on homogeneous multistate Markov models. We investigate maximum likelihood estimation from statistical and algebraic perspectives. For nonhomogeneous models, classical and algebraic formulas agree; in the homogeneous case, the algebraic approach is more complex. Lastly, we provide data applications where we demonstrate the statistical theory to obtain the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters under specific multistate Markov models."

We first introduce the fundamentals of CSS, including the general framework, classical detector design, and fusion strategies. Then, we present an overview of the state-of-the-art research on AI-driven CSS, classified into three categories: discriminative deep learning (DL) models, generative DL models, and deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Furthermore, we explore semantic communication (SemCom) as a promising solution for CSS, in which task-oriented representations are exchanged to reduce reporting overhead while preserving decision-critical information. Finally, we discuss limitations, open challenges, and future research directions at the intersection of AI and wireless communication."

This competition couples internal particle organization to container morphology and is central to biological processes such as cell motility, division, and encapsulation, in which cytoskeletal filaments confined by lipid membranes actively reshape cells. Using a minimal model combining experiments and simulations of colloidal rods encapsulated in lipid vesicles, we show that soft confinement drives a bidirectional coupling between internal order and vesicle shape. This interplay gives rise to a phase diagram in which elongated vesicles promote nematic alignment at lower packing fractions, whereas higher packing fractions induce smectic-like ordering that reshapes vesicles into plate-like morphologies with increased bending energy. Furthermore, by controlling vesicle volume and membrane area, we demonstrate that these boundary conditions enable reversible tuning of both vesicle shape and internal rod organization. This study establishes a promising route for dynamically controlling colloidal self-assembly in soft containers and for mimicking ordering in cell-like compartments."

However, most existing approaches remain task-specific and rely primarily on textual instructions, limiting their ability to handle multimodal inputs, contextual references, and diverse video generation and editing scenarios within a unified framework. Moreover, many video editing methods depend on carefully engineered pipelines tailored to individual operations, which hinders scalability and composability. In this paper, we propose Tele-Omni, a unified multimodal framework for video generation and editing that follows multimodal instructions, including text, images, and reference videos, within a single model. Tele-Omni leverages pretrained multimodal large language models to parse heterogeneous instructions and infer structured generation or editing intents, while diffusion-based generators perform high-quality video synthesis conditioned on these structured signals. To enable joint training across heterogeneous video tasks, we introduce a task-aware data processing pipeline that unifies multimodal inputs into a structured instruction format while preserving task-specific constraints. Tele-Omni supports a wide range of video-centric tasks, including text-to-video generation, image-to-video generation, first-last-frame video generation, in-context video generation, and in-context video editing. By decoupling instruction parsing from video synthesis and combining it with task-aware data design, Tele-Omni achieves flexible multimodal control while maintaining strong temporal coherence and visual consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that Tele-Omni achieves competitive performance across multiple tasks."

    "abstract": "In recent years, tokenomic systems, decentralized systems that use cryptographic tokens to represent value and rights, have evolved considerably. Growing complexity in incentive structures has expanded the applicability of blockchain beyond purely transactional use. Existing research predominantly examines token economies within specific use cases, proposes conceptual frameworks, or studies isolated aspects such as governance, incentive design, and tokenomics. However, the literature offers limited empirically grounded, end-to-end guidance that integrates these dimensions into a coherent, step-by-step design approach informed by concrete token-economy development efforts. To address this gap, this paper presents the Token Economy Design Method (TEDM), a design-science artifact that synthesizes stepwise design propositions for token-economy design across incentives, governance, and tokenomics. TEDM is derived through an iterative qualitative synthesis of prior contributions and refined through a co-designed case. The artifact is formatively evaluated via the Currynomics case study and additional expert interviews. Currynomics is an ecosystem that maintains the Redcurry stablecoin, using real estate as the underlying asset. TEDM is positioned as reusable design guidance that facilitates the analysis of foundational requirements of tokenized ecosystems. The specificity of the proposed approach lies in the focus on the socio-technical context of the system and early stages of its design."

An additional difficulty stems from the relative proximity of several targets, the latter being perceived as a single target in the worst case, or influencing each other's detection thresholds. The negative impact of targets proximity notably depends on the range resolution defined by the radar parameters and the adaptive threshold adopted. This paper addresses the matter of targets detection in radar range profiles containing multiple targets with varying proximity and distorted echoes. Inspired by recent contributions in the radar and signal processing literature, this work proposes partially complex-valued neural networks as an adaptive range profile processing. Simulated datasets are generated and experiments are conducted to compare a common pulse compression approach with a simple neural network partially defined by complex-valued parameters. Whereas the pulse compression processes one pulse length at a time, the neural network put forward is a generative architecture going through the entire received signal in one go to generate a complete detection profile."

The vast majority of approaches to spectral clustering are driven by a single modality, leaving the rich information in multi-modal representations untapped. Inspired by the recent success of vision-language pre-training, this paper enriches the landscape of spectral clustering from a single-modal to a multi-modal regime. Particularly, we propose Neural Tangent Kernel Spectral Clustering that leverages cross-modal alignment in pre-trained vision-language models. By anchoring the neural tangent kernel with positive nouns, i.e., those semantically close to the images of interest, we arrive at formulating the affinity between images as a coupling of their visual proximity and semantic overlap. We show that this formulation amplifies within-cluster connections while suppressing spurious ones across clusters, hence encouraging block-diagonal structures. In addition, we present a regularized affinity diffusion mechanism that adaptively ensembles affinity matrices induced by different prompts. Extensive experiments on \\textbf{16} benchmarks -- including classical, large-scale, fine-grained and domain-shifted datasets -- manifest that our method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin."

We consider here the complexity of the multiplication in small semifields and finite field extensions.

The other base field operations are additions and scalings by constants, which together we refer to as the additive complexity. When used recursively, the tensor rank determines the exponent while the other operations determine the constant of the associated asymptotic complexity bounds. For small extensions, both measures are of similar importance. In this paper, we establish the tensor rank of some semifields and finite fields of characteristics 2 and 3. We also propose new upper and lower bounds on their additive complexity, and give new associated algorithms improving on the state-of-the-art in terms of overall complexity.

We introduce the Fidelity-Age (FA) metric, which measures this interval for states whose fidelity exceeds a threshold Fmin. A renewal formulation links slot-level success probability to long-run average FA, enabling a stochastic control problem that minimizes FA under budget and memory limits. Two lightweight schedulers, FA-THR and FA-INDEX, approximate Lyapunov-drift-optimal control. Simulations on slotted repeater grids show that FA-aware scheduling preserves throughput while reducing extreme-age events by up to two orders of magnitude. Fidelity-Age thus provides a tractable, physically grounded metric for reliable and timely entanglement delivery in quantum networks."

This study examines this shift by analyzing longitudinal trends in physics-related search and page-view activity, using declines in traditional search behavior as a quantitative proxy for changes in independent information-seeking practices. We analyze Google Trends data for core concepts in Classical Mechanics and Electromagnetism across three academic years (2022-2025) in more than 20 countries, and complement this analysis with Wikipedia page-view data across seven major languages to establish platform independence. The results reveal a substantial, systematic, and persistent global decline in search and page-view activity across most examined physics topics. The magnitude of this decline is domain-dependent, with Mechanics-related content exhibiting sharper and more consistent reductions than Electromagnetism-related content. Pronounced geographic and linguistic heterogeneity is observed: while English-speaking regions show relative stability or only moderate declines, non-English-speaking regions exhibit substantially larger reductions in traditional, search-based information-seeking activity. Despite the overall decrease in volume, the seasonal structure characteristic of academic activity remains robust. Taken together, these findings indicate a redistribution of physics-related information-seeking behavior in academic contexts where generative tools are increasingly available."

Current methods struggle with nuanced emotional expressions due to the lack of fine-grained emotion control. To address this issue, we introduce a novel two-stage method (AUHead) to disentangle fine-grained emotion control, i.e. , Action Units (AUs), from audio and achieve controllable generation. In the first stage, we explore the AU generation abilities of large audio-language models (ALMs), by spatial-temporal AU tokenization and an \"emotion-then-AU\" chain-of-thought mechanism. It aims to disentangle AUs from raw speech, effectively capturing subtle emotional cues. In the second stage, we propose an AU-driven controllable diffusion model that synthesizes realistic talking-head videos conditioned on AU sequences. Specifically, we first map the AU sequences into the structured 2D facial representation to enhance spatial fidelity, and then model the AU-vision interaction within cross-attention modules. To achieve flexible AU-quality trade-off control, we introduce an AU disentanglement guidance strategy during inference, further refining the emotional expressiveness and identity consistency of the generated videos. Results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive performance in emotional realism, accurate lip synchronization, and visual coherence, significantly surpassing existing techniques.

    "abstract": "Blind Image Quality Assessment, aiming to replicate human perception of visual quality without reference, plays a key role in vision tasks, yet existing models often fail to effectively capture subtle distortion cues, leading to a misalignment with human subjective judgments. We identify that the root cause of this limitation lies in the lack of reliable distortion priors, as methods typically learn shallow relationships between unified image features and quality scores, resulting in their insensitive nature to distortions and thus limiting their performance. To address this, we introduce DR.Experts, a novel prior-driven BIQA framework designed to explicitly incorporate distortion priors, enabling a reliable quality assessment. DR.Experts begins by leveraging a degradation-aware vision-language model to obtain distortion-specific priors, which are further refined and enhanced by the proposed Distortion-Saliency Differential Module through distinguishing them from semantic attentions, thereby ensuring the genuine representations of distortions. The refined priors, along with semantics and bridging representation, are then fused by a proposed mixture-of-experts style module named the Dynamic Distortion Weighting Module. This mechanism weights each distortion-specific feature as per its perceptual impact, ensuring that the final quality prediction aligns with human perception. Extensive experiments conducted on five challenging BIQA benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DR.Experts over current methods and showcase its excellence in terms of generalization and data efficiency."

    "abstract": "The Rashomon set captures the collection of models that achieve near-identical empirical performance yet may differ substantially in their decision boundaries. Understanding the differences among these models, i.e., their multiplicity, is recognized as a crucial step toward model transparency, fairness, and robustness, as it reveals decision boundaries instabilities that standard metrics obscure. However, the existing definitions of Rashomon set and multiplicity metrics assume centralized learning and do not extend naturally to decentralized, multi-party settings like Federated Learning (FL). In FL, multiple clients collaboratively train models under a central server's coordination without sharing raw data, which preserves privacy but introduces challenges from heterogeneous client data distribution and communication constraints. In this setting, the choice of a single best model may homogenize predictive behavior across diverse clients, amplify biases, or undermine fairness guarantees. In this work, we provide the first formalization of Rashomon sets in FL.First, we adapt the Rashomon set definition to FL, distinguishing among three perspectives: (I) a global Rashomon set defined over aggregated statistics across all clients, (II) a t-agreement Rashomon set representing the intersection of local Rashomon sets across a fraction t of clients, and (III) individual Rashomon sets specific to each client's local distribution.Second, we show how standard multiplicity metrics can be estimated under FL's privacy constraints. Finally, we introduce a multiplicity-aware FL pipeline and conduct an empirical study on standard FL benchmark datasets. Our results demonstrate that all three proposed federated Rashomon set definitions offer valuable insights, enabling clients to deploy models that better align with their local data, fairness considerations, and practical requirements."

    "abstract": "Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex tasks by employing search-augmented reasoning to incorporate external knowledge into long chains of thought. However, we identify a critical yet underexplored bottleneck in this paradigm, termed Knowledge Integration Decay (KID). Specifically, we observe that as the length of reasoning generated before search grows, models increasingly fail to integrate retrieved evidence into subsequent reasoning steps, limiting performance even when relevant information is available. To address this, we propose Self-Anchored Knowledge Encoding (SAKE), a training-free inference-time strategy designed to stabilize knowledge utilization. By anchoring retrieved knowledge at both the beginning and end of the reasoning process, SAKE prevents it from being overshadowed by prior context, thereby preserving its semantic integrity. Extensive experiments on multi-hop QA and complex reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that SAKE significantly mitigates KID and improves performance, offering a lightweight yet effective solution for knowledge integration in agentic LLMs."

    "abstract": "We propose AdaDS, a generalizable framework for depth super-resolution that robustly recovers high-resolution depth maps from arbitrarily degraded low-resolution inputs. Unlike conventional approaches that directly regress depth values and often exhibit artifacts under severe or unknown degradation, AdaDS capitalizes on the contraction property of Gaussian smoothing: as noise accumulates in the forward process, distributional discrepancies between degraded inputs and their pristine high-quality counterparts diminish, ultimately converging to isotropic Gaussian prior. Leveraging this, AdaDS adaptively selects a starting timestep in the reverse diffusion trajectory based on estimated refinement uncertainty, and subsequently injects tailored noise to position the intermediate sample within the high-probability region of the target posterior distribution. This strategy ensures inherent robustness, enabling generative prior of a pre-trained diffusion model to dominate recovery even when upstream estimations are imperfect. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic benchmarks demonstrate AdaDS's superior zero-shot generalization and resilience to diverse degradation patterns compared to state-of-the-art methods."

    "abstract": "Multimodal representation learning aims to construct a shared embedding space in which heterogeneous modalities are semantically aligned. Despite strong empirical results, InfoNCE-based objectives introduce inherent conflicts that yield distribution gaps across modalities. In this work, we identify two conflicts in the multimodal regime, both exacerbated as the number of modalities increases: (i) an alignment-uniformity conflict, whereby the repulsion of uniformity undermines pairwise alignment, and (ii) an intra-alignment conflict, where aligning multiple modalities induces competing alignment directions. To address these issues, we propose a principled decoupling of alignment and uniformity for multimodal representations, providing a conflict-free recipe for multimodal learning that simultaneously supports discriminative and generative use cases without task-specific modules. We then provide a theoretical guarantee that our method acts as an efficient proxy for a global Hölder divergence over multiple modality distributions, and thus reduces the distribution gap among modalities. Extensive experiments on retrieval and UnCLIP-style generation demonstrate consistent gains."

    "abstract": "Reaction-diffusion (RD) equations underpin pattern formation across chemistry, biology, and physics, yet learning stable operators that forecast their long-term dynamics from data remains challenging. Neural-operator surrogates provide resolution-robust prediction, but autoregressive rollouts can drift due to the accumulation of error, and out-of-distribution (OOD) initial conditions often degrade accuracy. Physics-based numerical residual objectives can regularize operator learning, although they introduce additional assumptions, sensitivity to discretization and loss design, and higher training cost. Here we develop a purely data-driven operator learner with adaptive recurrent training (DDOL-ART) using a robust recurrent strategy with lightweight validation milestones that early-exit unproductive rollout segments and redirect optimization. Trained only on a single in-distribution toroidal Gaussian family over short horizons, DDOL-ART learns one-step operators that remain stable under long rollouts and generalize zero-shot to strong morphology shifts across FitzHugh-Nagumo (FN), Gray-Scott (GS), and Lambda-Omega (LO) systems. Across these benchmarks, DDOL-ART delivers a strong accuracy and cost trade-off. It is several-fold faster than a physics-based numerical-loss operator learner (NLOL) under matched settings, and it remains competitive on both in-distribution stability and OOD robustness. Training-dynamics diagnostics show that adaptivity strengthens the correlation between validation error and OOD test error performance, acting as a feedback controller that limits optimization drift. Our results indicate that feedback-controlled recurrent training of DDOL-ART generates robust flow-map surrogates without PDE residuals, while simultaneously maintaining competitiveness with NLOL at significantly reduced training costs."

    "abstract": "Long chains of thought (Long CoTs) are widely employed in multimodal reasoning models to tackle complex tasks by capturing detailed visual information. However, these Long CoTs are often excessively lengthy and contain redundant reasoning steps, which can hinder inference efficiency. Compressing these long CoTs is a natural solution, yet existing approaches face two major challenges: (1) they may compromise the integrity of visual-textual reasoning by removing essential alignment cues, and (2) the compression process lacks explainability, making it difficult to discern which information is critical. To address these problems, we propose XMCC, an eXplainable Multimodal CoT Compressor that formulates compression as a sequential decision-making process optimized via reinforcement learning. XMCC can effectively shorten reasoning trajectories while preserving key reasoning steps and answer correctness, and simultaneously generates natural-language explanations for its compression decisions. Extensive experiments on representative multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that XMCC not only reduces reasoning length but also provides explainable explanations, validating its effectiveness."

Knowledge distillation (KD) is a promising solution for compressing these models, but existing methods primarily rely on static next-token alignment, neglecting the dynamic token interactions, which embed essential capabilities for multimodal understanding and generation. To this end, we introduce Align-TI, a novel KD framework designed from the perspective of Token Interactions. Our approach is motivated by the insight that MLLMs rely on two primary interactions: vision-instruction token interactions to extract relevant visual information, and intra-response token interactions for coherent generation. Accordingly, Align-TI introduces two components: IVA enables the student model to imitate the teacher's instruction-relevant visual information extract capability by aligning on salient visual regions. TPA captures the teacher's dynamic generative logic by aligning the sequential token-to-token transition probabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate Align-TI's superiority. Notably, our approach achieves $2.6\\%$ relative improvement over Vanilla KD, and our distilled Align-TI-2B even outperforms LLaVA-1.5-7B (a much larger MLLM) by $7.0\\%$, establishing a new state-of-the-art distillation framework for training parameter-efficient MLLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/lchen1019/Align-TI."

Here we formulate this process as a genuine three-body problem within the hyperspherical coordinate framework and evaluate decay probabilities by numerically solving the corresponding hyperradial Schrödinger equation, combined with large-scale random sampling of the potential parameters; the latter treatment ensures that the present results are more convincing. Inspired by this, we demonstrate that the penetrability ratio between simultaneous and sequential $α$ emission exhibits a strikingly linear dependence on $ZQ_{αα}^{-1/2}$, extending the barrier penetration dynamics into the correlated few-body regime. The nuclei $^{108}$Xe, $^{218}$Ra, $^{224}$Pu, $^{222}$U, $^{216}$Rn, and $^{220}$Th are suggested as the most promising candidates for the observation of double-$α$ decay, with predicted half-lives potentially accessible within present detection limits. Our results provide a unified framework for multi-$α$ decay and open a pathway to probing nuclear clustering and few-body correlations in heavy nuclei."

The sample is well characterised at radio and optical wavelengths, allowing us to connect the presence (or absence) of HI to the properties of the AGN and its host galaxy. The sample consists mostly of core-dominated sources and quasars. Half of the targets have a UV luminosity $L_{\\rm UV} = 10^{23}$ W Hz$^{-1}$, above this limit, the gas would be expected to be ionised by this radiation. We obtained 15 spectra free (or almost free) of radio frequency interference, reaching extremely low optical depths ($τ_{\\rm peak} < 0.005$) resulting in three new HI absorption detections. Two are associated HI absorptions, giving a detection rate of such systems of $13\\%\\pm 7\\%$. Both are found in young radio sources (PKS 1151-34 and PKS 1306-09), confirming the trend that this type of sources are more often detected in HI compared to more evolved ones. The UV luminosity of both these sources is below $10^{23}$ W Hz$^{-1}$. Surprisingly, one of the detections (PKS 1151-34) is hosted by a quasar, suggesting that the radio lobes are still embedded in the circumnuclear disc. In the second source (PKS 1306-09), the HI is highly blueshifted and likely part of a jet-driven outflow. A third detection is a 'local intervening' system, caused by a galaxy in the local environment of PKS 0405-12 and located in front of the southern radio lobe of this source, about 100 kpc in projection from this quasar. Overall, the results indicate a variety of plausible situations, which resemble what is seen at low redshifts. For the associated absorption, a combination of evolutionary status of the radio sources, physical conditions, and geometry of the gas structure determine the detection rate of HI absorption."

    "abstract": "Digital histopathology whole slide images (WSIs) provide gigapixel-scale high-resolution images that are highly useful for disease diagnosis. However, digital histopathology image analysis faces significant challenges due to the limited training labels, since manually annotating specific regions or small patches cropped from large WSIs requires substantial time and effort. Weakly supervised multiple instance learning (MIL) offers a practical and efficient solution by requiring only bag-level (slide-level) labels, while each bag typically contains multiple instances (patches). Most MIL methods directly use frozen image patch features generated by various image encoders as inputs and primarily focus on feature aggregation. However, feature representation learning for encoder pretraining in MIL settings has largely been neglected. In our work, we propose a novel feature representation learning framework called weakly supervised contrastive learning (WeakSupCon) that incorporates bag-level label information during training. Our method does not rely on instance-level pseudo-labeling, yet it effectively separates patches with different labels in the feature space. Experimental results demonstrate that the image features generated by our WeakSupCon method lead to improved downstream MIL performance compared to self-supervised contrastive learning approaches in three datasets.

    "abstract": "Superconducting quantum devices, from qubits and magnetometers to dark matter detectors, are influenced by magnetic flux noise originating from paramagnetic surface defects and impurities. These spin systems can feature complex dynamics, including a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, that depend on the lattice, interactions, external fields, and disorder. However, the disorder included in typical models is not materials-specific, diminishing the ability to accurately capture measured flux noise phenomena. We present a first principles-based simulation of a spin lattice consisting of paramagnetic O$_2$ molecules on an Al$_2$O$_3$ surface, a likely flux noise source in superconducting qubits, to elucidate opportunities to mitigate flux noise. We simulate an ensemble of surface adsorbates with disordered orientations and calculate the orientation-dependent exchange couplings using density functional theory. Thus, our spin simulation has no free parameters or assumed functional form of the disorder, and captures correlation in the defect landscape that would appear in real systems. We calculate a range of exchange interactions between electron pairs, with the smallest values, 0.016 meV and -0.023 meV, being in the range required to act as a two-level system and couple to GHz resonators. We calculate the flux noise frequency, temperature, and applied external magnetic field dependence, as well as the susceptibility-flux noise cross-correlation. Calculated trends agree with experiment, demonstrating that a surface harboring paramagnetic adsorbates arranged with materials-specific disorder and interactions captures the various properties of magnetic flux noise observed in superconducting circuits. In addition, we find that an external electric field can tune the spin-spin interaction strength and reduce magnetic flux noise."

Existing research consensus protocols rarely discuss reconfiguration. Those that do tightly couple membership changes to a specific algorithm. This prevents the independent upgrade of individual building blocks and forces expensive downtime when transitioning to new protocol implementations. Instead, modularity is essential for maintainability and system evolution in production deployments. We present Gauss, a reconfiguration engine designed to treat consensus protocols as interchangeable modules. By introducing a distinction between a consensus protocol's inner log and a sanitized outer log exposed to the RSM node, Gauss allows engineers to upgrade membership, failure thresholds, and the consensus protocol itself independently and with minimal global downtime. Our initial evaluation on the Rialo blockchain shows that this separation of concerns enables a seamless evolution of the SMR stack across a sequence of diverse protocol implementations."

Traditional security paradigms - log aggregation, perimeter defense, and post-hoc forensics - cannot protect systems where AI-driven actions are irreversible, execute at machine speed, and originate from potentially compromised orchestration layers. This paper introduces Autonomous Action Runtime Management (AARM), an open specification for securing AI-driven actions at runtime. AARM defines a runtime security system that intercepts actions before execution, accumulates session context, evaluates against policy and intent alignment, enforces authorization decisions, and records tamper-evident receipts for forensic reconstruction. We formalize a threat model addressing prompt injection, confused deputy attacks, data exfiltration, and intent drift. We introduce an action classification framework distinguishing forbidden, context-dependent deny, and context-dependent allow actions. We propose four implementation architectures - protocol gateway, SDK instrumentation, kernel eBPF, and vendor integration - with distinct trust properties, and specify minimum conformance requirements for AARM-compliant systems. AARM is model-agnostic, framework-agnostic, and vendor-neutral, treating action execution as the stable security boundary. This specification aims to establish industry-wide requirements before proprietary fragmentation forecloses interoperability."

    "abstract": "Discrete diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful class of generative models for chemistry and biology data. In these fields, the goal is to generate various samples with high rewards (e.g., drug-likeness in molecules), making reward-based guidance crucial. Most existing methods are based on guiding the diffusion model using intermediate rewards but tend to underperform since intermediate rewards are noisy due to the non-smooth nature of reward functions used in scientific domains. To address this, we propose Clean-Sample Markov Chain (CSMC) Sampler, a method that performs effective test-time reward-guided sampling for discrete diffusion models, enabling local search without relying on intermediate rewards. CSMC constructs a Markov chain of clean samples using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm such that its stationary distribution is the target distribution. We design a proposal distribution by sequentially applying the forward and backward diffusion processes, making the acceptance probability tractable. Experiments on molecule and biological sequence generation with various reward functions demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms prior approaches that rely on intermediate rewards."

Imperfect channel state information (CSI) is considered for all links, where robustness is ensured by modeling channel estimation errors within a bounded uncertainty region, guaranteeing worst-case performance reliability. The resulting non-convex problem is solved using an alternating optimization framework. The precoding subproblem is reformulated as a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem via linear matrix inequalities derived using the S-procedure. The RIS reflection matrix is optimized using successive convex approximation (SCA), yielding an equivalent SDP formulation. The MA position optimization is addressed through SCA combined with block coordinate descent (BCD) method. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and demonstrate fast convergence."

Here, we extend the analysis by examining the solutions to both the full similarity ODE and the simplified ODE in detail. It is shown that the full similarity equation captures many now well-known features of non-Boussinesq RT flows, including asymmetric spike and bubble growth and a systematic shift of velocity statistics toward the light-fluid side. Comparisons of the theoretical model with numerical and experimental studies show reasonable agreement in both spatial profiles and growth trends of mixing layer heights. We further show that a global mass correction applied to the simplified solution closely approximates the full solution, highlighting that, to leading order, RT mixing is governed by the competing dynamics between diffusion of $\\ln \\barρ$ and mass conservation."

The microwave photonic technology is promising by the practical application is limited by its complex architecture so far. Here, we demonstrate an optically locked low-noise photonic microwave oscillator, so that all the optical components are packaged within a small module of 166 mL, and low noise microwave generation is achieved at 10.4 GHz with single-sideband phase noise of -54 dBc/Hz at 10 Hz, -141 dBc/Hz at 10 kHz, and -162 dBc/Hz at 10 MHz offset. Above performance arises from a dual-laser self-injection-locking scheme to a single Fabry-Perot cavity with high Q exceeding 10^8, with over 20 dB common-mode noise suppression. The low-noise nature of such reference is coherently transferred to the X-band through a high-performance TFLN electro-optic comb chip, thereby overcoming long-standing barriers in photonic microwave integration to enable truly field-deployable low-noise microwave generation."

    "abstract": "In streaming Reinforcement Learning (RL), transitions are observed and discarded immediately after a single update. While this minimizes resource usage for on-device applications, it makes agents notoriously sample-inefficient, since value-based losses alone struggle to extract meaningful representations from transient data. We propose extending Self-Predictive Representations (SPR) to the streaming pipeline to maximize the utility of every observed frame. However, due to the highly correlated samples induced by the streaming regime, naively applying this auxiliary loss results in training instabilities. Thus, we introduce orthogonal gradient updates relative to the momentum target and resolve gradient conflicts arising from streaming-specific optimizers. Validated across the Atari, MinAtar, and Octax suites, our approach systematically outperforms existing streaming baselines. Latent-space analysis, including t-SNE visualizations and effective-rank measurements, confirms that our method learns significantly richer representations, bridging the performance gap caused by the absence of a replay buffer, while remaining efficient enough to train on just a few CPU cores."

    "abstract": "Industrial recommender systems typically rely on multi-task learning to estimate diverse user feedback signals and aggregate them for ranking. Recent advances in model scaling have shown promising gains in recommendation. However, naively increasing model capacity imposes prohibitive online inference costs and often yields diminishing returns for sparse tasks with skewed label distributions. This mismatch between uniform parameter scaling and heterogeneous task capacity demands poses a fundamental challenge for scalable multi-task recommendation. In this work, we investigate parameter sparsification as a principled scaling paradigm and identify two critical obstacles when applying sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to multi-task recommendation: exploded expert activation that undermines instance-level sparsity and expert load skew caused by independent task-wise routing. To address these challenges, we propose SMES, a scalable sparse MoE framework with progressive expert routing. SMES decomposes expert activation into a task-shared expert subset jointly selected across tasks and task-adaptive private experts, explicitly bounding per-instance expert execution while preserving task-specific capacity. In addition, SMES introduces a global multi-gate load-balancing regularizer that stabilizes training by regulating aggregated expert utilization across all tasks. SMES has been deployed in Kuaishou large-scale short-video services, supporting over 400 million daily active users. Extensive online experiments demonstrate stable improvements, with GAUC gain of 0.29% and a 0.31% uplift in user watch time."

    "abstract": "Discovering configurations that are both high-utility and structurally diverse under expensive black-box evaluation and strict query budgets remains a central challenge in data-driven discovery. Many classical optimizers concentrate on dominant modes, while quality-diversity methods require large evaluation budgets to populate high-dimensional archives. Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) provides distributional sampling but requires an explicit problem Hamiltonian, which is unavailable in black-box settings. Practical quantum circuits favor quadratic Hamiltonians since higher-order interaction terms are costly to realize. Learned quadratic surrogates such as Factorization Machines (FM) have been used as proxies, but are limited to pairwise structure. We extend this surrogate-to-Hamiltonian approach by modelling higher-order variable dependencies via self-attention and projects them into a valid Positive Semi-Definite quadratic form compatible with QAOA. This enables diversity-oriented quantum sampling from learned energy landscapes while capturing interaction structure beyond pairwise terms. We evaluate on risk discovery for enterprise document processing systems against diverse classical optimizers. Quantum-guided samplers achieve competitive utility while consistently improving structural diversity and exclusive discovery. FM surrogates provide stronger early coverage, whereas ours yields higher-fidelity surrogate landscapes and better extreme-case discovery. Our method recovers roughly twice as many structurally tail-risk outliers as most classical baselines and identify an exclusive non-overlapping fraction of high-utility configurations not found by competing methods, highlighting that an effective mechanism for learning higher-order interaction structure and projecting it into quadratic surrogate Hamiltonians for quantum-assisted black-box discovery."

    "abstract": "Due to the scarcity of part-of-speech annotated data, existing studies on low-resource languages typically adopt unsupervised approaches for POS tagging. Among these, POS tag projection with word alignment method transfers POS tags from a high-resource source language to a low-resource target language based on parallel corpora, making it particularly suitable for low-resource language settings. However, this approach relies heavily on parallel corpora, which are often unavailable for many low-resource languages. To overcome this limitation, we propose a fully unsupervised cross-lingual part-of-speech(POS) tagging framework that relies solely on monolingual corpora by leveraging unsupervised neural machine translation(UNMT) system. This UNMT system first translates sentences from a high-resource language into a low-resource one, thereby constructing pseudo-parallel sentence pairs. Then, we train a POS tagger for the target language following the standard projection procedure based on word alignments. Moreover, we propose a multi-source projection technique to calibrate the projected POS tags on the target side, enhancing to train a more effective POS tagger. We evaluate our framework on 28 language pairs, covering four source languages (English, German, Spanish and French) and seven target languages (Afrikaans, Basque, Finnis, Indonesian, Lithuanian, Portuguese and Turkish). Experimental results show that our method can achieve performance comparable to the baseline cross-lingual POS tagger with parallel sentence pairs, and even exceeds it for certain target languages. Furthermore, our proposed multi-source projection technique further boosts performance, yielding an average improvement of 1.3% over previous methods."

We experimentally demonstrate this building block in a photonic setup, developing two alternative compression strategies, based on Type-I fusion gate and a postselected implementation of the CNOT gate."

While there have been notable progressions, the fundamental concept of numerous DA methodologies has persisted: aligning the data from various domains into a shared feature space. In this space, knowledge acquired from labeled source data can improve the model training on target data that lacks sufficient labels. In this study, we demonstrate the use of 10 deep learning models to simulate common DA techniques and explore their application in four medical image datasets. We have considered various situations such as multi-modality, noisy data, federated learning (FL), interpretability analysis, and classifier calibration. The experimental results indicate that using DA with ResNet34 in a brain tumor (BT) data set results in an enhancement of 4.7\\% in model performance. Similarly, the use of DA can reduce the impact of Gaussian noise, as it provides $\\sim 3\\%$ accuracy increase using ResNet34 on a BT dataset. Furthermore, simply introducing DA into FL framework shows limited potential (e.g., $\\sim 0.3\\%$ increase in performance) for skin cancer classification. In addition, the DA method can improve the interpretability of the models using the gradcam++ technique, which offers clinical values. Calibration analysis also demonstrates that using DA provides a lower expected calibration error (ECE) value $\\sim 2\\%$ compared to CNN alone on a multi-modality dataset."

We introduce AgentAuditor, which replaces voting with a path search over a Reasoning Tree that explicitly represents agreements and divergences among agent traces. AgentAuditor resolves conflicts by comparing reasoning branches at critical divergence points, turning global adjudication into efficient, localized verification. We further propose Anti-Consensus Preference Optimization (ACPO), which trains the adjudicator on majority-failure cases and rewards evidence-based minority selections over popular errors. AgentAuditor is agnostic to MAS setting, and we find across 5 popular settings that it yields up to 5% absolute accuracy improvement over a majority vote, and up to 3% over using LLM-as-Judge."

    "abstract": "The absence of pre-hospital physiological data in standard clinical datasets fundamentally constrains the early prediction of stroke, as patients typically present only after stroke has occurred, leaving the predictive value of continuous monitoring signals such as photoplethysmography (PPG) unvalidated. In this work, we overcome this limitation by focusing on a rare but clinically critical cohort - patients who suffered stroke during hospitalization while already under continuous monitoring - thereby enabling the first large-scale analysis of pre-stroke PPG waveforms aligned to verified onset times. Using MIMIC-III and MC-MED, we develop an LLM-assisted data mining pipeline to extract precise in-hospital stroke onset timestamps from unstructured clinical notes, followed by physician validation, identifying 176 patients (MIMIC) and 158 patients (MC-MED) with high-quality synchronized pre-onset PPG data, respectively. We then extract hemodynamic features from PPG and employ a ResNet-1D model to predict impending stroke across multiple early-warning horizons. The model achieves F1-scores of 0.7956, 0.8759, and 0.9406 at 4, 5, and 6 hours prior to onset on MIMIC-III, and, without re-tuning, reaches 0.9256, 0.9595, and 0.9888 on MC-MED for the same horizons. These results provide the first empirical evidence from real-world clinical data that PPG contains predictive signatures of stroke several hours before onset, demonstrating that passively acquired physiological signals can support reliable early warning, supporting a shift from post-event stroke recognition to proactive, physiology-based surveillance that may materially improve patient outcomes in routine clinical care."

We propose Priority-Aware Shapley Value (PASV), which incorporates both hard precedence constraints and soft, contributor-specific priority weights. PASV is applicable to general precedence structures, recovers precedence-only and weight-only Shapley variants as special cases, and is uniquely characterized by natural axioms. We develop an efficient adjacent-swap Metropolis-Hastings sampler for scalable Monte Carlo estimation and analyze limiting regimes induced by extreme priority weights. Experiments on data valuation (MNIST/CIFAR10) and feature attribution (Census Income) demonstrate more structure-faithful allocations and a practical sensitivity analysis via our proposed \"priority sweeping\"."

However, due to factors such as delay in treatment, patient's non-compliance or existing co-morbid conditions, an injury can deteriorate and ultimately lead to patient hospitalization. In this paper, we propose a deep multi-modal method to predict the patient's risk of hospitalization. Our goal is to predict the risk confidently by collectively using the wound variables and wound images of the patient. Existing works in this domain have mainly focused on healing trajectories based on distinct wound types. We developed a transfer learning-based wound assessment solution, which can predict both wound variables from wound images and their healing trajectories, which is our primary contribution. We argue that the development of a novel model can help in early detection of the complexities in the wound, which might affect the healing process and also reduce the time spent by a clinician to diagnose the wound."

Restricting to systems built from \\emph{bistable} elements -- components admitting exactly two local states, such as the Necker cube's forward/backward orientations, a gear's clockwise/counterclockwise spin, or a rhombic tiling corner's convex/concave interpretation -- allows the use of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ coefficients throughout, reducing obstruction theory to parity arithmetic. This reveals a hierarchy of paradox classes from $H^0$ through $H^2$, refined at each degree by the relative/absolute distinction, ranging from ambiguity through impossibility to inaccessibility. A discrete Stokes theorem emerges as the central tool: at each degree, the connecting homomorphism of relative cohomology promotes boundary data to interior obstruction, providing the uniform mechanism by which paradoxes ascend the hierarchy. Three paradigmatic systems -- Necker cube fields, gear meshes, and rhombic tilings -- are studied in detail. Throughout, we pair cohomology with imagery and animation. To illuminate the underlying structure, we introduce the \\emph{Method of Monodromic Apertures}, an animation technique that reveals monodromy through a configuration space of local sections."

Our dataset analysis reveals that our collected interaction traces quantitatively confirm distinct interaction styles between SU and BLVU groups (mouse- vs. keyboard-dominant) and demonstrate interaction diversity within each group (sequential vs. shortcut navigation for BLVUs). We then compare collected traces to state-of-the-art CUAs under default and AT conditions (keyboard-only, magnifier). The default CUA executed 78.3% of tasks successfully. But with the AT conditions, CUA's performance dropped to 41.67% and 28.3% with keyboard-only and magnifier conditions respectively, and did not reflect nuances of real AT use.

This project aims to use Star Formation History (SFH) measurements from the Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) surveys MaNGA, CALIFA, and AMUSING++ processed with the Pipe3D analysis pipeline in order to select PSB galaxies as well as PSB regions in galaxies. Most PSB selection methods use cutoffs determined by spectral features, but in this work we introduce a new PSB selection method based directly on the property we are most interested in; inferred SFHs. IFS data allows us to probe a galaxy's star formation on a spatially resolved scale, enabling us to examine the size, shape, and location of PSB regions within a galaxy. We select 107 PSB galaxies, only 7 of which are among known PSBs selected by other methods. Unlike traditional PSB selection methods, our approach is not biased against Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Despite this, we still find no evidence for a significant Seyfert 2 PSB population, suggesting that strong AGN activity is uncommon throughout the PSB phase. Our spatially-resolved SFH selection identifies a wide range of galaxies, including globally quiescent elliptical galaxies with centrally-concentrated PSB spaxels, galaxies with ring-like PSB spaxels and a preference for inside-out age gradients (contrary to what has previously been observed in the literature), and galaxies with widespread PSB regions that have significant star formation elsewhere in the galaxy."

Depending on the geometry of the underlying equilibrium and on the selected Fourier mode, the bifurcation diagram exhibits either two or four solution branches. In all cases, the bifurcation is of pitchfork type; in symmetric configurations, the local structure near the equilibrium has a hyperbolic geometry. We further show that these locally constructed branches extend globally. This work extends the previous study by the same author of the purely electronic case, where the ions were modeled as an immobile neutralizing background. Allowing both species to evolve dynamically leads to a more intricate, higher-dimensional analysis. Finally, by means of an affine change of variables, we reveal a connection with the one-dimensional two-component Euler-Poisson system, which in turn enables the construction of traveling periodic waves of both small and large amplitude for that model as well."

We ask three questions: how extremist violence impacts community behaviour; whether news coverage of political entities predicts shifts in conversation dynamics; and whether linguistic diffusion occurs between mainstream and extremist spaces and across extremist ideologies. Methodologically, we combine counterfactual synthesis to estimate event-level impacts with vector autoregression and Granger causality analyses to model ongoing relationships among news signals, behavioural outcomes, and cross-community language change. Across analyses, our results indicate that Stormfront and r/News appear to be more reactive to external stimuli, while Incels demonstrates less cross-community linguistic influence and less responsiveness to news and violent events.

Current causal diffusion models entangle temporal reasoning with iterative denoising, applying causal attention across all layers, at every denoising step, and over the entire context. In this paper, we show that the causal reasoning in these models is separable from the multi-step denoising process. Through systematic probing of autoregressive video diffusers, we uncover two key regularities: (1) early layers produce highly similar features across denoising steps, indicating redundant computation along the diffusion trajectory; and (2) deeper layers exhibit sparse cross-frame attention and primarily perform intra-frame rendering. Motivated by these findings, we introduce Separable Causal Diffusion (SCD), a new architecture that explicitly decouples once-per-frame temporal reasoning, via a causal transformer encoder, from multi-step frame-wise rendering, via a lightweight diffusion decoder. Extensive experiments on both pretraining and post-training tasks across synthetic and real benchmarks show that SCD significantly improves throughput and per-frame latency while matching or surpassing the generation quality of strong causal diffusion baselines."

    "abstract": "We present 4RC, a unified feed-forward framework for 4D reconstruction from monocular videos. Unlike existing approaches that typically decouple motion from geometry or produce limited 4D attributes such as sparse trajectories or two-view scene flow, 4RC learns a holistic 4D representation that jointly captures dense scene geometry and motion dynamics. At its core, 4RC introduces a novel encode-once, query-anywhere and anytime paradigm: a transformer backbone encodes the entire video into a compact spatio-temporal latent space, from which a conditional decoder can efficiently query 3D geometry and motion for any query frame at any target timestamp. To facilitate learning, we represent per-view 4D attributes in a minimally factorized form by decomposing them into base geometry and time-dependent relative motion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 4RC outperforms prior and concurrent methods across a wide range of 4D reconstruction tasks."

    "abstract": "Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are thermonuclear runaways in certain white dwarfs in binary systems. They have been extensively studied, yet their progenitor and explosion mechanisms remain poorly understood. We study a large sample of SNe Ia comparing the narrow interstellar absorption features in their spectra with various photometric and spectroscopic supernova properties, as well as with environmental characteristics. We find that the sodium absorption is significantly stronger in younger, more star-forming and more centrally located SNe Ia, as expected. However, we also show that there is a strong dependence on intrinsic properties that is independent of the environment. In fact, we find strong evidence for two environmental SN Ia populations, an old and a young one, with the young population showing significantly different distributions of sodium strength when divided according to the Si II ejecta velocity, nebular velocity, extinction, E(B-V), and reddening curve, RV. Performing a clustering of the SNe Ia, we recover an old population of SNe with low extinction and normal ejecta velocity, while we confirm that the young population can be subdivided into a group of highly-extincted, high-velocity SNe Ia with much stronger blueshifted sodium absorption, and another of low-extincted, normal-velocity objects with little sodium absorption. We interpret this relation of intervening material with intrinsic properties as evidence for the young SN Ia population, occurring in young and star-forming environments, to have asymmetric radiation that interacts with nearby material, and whose observables depend thus on the viewing angle. Finally, we show that the cosmological mass-step is consistent with these populations."

Previous work motivated by the piezomagnetic properties of altermagnets has primarily focused on the spin magnetization response to applied strain. In this paper we study orbital piezomagnetic effects--the orbital magnetization response to applied strain--in minimal lattice models of pure insulating altermagnets in two dimensions. We obtain general microscopic expressions for the orbital magnetization in the presence of strain, as well as the orbital piezomagnetic polarizability, i.e., the defining response characteristic of pure altermagnets. We apply these expressions to three specific tetragonal lattice models, two corresponding to $d$-wave altermagnets and one describing a $g$-wave altermagnet. Whereas the $d$-wave altermagnets are associated with a linear piezomagnetic polarizability, the $g$-wave altermagnet exhibits a nonlinear piezomagnetic effect. Our analysis reveals how the polarizabilities are related to and determined by the Berry curvature of the occupied bands. Connections to materials of current interest are discussed."

Such features are traditionally used for test-time monitoring or steering. We present an alternative affordance: features as scalable supervision for open-ended tasks. We consider the case of hallucination-reduction as a desirable, yet open-ended behavior and design a reinforcement learning (RL) pipeline, titled RLFR (Reinforcement Learning from Feature Rewards), that uses features as reward functions. Grounded in a novel probing framework that identifies candidate hallucinated claims, our pipeline teaches a model to intervene and correct its completions when it is uncertain of their factuality. Furthermore, the pipeline enables scalable test-time compute, guided once more by our reward features. This end-to-end process operationalized on Gemma-3-12B-IT results in a policy that is 58% less likely to hallucinate compared to the original model, while preserving performance on standard benchmarks. Taken together, by grounding supervision in the language of features, this paper introduces a novel paradigm in the use of interpretability for learning open-ended tasks."

This constrains concatenation: two strings may only be concatenated if the end vertex of the first is equal to the start vertex of the second. We develop the beginnings of an automata theory for languages on graph alphabets. We show that they admit a Kleene theorem, relating rational and regular languages, and a Myhill-Nerode theorem, stating that languages are regular iff they have finite prefix or, equivalently, suffix quotient. We present determinization and minimization algorithms, but we also exhibit that regular languages are not stable by complementation.

Pose estimates can, e.g., be obtained from various combinations of lidar sensors, cameras, and external services such as GPS. Crucially, in safety-critical domains, a rough estimate is insufficient to formally determine safety, i.e., guaranteeing safety even in the worst-case scenario, and external services might additionally not be trustworthy. We address this problem by presenting a certified pose estimation in 3D solely from a camera image and a well-known target geometry. This is realized by formally bounding the pose, which is computed by leveraging recent results from reachability analysis and formal neural network verification. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach efficiently and accurately localizes agents in both synthetic and real-world experiments."

These MDS matrices are very important in cryptography and coding theory because they provide strong data protection and help spread information efficiently. In this paper, we introduce a new type of matrix called a \\emph{consta-$g$-circulant matrix}, which extends the idea of $g$-circulant matrices. These matrices come from a linear transformation defined by the polynomial $ h(x) = x^m - λ+ \\sum_{i=0}^{m-1} h_i x^i $ over $ \\mathbb{F}_q $. We find the upper bound of such matrices exist and give conditions to check when they are invertible. This helps us know when they are MDS matrices. If the polynomial $ x^m - λ$ factors as $ x^m - λ= \\prod_{i=1}^{t} f_i(x)^{e_i}, $ where each \\( f_i(x) \\) is irreducible, then the number of invertible consta-$g$-circulant matrices is $ N \\cdot \\prod_{i=1}^{t} \\left( q^{°f_i} - 1 \\right), $ where $r$ is the multiplicative order of $λ$, and \\( N \\) is the number of integers \\( k \\) such that $ 0 \\leq k < \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m - 1}{r} \\right\\rfloor + 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\gcd(1 + rk, m) = 1. $ This formula help us to reduce the number of cases to check whether such matrices is MDS. Moreover, we give complete characterization of $g$-circulant MDS matrices of order 3 and 4. Additionally, inspired by skew polynomial rings, we construct a new variant of $g$-circulant matrix. In the last, we provide some examples related to our findings."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to support question answering and decision-making in high-stakes, domain-specific settings such as natural hazard response and infrastructure planning, where effective answers must convey fine-grained, decision-critical details. However, existing evaluation frameworks for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and open-ended question answering primarily rely on surface-level similarity, factual consistency, or semantic relevance, and often fail to assess whether responses provide the specific information required for domain-sensitive decisions. To address this gap, we propose a multi-dimensional, reference-free evaluation framework that assesses LLM outputs along four complementary dimensions: specificity, robustness to paraphrasing and semantic perturbations, answer relevance, and context utilization. We introduce a curated dataset of 1,412 domain-specific question-answer pairs spanning 40 professional roles and seven natural hazard types to support systematic evaluation. We further conduct human evaluation to assess inter-annotator agreement and alignment between model outputs and human judgments, which highlights the inherent subjectivity of open-ended, domain-specific evaluation. Our results show that no single metric sufficiently captures answer quality in isolation and demonstrate the need for structured, multi-metric evaluation frameworks when deploying LLMs in high-stakes applications."

    "abstract": "Blood pressure regulation is commonly addressed in terms of local mechanisms such as vascular resistance, compliance and neurohumoral control. However, the human vasculature encompasses multiple quasi-closed flow loops under both physiological and pathological conditions. To test whether these loops could influence pressure dynamics beyond local control, we address the role of vascular topology in blood pressure regulation. Using one dimensional flow simulation models, we compared pressure dynamics in open vascular segments and closed vascular loops. We found that in open segments pressure fades away and remains spatially localized, whereas in closed loops pressure can keep circulating around the loop even if resistance in one spot is modified. Since parallel pathways within loops are dynamically coupled rather than independent, pressure changes in one place can affect the entire closed loop, allowing system level pressure patterns to emerge. Also, we assessed the temporal evolution of pressure fluctuations within closed vascular loops in normotensive and hypertensive parameter regimes, before and after loop breaking intervention. This topological approach helps clarifying why drugs or local interventions may fail to lower blood pressure in looped vascular architectures, providing a theoretical interpretation of some forms of resistant hypertension. Because disrupting a loop restores pressure relaxation, it may also help explain the disproportionate pressure changes observed after topology altering events like thrombosis, vascular surgery or embolization of arteriovenous malformations and shunts. Therefore, vascular topology can influence cardiovascular physiology by coupling local pressure flow relations to global constraints on blood pressure regulation, with physiological, pathological and clinical implications."

Participants attempt to infer a hidden target word, scored based on the semantic similarity of their guesses to the target, while also observing the best guess from previous players. We compare performance and outcome diversity across human-only, AI-only, and hybrid human-AI groups. Hybrid groups achieve the highest performance while preserving high diversity of guesses. Within hybrid groups, both humans and AI agents systematically adjust their strategies relative to single-agent conditions, suggesting higher-order interaction effects, whereby agents adapt to each other's presence. Although some performance benefits can be reproduced through collaboration between heterogeneous AI systems, human-AI collaboration remains superior, underscoring complementary roles in collective creativity."

We generalise Street's notion of split two-sided fibration internal to a 2-category to one internal to a sesquicategory. Given a sesquicategory we construct a virtual double category whose horizontal (loose) morphisms are its internal split two-sided fibrations. Specialising to the sesquicategory of lax natural transformations we obtain the virtual double category of split two-sided 2-fibrations, which we study in detail. We then restrict to the sub-virtual double category of locally discrete split two-sided 2-fibrations and show that therein the usual Yoneda 2-functors satisfy a double-categorical formal notion of Yoneda morphism, which formally captures universal properties similar to those satisfied by the morphisms comprising a Yoneda structure on a 2-category. As a consequence we obtain a 'two-sided Grothendieck correspondence' of locally discrete split two-sided 2-fibrations $A \\nrightarrow B$ and 2-functors $B \\to Cat^{A^{op}}$. Restricting to $A = 1$, the terminal 2-category, we improve Buckley and Lambert's 'Grothendieck correspondence' for locally discrete split op-2-fibrations by extending the sense in which it is functorial."

The model couples morphogen dynamics with tissue mechanics via a positive feedback loop: mechanical stretching enhances morphogen production, while morphogen concentration modulates tissue elasticity. Global strain conservation implements a nonlocal inhibitory effect, realizing a mechanochemical variant of the local activation--long-range inhibition mechanism. For exponential elasticity-morphogen coupling, the system admits a variational formulation. We prove existence of nonconstant steady states for small diffusion and uniqueness of the homogeneous state for large diffusion. Linear stability analysis shows that only unimodal patterns are stable, while multimodal solutions are unstable. Bifurcation analysis reveals subcritical and supercritical pitchforks, with fold bifurcations generating bistable regimes. Our results demonstrate that mechanochemical feedback provides a robust mechanism for single-peaked pattern formation without requiring a second diffusible inhibitor."

Maximum-entropy inference introduces a finite resolution scale in action, implying that sufficiently close action contributions are operationally indistinguishable. We show that this indistinguishability, together with probability normalization and action additivity, selects complex amplitudes and unitary evolution as the minimal continuous representation compatible with action additivity, probability normalization, and inference under finite resolution. Quantum interference and unitarity therefore emerge as consequences of these assumptions rather than independent postulates. From the resulting propagator, the Lagrangian, Hilbert-space structure, and Schrödinger equation follow as derived consequences. In the infinitesimal-time limit, action differences universally fall below the resolution scale, making coherent summation the minimal consistent description at every step. The numerical value of the action scale is fixed empirically and identified with $\\hbar$."

    "abstract": "Monitoring leftover products provides valuable insights that can be used to optimize future production. This is especially important for German bakeries because freshly baked goods have a very short shelf life. Automating this process can reduce labor costs, improve accuracy, and streamline operations. We propose automating this process using an object detection model to identify baked goods from images. However, the large diversity of German baked goods makes fully supervised training prohibitively expensive and limits scalability. Although open-vocabulary detectors (e.g., OWLv2, Grounding DINO) offer lexibility, we demonstrate that they are insufficient for our task. While motivated by bakeries, our work addresses the broader challenges of deploying computer vision in industries, where tasks are specialized and annotated datasets are scarce. We compile dataset splits with varying supervision levels, covering 19 classes of baked goods. We propose two training workflows to train an object detection model with limited supervision. First, we combine OWLv2 and Grounding DINO localization with image-level supervision to train the model in a weakly supervised manner. Second, we improve viewpoint robustness by fine-tuning on video frames annotated using Segment Anything 2 as a pseudo-label propagation model. Using these workflows, we train YOLOv11 for our detection task due to its favorable speed accuracy tradeoff. Relying solely on image-level supervision, the model achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.91. Finetuning with pseudo-labels raises model performance by 19.3% under non-ideal deployment conditions. Combining these workflows trains a model that surpasses our fully-supervised baseline model under non-ideal deployment conditions, despite relying only on image-level supervision."

However, existing manipulation datasets remain costly to curate, highly embodiment-specific, and insufficient in coverage and diversity, thereby hindering the generalization of VLA models. Recent approaches attempt to mitigate these limitations via a plan-then-execute paradigm, where high-level plans (e.g., subtasks, trace) are first generated and subsequently translated into low-level actions, but they critically rely on extra intermediate supervision, which is largely absent from existing datasets. To bridge this gap, we introduce the RoboInter Manipulation Suite, a unified resource including data, benchmarks, and models of intermediate representations for manipulation. It comprises RoboInter-Tool, a lightweight GUI that enables semi-automatic annotation of diverse representations, and RoboInter-Data, a large-scale dataset containing over 230k episodes across 571 diverse scenes, which provides dense per-frame annotations over more than 10 categories of intermediate representations, substantially exceeding prior work in scale and annotation quality. Building upon this foundation, RoboInter-VQA introduces 9 spatial and 20 temporal embodied VQA categories to systematically benchmark and enhance the embodied reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Meanwhile, RoboInter-VLA offers an integrated plan-then-execute framework, supporting modular and end-to-end VLA variants that bridge high-level planning with low-level execution via intermediate supervision.

    "abstract": "The circumnuclear star-forming ring of the barred spiral galaxy NGC 1097 provides a unique laboratory to study star formation under extreme conditions. This work aims to derive the physical properties of the circumnuclear star-forming regions (CNSFRs) using MUSE integral field spectroscopy observations. A total of 24 individual ionised HII are identified and analysed within its ring, which spans from $\\sim$385 pc to $\\sim$1.3 kpc. Despite the complex nuclear activity, all HII regions are found to be purely photoionised. Directly derived abundances reveal supersolar metallicities, with the highest one exceeding five times the solar value (12+log(S/H) = 7.875 $\\pm$ 0.353, T$_e$([SIII]) = 3912 $\\pm$ 567 K), and representing the highest abundance reported to date. In this high-metallicity regime, we find a break in the ionisation parameter-[SII]/[SIII] relation, which can be explained by changes in the ionisation structure and line emissivities, as confirmed by photoionisation models that successfully reproduce the observed emission-line ratios. Our results also indicate that the local gas supply regulates the star formation activity within the ring, with the young stars ionising 8 % of the total gas in the ring. Furthermore, our findings support a propagating starburst scenario, originating in the galaxy nucleus and extending towards the ends of the bar and into the circumnuclear ring through bar-driven shocks, this being consistent with the results of previous multi-wavelength studies. Finally, we likely detect optical signatures associated with one of the two known jets in this galaxy. This finding, together with the radio core emission previously found at sub-parsec scales, reflects the presence of feedback processes operating even on small galactic disc scales."

    "abstract": "Recent concurrent work by Dupré la Tour and Fujii and by Hollender, Manurangsi, Meka, and Suksompong [ITCS'26] introduced a generalization of classical discrepancy theory to non-additive functions, motivated by applications in fair division. As many classical techniques from discrepancy theory seem to fail in this setting, including linear algebraic methods like the Beck-Fiala Theorem [Discrete Appl. Math '81], it remains widely open whether comparable non-additive bounds can be achieved. Towards a better understanding of non-additive discrepancy, we study coverage functions in a sparse setting comparable to the classical Beck-Fiala Theorem. Our setting generalizes the additive Beck-Fiala setting, rank functions of partition matroids, and edge coverage in graphs. More precisely, assuming each of the $n$ items covers only $t$ elements across all functions, we prove a constructive discrepancy bound that is polynomial in $t$, the number of colors $k$, and $\\log n$."

The problem is not inadequate alignment or insufficient guardrails, it is architectural: autoregressive language models process all tokens uniformly, making deterministic command--data separation unattainable through training alone. We argue that deterministic, architectural enforcement, not probabilistic learned behavior, is a necessary condition for trustworthy AI-assisted science. We introduce the Trinity Defense Architecture, which enforces security through three mechanisms: action governance via a finite action calculus with reference-monitor enforcement, information-flow control via mandatory access labels preventing cross-scope leakage, and privilege separation isolating perception from execution. We show that without unforgeable provenance and deterministic mediation, the ``Lethal Trifecta'' (untrusted inputs, privileged data access, external action capability) turns authorization security into an exploit-discovery problem: training-based defenses may reduce empirical attack rates but cannot provide deterministic guarantees. The ML community must recognize that alignment is insufficient for authorization security, and that architectural mediation is required before agentic AI can be safely deployed in consequential scientific domains."

A key feature of our approach is that it bypasses any measurability requirement on solutions of the DPP, an assumption that is often difficult to verify and may even fail in relevant examples. We establish a comparison principle between classical strict supersolutions and viscosity subsolutions of the DPP, which yields stability results under minimal and natural hypotheses. As a consequence, we prove existence of viscosity solutions of the DPP and their convergence to viscosity solutions of a PDE that is consistent with the underlying approximation scheme. Moreover, we show that solutions of the limiting PDE admit an asymptotic expansion encoded by the approximation operator. Finally, we demonstrate that a broad class of local, nonlocal, and nonlinear partial differential equations fits into our framework, recovering known examples in the literature and completing gaps in the existing literature."

    "abstract": "Moiré superlattices in two-dimensional (2D) materials exhibit rich quantum phenomena, but ab initio modelling of these systems remains computationally prohibitive. Existing machine learning methods for accelerating density-functional theory (DFT) can target the prediction of different quantities and often rely on the locality assumption. Here we train a Gaussian process regression SALTED model exclusively on the electron densities of small displaced bilayer structures and then extrapolate electron density prediction to the large supercells required to describe small twist angles between these bilayers. We show the necessity of long-range descriptors to yield reliable band structures and electrostatic properties of large twisted bilayer structures, when these are derived from predicted densities. We demonstrate that the choice of descriptor determines the distribution of residual density errors, which in turn affects the downstream electronic properties. We apply our models to twisted bilayer graphene, hexagonal boron nitride, and transition metal dichalcogenides, focusing on the model's capacity to predict complex phenomena, including flat band formation, bandwidth narrowing, domain-wall electric fields, and spin-orbit coupling effects. Beyond moiré materials, this approach provides a general methodology for electronic structure prediction in large-scale systems with substantial long-range phenomena related to non-local geometric information."

However, in the initial retrieval stage, practitioners face an inherent tradeoff between embedding expressiveness and the scalability and latency of serving components, resulting in the need for representations that are both compact and expressive. To address this challenge, we propose a training strategy for learning high-dimensional sparse embedding layers in place of conventional dense ones, balancing efficiency, representational expressiveness, and interpretability. To demonstrate our approach, we modified the production-grade collaborative filtering autoencoder ELSA, achieving up to 10x reduction in embedding size with no loss of recommendation accuracy, and up to 100x reduction with only a 2.5% loss. Moreover, the active embedding dimensions reveal an interpretable inverted-index structure that segments items in a way directly aligned with the model's latent space, thereby enabling integration of segment-level recommendation functionality (e.g., 2D homepage layouts) within the candidate retrieval model itself.

Standard bipartite matchers, which rely on geometric proximity, struggle when lesions appear, disappear, merge, or split. We propose a registration-aware matcher based on unbalanced optimal transport (UOT) that accommodates unequal lesion mass and adapts priors to patient-level tumor-load changes. Our transport cost blends (i) size-normalized geometry, (ii) local registration trust from the deformation-field Jacobian, and (iii) optional patch-level appearance consistency. The resulting transport plan is sparsified by relative pruning, yielding one-to-one matches as well as new, disappearing, merging, and splitting lesions without retraining or heuristic rules. On longitudinal CT data, our approach achieves consistently higher edge-detection precision and recall, improved lesion-state recall, and superior lesion-graph component F1 scores versus distance-only baselines."

We train linear probes on pre-generation activations to predict policy-specific success on math and coding tasks, substantially outperforming surface features such as question length and TF-IDF. Using E2H-AMC, which provides both human and model performance on identical problems, we show that models encode a model-specific notion of difficulty that is distinct from human difficulty, and that this distinction increases with extended reasoning. Leveraging these probes, we demonstrate that routing queries across a pool of models can exceed the best-performing model whilst reducing inference cost by up to 70\\% on MATH, showing that internal representations enable practical efficiency gains even when they diverge from human intuitions about difficulty.

While these phenomena are well-described by continuum hydrodynamics, a microscopic framework connecting them to their topological origins has remained elusive. Here, we present a lattice model for an isotropic chiral random walk that bridges the gap between classical stochastic diffusion and unitary quantum evolution. By equipping the walker with an internal degree of freedom and a tunable chirality parameter, $p$, we interpolate between a standard diffusive random walk and a deterministic, topologically non-trivial quantum walk. We show that the topological protection characteristic of the unitary limit ($p=1$) remarkably persists into the dissipative regime ($p<1$). This correspondence allows us to theoretically ground the robustness of edge flows in classical chiral systems using the bulk-boundary correspondence of Floquet topological insulators. Our results provide a discrete microscopic description for odd diffusion, offering a powerful toolkit to predict transport in confined geometries and disordered chiral media."

In 2024 a major effort to improve the far-ultraviolet (FUV) geometric distortion, delta-geometric, and walk corrections was completed. Those three corrections occur early in the CalCOS workflow and shift photon events into the corrected reference frame ((XCORR, YCORR) coordinate system) in which subsequent calibration steps-and their reference files-are defined.

By analogy with a Van der Waals equation of state, the empirically deduced critical temperature and pressure permit to draw a schematic picture of the underlying nuclear potential. More detailed approaches to the liquid-gas transition using self-consistent nuclear Hartree-Fock and variational calculations are described. Critical exponents are reported. Then chiral effective field theory, as the low-energy realization of QCD, is discussed in the context of nuclear thermodynamics. Its implications for the liquid-gas transition in symmetric nuclear matter as well as in neutron-rich matter are reviewed."

    "abstract": "Population size estimation from capture-recapture data is central for studying hard-to-reach populations, incorporating auxiliary covariates to account for heterogeneous capture probabilities and recapture dependencies. However, missing attributes pose a critical methodological challenge due to reluctance to share sensitive information, data collection limitations, and imperfect record linkage. Existing approaches either ignore missingness or rely on a priori imputation, potentially introducing substantial bias. In this work, we develop a novel nonparametric estimation framework using a Missing at Random assumption to identify capture probabilities under missing covariates. Using semiparametric efficiency theory, we construct one-step estimators that combine efficiency, robustness, and finite-sample validity: they approximately achieve the nonparametric efficiency bound, accommodate flexible machine learning methods through a doubly robust structure, and provide approximately valid inference for any sample size. Simulations demonstrate substantial improvements over naive imputation approaches, with our doubly robust ML estimators maintaining valid inference even at high missingness rates where competing methods fail. We apply our methodology to re-estimate mortality in the Gaza Strip from October 7, 2023, to June 30, 2024, using three-list capture-recapture data with missing demographic information. Our approach yields more conservative yet precise estimates compared to previous methods, indicating the true death toll exceeds official statistics by approximately 26%. Our framework provides practitioners with principled tools for handling incomplete data in conflict settings and other applications with hard-to-reach populations."

Analyzing data collected through an anonymous survey of CMMC-certified assessors and lead assessors, this exploratory study investigates whether inconsistencies in evidence sampling practices exist within the CMMC assessment ecosystem and evaluates the need for a risk-informed standardized sampling methodology. Across 17 usable survey responses, results indicate that evidence sampling practices are predominantly driven by assessor judgment, perceived risk, and environmental complexity rather than formalized standards, with formal statistical sampling models rarely referenced. Participants frequently reported inconsistencies across assessments and expressed broad support for the development of standardized guidance, while generally opposing rigid percentage-based requirements. The findings support the conclusion that the absence of a uniform evidence sampling framework introduces variability that may affect assessment reliability and confidence in certification outcomes. Recommendations are provided to inform future CMMC assessment methodology development and further empirical research."

We study the effect of LLM routing with respect to user behavior. We propose a game between an LLM provider with two models (standard and reasoning) and a user who can re-prompt or abandon tasks if the routed model cannot solve them. The user's goal is to maximize their utility minus the delay from using the model, while the provider minimizes the cost of servicing the user. We solve this Stackelberg game by fully characterizing the user best response and simplifying the provider problem. We observe that in nearly all cases, the optimal routing policy involves a static policy with no cascading that depends on the expected utility of the models to the user. Furthermore, we reveal a misalignment gap between the provider-optimal and user-preferred routes when the user's and provider's rankings of the models with respect to utility and cost differ. Finally, we demonstrate conditions for extreme misalignment where providers are incentivized to throttle the latency of the models to minimize their costs, consequently depressing user utility. The results yield simple threshold rules for single-provider, single-user interactions and clarify when routing, cascading, and throttling help or harm."

Specifically, we demonstrate that the resulting bipartite entanglement originates from the coherent conversion of local quantum coherence -- initially present in each subsystem -- into shared non-local correlations. We derive exact, analytical complementarity relations quantifying this conversion, link the decay of local coherence directly to the growth of entanglement, and support these findings with numerical simulations. Our results clarify the underlying mechanism and establish gravity as a coherence-to-entanglement conversion channel, offering a refined interpretive basis for forthcoming experimental tests. Crucially, we show that initial coherence is a necessary condition for entanglement generation and that its degree bounds the maximum achievable entanglement, with maximal entanglement requiring initial maximal coherence."

This behavior -- typical of quantum Anderson or many-body localized systems -- is observed here also in a clean classical glassy Hamiltonian system. We argue that this phenomenon might imply strong robustness to the effect of ergodic inclusions for the nonergodic behavior in the charge-quantized regime."

    "abstract": "Recent observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) 2024, combined with CMB and SNIa data, indicate a preference for a dynamical dark energy equation of state that crosses the phantom divide ($w < -1$). This finding challenges the standard $Λ$CDM model and minimally coupled scalar field scenarios, including the original Running Curvaton model, which is typically constrained to the quintessence regime. In this work, we propose a unified cosmological framework by extending the Running Curvaton model via a non-minimal gravitational coupling of the form $ξχ^2 R$. We demonstrate that this geometric modification allows the effective equation of state to naturally evolve from a quintessence-like to a phantom-like regime in the Jordan frame, thereby providing a superior fit to the DESI observational contours ($w_0 > -1, w_a < 0$). Crucially, we show that the introduction of non-minimal coupling does not compromise the model's success in describing the early universe. Through a parameter re-tuning mechanism involving the coupling constant ($g_0^{obs} = g_0 + 2ξ$), the predictions for the primordial power spectrum (spectral index $n_s$) and local-type non-Gaussianity ($f_{NL}$) remain strictly preserved and consistent with Planck data. Furthermore, we perform a comprehensive stability analysis within the Horndeski framework, verifying that the model remains free from ghost and gradient instabilities ($c_s^2 = 1$). Our results suggest that the non-minimally coupled Running Curvaton offers a robust, stable, and unified description of inflation and late-time accelerated expansion compatible with the latest precision cosmology data."

To address this challenge, a conceptual design is presented for a novel high-granularity crystal electromagnetic calorimeter that combines the superior intrinsic energy resolution of a homogeneous calorimeter with the fine segmentation required for particle-flow reconstruction. The crystal electromagnetic calorimeter design is based on orthogonally arranged long scintillating crystal bars read out by silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) at both ends.

Critical technical considerations, including crystal choices, photosensors, electronics, mechanical support, and radiation damage, are discussed. A dedicated digitisation framework was developed to realistically model effects from the crystal, SiPMs, and readout electronics. The performance of a single calorimeter module was evaluated using simulated electron showers.

    "abstract": "The flow field generated by a swimming bacterium serves as a fundamental building block for understanding hydrodynamic interactions between bacteria. Although the flow field generated by a force dipole (stresslet) well captures the fluid motion in the far field limit, the stresslet description does not work in the near-field limit, which can be important in microswimmer interactions. Here we propose the model combining an anisotropically regularized stresslet with an isotropically regularized source dipole, and it nicely reproduces the flow field around a swimming bacterium, which is validated by the experimental measurements of the flow field around \\textit{E. coli} and our boundary-element-method simulations of a helical microswimmer, in both cases of the free space and the confined space with a no-slip wall. This work provides a practical tool for obtaining the flow field of the bacterium, and can be utilised to study the collective responses of bacteria in dense suspensions."

So far, it has not been explored how various techniques for creating Behavior Tree (BT) program representations could be combined with complete graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to allow a human user to validate and edit trees suggested by automated methods. In this paper, we introduce BEhavior TRee GUI (BETR-GUI) for creating BTs with the help of an AI assistant that combines methods using large language models, planning, genetic programming, and Bayesian optimization with a drag-and-drop editor. A user study with 60 participants shows that by combining different assistive methods, BETR-GUI enables users to perform better at solving the robot programming tasks. The results also show that humans using the full variant of BETR-GUI perform better than the AI assistant running on its own."

    "abstract": "How can children acquire native-level syntax from limited input? According to the Poverty of the Stimulus Hypothesis (PoSH), the linguistic input children receive is insufficient to explain certain generalizations that are robustly learned; innate linguistic constraints, many have argued, are thus necessary to explain language learning. Neural language models, which lack such language-specific constraints in their design, offer a computational test of this longstanding (but controversial) claim. We introduce \\poshbench, a training-and-evaluation suite targeting question formation, islands to movement, and other English phenomena at the center of the PoSH arguments. Training Transformer models on 10--50M words of developmentally plausible text, we find indications of generalization on all phenomena even without direct positive evidence -- yet neural models remain less data-efficient and their generalizations are weaker than those of children. We further enhance our models with three recently proposed cognitively motivated inductive biases. We find these biases improve general syntactic competence but not \\poshbench performance. Our findings challenge the claim that innate syntax is the only possible route to generalization, while suggesting that human-like data efficiency requires inductive biases beyond those tested here."

Our self-supervised models adapt to input operators using coarse spectral information (e.g., eigenvalue estimates and residual norms), and they predict recurrence coefficients for computing or applying a matrix polynomial tailored to a downstream task. The effectiveness of AutoSpec relies on three ingredients: an architecture whose inference pass implements short, executable numerical linear algebra recurrences; efficient training on small synthetic problems with transfer to large-scale real-world operators; and task-defined objectives that enforce the desired approximation or preconditioning behavior across the range of spectral profiles represented in the training set. We apply AutoSpec to discovering algorithms for representative numerical linear algebra tasks: accelerating matrix-function approximation; accelerating sparse linear solvers; and spectral filtering/preconditioning for eigenvalue computations. On real-world matrices, the learned procedures deliver orders-of-magnitude improvements in accuracy and/or reductions in iteration count, relative to basic baselines. We also find clear connections to classical theory: the induced polynomials often exhibit near-equiripple, near-minimax behavior characteristic of Chebyshev polynomials."

For this purpose, quantum state tomography provides a standard framework for reconstructing quantum states from measurement data, yet it is often degraded by experimental noise. Mitigating such noise is therefore essential for the accurate estimation of the states in realistic settings. In this work, we propose a scalable tomography method based on multilayer perceptron networks that mitigate unknown noise through supervised learning. This approach is data-driven and thus does not rely on explicit assumptions about the noise model or measurement, making it readily extendable to general quantum systems. Numerical simulations, ranging from special pure states to random mixed states, demonstrate that the proposed method effectively mitigates noise across a broad range of scenarios, compared with the case without mitigation."

    "abstract": "Precise and reliable trajectory planning of mobile robots remains a fundamental challenge due to distance-dependent gain sensitivity, dynamic constraints, and nonlinearities in real environments. Conventional kinematic controllers and fixed-reference distance ANN approaches often degrade in performance when initial conditions (initial position and posture) vary, resulting in excessive travel time or violations of velocity and angular velocity limits. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a Distance Normalization Factor–based Artificial Neural Network (DNF-ANN) trajectory-planning controller that generalizes quasi-optimal control gains across arbitrary initial positions and postures. In particular, the proposed controller aims to compute quasi-optimal gains immediately at the start of motion while satisfying physical velocity and angular-velocity constraints. The method introduces a distance normalization factor to transform gains optimized at a reference distance(ρ<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ref</sub>), combined with a nonlinear compensation scheme to prevent angular velocity constraint violations. A genetic algorithm generates optimal gain datasets, which an ANN learns for real-time inference before the robot starts moving. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DNF-ANN strictly satisfies dynamic constraints and achieves benchmark-level performance comparable to GA re-optimization under identical initial conditions, with only a 0.26 s average difference in travel time. These findings confirm that the proposed controller ensures stable and quasi-optimal operation under diverse initial conditions. The DNF-ANN framework is suitable for mobile robot applications that require near-real-time gain computation during the pre-departure planning stage, such as logistics, service robotics, and industrial automation."

    "abstract": "With the widespread application of high-voltage power cables in urban power grids, the fire risk associated with these cables poses an increasing threat to the safe operation of power systems. Pyrolysis gases emitted from the cable’s outer sheath serve as critical indicators of early-stage thermal anomalies, acting as diagnostic signals rather than direct ignition sources. To investigate the gas generation characteristics for fault diagnosis and to develop a robust early warning method, this study conducted pyrolysis experiments on polyethylene (PE) outer sheaths across a temperature range of 90–250 °C. An optimized Random Forest (RF) early-warning model was established, underpinned by multi-dimensional feature engineering and the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to address data imbalance. Experimental results reveal that the pyrolysis products primarily consist of alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, CO, and CO2, exhibiting distinct non-linear trends with increasing temperature. Based on these characteristics, the cable condition was categorized into three warning levels: Attention, Alert, and Alarm. The proposed RF-based model achieved a mean stratified 5-fold cross-validation accuracy of 92.28%, with an independent test accuracy of 93.75%, demonstrating superior stability and generalization capability compared with Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression (LR) classifiers. This study provides a reliable, data-driven strategy for identifying incipient thermal faults and preventing fire accidents in high-voltage power cables."

    "abstract": "This article presents a novel semi-open resonator design based on a pair of evanescent waveguides (EWs) and a dielectric material under test (MUT) for high-sensitivity material structural health monitoring. Compared to conventional microwave resonant cavities, the electric field energy is primarily concentrated within the dielectric material at the resonant frequency, which significantly enhances the interaction between the electromagnetic field and the dielectric. Minor variations in dielectric properties caused by local defects will induce measurable shifts in the resonant frequency. Another distinctive feature of the designed resonant cavity is its semi-open architecture, where the dielectric material is not placed inside a rectangular waveguide but is positioned between two mirror-symmetric open-ended waveguides. This design enables the resonator to achieve scanning detection for larger-area MUTs. To mitigate electromagnetic leakage and enhance the quality factor of the resonator, a parallel plate waveguide (PPW) is incorporated at the open ends of the evanescent waveguides. To demonstrate the detecting ability, an extensive investigation of the sensitivity to local defects inside the material is presented. Two different dielectric materials, including F4B and ceramic samples, are tested using a prototype device. The experimental results demonstrated frequency shifts of 11 MHz at 4.32 GHz and 10 MHz at 3.65 GHz for subwavelength defects with diameters and thicknesses less than 2 mm. Compared to conventional microwave-based sensors, our proposed method offers advantages in detecting minute defects within relatively thick materials at lower operating frequencies."

We propose RA-SafeRL, a Risk-Aware SafeRL framework that improves learning without compromising safety. RA-SafeRL uses a digital twin environment to safely explore high-risk actions and learn from them, applies adaptive fallback penalties reflecting action severity to distinguish risk levels, and reuses fallback trajectories via off-policy learning, converting previously discarded data into useful signals. Experiments show RA-SafeRL outperforms baseline SafeRL by improving task performance by over 30%, reducing fallback frequency by more than 10%, and shortening recovery time by 38%, enhancing safety, efficiency, and robustness in safety-critical IoT applications."

The ETTIS algorithm effectively mitigates the Hamming distance shrinkage problem commonly observed in traditional probabilistic shaping algorithms and exhibits excellent compatibility, allowing seamless integration with standard forward error correction coding and interleaving algorithms. Moreover, the ETTIS framework utilizes predefined symbol components in the shaping templates to implicitly introduce pilot symbols, enabling real-time estimation of channel gain and noise variance without additional bandwidth overhead.. Experimental and simulation results show that, at the same bit rate, the proposed scheme achieves 0.4–0.6 dB performance gains under 16-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and 64-QAM modulation formats, respectively. Compared with other state-ofthe- art algorithms, ETTIS attains comparable performance while maintaining significantly lower complexity. During decoding, the absolute deviation of the estimated noise bit error rate remains below 0.75%. These features make ETTIS a promising solution for high-throughput and cost-sensitive optical interconnect systems."

The model jointly optimizes economic cost, carbon emissions, and freshness retention while enforcing time windows, routing feasibility, and capacity constraints across multiple time periods. To tackle the problem’s combinatorial complexity, a customized Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) metaheuristic is proposed to ensure scalability and near-optimal performance across large-scale instances. Computational experiments based on well-known benchmark scenarios demonstrate that the proposed model achieves global optimality for small- and medium-scale problems, while the ALNS delivers near-optimal solutions within a gap of 1–2% from the optimal and significantly reduces computation time. Ablation studies confirm the essential role of cold-storage hubs in maintaining feasibility and highlight the operational value of time-dependent travel modeling for realistic urban traffic. The proposed model offers decision-makers valuable guidance for achieving sustainable and resilient e-grocery delivery operations in the presence of perishability and stochastic variability."

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional radiative transfer models (3D RTMs) are indispensable for understanding how radiation propagates within vegetation canopies and for interpreting remote sensing signals. Yet their practical deployment is hindered by the difficulty of acquiring the detailed 3D structural parameters they require. Airborne laser scanning (ALS) offers a powerful means of retrieving such information at landscape scales. Here, we quantitatively assess how ALS-derived 3-D forest reconstructions influence bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) simulations. Using three benchmark RAMI scenes that span contrasting canopy architectures, we generated synthetic ALS point clouds and reconstructed each scene via alphashape, voxel, and ellipsoid representations. The resulting 3D scenes were then input to the LargE-Scale remote Sensing data and image simulation (LESS) model to evaluate the structural contribution to simulated canopy reflectance and to quantify the associated uncertainties. Results demonstrate that at a 10-meter resolution, all three representation methods yielded favorable results, especially in the summer birch forest, where the alphashape approach achieves the highest coefficient of determination <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R</i><sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> (0.94) and the lowest mean relative absolute error δ (3.5%) for NIR band. Generally, both the alphashape and voxel approaches outperformed the ellipsoid approach in representing canopies for reflectance simulation, with the alphashape method being comparable with the voxel approach. Furthermore, varying alpha values used for fitting the crowns showed that <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R</i><sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> and δ exhibit a consistent pattern and are minimally affected by alpha values, whereas the voxel approach shows greater sensitivity to voxel dimensions.

The proposed architecture employs a constant-slope capacitor digital-to-analog converter (CDAC) based digital-to-time converter (DTC) to narrow the effective range of the time-to-digital converter (TDC), thereby enabling high-resolution phase detection without requiring a wide dynamic range. A feedforward spur cancellation filter suppresses residual fractional errors caused by DTC gain error and nonlinearity. In addition, an asynchronous duty-modulation unit (DMU) dithers the LSB of digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) to reduce DCO quantization noise, distribute it across finer time segments and lower the integrated RMS jitter. Fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS process, the prototype ADPLL consumes 6.92 mW in steady-state operation, achieving 0.73 ps integrated RMS jitter and –71.6 dBc worst-case fractional spur. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining snapshot-based phase detection, feedforward spur cancellation, and asynchronous pulse-width dithering of DCO."

These healthcare data with composite properties can be represented by high-order tensors, which enables the application of tensor multi-way analytics to uncover the latent features in data. However, existing tensor decomposition techniques often face challenges of limited interpretability and weak robustness, which constrain their application in the healthcare industry. To mitigate these challenges, this paper introduces a novel Bayesian Tensor Interpolative Decomposition (BTID) model, which is an extension of the concept of matrix interpolative decomposition and is designed to efficiently and interpretably analyze multi-way tensors. The proposed model performs low-rank approximation using a subset of the original data and employs the Bayesian learning approach to infer the weight matrices, thereby ensuring theoretical interpretability. Additionally, a hierarchical prior is incorporated within this model to address the complexities of the data and enhance model robustness. Finally, a clustering-driven strategy is developed to construct the skeleton matrix, ensuring its physical interpretability while facilitating the CP rank estimation. The BTID model has been comprehensively evaluated on synthetic and healthcare datasets, where the experimental outcomes confirm its superior accuracy, robustness, and interpretability compared with traditional tensor decomposition methods."

    "abstract": "To allow a good signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) over a wide bandwidth for signals arriving from an unknown angle, many optical wireless communication (OWC) systems need a wide-aperture high-bandwidth detector. However, the physical properties of a photodiode (PD) challenge the design for high bandwidth and a large detection area, simultaneously. This problem is also known as the bandwidth versus area trade-off of an amplified PD receiver. In this paper, we study the limitations of a single-PD OWC receiver on throughput, particularly on bandwidth, photon capturing area, and electrical noise, to formulate a model that evaluates and optimizes the throughput of a communication link for different signal modulation schemes. We optimize the signal power spectral density (PSD) of pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM) and of DC-biased optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (DCO-OFDM) modulation for throughput, considering that large modulation bandwidths suffer disproportionally from noise enhancement in typical receiver amplifiers. This worsens if large PDs are used, but we show that to a large extent, the corresponding stronger signal can compensate for the increased noise. We study the optimum detector size, in combination with adaptations of the spectrum and, in particular, the maximum frequency of the modulation. While the limitations of photonic emitters have been extensively studied before, this is one of the first papers that models how the receiver limits the throughput of PAM and OFDM."

Under 416 nm excitation, all three clusters exhibited strong, single broad-spectrum emission. Owing to their small size and high surface area, the GSH‑AuNCs displayed high catalytic activity for the reduction of 4‑nitrophenol (4‑NP). A combined experimental and density functional theory (DFT) study revealed that the size‑dependent activity originates from differences in the adsorption energy of the reaction product, providing a mechanistic structure‑activity relationship. Furthermore, based on the specific Hg–Au metallophilic interaction, the GSH‑AuNCs served as a sensitive fluorescent sensor for selective mercury ion (Hg<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2+</sup>) detection.

However, conventional PKI-based authentication methods face limitations such as high query latency, privacy leakage risks, and centralized trust dependencies, making them unsuitable for large-scale, real-time metaverse services. To address these challenges, we propose ESAChain, a novel blockchain-based authentication framework that e nsures lightweight, decentralized, and privacy-preserving identity verification. Specifically, we propose a Mutually Exclusive Cuckoo Filter (MECF) integrated with a Filter Hash Chain (FHC), which provides lightweight data structures and efficient querying capabilities for certificate status. Furthermore, we design a trust-decay-based Delegated Proof-of-Stake (TD-DPoS) consensus mechanism to maintain the integrity and reliability of certificate status data by dynamically adjusting node trust values and decaying votes to prevent single-node dominance. We also incorporate a blind-signature-based authentication mechanism to enhance privacy-preserving identity authentication by preventing tracking of certificate verification requests. Extensive simulation experiments and security analyses demonstrate that ESAChain significantly reduces query latency and data transmission overhead, enhances consensus robustness, and provides an efficient, trustworthy, and privacy-preserving authentication solution for secure metaverse services."

    "abstract": "Electroencephalography (EEG) data are pivotal in brain–computer interfaces (BCIs), yet their utility is hindered by data scarcity arising from high acquisition costs, noise susceptibility, and privacy constraints. Traditional augmentation methods, such as noise injection and signal transformations, often fail to preserve task-relevant structure in multichannel EEG, while deep generative models may suffer from mode collapse or produce physiologically inconsistent samples. To address these limitations, we propose a Riemannian Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (RC-GAN) that enforces geometric consistency during signal generation. RC-GAN leverages the manifold of symmetric positive definite (SPD) covariance matrices to regularize synthetic EEG trials according to covariance-based representations widely used in BCI decoding. Evaluated on the BNCI 2014-001 motor imagery dataset, the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art augmentation techniques, achieving a 12.0% improvement in classification accuracy. Qualitative and quantitative analyses demonstrate that RC-GAN generates diverse and realistic EEG samples while enhancing robustness across different augmentation levels. These results highlight the benefit of incorporating Riemannian structure into generative models for EEG augmentation and provide a principled framework for improving the reliability of BCI systems."

For this purpose, we propose a novel model termed Meta Guided-Graph Lightweight TimesNet (MGGLTN) to accurately capture the spatio-temporal correlations within traffic flow data, thereby providing precise traffic flow predictions for Connected Vehicles (CVs). Our spatio-temporal information learning architecture features an encoder-decoder backbone, wherein both the encoder and decoder comprise graph convolutional networks coupled with lightweight Times modules. More importantly, we propose a meta guided-graph library, aimed at providing memory queries for time-varying traffic patterns based on real-world physical spatial information. It efficiently guides the initialization direction of meta guided-graph prototypes, thereby accelerating the convergence speed of model training. Moreover, we introduce depthwise separable convolutions to replace the computationally intensive multi-kernel convolutions in the Times modules, thus significantly reducing computational costs and model parameters while maintaining accuracy. We perform extensive experiments on three public benchmark datasets (i.e., METR-LA, PEMS-BAY, and EXPY-TKY) and conduct comprehensive performance evaluations compared to both baseline models and state-of-the-art models. The findings demonstrate the superior performance of our model across all three datasets of varying spatial scales, highlighting the potential of this model to provide precise traffic guidance for CVs."

Firstly, an error reconstruction mechanism based on adjustable convergence rate is proposed. This mechanism dynamically adjusts the convergence characteristics of the QUAV system, ensuring that the position and attitude tracking errors strictly converge to the prescribed accuracy range before the preset time threshold. Secondly, the disturbance observer is adopted to estimate unknown disturbances and additive faults, thereby reducing the impact of unknown variables on the stability of the system model. Afterwards, an adaptive fault-tolerant control (FTC) strategy is designed. It compensates for the multiplicative faults of the actuator online through the parameter adaptive law, and actively offsets additive faults by combining them with the output of the disturbance observer. This approach forms a composite FTC architecture. Finally, numerical simulation results show that the proposed control scheme can ensure the accurate convergence of the position and attitude system within prescribed-time under multiple actuator faults and unknown external disturbances. This verifies the effectiveness and robustness of the control strategy."

Comparative analyses with established methods, including ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and singular value decomposition (SVD), indicate that the proposed approach mitigates mode mixing and truncation order uncertainty and yields higher detection quality and improved localization while providing superior adaptability and a low computational cost compatible with near real-time clinical application.

Existing methods leverage KG structure to disambiguate queries but user often cannot describe their query conditions clearly. To address these challenges, we propose user intent-aware query reasoning (UiQR) over KG, by incorporating user generated data (UGD) to identify user intent. Specifically, we first propose the weighting function to evaluate entity relatedness implied in UGD and prove its submodularity theoretically. Accordingly, we propose a greedy algorithm to efficiently filter optimal candidates and present a variational Bayesian method to reason query paths. Finally, we rank answer entities upon the reasoned paths that are most similar to the query embedding. Extensive experiments on three common datasets show that our UiQR significantly improves the accuracy of query reasoning over KG."

Specifically, the FAN-based learner encodes temporal feature by capturing multiple periodic patterns associated with underwater acoustic targets. In parallel, the MoEN-based learner models spectral dependencies and emphasizes spectral-selective patterns. The AFF dynamically then balance the contributions of the dual-branch learners through an adaptive weighting mechanism. The proposed algorithm achieves 98.58% accuracy on ShipsEar dataset, outperforming six state-of-the-art methods with moderate model parameters and computational cost."

This paper proposes a vision-based framework that maps SLZs in dynamic scenes, characterized by both object and drone motions, by integrating several functionalities for visual analysis of the UAV surrounding scenes. Static scene analysis is achieved through context-aware segmentation which divides the UAV-acquired images into thematic classes enabling to identify suitable landing surfaces (e.g., roads, grass).For dynamic content analysis, we combine object detection, tracking, and trajectory prediction to determine object occupancy and identify regions free of obstacles. Trajectory prediction is performed through a novel encoder-decoder architecture taking past object positions to predict the most likely future locations. To ensure stable and robust trajectory prediction, we introduce an optimized homography computation using multi-scale image analysis and cumulative updates to compensate UAV motion. We tested our framework on different operational scenarios, including urban and natural scenes with moving objects like vehicles and pedestrians. Obtained results demonstrate its strong performance, and its significant potential for enabling autonomous and safe UAV navigation."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel dual event-driven hierarchical control architecture to achieve fully distributed practical prescribed-time consensus (Pd-TC) tracking for uncertain multi-agent systems (MASs). Firstly, a distributed estimate layer is established to reconstruct the leader’s states, guaranteeing practical prescribed-time convergence of estimation errors independent of global information. The proposed communication-triggered event-triggered mechanism (ETM) eliminates continuous communication among neighboring followers, effectively reducing communication resource consumption. Then, utilizing the estimated information, a local control layer is designed to realize practical Pd-TC tracking for uncertain MASs, where the control-update ETM reduces unnecessary control updates to conserve limited control resources, and adaptive gains eliminate the dependence on the bounds of disturbances and uncertain inherent parameters. Furthermore, a rigorous analysis confirms the exclusion of Zeno behavior in both communication-triggered and control-update ETMs. Finally, the proposed control architecture is applied to multiple ground vehicles, validating the theoretical findings."

    "abstract": "We present ZeroBot, a real2sim framework for learning a robot manipulation task from scratch in minutes under challenging conditions: zero human demonstrations, zero policy pre-training, and zero known object models. Given only a single view of an object and a goal pose for that object, ZeroBot uses image-to-3D generative models to obtain a complete object mesh, which is used in simulation for large-scale parallel reinforcement learning. To accelerate training, we introduce an action space which leverages the generated geometry and learned value function to sample states involving robot-object contact. When evaluated on real-world tasks including grasping, pushing, articulated object interaction, and multi-stage manipulation, ZeroBot achieves an 87% success rate with an average training time of 119 seconds. These results show the value of using image-to-3D models in a real2sim framework for rapid, autonomous robot learning.

    "abstract": "Stress detection is a widely studied field due to its significant implications for mental and physical health. While multimodal approaches show promising results, they present challenges related to hardware constraints and computational requirements that limits real time implementation in wearable devices. We propose a hybrid methodology combining feature extraction with ma chine learning (ML) for stress detection, using exclusively single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) signals from which heart rate variability (HRV) and respiratory signals with their derived features are extracted. We evaluated our approach using the ES3 project database, testing various feature combinations with the XGBoost model. Results demonstrate that incorporating ECG-derived respiratory features significantly improves classification accuracy and computational efficiency compared to traditional HRV-based approaches and deep learning models. Feature importance analysis identified a reduced set of key features, resulting in a more efficient model with superior performance and substantially lower inference times than deep learning models. These findings support the feasibility of acute stress detection using a single-lead ECG-based multimodal approach that combines feature extraction with ML techniques, providing insights into stress-induced physiological responses and contributing to more accessible biomedical monitoring strategies."

This article introduces LowCapChain (LCC), a lightweight PBC designed for manufacturing nodes, such as programmable logic controllers, robotic arms, and smart sensors. LCC integrates Merkle ledger compression, elliptic-curve cryptography-based proof-of-membership, and delegated fault-tolerant consensus to enable secure operations without full ledger replication. Implemented in a robotic metal stamping facility using Raspberry Pi edge nodes, LCC achieves 964 transactions per second with 108 ms consensus latency and memory usage below 55 MB. Compared with Hyperledger Fabric, LCC reduces mean consensus latency by 61% and cryptographic overhead by up to 81%. Compared with Quorum, the reductions are 54% and 76%, respectively. Scalability tests confirmed near-linear throughput growth across 10–200 nodes, and fault tolerance experiments verified block finalization under validator failure. These findings establish LCC as an efficient architecture for embedded industrial systems, offering a pathway toward scalable Industry 4.0 adoption with energy savings inferred from reduced CPU cycles rather than directly measured power."

    "abstract": "A novel near-field wideband integrated sensing and communication framework is proposed to address the prohibitively high pilot overhead challenge in extremely large-scale MIMO systems. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on exhaustive two-dimensional codebook search, a unified architecture leveraging true-time-delay-based rainbow beamforming with controllable distance-dependent beam squint is proposed to extend spatial coverage. Furthermore, the inter-antenna phase ambiguity is harnessed to introduce beam split phenomena, enabling simultaneous multi-angle and multi-distance sensing within a single pilot transmission. Based on this architecture, a two-stage low-complexity sensing protocol is carried out, where distance-ring identification via beam-split-enhanced rainbow beams is performed in the first stage using sub-array structures, followed by angle refinement in the second stage. To mitigate frequency-dependent beamwidth variations, a frequency-compensated joint reconstruction algorithm based on virtual grid mapping and sparse optimization is proposed. Additionally, an echo-aided velocity estimation method exploiting intra-symbol Doppler diversity across subcarriers is developed, eliminating the need for multiple pulse transmissions. Simulation results demonstrate that: 1) complete spatial coverage is achieved with only two OFDM symbols, representing over 98% overhead reduction compared to exhaustive search methods; 2) the proposed scheme achieves superior localization accuracy with root-mean-square errors below 0.001 in normalized angle domain and 0.01 in distance-ring domain at moderate SNR; 3) communication rates are improved by 7% to 15% compared to conventional near-field beam training approaches under identical pilot budgets."

To address these challenges, this paper studies distributed transceiver design and access point (AP) duplex mode selection under edge distributed unit (EDU)-level information constraints and per- AP power limitations. We develop a partial distributed block coordinate descent (PDBCD) algorithm that decomposes the original sum-rate maximization into three tractable subproblems and iteratively approximates MMSE performance. The proposed design fully leverages EDU computing resources, reducing the computation load at the cloud computing unit (CCU), and significantly lowering fronthaul signaling overhead through an adaptive inter-EDU information sharing mechanism. Furthermore, by integrating a low-complexity greedy search for duplex mode assignment, the algorithm effectively mitigates cross-link interference (CLI) in NA-FD systems. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme improves spectral efficiency compared with conventional duplex mode, and centralized/distributed MMSE baselines, while maintaining strong scalability under practical deployment constraints."

    "abstract": "Accurate global navigation satellite system (GNSS) positioning in urban canyon environments is severely challenged by non-line-of-sight (NLOS) errors caused by signal blockage and multipath propagation. This paper proposes a novel GNSS localization framework that integrates three-dimensional (3D) light detection and ranging (LiDAR) perception with virtual grid-based differential correction to improve positioning performance for both multi-sensor receivers (core nodes) and surrounding low-cost GNSS devices (base nodes). First, an NLOS identification method is developed by combining LiDAR-based ray tracing with pseudorange innovation clustering, enabling reliable detection of mid- and high-elevation NLOS satellites. Then, a satellite selection strategy based on dilution of precision (DOP) optimization is proposed to balance NLOS error compensation and satellite geometry preservation. For cooperative localization, a dynamic virtual grid is constructed around the core node, and pseudorange observations are simulated to generate spatially correlated reference points, allowing base nodes to perform single-differenced positioning relative to the core node. Experimental results on the UrbanNav dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves GNSS positioning accuracy and stability for the core node in complex urban scenarios. Meanwhile, it enhances the localization performance of nearby low-cost terminals through real-time environmental information sharing."

    "abstract": "Navigating socially in human environments requires more than satisfying geometric constraints, as collision-free paths may still interfere with ongoing activities or conflict with social norms. Addressing this challenge calls for analyzing interactions between agents and incorporating common-sense reasoning into planning. This paper presents a social robot navigation framework that integrates geometric planning with contextual social reasoning. The system first extracts obstacles and human dynamics to generate geometrically feasible candidate paths, then leverages a fine-tuned vision-language model (VLM) to evaluate these paths, informed by contextually grounded social expectations, selecting a socially optimized path for the controller. This task-specific VLM distills social reasoning from large foundation models into a smaller and efficient model, allowing the framework to perform real-time adaptation in diverse human-robot interaction contexts. Experiments in four social navigation contexts demonstrate that our method achieves the best overall performance with the lowest personal space violation duration, the minimal pedestrian-facing time, and no social zone intrusions.

To overcome these limitations, this study presents a high-precision capacitance-to-digital conversion circuit. The circuit adopts a continuous-time switched-capacitor architecture and incorporates a calibration module to suppress leakage current effects and improve conversion accuracy. Simulation results indicate that the effects of leakage currents and circuit mismatches are suppressed to approximately 24% of their original level by the proposed design. Experimental validation further confirms that the circuit extends the measurement range below 0.1 torr, maintaining a correlation coefficient of 0.999, improved repeatability, and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.024 torr under constant pressure. These results improve both the accuracy and stability of MEMS CDG and lay a robust foundation for their deployment in high-precision vacuum measurement."

    "abstract": "The tightly coupled GNSS/SINS integration technique has been widely adopted in navigation applications, offering reliable positioning and attitude determination in GNSS-challenged environments. However, further improving its performance, particularly in complex and low-dynamic scenarios where system observability is limited, remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose a novel rotating-antenna approach that actively enhances spatial observability by introducing autonomous antenna motion to modulate the observation geometry. Specifically, the GNSS antenna is driven to perform controlled motions during vehicle maneuvers, introducing relative motion with respect to the navigation frame. This dynamic motion enables the system to emulate the spatial diversity benefits of multi-antenna configurations while using only a single antenna. The resulting improvements in system observability under low-dynamic conditions are further analyzed within the Piece-Wise Constant System framework. The experimental results demonstrate that, compared to conventional fixed-antenna configurations, the proposed method yields improved yaw estimation accuracy, achieving a 38.2% reduction in RMS error. Furthermore, the rotating antenna demonstrates greater robustness, exhibiting slower error divergence and faster re-convergence under challenging conditions such as degraded GNSS signal quality, large initial alignment errors, and GNSS outages. Additionally, the study confirms that accuracy gains are attainable even at low rotation rates. This work provides a promising and cost-effective solution for achieving reliable high-precision attitude determination in challenging operational environments."

    "abstract": "Inspired by the Fleming-Viot stochastic process, we propose a parallel implementation with restart of variational quantum algorithms, with the aim of reducing the time spent by the algorithm in barren plateaus where the optimization direction is unclear. In the Fleming-Viot tradition, parallel searches are called particles. In the proposed approach, the search by a Fleming-Viot particle is stopped when it encounters a region where the gradient is too small or noisy, suggesting a barren plateau area. The stopped particle continues the search after being restarted at another location in the parameter space, potentially taking the exploration away from barren plateaus. We first analyze the behavior of the Fleming-Viot particles from a theoretical standpoint. We show that, when simulated annealing optimization algorithms are used to drive the particles dynamics, the Fleming-Viot system is expected to find the global optimum faster than a single simulated annealing instance. Furthermore, the relative efficiency increases proportionally to the percentage of barren plateaus in the domain. This result is corroborated by numerical experiments carried out on non-convex 2-dimensional synthetic problems, as well as on quantum approximated Max-Cut instances, both in a lower 2-dimensional and a higher 16-dimensional problem. The experiments show that our method tends to perform better than vanilla and parallel simulated annealing when large barren plateaus are present in the domain, especially in the higher-dimensional problem where barrenness tends to be more important."

The system uses smart contracts to automatically incentivize and monitor nodes, rewarding or penalizing them to boost long-term availability. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that this system achieves an optimal Load Balance Factor (LBF) of nearly 1.00 and maintains high storage reliability. It is noteworthy that, even in environments with up to 90% malicious nodes performing tampering or denial-of-service attacks, the file availability of this system remains at least 30%, which is up to 5.7 times higher than that of other distributed storage algorithms."

Consequently, the impacts of blockage spatial correlation, induced by the physical dimensions (e.g., height, width, and thickness) on satellite link performance remain poorly understood. In this paper, we propose a novel three-dimensional (3D) cascade blockage structure and a functional framework to tackle this issue. Under the virtual satellite association strategy, two iterative functional equations in both azimuth and elevation domains are proposed to evaluate coverage performance in 3D correlated environments. For the real satellite association, a location index matrix is introduced to determine the serving node with minimum elevation angle in the orbital sphere. Then, a set of iterative functional equations are proposed to derive the association and coverage probabilities. Numerical simulations validate our analytical framework and quantify the impact of spatial correlation on coverage performance. This study provides guidelines for deploying future dense LEO constellations in correlated blockage environments for both satellite-only and hybrid networks."

    "abstract": "Through-the-earth (TTE) communication provides a practical solution for data transmission in environments with substantial electromagnetic shielding. However, the alignment of the receiving electrodes relative to the signal propagation direction has a significant impact on the strength of the received signal. Furthermore, the power-frequency interference signal, emanating from the power system, can significantly degrade the quality of reception, potentially obscuring the desired signal entirely. To address these issues, this paper proposes a ground electrode array receiving system designed to optimize the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). The system first utilizes an orthogonal “L”-shaped ground electrode array to perform preliminary detection of both the ground current signal and the power-frequency interference signal, while approximately determining their respective propagation directions. Subsequently, a semicircular array, consisting of multiple “L”-shaped electrode groups, is employed for precise identification of the signal propagation direction. An optimization problem is formulated based on the SINR to select the optimal receiving channel, thereby ensuring the best possible signal reception. The experimental results show that, compared to the conventional dual-electrode configuration with a single channel, the proposed system significantly improves the SINR of the received signal, demonstrating superior anti-interference performance."

A novel resilient distributed observer is developed to simultaneously reconstruct both the state and system matrix of the leader using only local neighbor information without requiring global knowledge of the leader’s dynamics or communication topology as in existing methods. Furthermore, a disturbance-rejection synchronization controller is designed based on the internal model principle and a saturation-compensating auxiliary system. In contrast to conventional strategies that rely on constant-bound disturbance assumptions and lack explicit saturation compensation, the proposed controller achieves online disturbance cancellation without prior knowledge of disturbance characteristics such as frequency, amplitude, and phase, while explicitly handling input saturation. The proposed control strategy could significantly improve tracking accuracy, robustness, and practicality in marine environments. Theoretical analysis and simulations validate the merits and performance of the proposed approach."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a unified framework for continual learning in Audio-Visual Question Answering (AVQACL), designed to enhance fine-grained scene understanding and spatio-temporal reasoning in dynamic multimodal task environments. To simulate realistic incremental learning scenarios, we construct two large-scale benchmark datasets, Split-AVQA and Split-MUSIC-AVQA, by reorganizing existing AVQA corpora into sequential tasks. Empirical results show that conventional models suffer from severe performance degradation and catastrophic forgetting when learning across audio, visual, and textual modalities in a continual setup. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that integrates four key modules: (1) Question-Guided Cross-modal Information Fusion (QCIF), which dynamically extracts task-relevant multimodal features via question-aware attention; (2) Task-specific Knowledge Distillation with Spatial-Temporal Feature Constraints (TKD-STFC), which preserves semantic output behavior and internal reasoning trajectories across tasks; (3) Question Semantic Consistency Constraint (QSCC), which regularizes evolving question representations to maintain linguistic stability. (4) Dual-Strategy Exemplar Selection (DSES), a memory-efficient replay strategy that jointly maximizes sample informativeness and diversity. All components are theoretically grounded, and formal analysis is provided to ensure modality alignment, spatial-temporal coherence, and exemplar selection reliability. Extensive experiments on both datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art AVQACL baselines in terms of accuracy, retention, and robustness."

    "abstract": "High voltage bushings are critical insulation components in power equipment, directly affecting the safe and stable operation of power systems. Partial discharge (PD) is a primary indicator of insulation degradation in bushings, but existing PD detection and assessment methods face severe limitations: (1) heavy dependence on large amounts of labeled data that cannot cover rare fault scenarios; (2) limited generalization across diverse equipment conditions; (3) lack of adaptive severity grading, relying on fixed thresholds that cannot reflect actual degradation processes. These limitations hinder timely identification of critical insulation states. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a PD anomaly detection and severity assessment method based on self-supervised adversarial encoder network and Gaussian mixture model (GMM). Unlike standard autoencoders that over-generalize, the Transformer-based adversarial encoder with dual competing decoders creates sharper anomaly boundaries, enabling high-sensitivity detection of weak PD signals without labeled data. A GMM with composite clustering evaluation automatically determines optimal severity levels by capturing the natural multimodal distribution of PD anomaly scores, where different degradation stages form distinct Gaussian components. Transparent bushing experiments establish quantitative mapping between anomaly scores and observable physical phenomena (gas generation, thermal decomposition), providing interpretable diagnostic criteria. Experimental results demonstrate effective PD detection across developmental stages, automatic severity identification, and quantitative condition assessment. Particularly when approaching critical states, the method captures significant anomaly score changes, enabling timely risk warnings. Compared with existing methods, this approach achieves high-precision detection without labeled data while providing adaptive severity assessment, offering significant practical value."

    "abstract": "Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite systems empowered by intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) offer new opportunities for seamless Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity, but they face two major challenges: rapidly varying channels caused by satellite mobility and the structural mismatch between the cascaded base station (BS)-IRS-user equipment (UE) channel and the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)-based codebook specified by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). To address these issues, we propose a channel feedback and beamforming framework that decouples the cascaded channel into BS-IRS and IRS-UE components. The BS-IRS link, though fast-changing, follows predictable and periodic satellite trajectories, enabling statistical modeling from ephemeris data. In contrast, the IRS-UE link varies slowly and is typically dominated by a single angular path, which can be effectively represented using the DFT-based codebook. Leveraging this property, we apply sparse recovery to extract directional features, quantize them, and feed them back in a manner compliant with 3GPP standards. This design enables robust IRS beamforming aligned with the dominant UE-side channel direction. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively mitigates channel aging and codebook mismatch, leading to stable beam patterns and improved reliability over conventional methods."

Currently, most studies fail to simultaneously account for both internal and external uncertainties, which limits the improvement in the estimation accuracy under multiple operation conditions. In this study, an autonomous sensorless control strategy of FP-PMSM considering operation uncertainties with dual control for exploration and exploitation (DCEE) is innovatively developed. First, an <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>-dimensional <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">q</i>-axis inductance estimator is designed to quantify and mitigate the external uncertainty from varying operation conditions, which can overcome limitations of traditional parameter identification. Additionally, a new objective function is established to generate optimal sliding-mode gains under varying operation conditions, which can reduce the internal uncertainty of sensorless control system. Therefore, by selecting sliding-mode gain autonomously according to varying operation conditions, internal and external uncertainties can be effectively decreased, which can improve sensorless control accuracy. Finally, effective improvement in sensorless control accuracy of FP-PMSM under varying operation conditions is verified through experiments."

    "abstract": "The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) has the largest area of permafrost terrain in the mid- and low-latitude regions of the world. Under the combined influence of global change and human activities, the permafrost on the QTP is undergoing widespread degradation, which will not only have significant impacts on the global environment and carbon cycle, but also result in permafrost-related geohazards. Surface deformation resulting from the freeze-thaw process is an important characteristic of permafrost, and predicting it is of great significance for understanding the development of permafrost. However, intrinsic complexity and multifactorial environmental controls limit the accuracy and generalizability of existing prediction models. In this paper, based on the deformation results from the InSAR technique, an integrated algorithm for permafrost deformation prediction is proposed. The algorithm combines wavelet multi-resolution analysis and a Multi-Resolution Cross-Attention (MRCA)-Transformer model, in which both periodic and non-periodic deformation features, together with environmental variables such as soil moisture and temperature, are incorporated through a multi-head cross-attention mechanism for spatiotemporal prediction. The proposed model is trained and evaluated using the InSAR time series deformation derived from 2017-2024 Sentinel-1A data over the QTP permafrost region. The model achieves an average root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 4.97 mm, an average mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.22 mm, with standard deviations of 3.21 mm and 2.89 mm, respectively. The square of the correlation coefficient and the coefficient of determination are both greater than 0.99 across all time steps. Moreover, the results show that the model demonstrates effective performance across a variety of terrains and observational conditions without additional training. This study provides significant scientific insights and practical value for the monitoring of permafrost evolution, environmental assessment, and early warning of geohazards."

In such settings, UAV trajectory and power control are naturally modeled as continuous variables, while communication resource allocation is typically discrete. However, existing methods for handling hybrid actions often ignore the interdependencies between discrete and continuous components, thereby limiting cooperative decision-making capabilities for ICAC among UAVs. To overcome this limitation, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm based on hybrid action representation (MAHyAR) to solve the dynamic optimization problem, which maintains an equilibrium between fair communication and UAVs’ energy consumption. Furthermore, we innovatively construct a hybrid action representation space to characterize the intrinsic dependencies between discrete and continuous actions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves an 11% increase in fair throughput and conserves energy consumption by up to 33%, compared to the baseline method."

Additionally, TCAD simulations of the carrier mobility-lifetime product were conducted to illustrate the high-temperature effect on the charge collection efficiency in the 30 μm depletion region of the SiC npn detector, which is essential for the effective collection of high-energy X-ray photons.

Nevertheless, the centralized storage and management of such preferences encounter significant interoperability challenges across different domains. By combining on-chain and off-chain storage paradigms, hybrid-storage blockchains have developed into a reliable infrastructure. Their value lies not only in ensuring secure data storage, but also in providing a practical foundation for data governance, especially in complex and cross-domain environments. In this paper, we propose LiveIndex, an index-driven hybrid-storage blockchain framework for cross-domain data governance. First, we design an on-chain data index based on distributed chameleon hash (DCH) to enable efficient off-chain data governance. This index incorporates essential elements, including metadata tags, data addresses, privacy ciphertexts, and group signatures. Second, we employ asymmetric searchable encryption (ASE) to protect privacy by converting analysis policies into search trapdoors and embedding privacy attributes into ciphertexts, thereby supporting compliant and secure data analysis. Third, we integrate proxy re-encryption (PRE) to strengthen control over cross-domain data, using re-encryption keys to ensure secure data authorization. Finally, we implement and evaluate LiveIndex on public datasets. The results show time overheads ranging from milliseconds to microseconds, demonstrating the practicality and efficiency in real-world scenarios."

Purely manual teleoperation is prone to operator fatigue and error, while fully autonomous systems often lack the robustness and adaptability to handle. Here, we propose a human–machine shared cascade control method for magnetically driven microrobots, which effectively integrates human cognitive intelligence with machine autonomy for collision-free navigation in dynamic environments. The outer-loop hybrid shared control unit smoothly modulates control authority in response to real-time collision risk, dynamically integrating the operator instructions and the autonomous navigation system output guided by the enhanced artificial potential field method to formulate the guidance law. For the inner-loop motion tracking, a data-driven adaptive orientation controller is designed, which integrates a nonlinear feedforward compensator leveraging a Gaussian process regression (GPR) model with a linear feedback controller whose parameters are optimized using the virtual reference feedback tuning (VRFT) method, ensuring fast and precise tracking of the desired motion. The effectiveness of the proposed method was validated through both simulation and physical experiments. In human-subject studies conducted on a physical magnetic actuation platform featuring both static and dynamic obstacle scenarios, quantitative results demonstrate that the shared control strategy significantly outperforms both purely manual and fully autonomous modes across all key metrics, including success rate, task completion time, stability, and safety (<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$p \\lt 0.001$</tex-math> </inline-formula>).

Due to the intensive computational demands of running TGP, GPU acceleration is crucial for achieving scalable performance. However, efficient GPU-based execution of TGP remains challenging, primarily due to three core issues: (1) the structural heterogeneity of program individuals, (2) the complexity of integrating multiple levels of parallelism, and (3) the incompatibility between high-performance CUDA execution and flexible Python-based environments. To address these issues, we propose EvoGP, a high-performance framework tailored for GPU acceleration of TGP via population-level parallel execution. First, EvoGP introduces a tensorized representation that encodes variable-sized trees into fixed-shape, memory-aligned arrays, enabling uniform memory access and parallel computation across diverse individuals. Second, EvoGP adopts an adaptive parallelism strategy that dynamically combines intra- and inter-individual parallelism based on dataset size, ensuring high GPU utilization across a broad spectrum of tasks. Third, EvoGP embeds custom CUDA kernels into the PyTorch runtime, achieving seamless integration with Python-based environments such as Gym, MuJoCo, Brax, and Genesis. Experimental results demonstrate that EvoGP achieves a peak throughput exceeding 10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">11</sup> GPops/s. Specifically, this performance represents a speedup of up to 304× over existing GPU-based TGP implementations and 18× over state-of-the-art CPU-based libraries. Furthermore, EvoGP maintains comparable accuracy and exhibits improved scalability across large population sizes. EvoGP is open source and accessible at https://github.com/EMI-Group/evogp."

    "abstract": "As an important and widely studied research topic, the detection of fresh milk plays a crucial role in protecting consumer health. However, due to the diversity of milk brands and environmental conditions in real-world application scenarios, the accuracy of existing detection models often drops significantly when applied to new domains. A significant amount of new data needs to be gathered in order to retrain the model for new domain, which greatly increases both time and labor costs. To tackle this problem, this paper introduces a transfer learning-based cross-domain milk freshness detection method. The method uses transfer learning to generate data for unknown categories within the target domain. Specifically, the transfer generation model trains on data from both the target and source domain categories. With the proposed model, data from other categories in the source domain can be utilized to generate corresponding target domain data. This method comprehensively considers data generation from multiple perspectives of time, frequency, and spatial, to enhance the authenticity of the generated data. It uses a transfer generation architecture, consisting of a transfer network and a decoder, to learn the mapping relationship between the source and target domain, helping to narrow the gap between domains. Additionally, a feature subspace decomposition method is introduced into the decoder, and a cross-domain consistency loss function is formulated to strengthen the model’s learning capability. The proposed method is shown to generate high-quality data for unknown target-domain categories in multiple cross-domain settings, leading to a performance improvement ranging from 17.64% to 32.44% in the detection of cross-domain milk freshness."

    "abstract": "Crop diseases pose a significant threat to agricultural productivity and global food security. Timely and accurate detection of such diseases is crucial for improving both crop yield and quality. While numerous deep learning approaches rely solely on image data for disease identification, they often overlook the complementary value of multi-scale feature extraction in enhancing visual analysis. To address this limitation and effectively capture hierarchical representations across different scales, we propose a Multi-Scale Feature Extraction Framework for Image-Text Fusion (MSF-ITF) that simultaneously processes both modalities through parallel convolutional branches with varying receptive fields. Our approach utilizes an image encoder to extract foundational visual representations, followed by four parallel convolutional branches (1×1, 3×3, 5×5, 7×7) to capture multi-scale visual information. For text processing, we employ established pipeline using GLM-4V-Plus to generate hierarchical textual descriptions and BLIP2 encoder for feature extraction, then apply multi-scale 1D convolutions to capture semantic patterns at different contextual ranges. Subsequently, a cross-attention module aligns and fuses the multi-scale features from both modalities. Extensive evaluations on Soybean Disease, AI Challenge 2018, and PlantVillage datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing single-scale and image-based models in terms of accuracy. Specifically, our model achieves recognition accuracies of 99.14%, 87.90%, and 99.24% on respective datasets, while maintaining computational efficiency through lightweight design. These results highlight the effectiveness of multi-scale learning in integrating hierarchical visual and textual cues for accurate and efficient disease recognition, offering a scalable solution for crop disease diagnosis."

Deep neural networks have recently produced encouraging performance of automated lesion identification with PET imaging. However, most methods require a predefined region/volume of interest (ROI/VOI) or rely on a multi-stage, cascaded modeling pipeline, which often leads to low efficiency and/or high variability. In this paper, we propose a novel single-stage PET lesion detection method that does not need precomputed ROIs/VOIs, cascaded models or multimodal data. Methods: We introduce a novel three-dimensional dual-decoder neural network, which contains a cross-decoder attention module to take as input gating signals from an auxiliary organ segmentation decoder and suppress irrelevant feature responses in the primary decoder of lesion detection. Additionally, we design and insert a new patchwise contrastive learning module into the primary decoder to enhance the network's discriminative power for lesions with varying volumes and shapes.

The proposed consensus tracking control framework synergistically combines model reference adaptive control (MRAC) and super-twisting terminal sliding mode control (ST-TSMC), applied to a partially unknown CP-MAS, to enable cyber-resiliency with minimal tracking error and improved chattering performance. Due to stealthy deception attacks on sensor measurements, the states of follower agents are compromised. Thus, to minimize the conservativeness in realizing the proposed cyber-resilient control framework, a radial basis function neural network (RBF-NN)-assisted state observer has been formulated to estimate the uncompromised states of CP-MAS. Using graph theory and the Lyapunov argument, online adaptation laws have been derived that guarantee the boundedness of all signals and finite-time global asymptotic stability of consensus errors. Numerical simulations have been conducted on a group of four single-link robot manipulator agents subjected to hybrid cyberattacks. The presented qualitative and quantitative assessment demonstrates the proficiency and cyber-resiliency of the proposed hybrid control framework over MRAC, ST-SMC, and other reported methodologies in the face of unknown malicious attacks."

Most of the existing solutions are based on GPUs or ASICs, whose fixed hardware architecture has limited low-latency capabilities when dealing with varying request rates in random dynamic scenarios. The dynamic reconfigurability of Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) can enable the hardware architecture to adapt in accordance with fluctuating request rates. Therefore, this study proposes a Request-Rate-Aware Multi-DNN accelerator framework (RRAM) based on FPGA, thereby improving latency performance. The RRAM includes a reconfigurable, computation-memory-interleaved multi-core accelerator architecture, a dynamic bandwidth adaptor for stable data transfers, and a performance analytic model for random request scenarios that enables an end-to-end latency evaluation. To efficiently explore the design space, a workload-aware resource boundary search strategy is also introduced, which eliminates a majority of invalid solutions. Implemented on the U250 platform, RRAM achieves better Service-Level Agreement (SLA) satisfaction rates compared to the fixed-architecture baseline accelerators under varying request rates, and improves the Average Normalized Turnaround Time (ANTT) by 1.3x to 6.1x. Furthermore, the average power consumption of RRAM is only 22.8% and 44.9% of the GPUs of RTX3090 and A100, while the latency is improved by up to 18.2x and 4.6x."

Current methods for foggy conditions rely on generic image enhancement without considering the physics-based correlation between fog distribution and terrain elevation. This paper presents PHENet, a physics-guided height-enhanced network that leverages the intrinsic correlation between atmospheric scattering and terrain elevation for robust change detection under foggy conditions. The proposed approach introduces three synergistic components: (1) Height-Aware Mixture Fusion module that leverages frequency-domain decomposition for elevation-conditioned spatial feature enhancement, selectively suppressing fog-related artifacts while preserving structural details; (2) Height-Enhanced Difference (HED)-Augmented Difference Fusion Module that incorporates height-derived change indicators invariant to atmospheric variations, significantly reducing false positives from weather-induced spectral changes; and (3) Physics-Guided Adversarial Refinement Module that enforces consistency with atmospheric scattering principles during training without requiring paired clear-foggy data. Comprehensive experiments on foggy variants of WHU-CD and LEVIR-CD datasets demonstrate that PHENet achieves superior performance across all fog densities. Furthermore, the proposed method maintains a compact architecture with 5.24M parameters, demonstrating that physics-informed design can deliver robust performance without excessive model complexity.

    "abstract": "In addition to securely handling objects, grippers endowed with a sense of touch are desirable for handling delicate objects. Force sensors can be mounted distally at the fingertips, but a simpler option is to estimate fingertip forces from motor current at the base. This approach, which is not new, reduces wire routing and recesses electronics away from the sensed surface for operation in wet environments. However, for such a strategy to work, the actuating motor must have no or low gearing, which increases its transparency to external torques, but greatly limits its own torque output. Therein lies a trade-off. In addition to gearing, the transmission ratio from motor to fingertip is also defined by the gripper linkage itself. In this work, the trade-off is overcome by introducing a linkage capable of reconfiguring without the need of an extra actuator. Reconfiguration is performed by moving across an output singularity to select between a mode which is biased for force sensing (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">sense mode</i>) and a mode which is biased for force production (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">grip mode</i>). These novel kinematics are embodied as a mostly monolithic compliant mechanism, leaving just one traditional pin joint in the entire gripper assembly. Experiments show that force mode exhibits 3.1× more force output, and sense mode can measure 2.6× smaller forces. Corollary to the latter, sense mode is ideal for estimating the stiffness of objects, including small fruits with stiffness lower than 150 N/m. As an illustration, we demonstrate the usage of sense mode to estimate the ripeness of small fruits, followed by a transition to force mode in order to pluck the fruit.

The PPSR overcomes this by implementing two primary solutions. First, an analog CID-restoring feedback loop is integrated to actively secure a stable vertical margin even under long-term CID sequences. Second, the PPSR exploits the non-ideal low-pass filter (LPF) characteristic of the sample-and-hold (S&H) circuits. By intentionally adjusting the time constant (τSH), a robust horizontal margin is achieved. Fabricated in 28 nm CMOS, the RX achieves a data rate of 20 Gb/s/pin while compensating –15 dB channel loss.

To address the above challenges, in this paper we set up cascaded ORISs in a typical long-distance free space optcis (FSO) scenario and conduct a detailed analysis of their channels and performance. This system employs cascaded ORISs to extend ORIS coverage and expand the overall scale of the FSO system, thereby enabling the FSO link to evolve from a traditional point-to-point configuration to a broader, spatially distributed communication layout. The physical model of multiple ORISs’ cascades and the effect on their communication performance are analyzed in detail. Meanwhile, the closed-form expressions of the bit error rate (BER) and outage probability of the multi-hop cascaded ORISs-assisted FSO system are derived and verified by simulations. Based on the theoretical results and simulation results, the influence of each parameter on the system performance is carefully analyzed, which provides guidance for the design of the actual system."

    "abstract": "Surface emissivity is directional, for homogeneous surfaces, increasing View Zenith Angle (VZA) reduces surface emissivity while simultaneously extending the atmospheric path length. This combined effect changes the radiance detected by satellite sensors. In this study, simulation experiments were initially conducted, revealing that as the VZA increases, the decrease in emissivity retrieved by Temperature and Emissivity Separation (TES) algorithm is less pronounced than the actual decrease in surface emissivity. Concurrently, the retrieved Land Surface Temperature (LST) also decreases. Subsequently, two sites were selected in the Sahara Desert and the Taklamakan Desert. Using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) radiance product (MYD21KM) and the TES-derived temperature and emissivity product (MYD21), the impact of VZA on TES-derived surface temperature and emissivity products was analyzed. Additionally, longwave radiation data and broadband emissivity were employed to calculate surface temperature. Based on this analysis, a ratio correction method was proposed to convert satellite-observed thermal infrared radiance to nadir radiance, taking desert regions as a case study. The results demonstrated that for MODIS band 29 (8.55 μm), when VZA = 48.5°, the bias improved from −1.49 to 0.64, and from −2.05 to 0.84, while the corresponding RMSE decreased from 1.51 to 0.89, and from 2.08 to 1.17 (10⁻⁷ W·cm⁻²·sr⁻¹·cm⁻¹) for Top-Of-Atmosphere (TOA) and Bottom-Of-Atmosphere (BOA) radiance, respectively. When VZA = 35.2°, the bias improved from −0.32 to 0.12, and from −0.14 to 0.15, and the RMSE decreased from 0.72 to 0.69, and from 0.95 to 0.90 (10⁻⁷ W·cm⁻²·sr⁻¹·cm⁻¹) for TOA and BOA radiance, respectively. The method proves to be more suitable when VZA > 40°."

    "abstract": "The continuous real-time estimation of gait phase is a critical element for achieving natural synchronization between the user and the powered prosthesis. Traditional phase variable methods based on the unilateral thigh angle and its derivative or integral exhibit inherent limitations in nonlevel terrains (e.g., inclines and stairs), mainly attributed to the unequal positive and negative part area of single-leg angle curves and the phase shift between these curves and the standard cosine function. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a synchronized orthogonal gait phase estimation method based on inter-thigh angle. Based on the symmetry inherent in the synergistic locomotion of two legs, this study uses the inter-thigh angle as a phase variable candidate, whose intrinsic symmetry compensation mechanism directly eliminates the limitation of unequal positive and negative part area of the single-leg angle curve. By further implementing a zero-crossing-aligned gait cycle partitioning strategy, the proposed framework effectively overcomes the phase shift problem prevalent in conventional methods. Additionally, this study generates orthogonal cosine signals based on the inter-thigh angle, fundamentally circumventing the noise sensitivity inherent in thigh angle differential while suppressing drift errors associated with thigh angle integral, thereby improving the accuracy of gait phase estimation. Experimental results across various locomotion scenarios, including inclines, stairs, and speed variations, demonstrate that compared to time-based estimations and traditional phase variable methods, the proposed method reduces gait phase estimation errors by 33.88% and 65.09% respectively through symmetry compensation and phase correction."

Accounting for the inherent random jitter in local oscillators and keeping the sampling interval smaller than the memory length of the continuous-time (CT) source process to facilitate reliable modeling, induce a discrete-time (DT) wide-sense almost cyclostationary (WSACS) process with memory model upon the sampled signals. The main challenge follows from the information-instability of DT WSACS processes, which renders conventional information-theoretic approaches inapplicable. We use the information-spectrum framework to study the compression of incoming source sequences in two settings: when processing starts immediately upon reception and when a bounded delay exists between consecutive source sequences. Our analysis provides novel insights relating source memory, sampling frequency synchronization, and achievable compression rates.We show that, contrary to the sampled stationary case, the RDF for sampled cyclostationary processes is very sensitive to sampling rate synchronization. We also demonstrate that the RDF is not a monotonically decreasing function for the sampling rate and how introducing delay simplifies the compression scheme and lowers the rates."

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant success in solving real-world problems using both static and dynamic graph data. While static graphs remain constant, dynamic graphs evolve over time, presenting unique challenges that necessitate integrating GNN computations with sequential models. Despite advancements, existing research has primarily focused on static graphs, with dynamic graphs receiving comparatively less attention. This study extends the investigation of over-squashing—a phenomenon where excessive information compression leads to the loss of distant node information—from static to dynamic graphs. Over-squashing is exacerbated in dynamic graphs due to the combined compression of spatial and temporal information into narrow time windows. To address this issue, we propose the spatial and temporal compensation model for dynamic graphs, which is theoretically validated and incorporates two key modules: the structural similarity-based spatial compensation (SSSC) module and the representation and trend similarity-based temporal compensation (RTSTC) module. The former module mitigates spatial information loss by leveraging structural similarities among nodes, while the latter module addresses temporal information loss by integrating historical data and trends. The extensive experiments on real-world dynamic graph datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.

    "abstract": "Owing to the huge success of generative artificial intelligence (AI), large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a core subclass, powering applications such as question answering, text generation, and code completion. While fine-tuning these models on domain-specific data can yield significant performance gains, it also poses daunting computational challenges, especially for researchers and organizations with limited hardware resources. Although SSD offloading (i.e., ZeRO-Infinity) has emerged as a viable strategy to overcome the GPU memory barrier via leveraging both system memory (i.e., CPU DRAM) and storage space (i.e., solid-state devices, SSDs), its design primarily targets model-centric performance issues. As a result, key system-level issues, including system memory fragmentation, inefficient pinned buffer allocation, peak system memory usage spikes, and file system overhead, remain unaddressed, limiting scalability and inflating costs. Such an observation motivates this paper to introduce MemAscend, a framework that systematically tackles the underexplored system memory bottlenecks in SSD-offloaded LLM training, with a focus on resource-constrained environments. By streamlining pinned-memory allocation, eradicating fragmentation, and mitigating peak system memory usage, MemAscend reclaims a substantial system memory budget, enabling larger models, longer context windows, and higher batch sizes without exceeding modest hardware limits. Across diverse LLM benchmarks, MemAscend reduces peak system-memory consumption by an average of 55.7% compared with state-of-the-art SSD offloading techniques, lowering the hardware barrier for fine-tuning and unlocking new possibilities for cost-effective large-scale training on limited-resource machines."

Recently, semantic communication has been introduced into UWOC systems to enhance transmission efficiency and robustness. However, existing underwater wireless optical semantic communication (UWOSC) systems overlook the bandwidth limitation imposed by practical optoelectronic devices, which hinders high-speed semantic information transmission. In this paper, we introduce orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation into the UWOSC system for the first time, and design a novel OFDM-based UWOSC system with symbol and power loading (SPL). In the proposed system, shifted-window-based hierarchical vision transformer blocks are employed to extract semantic features and encode them into frequency-domain baseband symbols for OFDM transmission. Furthermore, an SPL scheme, comprising an entropy model-driven symbol reordering strategy and a lightweight power allocation network, is designed to adaptively allocate subcarriers and power based on semantic importance and channel conditions. Experiments conducted on an emulated UWOC platform demonstrate that the proposed OFDM-based UWOSC system achieves superior performance compared with baseline schemes under high transmission bandwidth scenarios. Moreover, the introduction of the SPL module further improves semantic spectrum efficiency, effectively mitigating the adverse impact of low-pass characteristic inherent in bandwidth-limited UWOSC systems. These results demonstrate that the proposed system has strong potential to enable high-speed semantic communication in the IoUT."

As data-driven approaches to materials development are attracting increasing attention, two major challenges remain: the limited availability of polymer data and the complex hierarchical structures of polymers. In this study, we conduct high-throughput quantum chemistry calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using a single force field for approximately 5,500 homopolymers to construct a dataset of computed polymer properties. We develop machine learning models to predict MD-calculated polymer properties using quantum chemistry-derived physical quantities and MD force field parameters as descriptors. We also compare their performance with models using structural descriptors. While interpolation performance is comparable between molecular structure–based models, including a fingerprint model and a graph convolutional neural network, and models using quantum chemistry and MD force-field descriptors, the latter shows superior extrapolation performance in our evaluated setting for MD-computed density. In addition, we confirm that increasing the amount of data improves the accuracy of both interpolation and extrapolation predictions. The polymer dataset and predictive approach proposed in this study may help inform computational screening toward the development of high-performance polymer materials; experimental validation remains necessary."

Specifically, we first construct a Batch HyperGraph (BHGraph) to model the high-order correlation of samples within each mini-batch. Then, we introduce a message propagation module on BHGraph to update the node embeddings by aggregating information from their high-order neighbors, thereby capturing semantic relationships to enrich feature representation. Finally, we incorporate the proposed BHGraph learning into the pre-trained CLIP framework to achieve the feature adaptation for the downstream tasks.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated potential for solving such optimization tasks by generating heuristics and enabling structured reasoning through natural language.

We present Omni-LIVO, a tightly coupled multi-camera LIVO system that leverages multi-view observations to comprehensively utilize LiDAR geometric information across extended spatial regions. Omni-LIVO introduces a Cross-View direct alignment strategy that maintains photometric consistency across non-overlapping views, and extends the Error-State Iterated Kalman Filter (ESIKF) with multi-view updates and adaptive covariance. The system is evaluated on public benchmarks and our custom dataset, showing improved accuracy and robustness over state-of-the-art LIVO, LIO, and visual-inertial SLAM baselines."

    "abstract": "Conventional multi-model ensemble averages (MME) from hindcasts, such as those from the Decadal Climate Prediction Project component A (DCPP-A), can suffer from diluted predictive skill due to the averaging of models with varying performance. This dilution limits the skillful prediction of key Decadal Climate Variability (DCV) modes, such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the Tropical Atlantic SST Gradient (TAG). We propose a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to correct the ensemble averages of each participating model and hence the MME. The LSTM is trained on individual model ensemble averages and the MME to learn non-linear relationships, producing a more skillful time series for the PDO and TAG indices, relative to the conventional MME, as quantified by multiple performance metrics. These enhancements include superior temporal accuracy, reduced error, and a closer statistical correspondence in phase, timing, and magnitude with the observations. Our study demonstrates that deep learning can extract a more skillful signal from climate ensembles, offering an approach to more reliable decadal predictions."

    "abstract": "Overhead conductors undergo multiple cycles of varying bending amplitude at suspension clamps due to aeolian vibration. The current approach for evaluating fretting fatigue damage relies on using constant amplitude experimental tests on conductor classes grouped according to the Poffenberger-Swart relation. This approach neglects the effect of sequence of amplitudes. A probabilistic fatigue life assessment model is developed using the Poisson binomial model and various cumulative damage theories for sets of vibrations with different amplitudes. Fragility curves are presented for the failure of the first wire to the fourth wire failure in a conductor for experimental data sets with increasing and decreasing amplitudes of vibration. A comparison of predicted fragility curves with the conductor fatigue data shows that although the contact stresses as a function of amplitude of vibration are independent of the loading sequence, the material fatigue resistance is affected by the loading sequence. Cumulative damage theories that include the order of loading on the wires predict fragilities that are closer to experimental observations."

The proposed approach extends a previously introduced single-resonant control scheme proposed in [1] to a multi-resonant structure capable of compensating multiple harmonic components while maintaining robust stability under digital delay. Selective phase compensation is applied only to the final resonant term, avoiding anti-resonant effects commonly associated with full compensation schemes. To address practical implementation challenges, an artificial intelligence-based evaluation framework is introduced to automate the selection of discretization methods for individual resonant components, ensuring high-fidelity digital realization. The stability and performance of the proposed controller are analyzed using frequency-domain and stability criteria. Experimental validation is carried out on two different inverter topologies, namely a three-level three-phase T-type converter and a single-phase H-bridge inverter, demonstrating accurate current tracking, effective harmonic suppression, and robust operation under practical conditions."

Often certain microscopic anomalies that are overlapped or hidden by high-frequency substrates go unnoticed. This work presents a detailed optimization pipeline customized specifically to integrate data-driven optimization and architectural refinement to attain better detection rates and accuracy. The uniqueness of this work is in the integrated pipeline that combines a multi-stage adaptive optimization process with an FGA-integrated YOLOv12 training script. So as to enhance representational focus and suppress background noise in complex PCB imagery. The framework begins with an adaptive hyperparameter optimization loop, where, 50 mini-training trials were conducted to empirically identify an optimal parameter set, specific to PCBs. This is followed by a model training phase, where the optimized configuration is utilized to train a high-capacity YOLOv12-Large model using 5-fold cross-validation, for up to 200 epochs. Further, aggressive data augmentation and early stopping mechanisms were implemented to ensure generalization of the model. The strong quantitative performance (mAP@.50=0.811) obtained using the paper’s customized dataset and the increase in accuracy relative to other available model substantiates the claim that, the proposed framework feature discrimination thereby, reducing noise in cluttered circuit layouts."

In particular, false alarms frequently arise near the edges of the region of interest (ROI), reducing the stability of deep learning–based radar systems in practical deployments. To solve this issue, this study proposes a privacy-preserving fall detection system based on frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar by integrating the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Inception–ResNet</i> 1D architecture with a physics-informed decision layer called <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Subject’s Physical Information</i> (SPI).

The system is implemented in a multithreaded architecture with bounded real-time latency. The learning model was trained using data collected from ten subjects, while experiments were conducted on five different subjects distinct from the training cohort for real-time evaluation within a 3 × 3 m area covering both center and edge ROI. Compared with the baseline <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Inception–ResNet</i> model without SPI, the proposed system improves precision from 62.71% to 84.90%, accuracy from 70.27% to 91.11%, and F1-score from 77.09% to 91.84%, while maintaining a recall of 100% from tests on five subjects under controlled room conditions. In addition, a supplementary robustness evaluation in an uncontrolled-room setting further shows that SPI integration helps maintain improved overall system performance under more challenging sensing conditions. These results indicate that combining deep learning-based prediction with lightweight physical validation yields a more reliable and stable radar-based fall detection system suitable for real-time deployment in elderly monitoring applications."

    "abstract": "Predicting and understanding pedestrian behavior is one of the main challenges faced by autonomous vehicles in urban environments. Recent studies have shown promising results by introducing complex and large deep learning models to predict pedestrian actions. Despite being powerful, these models require significant time for both training and testing. However, when these models are embedded in vehicles, such delays become problematic for real-time inference. Additionally, capturing the spatial and temporal interactions between pedestrians and other traffic elements, such as vehicles, remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, this paper proposes an approach that applies sequential learning to traditional machine learning techniques, such as lightweight models including the XGBoost classifier, to determine whether pedestrians are crossing the road or not. Our model PCAP-SL (Pedestrian Crossing Action Prediction with Sequential Learning) uses pre-trained and frozen Vision Transformers (ViT) for feature extraction, enabling more efficient capture of complex interactions between pedestrians and their environment. The approach is validated against state-of-the-art models using the Joint Attention for Autonomous Driving (JAAD) and Pedestrian Intention Estimation (PIE) benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves competitive performance in predicting pedestrian actions while maintaining efficient inference time making it suitable for integration into real-time autonomous driving pipelines. The lightweight nature of the XGBoost classifier, combined with frozen ViT feature extraction, offers a practical balance between accuracy and computational efficiency."

We evaluated the efficiency, effectiveness, and user preference for each modality through quantitative and qualitative measures. Quantitative data included task completion time, errors rates, and responses to closed-ended questions regarding the preferred modalities, whereas qualitative data included survey responses to the open-ended questions. Statistical analysis revealed that the controller modality resulted in faster task completion times with the least error rate, whereas the eye gaze took significantly longer completion time with the highest error rates. The majority of participants preferred using the controller for its efficiency and effectiveness, highlighting that interaction modality plays a crucial role in determining user performance and experience in basic object manipulation tasks in VR."

To address this issue, a 6+1 cable (six superconducting wires and one center cooper wire) configuration has been proposed. During a quench, the central copper strand acts as an internal heater, inducing the quench-back effect. However, the presence of the copper strand reduces the available slot space, thereby limiting the effective engineering current density. To further improve both the current density and protection performance, the coupling-loss induced quench (CLIQ) method has been introduced and applied to seven-strand superconducting cables without a central copper strand. In this study, an electro-thermal coupling model is employed to first validate, through experiment–simulation comparison, the effectiveness of quench-back protection in 6+1 cables. The same model is then extended to analyze and predict the quench protection performance of seven-strand cables under CLIQ. The results demonstrate that CLIQ can effectively trigger uniform quenching, significantly reducing the quench integral and hot-spot temperature, thereby ensuring the reliable protection of the magnet."

An equivalent model capturing these effects is subsequently developed. Then, to actively suppress these losses without additional components, a novel method that strategically relocates the compensation capacitors is proposed. This relocation reshapes the electric field distribution across the coils, thereby enhancing system efficiency. Experimental results from a 1.3 kW prototype validate the proposed method, demonstrating a 1.35% efficiency improvement over conventional compensation and achieving a peak efficiency of 92.23%."

The spectral efficiency (SE) achieved by each deployment strategy is analyzed: i) For the centralized deployment, the location strategy of PAs on each waveguide is determined first with the aim of maximizing the channel gain of the nearest served user. Based on this, the corresponding system SE is derived. ii) For the distributed deployment, the system SE under the maximum ratio transmission (MRT) is first obtained, which is challenging to analyze due to the inter-user interference. To obtain an analytically tractable form, the stationary phase method is utilized to approximate the system SE. The approximation result reveals that the average inter-user interference can be negligible with a large waveguide spacing and thus the simple MRT is appealing for PA-based multi-user communications. Furthermore, the system SEs achieved by the two strategies are compared in both the high- and low-signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. Our analysis suggests that in the high-SNR regime, the distributed deployment is superior to achieve the maximal system SE, while the centralized deployment is more suitable for the low-SNR regime. Finally, the theoretical analysis is verified through simulations. Numerical results demonstrate that i) with the aid of the stationary phase method, the approximation of the system SE proves to be highly accurate overall; and ii) compared to the centralized deployment, the distributed deployment generally achieves a higher SE but at the cost of a low energy efficiency."

Here, we report on terahertz (THz) emission through difference-frequency generation (DFG) in an Aluminum Gallium Arsenide (AlGaAs) metasurface supporting magnetic toroidal dipolar resonances at the two pump wavelengths, which nonlinearly interact with each other. The simultaneous excitation of these high-Q resonances, together with the dispersive behavior of the nonlinear susceptibility, enables an exceptionally strong DFG response. Conversion efficiencies around 8 THz exceed those of an unstructured AlGaAs slab of the same thickness by over nine orders of magnitude. These results highlight the potential of DFG metasurfaces as compact and highly efficient platforms for THz generation."

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative training of large-scale AI models, including large language models (LLMs), and is particularly attractive for IoT sensor systems with stringent privacy and resource constraints. However, fine-tuning LLMs in sensor-driven edge environments remains challenging due to limited computation and memory resources on edge devices, as well as heterogeneous and time-varying communication and computational conditions that exacerbate the straggler problem. To address these challenges, we propose HRL-FLLM, a hierarchical client–edge–cloud FL framework driven by deep reinforcement learning (DRL). HRL-FLLM allows edge servers to adaptively coordinate LLM fine-tuning by jointly controlling efficiency-enhancing techniques, including Low-Rank Adaptation, quantization, and sparse communication, thereby reducing computational overhead and communication costs while preserving model performance. We further design a convergence-aware reward function and formulate a training time budget optimization problem, enabling edge servers to learn effective local training time allocation policies under heterogeneous conditions. Extensive experiments show that HRL-FLLM achieves robust convergence and significantly reduces training latency. In large-scale heterogeneous FL scenarios with resource-constrained clients, the proposed framework reduces convergence time by up to 47% compared with conventional cloud-centric FL approaches, demonstrating its effectiveness as a scalable and sustainable edge intelligence solution for IoT sensor systems."

    "abstract": "The pulse sequences-based work modes recognition of multi-function radars (WMR-MFRs) is crucial for the electronic support measures (ESM) to analyze the intentions of radar platform and carry out the jamming countermeasures. However, the measurement errors, missing and spurious pulses, and lack of prior information can still pose a significant challenge. This article proposes a WMR-MFRs method through joint radar semantics embedding with self-supervised denoising contrastive learning. Firstly, the radar functional-level semantics is embedded into the input parameter sequences via radar experts domain knowledge. Then, self-supervised denoising contrastive learning is utilized to effectively extract distinctive features between different pulse groups and similar features within the intra-pulse groups. More specifically, denoising contrastive loss and Gaussian noise regularization loss are designed to reduce the sensitivity to the undesirable noise and outliers during training process. Finally, a feature difference-based label mapping method is proposed to improve the recognition robustness. Simulation results show that the proposed method can achieve over 96% accuracy for the WMR-MFRs task in the case of inter-class parameters overlap, and more than 90% accuracy in the scenario with 40% non-ideal pulses. Compared to the baseline methods, the proposed method can achieve better and more robust performances in WMR-MFRs task."

The unique coaxial winding arrangement eases fabrication constraints. Many coupled inductors can be interconnected in a fabric-like fashion and scaled to larger inductance values and current ratings. As a proof of concept, TSV coupled inductors are fabricated, achieving an inductance density of 162 nH/mm2, an L/RDC ratio of 597 nH/Ω, a coupling factor of 0.97, and a peak Q of 9 at 5.5 MHz. Inductor performance with different core thicknesses and via diameters is evaluated, showing the potential to exceed 1000 nH/mm2 in inductance density and 2500 nH/Ω in L/RDC ratio."

The opamp integrates a 500× gain module to amplify and calibrate the non-chopped offset voltage, thereby reducing output ripple. It adopts a calibration scheme with temperature-compensated bit weights which are proportional to the transconductance of the chopper-path input transistor pair. Fabricated in a 0.18-μm Bipolar-CMOS-DMOS process, the amplifier employs input-referred offset and ripple minimization techniques while ensuring consistent performance over a wide input common-mode voltage range and temperature span, achieving a 3-σ offset voltage of 2 μV across 100 samples (-40 °C to 125 °C), an offset drift of 7 nV/°C, and a maximum input-referred ripple of 0.12 μVRMS (Root Mean Square)."

    "abstract": "Owing to the inherent advantages of edge computing in latency, privacy, and always-on availability, Deep Neural Network (DNN) tasks are progressively shifting to edge devices. However, limited edge resources pose significant challenges for deploying large DNNs. Pipeline parallelism (PP) and post-training quantization (PTQ) are essential techniques for addressing these resource constraints, and mainstream frameworks (e.g., DeepSpeed, PyTorch) encapsulate them independently. Nonetheless, this decoupled treatment inevitably traps the optimization process into local optima and results in inferior throughput-accuracy trade-offs in heterogeneous edge environments, due to the natural circular dependency between the PP and PTQ optimization processes. To this end, we propose MP3, a novel framework for joint PP-PTQ optimization in heterogeneous edge environments. MP3 integrates three core components: (1) Task-Device Co-analyzer (TDC) utilizes a fine-grained modeling method to estimate computation and communication latencies precisely. (2) Information-Fused Accuracy Proxy (FAP) characterizes quantized DNN accuracy through a unified proxy combining intra-layer and inter-layer information, with a data-driven fusion function search strategy. (3) Pipeline Quantization Co-optimizer (PQC), leveraging latency estimates from TDC and accuracy characterizations from FAP, navigates the joint optimization space effectively by formulating it as a Constraint Programming (CP) problem. A comprehensive experimental evaluation on an edge testbed confirms the effectiveness of MP3, demonstrating that it lies on a superior Pareto curve (achieving up to 3.2× throughput speedup with accuracy drop within 1%) and exhibits robust adaptability across heterogeneous devices."

Key contributions include: 1) analysis of RSHPN meta-model properties; 2) decomposition of RSHPN analysis into analysis of individual Petri nets, thus the reduction of state space explosion; and 3) transfer of RSHPN meta-model properties onto the produced models, hence elimination of the need for full re-analysis of the RSHPN model when creating new robotic systems. Only task-dependent parts of the model need to be analysed. This approach streamlines the analysis thus reducing the design time. Moreover, it produces a specification which is a solid foundation for the implementation of the system. The obtained results highlight the potential of Petri nets as a valuable formal framework for analysing robotic system properties."

The objective of this study was to assess feasibility of social robot (SR) administration of the GDS-15 by comparing decision-relevant screening outcomes with a healthcare professional (HP), comparing embodied and avatar SR modalities, and evaluating affect (PANAS) and robot perceptions (Godspeed). Building on a 5-participant pilot suggesting comparable triage-level classifications, we ran a counterbalanced within-participant study with 20 older adults (10 SR first, 10 HP first; 10 embodied, 10 avatar). We mapped GDS-15 scores to screening outcomes (0–5 vs 6–15; unlikely, possible, likely) and quantified agreement with percent agreement, Cohen’s kappa (weighted for ordinal), and McNemar’s exact test. Using HP as an operational reference, we computed sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, accuracy, and absolute SR–HP score deviations in GDS-15 points. Score-level method-comparison summaries included ICC(A,1) and Bland-Altman bias and limits of agreement. A paired TOST equivalence test supported equivalence of the mean SR–HP score difference for Δ = 2 points, with sensitivity analyses for Δ = 1 and Δ = 1.5 points. Exploratory order-effect and cognitive-status sensitivity analyses did not materially change agreement estimates in this sample. PANAS showed no adverse affect impact during SR-administered screening, and Godspeed responses were positive. These findings support social robots as a supervised interface for GDS-15 administration and decision-relevant screening outcomes in this cohort. PANAS and Godspeed were administered by human researchers, while the GDS-15 was administered in separate SR-administered and HP-administered sessions."

Different from the existing spherical puncturing, puncturing schemes which do no change the Plotkin structure of RM codes are proposed, enabling existing decoding techniques be readily accessible. The proposed puncturing schemes are based on Hamming weights of column indices of the generator matrix of RM codes. When Hamming weights of column indices (also determining the column weights, CW) are the same, different strategies are proposed, producing four different puncturing strategies, called CW-IV, CW-LSB, CW-MSB, and CW-MSB-Sym, respectively. Analysis is performed to show the union bound on error performance of RM codes with puncturing. Theoretically, it also shows that the punctured first 1st-order subcode can have potentially better performance than the non-puncturing case if puncturing is properly designed. Simulation results show that the proposed puncturing strategies outperform random and quasi-uniform puncturing (QUP) schemes in terms of block error rate (BLER). Union bound results also confirm that the first 1st-order subcode shows better performance than the original non-puncturing case. This fact indicates a more efficient transmission scheme of RM codes: transmitting part of the original codeword to increase the spectrum efficiency while achieving a better BLER performance under recursive list decoding."

    "abstract": "Although existing texture synthesis methods perform well in generating large images with irregularly repeated textures to avoid visually unrealistic repetitions, they still face significant challenges in synthesizing regular textures with densely interconnected structures. In this paper, we propose a novel neural texture synthesis method, FreNTS, which uses frequency domain information to enhance the texture synthesis process, synthesizing textures with continuous, complete, and visually realistic overall structures. The core idea is to perform the Discrete Cosine Transform on image patches to obtain the corresponding frequency domain rate information features, and then use the designed adaptive guided correspondence (AGC) loss to calculate the correlation difference between the source image and the target image in the frequency domain and spatial domains, thereby constraining the optimization of the target image to achieve high-quality texture synthesis. In addition, to better evaluate the effect of texture synthesis, we introduce Tile LPIPS as the metric for quantitative evaluation. Experimental results show that the proposed FreNTS can effectively accelerate the process of neural texture synthesis and use high-frequency information to capture better structural details to synthesize realistic textures."

    "abstract": "Automated, adaptive lighting systems based on LED arrays offer significant potential for general lighting applications. Unlike conventional lighting systems, LED arrays enable real-time, spatially adaptive illumination by dimming individual LED pixels through camera-detected environmental features. While already mature in the automotive industry, the translation of LED array technology to general lighting comes with various key challenges, limiting their broader adoption: (1) current high-resolution LED arrays are optimized for automotive use; (2) existing projection optics have low efficiency; and (3) determining optimal LED activation patterns from camera data is non-trivial. This manuscript identifies these challenges in-depth, followed by possible solutions. These solutions are then combined and integrated into a fully automated adaptive lighting system with LED array technology. This demonstration is followed by a discussion of the system's shortcomings, concluding that LED array technology for general lighting remains in an early stage but holds significant promise for future development."

A FAS predictive control with a generalized proportional-integral observer (GPIO) is presented to address this problem. Concretely, a FAS model of discrete-time nonlinear systems with the lumped disturbances is firstly given as a control-oriented one. Then, a GPIO is developed to achieve an accurate estimation for the lumped disturbances by adopting a less conservative disturbance assumption, which provides a better foundation to construct a disturbance preview. Furthermore, an incremental FAS (IFAS) prediction model with a disturbance preview is constructed by utilizing a new type of Diophantine Equation. Dependent on this IFAS prediction model, the multistep ahead predictions can be obtained to minimize an objective function to yield an optimal anti-disturbance controller, such that the desired tracking performance can be guaranteed. The depth analysis derives a sufficient condition for the bounded stability and tracking performance of the closed-loop FASs. The proposed GPIO-based FAS predictive control provides a solution to the spacecraft attitude control for verifying the feasibility."

    "abstract": "Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a highly promising technology for future sixth-generation networks owing to its potential to optimize spectrum resources at minimal hardware costs. One promising realization of ISAC is the multi-static design, where several distributed nodes jointly enhance sensing and communication performance. However, the current multi-static designs fall short of maintaining accurate sensing performance while fulfilling the simultaneous uplink/downlink communication requirements. To solve this efficiently, we consider a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) operating in network-assisted full-duplex (NAFD) mode and enhance the weighted sensing and communication rates of the network by efficiently designing transmit/receive beamformers at the APs and optimizing the RIS phase-shifts. Since the formulated problem is highly non-convex, we leverage tools such as quadratic-transform and succesive-convex approximation to convert the objective into a tractable form and then utilize Lagrange multipliers method to derive inter-AP-interference suppression enabled closed-form expressions for transmit and receive beamformers at the APs. Then, we propose a variance-reduced projected-gradient method, that relies on closed-form gradient updates to update the reflect beamformers at the RIS based on statistical-CSI. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design in achieving excellent ISAC performance at low computational complexity."

In dynamic scenes with pronounced foreground motion or camera jitter, especially under challenging conditions including extremely low or high luminance, widespread saturation, and substantial motion, existing approaches often encounter ghosting artifacts, spatial misalignment, and degradation of fine structural details. Traditional techniques based on handcrafted priors struggle to generalize to complex motion patterns, while most deep learning-based methods operate exclusively in the spatial domain, limiting their ability to capture global contextual cues and restore high-frequency structures that are better represented in the frequency domain. To address these challenges, we introduce a Dual-Domain Parallel Fusion Network with Prompt Refinement (DDPF-PR), which jointly leverages spatial and frequency-domain features for enhanced HDR reconstruction. Specifically, the proposed framework consists of a Bi-Domain Interaction Module(BDIM), which integrates spatial features for local detail and frequency features for global structure to suppress ghosting artifacts caused by motion. In addition, a Prompt Refinement Module(PRM) is designed to recover fine details in degraded regions such as saturated or misaligned areas by adaptively generating structural cues. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DDPF-PR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Firstly, we devise a complex-valued CSK constellation design method under given color/illumination constraints. The new method not only eliminates the color balance distortion issue, but also achieves a better normalized minimum Euclidean distance (NMED). Secondly, an expectation maximization (EM) based ECCSK constellation recognition algorithm is proposed, which enables the system to automatically identify the ECCSK constellation with unknown symbol timing offset (STO) and noise variance. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the new ECCSK constellation design method and the EM-based AMR algorithm. It shows that the proposed system can provide a performance close to the ideal benchmark scheme in MTCC scenarios."

    "abstract": "The concept of Wireless Network-on-Chip (WNoC) has emerged as a potential solution to address the escalating communication demands of modern computing systems due to its low-latency, versatility, and reconfigurability. However, for WNoC to fulfill its potential, it is essential to establish multiple high-speed wireless links across chips. Unfortunately, the compact and enclosed nature of computing packages introduces significant challenges in the form of Co-Channel Interference (CCI) and Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI), which not only hinder the deployment of multiple spatial channels, but also severely restrict the symbol rate of each individual channel. In this paper, we posit that Time Reversal (TR) could be effective in addressing both impairments in this static scenario, thanks to its spatiotemporal focusing capabilities even in the near-field. Through comprehensive full-wave simulations and bit error rate analysis in multiple chip layouts with multiple frequency bands, we provide evidence that TR can increase the symbol rate by an order of magnitude, enabling the deployment of multiple concurrent links and achieving aggregate speeds exceeding 100 Gb/s. Finally, we evaluate the impact of reducing the sampling rate of the TR filter on the achievable speeds, paving the way to practical TR-based wireless communications at the chip scale."

Furthermore, we develop an online multi-path stabilization strategy that enhances the performance of these slimmed sub-models using only unlabeled target data. Comprehensive experiments across various scenarios confirm that the proposed method enables the slimmable model to adapt effectively to diverse domain shifts.

    "abstract": "Autonomous driving in adverse weather conditions remains a significant challenge. In particular, LiDAR sensors in heavy snowfall suffer from severe noise caused by snow particles, resulting in degraded perception performance. To address this issue, a variety of snow-removal methods have been studied. In many existing approaches, candidate snow particles are initially generated, followed by noise filtering of these candidates to reduce computational complexity. Nevertheless, existing snow-candidate generation methods have several limitations, such as dependency on fixed thresholds of specific indicators, sensitivity to different sensor types, the need for labeled data, and high computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel snow-candidate generation method that does not rely on fixed thresholds and automatically adapts to sensor and environmental characteristics, along with a snow-removal method built upon it. In addition, to mitigate misclassifications occurring in the snow-removal process, we introduce a confidence-based label correction method. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves improved filtering performance compared with existing approaches. Furthermore, by reducing the number of filtering targets through candidate generation, our method improves computational efficiency and ensures real-time performance even in resource-limited environments."

    "abstract": "Recently, lightweight networks for single image super-resolution (SISR) have surged due to the need of resource-constrained devices, where divide-and-conquer multi-route model exhibits impressive trade-off between performance and computational cost. However, most existing divide-and-conquer multi-route models face two key limitations: (1) possible suboptimal decoupling of image components (e.g. smooth regions, edges and texture details) due to spatial-domain-only processing, and (2) inability to model global dependencies explicitly and capture structural information, hindering further performance gains. To address these drawbacks, we propose a lightweight frequency-selection-based progressive patch Transformer network (FSPPTN) for higher-quality SISR reconstruction. Specifically, we first propose a frequency selection module, in which we develop a frequency enhancement branch (FEB) to dynamically decouple different image components by introducing the window-based Fast Fourier transform (WFFT) and a learnable weight matrix, and a spatial restoration branch (SRB) to recalibrate and fuse cross-granularity features by designing a multi-gate mechanism for reconstructing the component information screened out by the FEB at current level. Secondly, we propose a lightweight multi-branch gradient-guided inter-patch self-attention to explicitly capture global structural similarities by summarizing structural information of each patch into a lower-dimensional space using the statistical properties of first-order gradients, thereby achieving explicit global dependencies modeling and lightweight. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that, in the vast majority of cases, FSPPTN outperforms state-of-the-art lightweight SISR methods in terms of both performance and computational overhead, especially for ×3 and ×4 SR, e.g. FSPPTN outperforms MaIR-Small by even 0.14dB PSNR on Manga109 dataset for ×4 SR even with 48.3% fewer parameters and 63.5% lower FLOPs.

Domain adaptation, which aims to improve the classification performance of target domain with knowledge from the source domain, is a promising approach to address this issue. However, conventional domain adaptation methods typically assume access to both source and target domain data, which may be infeasible in real-world settings due to data privacy and confidentiality concerns. Therefore, it is crucial to develop source-free domain adaptation PolSAR image classification methods which rely only on target domain data. In this scenario, how to make full use of the label sparse target domain data is a consequent challenge to overcome. To this end, we propose CVSFDA, a complex-valued source-free domain adaptation framework tailored for PolSAR image classification. CVSFDA incorporates a complex-valued multiscale prototypical matching module (CVMP) and a complex-valued relation network (CVRN). Given the pretrained source domain model and the limited labeled samples in target domain, CVMP captures the similarities between samples leveraging the hierarchical spatial information across multiple encoder layers. A similarity convolutional network is further devised in CVRN, to comprehensively model class-specific information in the target domain. Extensive experiments on four benchmark PolSAR datasets demonstrate that CVSFDA achieves superior classification accuracy and generalization ability compared to existing domain adaptation methods."

To address these limitations, this letter proposes a multi-mode topology-reconfiguration open-end winding drive (MMTR OEWD) for handling inverter SCFs in multiphase machines. It rapidly isolates the faulty inverter and maintains motor output by reconfiguring the topology.

First, the principles of post-fault topology reconfiguration are presented. The analysis results detail the carrier-based PWM generation method during topology reconfiguration.

Their Phase profiles are synthesized through a novel sampling-point-based reference-phase search method utilizing a phase matching path with focal-ratio refinement. Multi-band reference phases are extracted from representative sampling-point evaluations along the phase matching path and subsequently applied to the entire aperture in a one-shot manner.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes CADiS, a causality-driven anomaly detection framework, to address the challenges of root cause identification in high-dimensional Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) multivariate time series. The essential difference between CADiS and existing correlation-driven deep models lies in its core innovation: it fundamentally redefines anomalies as the structural decay of an underlying causal mechanism, rather than merely capturing symptomatic deviations or spurious correlations. Specifically, the framework first learns a directed and lag-aware causal prior from normal data, compiling it into a structured attention mask to constrain information flow. Then, a Causal-Phase Decomposition (CPD) technique treats each time window as a micro-experiment, comparing an ante-phase with a post-phase to explicitly capture the dynamics of causal attenuation.

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning (DL) has been extensively applied in channel modeling to capture complex nonlinear relationships and uncover underlying signal propagation mechanisms. However, current DL-based channel modeling methods typically rely on extensive training data, which limits their performance and adaptability in dynamic and changing environments. To address this imperative, this paper proposes a DL-enhanced channel parameter prediction model based on adaptive meta mask region-based convolutional neural networks (AMM-RCNN). First, an optimized Mask RCNN network is designed to extract the key environmental information from satellite images. The extracted scatterer feature maps and propagation statistics are used as the multimodal input of network, so as to capture the correlation between propagation environment and channel characteristics. Second, the meta-learning algorithm is applied to improve the prediction accuracy of the network with sparse training samples. The method utilizes measurement data from multiple routes as meta-learning tasks, thereby enhancing the generalization ability of the model in new scenarios. Finally, the proposed model is trained and validated with using real-world channel measurement data collected from a university campus. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model can accurately predict channel parameters across diverse routes in campus scenarios."

    "abstract": "With the increasing demand for encrypted communication in spacecraft, aerospace-grade chips are required to integrate encryption circuits. The lightweight characteristics of static random access memory (SRAM) physical unclonable function (PUF) make it suitable for aerospace applications. However, the space radiation effects can degrade SRAM PUF key reliability and even cause stuck-bit errors. Therefore, it is necessary to harden the SRAM PUF circuit to obtain a stable encryption key. This paper presents a dynamically adjustable radiation-hardening method for SRAM PUF (DAR-SPUF). The method generates stable keys through dynamic key adjustment circuit, stuck-bit error detection circuit, and other peripheral circuits. The proposed method does not modify the structure of traditional SRAM PUF cell. Compared to existing hardening methods, the proposed method exhibits smaller area overhead and power consumption. A FinFET-based test chip was designed and fabricated to verify the effectiveness of the DAR-SPUF. The test chips were irradiated with total ionizing dose (TID) and heavy ions. The experimental results show that radiation effects increase the bit error rate (BER) of unhardened test chip by 1.34x – 2.57x. However, it reduces the BER of the hardened DAR-SPUF chip by 19.73x – 24.52x. The experimental results also demonstrate that the DAR-SPUF can mitigate the stuck-bit errors to 0."

To address this, we present a monolithically-integrated, dual-channel surface plasmon resonance (SPR) fiber sensor capable of crosstalk-compensated and temperature-compensated detection of Cu²⁺ and Ni²⁺. The sensor is fabricated by cascading two sensing regions on a single microstructured optical fiber (MOF), where a strategic combination of heterogeneous metallic films—a silver film for the Cu²⁺ channel and a gold film for the Ni²⁺ channel—creates two spectrally distinct resonance dips in the visible range. To overcome the limitation of specificity, ion-imprinted polymers (polyacrylic acid and chitosan) are functionalized onto the respective channels, creating highly selective recognition sites. Furthermore, an independent temperature-sensing probe, with its resonance strategically located in the near-infrared region, is incorporated into the optical path for real-time temperature monitoring, effectively eliminating thermal cross-sensitivity. Experimental results demonstrate that the sensor exhibits high sensitivity (up to 0.41 nm/μM for Cu²⁺ and 0.34 nm/μM for Ni²⁺ in the low concentration regime), a fast response time (20-30 s), and low detection limits. This work provides a compact and robust all-in-one sensing solution that paves the way for practical, multi-analyte environmental monitoring."

Using controlled numerical closed-loop simulations (identical altitude, satellite count, and sub-cycles), we conduct an equitable comparison of these constellations' performances in spectral and spatial domains under identical conditions. Comparative analyses under the optimal spatial resolution for each constellation configuration reveal that the DP Cartwheel-type and DP Pendulum-type configurations outperform the Bender-type configuration in recovering time-variable gravity field models at higher temporal resolutions. Spectral and spatial analyses confirm that the DP Cartwheel and DP Pendulum configurations surpass the Bender-type configuration, reducing the error by approximately 12%. In geoscience applications, the DP Cartwheel-type and DP Pendulum-type configurations slightly outperform the highly advocated Bender constellation design. Specifically, compared to the Bender-type, the DP Cartwheel-type and DP Pendulum-type configurations improve large-basin signal recovery accuracy by  7.4%, Greenland Ice Sheet's southern sector mass balance signals by  3.2%, and co-seismic signals by  13.2%. The simulation results indicate that the DP Cartwheel-type and DP Pendulum-type configurations show superior performance in gravity signal detection. However, due to current limitations in fuel consumption, laser pointing accuracy, and mission budget, maintaining these configurations remains technically and economically challenging. With future reductions in launch costs and advances in relevant technologies, these two configurations may become promising candidates for next-generation gravity missions."

    "abstract": "Accurate simulation of land use and land cover change (LUCC) is essential for understanding urban expansion and ecosystem evolution. However, existing models struggle to simultaneously capture complex spatiotemporal dependencies and nonlinear socioeconomic drivers, often failing when historical trends are disrupted by sudden policy interventions (i.e., structural breaks). To address these limitations, this study proposes a parallel mechanism-coupled Cellular Automata–Deep Learning–XGBoost (CDX) framework that dynamically integrates spatial, temporal, and socioeconomic driving forces. In this framework, a decoupled CNN-LSTM module extracts spatiotemporal inertia from remote sensing sequences; an XGBoost module transparently quantifies driver suitability; and a Cellular Automata (CA) module simulates spatial diffusion. These components are integrated through a unified transition potential function, optimized by adaptive stochastic search, to balance spatial realism with mechanism fidelity. The CDX framework was applied to Yancheng, China, using multi-temporal Landsat imagery (1995–2025). Experimental results validate the framework's superior mechanism adaptability: while purely data driven baselines (e.g., MicroViT) remained locked in historical inertia, the adaptively calibrated CDX successfully characterized the policy-driven regime shift from inertia-driven expansion to eco-regulated growth (2020–2025). Consequently, CDX achieved a diagnostic Figure of Merit (FoM) improvement of approximately 12.6% compared to the state-of-the-art MicroViT model and over 50% compared to the traditional RF-CA baseline. Leveraging the transition rules explicitly learned from this structural evolution, the model generated robust projections for the 2025–2050 period. Comparative scenario simulations reveal that while an economic priority scenario results in coastal sprawl, the baseline projection identifies an optimized trajectory where steady built-up land expansion (reaching 37.32% by 2050) is successfully decoupled from ecological degradation, enabling significant wetland recovery (increasing to 7.15%). This study demonstrates that the CDX framework effectively bridges spatial pattern simulation with the adaptive learning of evolving policy regimes, providing a unified and interpretable approach for sustainable land use planning under non-stationary conditions."

    "abstract": "For disaster response robots to work safely and effectively, it is crucial to assess task executability before execution, as failures or accidents, such as rollovers, at disaster sites could cause secondary disasters. Thus, motion learning through trial and error in such environments is unacceptable. Moreover, disaster sites are highly diverse and unpredictable, making traditional pre-installed control methods ineffective due to surface slippage and unstable terrain. In this study, we propose an environment-adaptability enhancement system that enables efficient motion learning in a virtual space for multi-degree-of-freedom disaster response robots. The process begins with the robot using a depth sensor to recognize the real environment and then reconstructs it in a virtual space. The robot subsequently attempts to complete the assigned task and calculates its confidence level in successful execution. If the task fails, the robot uses a genetic algorithm to efficiently optimize control parameters using multiple virtual robots. Finally, the learned control method is applied to the real environment. Experiments verified the robot’s ability to adaptively climb higher, uneven, and slippery steps using parameters designed for standard step climbing. The results showed that the proposed system can assess task executability via confidence levels, learn viable motions in a virtual space, and successfully perform adaptive step climbing in the real-world settings."

Towards this end, we investigated the impact of the transceive UAV trajectory on the sensing and communication (S&C) performance of the proposed system. Specifically, we first estimate the coordinate and velocity of the MT via the extended Kalman filter (EKF) method utilizing the transmit and receive UAVs, and then formulate a weighted optimization problem to optimize the UAV trajectory by considering the posterior Cramér-Rao bound (PCRB) and communication rate under the constraints of anti-collision and energy consumption. A successive convex approximation (SCA)-based algorithm is proposed to solve the problem efficiently. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate that the proposed airborne maneuverable bi-static ISAC system outperforms the existing semi-static ISAC systems in terms of tracking and communication performance by fully utilizing the transceive UAV mobility."

    "abstract": "In future 6G networks, dependable networks will enable telecommunication services such as remote control of robots or vehicles with strict requirements on end-to-end network performance in terms of delay, delay variation, tail distributions, and throughput. With respect to such networks, it is paramount to be able to determine what performance level the network segment can guarantee at a given point in time. One promising approach is to use predictive models trained using machine learning (ML). Predicting performance metrics such as one-way delay (OWD), in a timely manner, provides valuable insights for the network, user equipments (UEs), and applications to address performance trends, deviations, and violations. Over the course of time, a dynamic network environment results in distributional shifts, which causes catastrophic forgetting and drop of ML model performance. In continual learning (CL), the model aims to achieve a balance between stability and plasticity, enabling new information to be learned while preserving previously learned knowledge. In this paper, we target on the challenges of catastrophic forgetting of OWD prediction model. We propose a novel approach which introducing the concept of multi-generator for the state-of-the-art CL generative replay framework, along with tabular variational autoencoders (TVAE) as generators. The domain knowledge of UE capabilities is incorporated into the learning process for determining generator setup and relevance. The proposed approach is evaluated across a diverse set of scenarios with data that is collected in a realistic 5G testbed, demonstrating its outstanding performance in comparison to baselines."

    "abstract": "This study presents a novel approach to enhance the power level at millimeter waves (mm-waves) with very low cost. Considering an mm-wave base station (BS) in a fixed location and the user equipment (UE) in the far-field (FF) region, a plane wave with a known direction of propagation reaches a specific region. A very large, predesigned fixed focal spot passive surface (S1) is designed and installed within the viewing angle of the plane wave to reflect and focus it in the near-field (NF) region on another wall. A small reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) device is installed on the other wall to be illuminated by the focused beam, and the RIS steers the beam dynamically inside the desired region toward the UE. By using this scheme, a large amount of power can be focused on the UEs to enhance the signal level. The components are modeled with full-wave electromagnetic simulation, and the best approach to design the mm-wave system is discussed. A prototype was fabricated and measured at 26 GHz to demonstrate the 2-D beam steering.

Conventional optimization-based controllers can enforce physical constraints, but they struggle to produce feasible solutions quickly when many obstacles are present. Diffusion models can generate diverse trajectories around obstacles, yet prior approaches lacked a general and efficient way to condition them on scene structure. In this paper, we show that combining diffusion-based warm-starting conditioned with a latent object-centric representation of the scene and with a collision-aware model predictive controller (MPC) yields reliable and efficient motion generation under strict time limits. Our approach conditions a diffusion transformer on the system state, task, and surroundings, using an object-centric slot attention mechanism to provide a compact obstacle representation suitable for control. The sampled trajectories are refined by an optimal control problem that enforces rigid-body dynamics and signed-distance collision constraints, producing feasible motions in real time. On benchmark tasks, this hybrid method achieved markedly higher success rates and lower latency than sampling-based planners or either component alone. Real-robot experiments with a torque-controlled Panda confirm reliable and safe execution with MPC. An open-source implementation is provided here."

    "abstract": "Remote sensing object detection plays a vital role in both civilian applications and national defense security. However, remote sensing images typically exhibit characteristics such as wide coverage, significant variations in object scales, dense object distribution, and severe background interference. These factors greatly limit the applicability of existing detection methods in remote sensing scenarios. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a cross-layer cascade network with multi-attention mechanisms for remote sensing object detection (CCMANet). The proposed network incorporates different types of attention mechanisms at different stages to tackle background interference and dense multi-target detection, and leverages cross-layer cascading to progressively optimize feature representations, thereby achieving higher detection accuracy. Specifically, a multi-attention collaborative module is first introduced for feature filtering and suppression of complex backgrounds, highlighting useful remote sensing object features. Then, a maximum feature fusion module is employed in the feature fusion stage to enhance the diversity and representational capacity of the fused features. Finally, an improved dual-spatial pyramid pooling module combines two distinct spatial feature representations to further enrich target features in remote sensing images, ensuring that the dense and diverse remote sensing object information is preserved throughout the detection pipeline. Experiments on the DIOR, NWPU VHR-10, and RSOD datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving the highest mAP of 0.773, 0.952, and 0.973, respectively.

    "abstract": "Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) is an important technique for mental state analysis, identifying aspects, opinions, and their sentiment polarities from user-generated content. A fundamental challenge lies in capturing the semantic dependencies across different sentiment elements. Most existing methods are model-centric, primarily modeling tripletlevel semantics by aligning predictions with the ground truth. However, users freely post content with varying mental states, showing informal linguistic styles. Such methods may struggle to generalize to challenging cases with element-level diversity. This paper introduces Metamorphic Relation Guided Quantitative Reflection (MaRS), a novel data-centric paradigm that leverages generated testing counterparts of existing samples to improve ASTE. Particularly, inspired by software metamorphic testing, we construct eight metamorphic relations governing intra- and inter-triplet element diversity. Leveraging these relations, we can quantify the weaknesses of existing ASTE methods and large language models (LLMs) in capturing diversity. Furthermore, we devise a quantitative reflection strategy that flexibly incorporates linguistic constraints into both the training and reasoning phases. Extensive experiments on four ASTE datasets and three mental happiness datasets demonstrate that our MaRS outperforms several state-of-the-art models in F1-score and reduces violation rates by up to 10.80% for ASTE models and 17.29% for LLMs."

    "abstract": "We consider semantics-aware remote estimation of a discrete-state Markov source with both normal (low-priority) and alarm (high-priority) states. Erroneously announcing a normal state at the destination when the source is actually in an alarm state (i.e., missed alarm) incurs a significantly higher cost than falsely announcing an alarm state when the source is in a normal state (i.e., false alarm). Moreover, consecutive estimation errors may cause significant lasting impacts, such as maintenance costs and misoperations. Motivated by this, we introduce two new metrics, the Age of Missed Alarm (AoMA) and the Age of False Alarm (AoFA), to capture the lasting impacts incurred by different estimation errors. Notably, these two age processes evolve interdependently and distinguish between different error types. Our goal is to design a transmission policy that achieves an optimized trade-off between lasting impact and communication cost. The problem is formulated as a countably infinite-state Markov decision process (MDP) with an unbounded cost function. We show the existence of a simple switching policy with distinct thresholds for each age process and derive closed-form expressions for its performance. For symmetric and non-prioritized sources, we show that the optimal policy reduces to a threshold policy with identical thresholds. For numerical tractability, we propose a finite-state approximate MDP and prove that it converges exponentially fast to the original MDP in the truncation size. Finally, we develop an efficient search algorithm to compute the optimal switching policy and validate our theoretical findings with numerical results."

    "abstract": "Inter-satellite links (ISLs) are pivotal for information interaction and orbit determination in mega-constellation networks. Terahertz (THz) band, with its abundant spectral resources, exhibits significant potential for high-speed ISL establishment. However, due to frequent operations of Low earth orbit (LEO) satellites, the combined impacts of multi-source timevarying platform vibrations and two-dimensional asymmetrical features of each source on THz inter-satellite communication-ranging systems have yet to be revealed. This paper proposes a vibration-constrained THz-ISL system with LEO satellite attitude dynamics and spatial effects. Specifically, we establish a multi-peak frequency model using Semiconductor Inter-Satellite Link Experiment (SILEX) spectra, complemented by an optimized sum-of-sinusoids (SOS) time-domain model to address high dynamics and multi-source vibrations in LEO scenarios. Statistical link gain models are formulated, encompassing steady, sporadic, and universal scenarios. Subsequently, the proposed ISL gain model is applied to assess communication and ranging performance. We derive the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-vibration quantitative relationship through Stirling’s approximation, where SNR quantifies communication performance degradation. Ranging precision is evaluated via the Fisher information matrix (FIM), revealing vibration deterioration of Cram´er-Rao bounds (CRB). Under given power constraints, we define truncation distance as the maximum vibration-tolerant link range where performance remains unaffected, and derive its closed-form solution. Simulations utilizing SILEX orbit data indicate that under typical settings: 1) inter-satellite vibrations are on the order of hundreds of μrad and cause a 5% pointing error attenuation, 2) vibrations alter system performance boundaries, with 600 km communication distance reduction and 2.2 dB ranging accuracy degradation with 0.03° deviation, 3) vibration effects can be mitigated via phased array dimensions and beamforming design, achieving capacity-robustness trade-off."

    "abstract": "The concept of wireless virtualized networks enables Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs) to utilize resources made available by multiple Infrastructure Providers (InPs) to set up a service. Nevertheless, existing centralized resource provisioning approaches fail to address such a scenario due to conflicting objectives among InPs and their reluctance to share private information. This paper addresses the problem of resource provisioning from several InPs for services with geographic coverage constraints. When complete information is available, an Integer Linear Program (ILP) formulation is provided, along with a greedy solution. An alternative coalition formation approach is then proposed to build coalitions of InPs that satisfy the constraints imposed by an MVNO, while requiring only limited information sharing. The proposed solution adopts a hedonic game-theoretic approach to coalition formation. For each InP, the decision to join or leave a coalition is made in a decentralized manner, relying on the satisfaction of service requirements and on individual profit. Simulation results demonstrate the applicability and performance of the proposed solution."

    "abstract": "Accurately predicting molecular properties can identify more promising drug candidates and facilitate the process of drug discovery. There are advances in methods for molecular property prediction using self-supervised learning. However, most methods tend to focus only on a certain representation, resulting in reduced information diversity. Moreover, less attention is paid to the functional groups in the molecule, which are highly related to the molecular properties. To solve the problem, a multimodal contrastive learning framework called MMCL for molecular property prediction is proposed, which learns common features among similar molecules by utilizing different views of molecules for predicting molecular properties. In addition, by explicitly representing functional groups as nodes in the molecular graph, the model is prompted to learn features related to molecular properties. Prediction results on benchmark datasets and a series of case studies show that MMCL has optimal performance in most property prediction tasks and can capture information related to chemical semantics. Overall, MMCL can be used as an efficient deep learning tool for molecular-related tasks to facilitate the drug discovery process."

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant potential in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. However, their performance is often constrained by fixed graph structures and limited capacity for long-range dependency modeling. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Hypergraph and Transformer Fusion Network (HGTFN) that integrates hypergraph convolution and Transformer encoding in a complementary manner, combining localized structural modeling with global semantic context aggregation. Specifically, a Structure-aware Multi-hop Hypergraph Construction (SMHGC) module is developed to generate adaptive, multi-scale hypergraphs guided by spatial–spectral correlations, enabling the capture of higher-order relational structures. This is followed by a Hypergraph Convolution with Edge-wise Attention (HGCEA) module, which enhances feature propagation through edge-adaptive weighting. To overcome the rigidity of grid-based tokenization in conventional Vision Transformers (ViTs), we introduce a Key-Pixel Guided Transformer (KPFormer), which constructs localized neighborhood tokens centered on key pixels based on feature similarity and employs a context-aware feedforward block to strengthen local–global interactions. Furthermore, a Residual Complement Fusion Network (RCFN) is incorporated to fuse multi-source features and refine semantic representation in non-key regions. This design enables HGTFN to generate more balanced and discriminative representations even with limited training samples. Experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets, namely Indian Pines, Pavia University, Salinas and WHU-Hi-HongHu, demonstrate that the HGTFN model achieves state-of-the-art performance with overall accuracies (OA) of 95.73%, 95.58%, 99.19% and 96.56%, respectively, significantly outperforming 10 other algorithms, including CNN, Transformer, and graph-based methods.

To support these applications, aerial platforms should perform real-time, efficient navigation and sensing services in dynamic, dense, and uncertain low-altitude environments via large artificial intelligence (AI) models. However, enabling such intelligence requires overcoming significant challenges of limited onboard resources and dynamic connectivity for the aerial platforms. This paper provides a comprehensive study on addressing these challenges to enable large AI model-based services in LAE networks. We propose a cloud-edge-end architecture that facilitates collaborative model training and inference among aerial and ground nodes. We also explore three key enabling technologies, i.e., model collaboration, dynamic networking, and resource management. We validate the proposed framework through a case study on radio map generation for LAE networks.

    "abstract": "In addition to securely handling objects, grippers endowed with a sense of touch are desirable for handling delicate objects. Force sensors can be mounted distally at the fingertips, but a simpler option is to estimate fingertip forces from motor current at the base. This approach, which is not new, reduces wire routing and recesses electronics away from the sensed surface for operation in wet environments. However, for such a strategy to work, the actuating motor must have no or low gearing, which increases its transparency to external torques, but greatly limits its own torque output. Therein lies a trade-off. In addition to gearing, the transmission ratio from motor to fingertip is also defined by the gripper linkage itself. In this work, the trade-off is overcome by introducing a linkage capable of reconfiguring without the need of an extra actuator. Reconfiguration is performed by moving across an output singularity to select between a mode which is biased for force sensing (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">sense mode</i>) and a mode which is biased for force production (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">grip mode</i>). These novel kinematics are embodied as a mostly monolithic compliant mechanism, leaving just one traditional pin joint in the entire gripper assembly. Experiments show that force mode exhibits 3.1× more force output, and sense mode can measure 2.6× smaller forces. Corollary to the latter, sense mode is ideal for estimating the stiffness of objects, including small fruits with stiffness lower than 150 N/m. As an illustration, we demonstrate the usage of sense mode to estimate the ripeness of small fruits, followed by a transition to force mode in order to pluck the fruit. Ripeness is distinguished with up to <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\approx 90\\%$</tex-math></inline-formula> accuracy based on estimates of stiffness and fruit size using sense mode."

    "abstract": "To counter unauthorized access posed by presentation attacks in fingerprint authentication systems, deep learning-based fingerprint spoofing detection methods have been introduced. However, different artificial materials produce non-uniform spoof image representations, leading to a bias toward easy-to-recognize samples while ignoring hard-to-recognize ones. Hard sample mining is beneficial for accurately modeling a discriminative function. In this paper, we propose a novel fingerprint spoof detection method with hard sample mining called EasyHard-FSD. Specifically, EasyHard-FSD introduces a self-training (teacher/student model), where a teacher model is learned using all original samples, and it is used to identify possible hard samples. EasyHard-FSD employs a Hard Mining Module (HMM) to mask out hard samples for the student model. This strategy allows the student model to learn a better discriminative function for recognizing live and spoof fingerprint samples accurately. Experimental results on LiveDet2013 and LiveDet2015 demonstrate that EasyHard-FSD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in fingerprint spoof detection.

    "abstract": "In Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled energy systems, accurate wind power forecasting is essential for intelligent scheduling and grid stability. However, meteorological and power time series often exhibit time-varying distributions and irregular regime shifts. This complexity complicates stable pattern learning and may cause models to overemphasize repeated local patterns. To address this issue, we propose a Cluster-Driven Block-Flip Transformer with Dynamic Positional Learning (CBFT) for wind power forecasting in IoT-based energy applications. CBFT includes two components. First, a block-based clustering and flipping module splits the input into fixed-length blocks and clusters them by statistical similarity. It then applies controlled randomized flipping to selected blocks as structured regularization to reduce order-sensitive dependencies. Second, a dynamic positional learning module uses multi-layer perceptron (MLP) embeddings to learn adaptive relative positional representations among blocks. This design remains effective under block-level order perturbations. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple real-world wind power and electricity datasets show that CBFT achieves lower MAE and MSE than state-of-the-art Transformer-based models."

A switched linear parameter-varying (LPV) model, accounting for mass variations due to changes in shipborne equipment, is established to characterize the NUSV dynamics. To counter bidirectional network attacks, a dual-channel deception attack defense mechanism is proposed. For the vessel-to-basal communication channel, the mechanism employs a controller mode estimator to provide reliable controller modes when data tampering is detected, thereby mitigating the duration of asynchronous behavior induced by deception attacks (DAs). For the basal-to-vessel channel, a quantity-parameter-based control input compensator is designed to counteract the impact of DAs on secure controller outputs. Based on this framework, a secure control scheme is developed to achieve robust dynamic positioning for NUSV. Finally, a numerical simulation is conducted to validate the efficacy of the proposed approach."

    "abstract": "Accurate heading estimation is essential for improving position accuracy and enabling intuitive navigation by indicating the correct direction to the destination, yet it remains challenging on smartphones because of short term compass bias, long term gyroscope drift, and unconstrained user motion. Previously proposed external infrastructure-dependent methods demonstrate improved heading estimation; however, such reliance faces scalability issues. Conversely, pervasively available Wi-Fi fingerprinting approaches primarily focus on position estimates, overlooking opportunities for heading calibration through temporal continuity and motion-state alignment. This paper utilizes this alignment with the fingerprinting sequence to infer heading calibration. The approach evaluates the suitability of fingerprint positions for calibrating heading using spatial variance and signal strength, incorporating an adaptive thresholding mechanism driven by continuous self-learning to dynamically refine the qualification criteria. A multi-layer validation scheme further improves reliability by cross-correlating displacement-based step estimates and compass-derived headings with corresponding estimates from qualified fingerprinting solutions. To complement this, we propose exploiting Quasi-Static Magnetic Field Intervals (QSMFIs) for reliable heading calibration. Unlike current QSMFI techniques designed for foot-mounted systems with fixed detection parameters, our method introduces a smartphone-oriented method tailored for unrestricted handheld use. A self-attention mechanism is employed to reject faulty QSMFIs, dynamically adjusting window sizes and detection thresholds based on historical magnetic stability, allowing detection across diverse environments and motion contexts. These calibrated headings are integrated within a loosely coupled Extended Kalman Filter that fuses dead reckoning and Wi-Fi fingerprinting for robust position estimation. Real-world experimental results demonstrate that the integrated approach significantly outperforms in reducing drift and enhancing positioning robustness."

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of gene expression levels across different tissues is of great significance in understanding the functional roles of genes in various biological processes and assisting in transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS). Traditional methods rely on the construction of a prediction model for each gene in a specific tissue, which is time-consuming and inefficient when dealing with numerous genes or tissues. In addition, current approaches do not consider missing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the training population. These SNPs significantly affect gene expression levels and in turn limit the predictive capability of these approaches in new samples. Recent research indicates that by identifying a specific group of core genes (known as landmark genes) that accurately reflect the cellular states of samples across different experimental conditions, it is possible to predict the expression levels of other genes in the genome. In light of this, we propose AGEP_TWAS (Adaptive Gene Expression Predictor for TWAS), a gene expression prediction method that utilizes a dense connection network, adaptive activation functions, and parameter pruning strategies within a nonlinear feature extraction computational framework. AGEP_TWAS leverages landmark genes within a tissue to predict the expression levels of other genes that are challenging to predict using traditional methods. Results on the human GEO expression dataset demonstrate that AGEP_TWAS achieved a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.1821 and a Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.9004, outperforming existing state-of-the-art prediction models. Additionally, when applied to the CattleGTEx dataset to infer gene expression levels across different tissues in cattle, AGEP_TWAS exhibited superior predictive performance compared to existing methods. A TWAS on milk production traits in cattle highlights the practical utility of AGEP_TWAS, with six identified significant genes already reported in scientific literature to be associated with milk production traits."

To exploit MG potential, a DS Operator (DSO) requires an effective energy trading strategy that incentivizes MG Operators (MGOs) to actively exchange energy and preserves MGO benefits. This paper proposes a new energy trading strategy with multiple responses from MGOs. Firstly, a multi-objective optimization problem is performed to create the MGO Pareto front and solved through the proposed optimization framework by combining a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning with random sampling training, a predictive-guide model to generate proper single-objective problems, and a point estimation method to evaluate practical MGO objective values. Secondly, the proposed energy trading strategy allows all MGOs to use their Pareto solutions to respond to the DSO’s dynamic buying energy rate, while the DSO is modeled as a DRL agent to learn MGO’s multiple responses from Pareto solutions. Three low-voltage MGs are connected to a medium-voltage DS. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed optimization framework enables MGOs to generate Pareto fronts with high adaptability to MG uncertainties. Also, MGOs effectively respond to the dynamic buying rate by using the proposed energy trading strategy, while the DSO optimally determines the dynamic buying rate, reducing the monthly DSO cost by up to 5.24% compared to a constant buying rate."

Infidelity effect of the phase response of a Rayleigh backscattered signal (RBS) to an external perturbation is theoretically analyzed, and the expression of the reconstructed signals in the sampling-rate enhanced system is rigorously derived. The expression reveals that differences in the direct-current (DC) offsets of the phase responses contribute to the spurious signals at frequencies associated with the repetition rate of the probe pulses, while differences in the alternating-current (AC) amplitudes lead to the spurious signals at frequencies associated with both the pulse repetition rate and external perturbations. Based on theoretical analysis, a novel method named Active Offset‑Amplitude Correction (AOAC) is proposed to suppress the spurious signals. It eliminates the offsets and compensates the amplitudes of the phase responses retrieved from the RBSs of different optical modes before phase splicing. The validity of the proposed method is confirmed through high-fidelity detection of diverse perturbations and a maximum suppression of spurious signal by 38 dB in both simulations and experiments. Benefiting from the proposed method, a high-performance DAS system is implemented along a 497 km fiber link, featuring a high frequency response of 240 Hz and a low noise level of -40 dB at that frequency. This study is crucial for simultaneously achieving long-distance, broad-bandwidth, and high-fidelity sensing in DAS systems."

    "abstract": "Disrupted hand motor functions may be restored through exoskeleton-assisted rehabilitation training. However, the variability of soft tissue in human joints or across individuals and development of an exoskeleton that combines human machine motion compatibility and dynamic compliance pose persistent challenges. We introduce a hybrid single-motor-driven rigid–soft exoskeleton for the index finger to assist in rehabilitation training. A rigid parallel mechanism directly drives the soft component of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint. In addition, we adopt an interlocking mechanism to induce deformation in leaf springs, enabling the coordinated flexion and extension of multiple joints. A motion analysis based on the modified Denavit–Hartenberg convention confirms that the proposed parallel mechanism can compensate for the misalignment displacement of the MCP joint. Based on the displacement and force applied to the soft component by the designed rigid parallel mechanism, kinematic and static analyses along with dimensional optimization are performed on a dual segment parallel leaf spring. A prototype exoskeleton undergoing tests demonstrated Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.998, 0.991, 0.986, for the MCP, proximal and distal interphalangeal (PIP/DIP) joints, respectively. The corresponding joint flexion angles were 68.19°, 81.91°, and 41.64°. The exoskeleton self-aligns with the index finger joints, properly assisting the natural bending motion of the finger to meet rehabilitation training needs of patients. The proposed exoskeleton can assist with a fingertip force of 6.2 N, thereby satisfying grip requirements, while the reduced force on the dorsal surface of the index finger enhances comfort during use. The proposed solution is promising for developing hand exoskeletons."

    "abstract": "In recent years, the mobile crowdsensing (MCS) paradigm has enabled a diverse array of emerging sensing applications by harnessing the collective efforts of ubiquitous mobile users, who collaborate to carry out specific sensing tasks using smart devices. However, the majority of existing works concentrate on a single MCS platform, which struggles to accommodate diverse service requirements. Moreover, these existing researches either consider opportunistic users (OUs) or participatory users (PUs) for task execution, which leads to low task coverage or high recruitment costs, while reducing the sensing quality of tasks. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a multi-platform scenario where OUs and PUs are combined to complement each other. Then, we formulate a multi-platform hybrid user recruitment (MPHUR) problem within the limited platform budget and user time budget and decompose it into two NP-hard subproblems. To maximize the total sensing quality of tasks, we propose a Two-phase cross-platform Hybrid User recruitment Strategy called THUS. In the first phase, we present a greedy-based opportunistic user recruitment algorithm to match the user-task pair iteratively with maximum sensing quality according to the shortage degree of PUs. In the second phase, the MCS platforms assign PUs to complete the tasks that OUs fail to cover based on their residual budget. We propose a multi-task minimum-cost flow algorithm to recruit PUs for the remaining tasks. The extensive experiments are conducted on two real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed THUS."

    "abstract": "As recommendation systems have become foundational to digital platforms, the integration of large language models (LLMs) into these systems offers transformative potential. In LLM-based recommendation (LLMRec) systems, LLMs excel at capturing nuanced user pReferences, greatly enhancing personalization and recommendation accuracy. However, LLMRec systems face data governance issues, such as data privacy, outdated data, poisoned data, and copyrighted data. All these data government scenarios require the removal of data and its impact from large models like LLMRec. This poses significant challenges as existing solutions struggle to accurately delete target data from such complex systems. Motivated by this, we propose an LLMRec unlearning system based on adapter-driven logits modification in this work. This mechanism addresses the unique characteristics of LLMRec’s complex parameters and network structure, enabling precise and effective unlearning while maintaining recommendation performance. Our approach offers several key advantages: 1) using adapters reduces training costs during the unlearning process; 2) a knowledge distillation (KD)-powered logits modification mechanism ensures that the model can still engage in effective reasoning after unlearning, leveraging its existing knowledge logic to maintain high-quality recommendations; and 3) an additional adapter-based general knowledge retention module is incorporated to preserve the core language capabilities of the LLMRec system, ensuring that its foundational performance remains intact. Extensive experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed system.

    "abstract": "With the evolution from 5G to 6G, ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) faces increasingly stringent performance requirements. Lower latency constraints demand shorter channel codeword length, which can severely degrade decoding performance. The massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system is considered a crucial technology to address this challenge due to its abundant spatial degrees of freedom (DoF). While polar codes are theoretically capacity-achieving in the limit of infinite codeword length, their practical applicability is limited by the latency penalty associated with the long codewords. In this paper, we establish a unified theoretical framework and propose a novel spatiotemporal two-dimensional (2-D) polar coding scheme for massive MIMO systems employing minimum mean square error (MMSE) receivers. The polar transform is jointly applied over both spatial and temporal dimensions to fully exploit the large spatial DoF. By leveraging the near-deterministic signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) property of MMSE detection, the spatial domain is modeled as a set of parallel Gaussian sub-channels. Within this framework, we theoretically analyze the 2-D polarization behavior based on the Gaussian approximation method and show that the proposed scheme asymptotically retains its capacity-achieving property, even under finite blocklength constraints and large spatial DoF. Simulation results further demonstrate that, compared to traditional time-domain polar codes, the proposed 2-D scheme can significantly reduce latency while guaranteeing reliability, or alternatively improve reliability under the same latency constraint—offering a capacity-achieving and latency-efficient channel coding solution for massive MIMO systems in future 6G URLLC scenarios."

    "abstract": "We propose a framework to design integrated communication and computing (ICC) receivers capable of simultaneously detecting data symbols and performing over-the-air computing (AirComp) in a manner that: a) is systematically generalizable to any nomographic function, b) scales to a massive number of user equipments (UEs) and edge devices (EDs), c) supports the computation of multiple independent functions (streams), and d) operates in a multi-access fashion whereby each transmitter can choose to transmit either data symbols, computing signals or both. For the sake of illustration, we design the proposed multi-stream and multi-access method under an uplink setting, where multiple single-antenna UEs/EDs simultaneously transmit data and computing signals to a single multiple-antenna base station (BS)/access point (AP). Under the communication functionality, the receiver aims to detect all independent communication symbols while treating the computing streams as aggregate interference which it seeks to mitigate; and conversely, under the computing functionality, to minimize the distortion over the computing streams while minimizing their mutual interference as well as the interference due to data symbols. To that end, the design leverages the Gaussian belief propagation (GaBP) framework relying only on element-wise scalar operations coupled with closed-form combiners purposebuilt for the AirComp operation, which allows for its use in massive settings, as demonstrated by simulation results incorporating up to 200 antennas and 300 UEs/EDs. The efficacy of the proposed method under different loading conditions is also evaluated, with the performance of the scheme shown to approach fundamental limiting bounds in the under/fully loaded cases."

    "abstract": "Due to multidimensional heterogeneity, Multimodal Federated Learning (MMFL) confronts fundamental challenges including modality incongruence, modality agnosticism, and modality incompleteness. Existing methods face a trilemma: leveraging external data with privacy risks, isolating features to restrict cross-modal interaction, or incurring high overhead from complex graph-based coordination, all culminating in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a Modality-Agnostic Hybrid Federated Learning (MA-HyFL) framework that synergistically integrates unimodal and multimodal federated processes in modality-agnostic scenarios. Specifically, a bidirectional cross-modal knowledge distillation is employed to promote comprehensive collaboration at inter-client and intra-client levels, enabling robust knowledge transfer among heterogeneous modalities. A reinforcement learning-based aggregation mechanism is further introduced to orchestrate federated workflows through reward-driven policy optimization, dynamically integrating contributive client selection and adaptive aggregation weighting for closed-loop decision-making. Extensive experiments show that MA-HyFL significantly outperforms the other baseline methods in four realistic real-world applications, each exhibiting varying degrees of statistical heterogeneity and missing rates."

    "abstract": "In recent years, antenna design problems have become increasingly high-dimensional, strongly nonlinear, and tightly constrained. Existing surrogate-assisted frameworks for antenna optimization are limited in representational capacity, calibrated uncertainty, and handling of multiobjective trade-offs; consequently, they struggle to balance global exploration with precise convergence under restricted simulation budgets. To address these limitations, we propose DGP–DEMO, a surrogate-assisted multiobjective optimization framework for antenna design. DGP–DEMO employs a deep Gaussian process (DGP) as an online surrogate that continuously learns the mapping from design variables to electromagnetic responses and yields per-sample, calibrated uncertainty estimates; couples heuristic search with a Pareto-based fitness to efficiently generate and screen candidates across the parameter space; and introduces a surrogate-guided local refinement stage to improve feasibility and convergence quality. Case studies on two complex antennas show that, relative to existing surrogate-assisted frameworks, DGP–DEMO achieves effective multiobjective optimization of electromagnetic performance with fewer simulations and exhibits strong practical applicability."

The hole configurations are optimized using the Bayesian direct binary search method. The multiplexers are the smallest among those validated through experimental demonstration with 20-nm channel spacing. The C-band multiplexer exhibits a low insertion loss of 3 dB and dimensions of 13.8 μm × 7.58 μm. Tolerance analyses indicate that spectral shifts caused by waveguide width deviations is 1/10 of that caused by hole diameter deviations. The O-band multiplexer, suitable for coarse wavelength division multiplexing systems, exhibits an insertion loss of 3.6 dB and dimensions of 12.7 μm × 7.9 μm.

Traditional ground-based EM monitoring systems, constrained by limited spatial coverage, are insufficient to meet the growing demand for wide-area EM sensing. In contrast, space-based EM sensing provides inherently broader observation coverage. Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites offer reduced propagation latency relative to medium-Earth-orbit (MEO) and geostationary-orbit (GEO) satellites, flexible deployment, and high spatiotemporal resolution, making them particularly suitable for constructing a global space-based EM sensing network. Ultra-dense LEO constellations can collaboratively receive terrestrial EM signals and share data across nodes, improving sensing continuity, robustness, and coverage. However, the massive, heterogeneous, and dynamic EM data generated by distributed satellites challenges traditional signal processing, particularly in cross-node fusion and spatiotemporal feature extraction. Deep learning (DL), with its end-to-end modeling and feature learning capabilities, shows strong potential in modulation recognition, interference identification, and passive localization. Integrating DL with multi-LEO cooperation paves the way for accurate, scalable, and intelligent EM sensing. This article proposes an intelligent architecture for multi-LEO satellite cooperative EM sensing, analyzes key challenges in applying DL, and explores potential solutions such as physics-informed priors, self-supervised learning, and multi-task collaboration, while outlining future research directions."

    "abstract": "Machine unlearning considers the removal of the contribution of a set of data points from a trained model, and is often associated with realizing “the right to be forgotten”. In distributed settings, where a server orchestrates training using data available at a set of remote users, unlearning is essential to cope with malicious or corrupted clients. If these are revealed after training is concluded, and the collaborating users are no longer available, unlearning has to be completed solely by the server. Consequently, server-side unlearning conventionally requires the server to store all model updates observed in training, leading to immense storage overhead for preserving the ability to unlearn. In this work we study lossy compression schemes for facilitating distributed server-side unlearning with limited memory footprint. We propose <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">memory-efficient distributed unlearning (MEDU)</i>, a hierarchical lossy compression scheme tailored for server-side unlearning, that integrates user sparsification, differential thresholding, and random lattice coding, to substantially reduce memory footprint. We rigorously analyze MEDU, deriving an upper bound on the difference between the desired model that is trained from scratch and the model unlearned from lossy compressed stored updates. Our bound outperforms the state-of-the-art known bounds for non-compressed decentralized server-side unlearning, even when lossy compression is incorporated. We further provide a numerical study, which shows that suited lossy compression can enable distributed unlearning with notably reduced memory footprint at the server while maintaining the utility of the unlearned model."

    "abstract": "The effectiveness of autonomous decision-making of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) exceeds that of a single one. However, existing methods face critical gaps in within-visual-range (WVR) combat: single-step strategies lack decision depth and precision; non-cooperative multi-UAV frameworks lose tactical advantages-both conflicting with WVR's stringent demands for rapid response and high precision. To bridge these issues, an UAV autonomous decision-making model is proposed. This model incorporates several key components, including a dynamics model with overload control, a relative motion model, an overload maneuver library, and a situation assessment (SA) model. To systematically address the decision-making challenge in WVR engagements, a two-step strategy is adopted to design a 1v1 decision-making method. Specifically, in the first step, preliminary maneuver selection is made using an improved matrix decision-making method, which incorporates a Kalman filter for improved accuracy. Subsequently, the second step involves reoptimizing the decision using an improved genetic algorithm (IGA). Building upon this 1v1 decision-making framework, a 2v1 cooperative decision-making method is proposed-leveraging distributed cooperative principles and information exchange mechanisms. The simulation results show that, compared to the single-step strategy method, the proposed two-step strategy matrix decision-making method significantly reduces the time required to lock onto the enemy and increases tactical advantage. In addition, the proposed cooperative decision-making method outperforms non-cooperative approaches, both in terms of locking time and advantage. The proposed cooperative decision-making framework for UAVs enables significantly enhance efficiency and precision, offering advancements in autonomous operations and real-time decision-making systems."

Nevertheless, its real-world performance remains hampered by the low data transmission rate. In this paper, we leverage reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) and differential index modulation (DIM) in LoRa uplink systems, and develop a RIS-aided LoRa uplink transmission scheme with DIM to enhance the transmission data rate of the system. In the transmission design, additional information is conveyed by constructing RIS-aided space-time coding blocks and utilizing the activation sequence of receiving antenna array elements, followed by demodulation through a differential encoding-based IM strategy that does not require channel state information (CSI). In the detection design, the orthogonal characteristics of LoRa are leveraged to decouple the detections of LoRa symbols and RIS-aided space-time coding blocks, employing sphere decoding algorithms to reduce the complexity of differential detection. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed transmission and detection design inherits the non-coherent detection characteristics of traditional LoRa and significantly enhances both the data rate and bit error rate performances of the system."

Despite their critical role, a holistic framework for proactively identifying and mitigating the causes of early-stage business failures remains limited. This study addresses this gap by introducing the Business Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (BFMEA) framework - an innovative, structured methodology tailored to reduce failure rates among small technology businesses (STBs), a key subset of the small industry sector. Drawing inspiration from the traditional Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) used in product development, BFMEA adapts its principles to the business context, integrating both financial and non-financial risk dimensions. The business framework prioritizes failure modes based on the severity of their financial impact and the value they deliver, addressing significant limitations of traditional FMEA approaches. Employing the elaborated Action Design Research (eADR) methodology, the study evolved the BFMEA theory, and the artifact progressed through diagnosis, design, and iterative implementation stages. Collaboration with academic experts and STB practitioners was central in shaping and refining the BFMEA worksheet artifact. Real-world feedback from initial implementations revealed the tool's practical utility in improving business resilience and reducing risk exposure. Additionally, the framework offers value to investors, such as venture capitalists and business angels, by serving as a pre-investment risk assessment tool. The study highlights the effectiveness of academic-practitioner collaboration in evolving applied solutions and positions BFMEA as a scalable, cost-effective approach for enhancing the long-term sustainability of small enterprises."

By integrating real-time gait-phase detection with visual-inertial data fusion, our system demonstrates improved robustness against transient sensor perturbations and high-frequency vibrations inherent in dynamic locomotion. Quantitative evaluations reveal that this gait-adaptive optimization framework achieves superior tracking performance compared with conventional SLAM implementations, with lower absolute trajectory error, higher loop closure detection accuracy, and enhanced mapping consistency with less drift and overlap. The proposed architecture effectively decouples locomotion-induced sensor noise from true environmental observations, maintaining relatively high tracking precision even under severe gait disturbances (peak acceleration > 13<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m/s<sup>2</sup></i>).

However, most existing methods either rely solely on RSSI or on phase, or fuse active radios with power-hungry IMUs, which undermines RFID’s core advantages of low cost and easy deployment. To explore the potential of passive tags, this paper designs a measurement setup and an algorithm tailored for an embedded, battery-free 3-axis accelerometer RFID tag. The approach exploits (i) changes in the gravity projection induced by target pose, and (ii) an approximately linear relation between tag orientation and backscatter phase. Fitting the two-antenna phase model to the measured phases via a Gauss–Newton nonlinear leastsquares optimizer, a centimeter-level, step-wise position tracking under planar motion constraints is acieved, while maintaining a simple hardware configuration and reduced algorithmic complexity. The approach is targeted at mechanically guided scenarios (e.g., doors, rails, panels) where coplanarity can be enforced by design. Under similar geometric constraints, the method achieves comparable accuracy while reducing hardware complexity and deployment requirements."

In this paper, we propose a novel remote sensing VQA framework that leverages semantic segmentation results to enhance the extraction and focus of critical visual features. Our model employs a dual-branch feature extraction strategy: one branch captures pixel-level features using a convolution neural network (CNN) backbone, while the other utilizes a graph neural network (GNN) to model the relationships among segmented regions, thereby extracting high-level, category-specific semantic information. In addition, an auxiliary contrastive learning module is integrated to align key terms in the question with corresponding regions in the segmentation map, effectively distinguishing foreground from background elements and reinforcing the model’s attention on question-relevant areas. Extensive experiments on the EarthVQA, RescueNet-VQA, and FloodNet-VQA datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of VQA accuracy. Our results highlight the benefits of incorporating semantic segmentation as a prior, offering a comprehensive and interpretable solution that lays the groundwork for future research in remote sensing VQA."

    "abstract": "In this paper, a predictor-based fuzzy safety control framework is proposed for uncertain nonlinear systems with reference-independent output constraints. A safety-compliant reference regulation mechanism is developed to reshape potentially infeasible references into safety reference signals, thereby eliminating the conventional admissible-reference assumption. A novel dual-constraint framework is developed to simultaneously enforce output constraints and prescribed performance in a unified manner, allowing explicit boundary construction without undesirable coupling. To handle uncertainty, a predictor-based simplified fuzzy approximator is constructed, in which prediction errors rather than tracking errors are employed to update the norm of weight vector, substantially reducing computation complexity and alleviating transient chattering. Meanwhile, the use of prediction errors also decouples control and estimation loops, thereby simplifying the stability analysis. Furthermore, a new transient analysis theorem is established to quantify chattering degree and explicitly reveal the influence of design parameters. Rigorous Lyapunov-based analysis proves that all closed-loop signals remain bounded, and both safety and performance constraints can be strictly satisfied. Simulation results validate the usefulness and superiority the proposed method."

In the proposed array, a lower-band (LB) ±45°-polarized dipole antenna is interlaced among four higher-band (HB) ±45°-polarized dipole antennas. To suppress the coupling effect of LB antenna on HB antennas, four Absorbers A are placed above the LB antenna. For the LB antenna, the Absorbers A can absorb the scattering wave from induced HB coupling current, but do not affect the in-band radiation. To mitigate the electromagnetic blockage effect, the LB radiators are designed to pass the HB electromagnetic wave. Each HB antenna element is surrounded by four Absorbers B for suppressing the resonance interference caused by the LB common-mode currents on the HB feeding baluns. Compared with previous works, the proposed array has wider LB of 1.4-2.2 GHz and HB of 3.8-5.2 GHz, higher cross-band isolation of over 33dB and stable radiation patterns. By virtue of the superior advantages, the proposed array is a good solution for multiband communication application scenarios."

This paper aims to address this issue. Specifically, we investigate an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based wide-band device-to-device (D2D) network with multiple multi-antenna transceiver pairs accessing various subcarriers. We optimize resource management (RM), i.e., beamforming and power control, to maximize the worst-case achievable rate among all transceiver pairs under the beamforming and power constraints. The RM problem is a challenging large-scale non-convex problem. We propose joint and separate designs offering different worst-case achievable rate and computation time trade-offs by solving the RM problem and a resultant power control (PC) problem for separately optimized beamforming using optimization and deep learning techniques. First, we propose two parallel successive convex approximation (PSCA)-based parallel iterative algorithms to obtain stationary points of the RM and PC problems. Both can achieve completely parallel and closed-form per-iteration updates, significantly reducing the computation times. Next, we propose two data and model-driven deep learning methods that optimally select good channel state information (CSI)-adaptive initial points for RM-PSCA and PC-PSCA and effectively unroll the two PSCA-based algorithms into neural networks with the algorithm parameters as tunable parameters. Both further reduce the underlying algorithms’ computation times while achieving appealing worst-case achievable rates based on training over vast samples. Numerical results demonstrate the proposed approaches’ superior advantages over the state of the art."

Our multi-branch design processes each feature type through specialized BiLSTM pathways with attention mechanisms, enabling the model to learn distinct spatial, temporal, and structural patterns. To ensure robust performance in real-world scenarios, we incorporate label smoothing, gradient clipping, and adaptive learning strategies. Evaluated on the IndoorActionDataset with 8 activity classes, our approach achieves 95.6% test accuracy, significantly outperforming OpenPose-based methods (87.2%) and 3D-CNN with Transformer architectures (75.1%). With only 23ms inference latency, the system demonstrates practical viability for real-time deployment on resource-constrained devices. The results confirm that thoughtful feature engineering combined with attention-driven temporal modeling can deliver both accuracy and efficiency for activity recognition tasks."

While 2D tracking suffers from double-counting and 3D reconstruction requires offline processing, we propose a real-time crop counting framework that incrementally constructs global 3D crop instances during data collection. Each crop is modeled as a 3D oriented bounding box, initialized upon detection and updated with subsequent observations. To ensure robust association across frames, we employ 3D Generalized Intersection over Union (GIoU) for spatial matching and confidence-based filtering for validation, effectively reducing double-counting in dense orchards. Unlike prior methods, our approach supports on-the-fly counting without post-hoc reconstruction and performs reliably in unstructured field conditions. Experimental results demonstrate the accuracy and real-time capability of the proposed system in dense agricultural settings."

This revealed the evolution of electron density and temperature throughout the stages, along with frequency-dependent effects on plasma parameters and thedegree of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE).

    "abstract": "With the increase in voltage levels of power systems, converter transformers are more susceptible to internal high-energy arcing faults because of their compact structure, causing pressure to increase inside the tank and ultimately resulting in deflagration accidents. Conventional pressure relief devices (PRDs) suffer limitations in terms of response speed and pressure relief capacity, making them inadequate for severe arcing faults within converter transformers. In this context, a novel approach based on resistive-type superconducting fault current limiters (R-SFCLs) is proposed to suppress overpressure. Specifically, a coupled model is established, in which the magnetic field, electric circuit, arc nonlinear characteristics, R-SFCLs insertion, and fluid-structure interactions are integrated. Afterward, a corresponding numerical method is developed and implemented. Simulations performed involving an actual 500 kV converter transformer reveal that the deployment of R-SFCLs effectively limits the arc power and the released energy. Moreover, combined with PRDs operation, the proposed method significantly mitigates overpressure inside the tank. Compared with the scenario without R-SFCLs, the peak pressure is reduced by 21.1% under a severe interturn fault shorting 30% of the grid side winding, and this effect increases with increasing fault severity."

However, the winding pattern of these generators introduces an imbalance in the mutual inductances between phases, resulting in second-order harmonics in the dc output current of the rectifier. This paper presents a dynamic model to explain the effects of these imbalances on the harmonic performance of the output dc power. Sequence component networks are derived to quantify the dc current ripple in terms of the unequal mutual inductances of the active port winding. A feedforward-based control strategy is proposed to reduce the current ripple, thereby compensating for asymmetry in the active port control system, and improving the quality of dc power delivered to the grid. The proposed concepts are validated through simulations of a 4-port, 120 kW prototype generator-rectifier system, with experimental validation performed on the same machine at a scaled-down power level."

However, the powerful cross-modal representation capability of vision-language model (VLM) provides a promising approach. The traditional methods that rely on real-time channel state information are computationally expensive and often fail to maintain accuracy in such environments. In this paper, we present a VLM-driven multimodal beam prediction framework that integrates multimodal data via modality-specific encoders. To enforce cross-modal consistency, we adopt a sequential contrastive pre-training strategy to align visual features with text prompts for semantic injection, followed by alignment with light detection and ranging. We use location information as text prompts and connect it to the text encoder to introduce the language modality, which further improves cross-modal consistency. Experiments on the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">DeepSense-6G</i> dataset show that our VLM backbone provides additional semantic grounding.

However, their extreme hardware/software diversity, volatile availability, and variable network conditions render traditional schedulers ineffective, leading to suboptimal task completion. In this work, we present REACH (Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Allocation in Community and Heterogeneous Networks), a Transformer-based reinforcement learning framework that redefines task scheduling as a sequence scoring problem to balance performance, reliability, cost, and network efficiency. By modeling both global GPU states and task requirements, REACH learns to adaptively co-locate computation with data, prioritize critical jobs, and mitigate the impact of unreliable resources. Extensive simulation results show that REACH improves task completion rates by up to 17%, more than doubles the success rate for high-priority tasks, and reduces bandwidth penalties by over 80% compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Stress tests further demonstrate its robustness to GPU churn and network congestion, while scalability experiments confirm its effectiveness in large-scale, high-contention scenarios."

    "abstract": "Portable quartz piezoelectric Weigh-In-Motion (WIM) systems frequently suffer from low accuracy due to environmental noise and spatial sensitivity non-uniformity (SSNU), particularly under complex dynamic loading conditions. Previous studies often lack rigorous validation in realistic measurement scenarios. To address these challenges and ensure practical applicability, this paper proposes a multi-modal optimization method integrating novel sensor mechanics, hybrid filtering, and spatial compensation. First, a robust sensor structure featuring an oscillation damping layer and a pre-tightening stabilization mechanism was designed, optimizing the damping ratio to 0.2 – 0.3 to stabilize dynamic response. Second, a hybrid filtering architecture combining zero-phase high-pass filtering with custom chirp wavelet thresholding was developed. This method effectively extracts impact features from power frequency interference, improving the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) by 17.32 dB. Crucially, to validate the system under realistic weighing conditions, a comprehensive experimental campaign was conducted, including multi-point dynamic loading and variable impact tests. Based on the experimental data, a multiregion nonlinear position compensation model was established. Results demonstrate that this model achieves a coefficient of determination (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R<sup>2</sup></i>) of 0.9918 in the central load-bearing zone and reduces the Spatial Sensitivity Non-Uniformity (SSNU) in this region by 72.56%, significantly lowering the coefficient of variation (CV) of the central zone to within 10%. Furthermore, statistical evaluation confirms significantly improved spatial sensitivity uniformity across different loading zones.This study provides a validated, high-precision solution for portable dynamic weighing in smart transportation infrastructure."

    "abstract": "Low back pain often involves paraspinal muscle degeneration. Rehabilitation robots can provide high-consistency exercise therapy, but current technologies face the challenge of delivering personalized training to patients with various muscular conditions. To solve the issue, this work proposes an automated framework that translates sparse clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans into personalized robotic lumbar rehabilitation strategies. First, a Bayesian fusion method with adaptive observation confidence is proposed to enable automatic posterior inference of the 3D paraspinal muscle geometry from sparse MRI. Key biomechanical parameters, including physiological cross-sectional area and fat infiltration, are extracted from the reconstructed muscle shapes to create a patientspecific musculoskeletal model. Based on the personalized model, a hierarchical optimization framework is developed to generate rehabilitation strategies of the combined multi-degree-of-freedom (multi-DOF) motions and dynamic interaction forces to maximize the target muscle activation. Validation on multi-center datasets demonstrates 90% dice similarity for the muscle reconstruction. Personalized validation experiments on volunteers with varying muscle fat infiltration levels revealed that conventional empirical force strategies failed to adapt to individual differences, leading to risks of activation overload or insufficient stimulation. In contrast, the proposed personalized strategy reduced the activation level variance by 60.49% compared to the empirical strategy and maintained the target activation error within 4%. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly mitigates individual uncertainties, ensuring both safety and effectiveness in robotic rehabilitation."

However, current mainstream classification algorithms struggle to eliminate the need for calibration and rely on expensive labeled data, limiting the practical usability of ERP based BCIs. The development of fully unsupervised algorithms is essential for the advancement of practical applications of BCI systems. Methods: In this study, we propose a novel unsupervised classification method called sliding-window distribution distance maximization (sDDM). This algorithm utilizes sliding windows to highlight important temporal features and transforms the metric of inter-class differences from absolute distances to relative distribution distances in Mahalanobis space, while incorporating information on target event similarity from the BCI paradigm. Additionally, our proposed spatial dimensionality reduction strategy ensures smaller spatial dimensions and more prominent spatial features. Results: We compare our proposed method to other state of-the-art unsupervised classification methods and evaluate it offline on our self-collected dataset, a public dataset recorded during the use of a P300 Speller by patients with ALS, and the BCI Competition III Dataset II. Our results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves the best spelling accuracy across all datasets, surpassing other unsupervised algorithms. We further explore its improvement effectiveness through ablation experiments. Conclusion: Our proposed method enhances the performance of unsupervised classification in ERP-based BCIs."

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral image contains rich spectral and spatial information. The existing hyperspectral image classification methods, which rely solely on superpixel level features, suffer from the limitation of fixed kernel functions, failing to adequately account for the spectral similarity relationships between pixels and ignoring the correlations between feature dimensions. This leads to insufficient feature extraction and inefficient utilization of data. In the classification stage, existing hyperspectral image classification methods lack a dynamic optimization mechanism for the utilization of information from unlabeled samples. To address these challenges, a two-branch semi-supervised classification method based on incremental dictionary learning for hyperspectral image is proposed, where the two branches are designed to extract pixel level features and superpixel level features. In this method, the pixel spatial distance-enhanced multi-scale convolutional neural network is used to extract pixel level features, and the U-Net with superpixel segmentation based on adaptive composition is used to extract the superpixel level features under the graph structure of different scales. Then, the above two features are fused. Finally, the features are classified by sparse graph regularization based on incremental dictionary learning. Empirical studies conducted on four standard datasets verify the superior performance of our method."

    "abstract": "Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has achieved remarkable success in graph self-supervised learning (SSL) through an augmenting-contrasting paradigm. Existing augmentation strategies typically generate augmentations independently, ignoring the explicit modeling of the underlying relationship between augmentations, i.e., <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">augmentation discrepancy</i>. In addition, previous discrete augmentations (e.g., edge dropping and feature masking) also hinder the path toward joint optimization. These limit the diversity and complementarity of augmentations, leading to the suboptimal contrastive learning. In this article, we propose a novel adversarial augmentation method, called adversarial augmentation with maximum discrepancy for GCL (AMD-GCL), to jointly optimize pairwise augmentations. The core of AMD-GCL is an adversarial augmentation constraint module that maximizes the discrepancy between pairwise augmentations. Specifically, we establish a theoretical analysis indicating that maximizing graph reconstruction error in a continuous space serves as a surrogate for minimizing mutual information (MI), laying the basis for the differentiable constraint of augmentation discrepancy. Based on this, AMD-GCL designs a min–max problem. We directly add continuous adversarial perturbations to the original graph structure and features to maximize the reconstruction error. Meanwhile, we maximize the reconstruction error between pairwise augmentations to amplify the discrepancy. This leads to a maximization problem. After obtaining augmentations, AMD-GCL optimizes both the contrastive loss and reconstruction objectives, deriving a unified minimization problem. The adversarial augmentations are iteratively updated during the training process. Comprehensive experiments on 18 datasets demonstrate the superiority and robustness of AMD-GCL on several downstream tasks and various adversarial scenarios."

    "abstract": "The significance of multimodal feature fusion in multimodal-based fake news detection is crucial. However, each modality’s contribution to the final detection outcome varies, and due to substantial differences in data distribution, a simple fusion approach is often inadequate. While existing works attempt to perform multimodal fusion using attention mechanisms, they still face the challenge of modal laziness—where a modality may be underutilized during training due to its low weight, resulting in insufficient learning. In this article, we propose the model alternative learning network (AlLNet). AlLNet addresses the issue of modal laziness by learning unimodal features separately during the training stage and employing an alternating independent training process. Additionally, it incorporates contrast learning to enhance the discriminative ability of image features. During the inference stage, AlLNet evaluates the uncertainty of different modalities using entropy and combines their predictions dynamically with appropriate weights to produce the final result. Moreover, AlLNet is designed to be lightweight and effectively handles modalities missing, making it well-suited for real-world applications. Our experiments conducted on three real-world datasets in English and Chinese demonstrate the advantages and effectiveness of our approach."

To ensure the robustness of <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">RopStitch</i>, we propose to incorporate the universal prior of content perception into the image stitching model by a dual-branch architecture. It separately captures coarse and fine features and integrates them to achieve highly generalizable performance across diverse unseen real-world scenes. Concretely, the dual-branch model consists of a pretrained branch to capture semantically invariant representations and a learnable branch to extract fine-grained discriminative features, which are then merged into a whole by a controllable factor at the correlation level. Besides, considering that content alignment and structural preservation are often contradictory to each other, we propose a concept of virtual optimal planes to relieve this conflict. To this end, we model this problem as a process of estimating homography decomposition coefficients, and design an iterative coefficient predictor and minimal semantic distortion constraint to identify the optimal plane.

    "abstract": "Disrupted hand motor functions may be restored through exoskeleton-assisted rehabilitation training. However, the variability of soft tissue in human joints or across individuals and development of an exoskeleton that combines human machine motion compatibility and dynamic compliance pose persistent challenges. We introduce a hybrid single-motor-driven rigid–soft exoskeleton for the index finger to assist in rehabilitation training. A rigid parallel mechanism directly drives the soft component of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint. In addition, we adopt an interlocking mechanism to induce deformation in leaf springs, enabling the coordinated flexion and extension of multiple joints. A motion analysis based on the modified Denavit–Hartenberg convention confirms that the proposed parallel mechanism can compensate for the misalignment displacement of the MCP joint. Based on the displacement and force applied to the soft component by the designed rigid parallel mechanism, kinematic and static analyses along with dimensional optimization are performed on a dual segment parallel leaf spring. A prototype exoskeleton undergoing tests demonstrated Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.998, 0.991, 0.986, for the MCP, proximal and distal interphalangeal (PIP/DIP) joints, respectively. The corresponding joint flexion angles were 68.19°, 81.91°, and 41.64°. The exoskeleton self-aligns with the index finger joints, properly assisting the natural bending motion of the finger to meet rehabilitation training needs of patients. The proposed exoskeleton can assist with a fingertip force of 6.2 N, thereby satisfying grip requirements, while the reduced force on the dorsal surface of the index finger enhances comfort during use. The proposed solution is promising for developing hand exoskeletons."

By deploying a new device-centric power model for cascode PA stages, it is first shown how an enhanced output power can be achieved by precisely choosing the device sizes in a cascode PA. Leveraging this finding, a novel three-transistor configuration is introduced where the additional transistor not only reuses the excess current due to the device size mismatch, but also helps increase the power gain. To further enhance the output power across a large bandwidth, a 4-way slotline-based dual-coupled differential power combiner (DCDPC) is proposed. An even-odd mode analysis is presented to evaluate the impedance matching performance of the DCDPC combiner. By combining the proposed PA stage and the broadband combiner, a three-stage PA is designed and fabricated in a 65-nm bulk CMOS process.

The insulation between turns ensures that the current flows the designed path, resulting in improved predictability during quench events with properly designed protection circuits. Conventional insulated magnets typically use Kapton tapes between turns or wrapped around the conductor, which is functional but limited by its thickness, softness, and lack of mechanical robustness. Our magnet design incorporates key innovations: the application of Pyralux insulation—a very thin Kapton layer laminated between two outer copper sheets without adhesive bonding between conductor turns—to improved mechanical properties and compactness, a four-tapes co-winding technique, which includes two REBCO tapes in parallel to enhance defect tolerance, a copper tape for protection and a Pyralux insulation tape, and the integration of intermediate rings within each single pancake coil to effectively manage mechanical stresses in large-diameter pancakes. The copper laminates in Pyralux provides a robust way to introduce a much thinner Kapton layer between conductor turns than would otherwise be possible. These innovations collectively demonstrate significant advancements in insulated magnet technology for high-field applications."

A large number of NTN nodes, such as satellites, are required to establish a global NTN, but not all operators have the capability to deploy such a system. Therefore, cooperation among multiple operators, facilitated by an orchestrator, enables the construction of virtually large-scale constellations. In this paper, we propose a weak-control-based orchestration framework that coordinates multiple NTN operators while ensuring that operations align with the policies of both the orchestrator and the individual operators. Unlike centralized orchestration frameworks, where the orchestrator determines the entire route from source to destination, the proposed framework allows each operator to select preferred routes from multiple candidates provided by the orchestrator. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, we conducted numerical simulations under various scenarios and network configurations including dynamic NTN environments with time-varying topologies, showing that inter-operator cooperation improves the availability of feasible end-to-end routes. Furthermore, we analyzed the iterative negotiation process to address policy conflicts and quantitatively demonstrated the “price of autonomy,” where strict individual policies degrade global feasibility and performance. The results also demonstrate that outcomes of the proposed framework depend on the operators’ policies and that hop count and latency increase as the number of operators grows. These findings validate the proposed framework’s ability to deliver practical benefits of orchestrated multi-operator collaboration in future NTN environments."

    "abstract": "This paper pioneers the domain of multi-user holographic unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications, establishing a robust foundation for future advancements in next-generation aerial wireless networks. It investigates the joint design of hybrid holographic beamforming and three-dimensional (3D) positioning for a UAV equipped with a reconfigurable holographic surface (RHS), with the objective of maximizing the network’s sum rate. To tackle this inherently complex and non-convex optimization problem, a novel alternating optimization framework is proposed. The solution leverages zero-forcing (ZF) digital beamforming and a gradient ascent strategy to iteratively update the holographic beamforming weights and the UAV’s 3D location, while satisfying key system constraints. This framework is tailored to efficiently navigate the trade-offs between hybrid transceiver design and UAV mobility limitations, ensuring both adaptability and performance scalability. Simulation results confirm that the proposed approach achieves substantial gains in sum rate and system robustness compared to conventional methods, validating its effectiveness under diverse channel and deployment conditions."

    "abstract": "Gaze provides valuable insights into people’s interests and can facilitate seamless interaction with computational systems. However, capturing natural gaze during dynamic motions with compact, low-cost, low-power wearables like earbuds is challenging. While gaze estimation using IMUs has been explored, it typically requires the user to remain still or relies on additional data such as posture, limiting its use in various scenarios. In this work, we propose HeadGaze, which estimates gaze also in walking postures only from a single IMU inside an earbud with an LSTM network. We hypothesized that the acceleration caused by walking can be utilized to estimate the head orientation. To estimate gaze from head orientation, we obtained the linear head-gaze relationship coefficients. Our user study, in which participants looked freely in various postures, showed that our method estimated gaze relative to the body with an error of 12.9 degrees in the yaw direction and 10.2 degrees in the pitch direction. HeadGaze enables gaze estimation using a single IMU inside a wearable device, such as earbuds and smartglasses worn on the head, making gaze interaction techniques available on various devices. Moreover, our method essentially requires only earbuds and a smartphone for user-specific data collection without requiring special equipment such as eye trackers."

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on the dyeing process and scheduling model, conducting an in-depth analysis of the dyeing production process and its characteristics. The core of fabric dyeing involves the systematic transformation of fiber raw materials through multiple precise processes to produce textile products. The industry features tightly interconnected and continuous operations, requiring strict material balance control and the establishment of dynamic monitoring mechanisms to ensure stable quality. Traditional production processes are divided into pre-treatment (including fabric preparation, scorching, degumming, and boiling) and post-treatment (bleaching, mercerization, dyeing, and finishing) stages, each of which significantly impacts fabric quality. However, current market demand changes have posed challenges such as diversified product varieties, rapid style iterations, small order quantities but large total volumes, making traditional fixed production line models difficult to adapt to. Frequent equipment switching leads to increased costs and reduced efficiency. To tackle this issue, a scheduling model covering four product categories was established. Drawing on sales-side order clustering, production notices are created with a batch consolidation strategy for the same product variety; resources are dynamically scheduled by machine unit per the \"first idle\" principle, with defined process sequences, equipment configurations and scheduling logic rules to balance production continuity and multi-variety flexibility. Moreover, the Hyena Algorithm was improved to solve scheduling problems in dyeing workshops, as the original algorithm had three key technical flaws: insufficient population diversity (caused by initial solution generation ignoring process constraints and leading to concentrated individual distribution), unbalanced local/global search capabilities (due to fixed exploration step sizes without dynamic adjustment during iteration), and premature convergence (resulting from the lack of adaptive mutation mechanisms). The improved algorithm added exploration strategies to expand individual movement ranges, optimized position updates through weight coefficients, and set safety distances to avoid local optima. Experimental comparisons showed the improved algorithm significantly outperformed the original in terms of Average Relative Deviation Value (ARDV) and Minimum Relative Deviation (MRD) metrics, converging faster and escaping local optima. It demonstrated robust performance across various working conditions, particularly excelling in complex data scenarios. Under the fixed production line mode, the GP2 algorithm achieved a fitness of 0.005 after 554 iterations, compared to 0.08 for the GP1 algorithm. In the non-fixed production line mode, the Good Programs 2 (GP2) algorithm converged to a fitness of 0.01 after 523 iterations, while the Good Programs 1 (GP1) algorithm reached 0.102 after 578 iterations. This study is expected to promote the transition of the dyeing industry toward efficient and flexible production models, helping enterprises enhance competitiveness in the era of consumer sovereignty and achieve sustainable development."

    "abstract": "Satellite communications (SatCom) are envisioned as a critical enabler of 6G networks, enabling seamless global coverage by integrating terrestrial infrastructures with multi-layered satellite constellations. Among these, the integration between geostationary (GEO) and low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks is particularly attractive, as they combine the broad coverage of GEO satellites with the low latency and high capacity of LEO systems. Within this context, we address the resource allocation problem for LEO satellite through a joint design of beam size and transmit power, while accounting for GEO interference constraints, residual Doppler frequency offsets, and frequency reuse strategies. The objective is to maximize the spectral efficiency of LEO system operating in multi-beam GEO-LEO networks. Motivated by the limitations of classical deep reinforcement learning (RL) in such dynamic orbital settings and the potential of quantum RL for accelerated convergence, we propose a hybrid solution that exploits quantum acceleration during offline training and subsequently exports the learned policy into a classical representational format for onboard LEO satellite deployment. A fully quantum deep deterministic policy gradient framework with variational quantum circuit-based actor and critic is developed, along with a neural network-based policy translator for classical inference. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first deployment-ready quantum RL framework in SatCom, offering efficient offline training, reduced retraining latency, and practical deployment compatibility with existing LEO satellite hardware."

    "abstract": "Cloud data lakes accumulate massive volumes of append-only, high-frequency logs from web servers, gateways, security appliances, and databases. Ensuring their integrity is challenging because existing blockchain-assisted auditing schemes are primarily optimized for static or periodically updated data and provide limited support for continuous ingestion, real-time verification, and auditor access control. These limitations lead to high recomputation overhead, delayed tamper detection, and the lack of reusable proofs required for scalable log publishing.This paper introduces a verifiable log publishing framework based on a newly proposed ancestor-assisted Merkle Tree with stride-based checkpoints for efficient verification of encrypted logs. Each log record is canonically formatted, AEAD-encrypted with metadata binding, and producer-attested prior to storage. Parent-node records and ancestor certificates are distributed via a private Distributed Hash Table (DHT) to enable proof reuse, while only an epoch-level root-of-roots is anchored on a public blockchain to provide tamper-evident integrity guarantees. The framework further supports auditor authorization using certification-authority-issued tokens and incorporates micro-root commitments for near real-time verification. Experimental results demonstrate substantial performance improvements: single-record verification is significantly faster than the strongest baseline, verification throughput is markedly higher, commit latency is greatly reduced, and on-chain storage remains constant across all evaluated epoch sizes. These results confirm that the proposed architecture enables scalable, low-latency, and compliance-aware log integrity verification suitable for modern cloud data lake environments."

    "abstract": "Composite insulator degradation poses severe risks to power grid stability, rendering live detection of internal defects critically significant. The electric field detection method, as a non-contact solution, suffers from lack of field measurement data and unclear criteria for electric field-based degradation identification. To address this challenge, field samples of composite insulators with decayed and carbonized core rods are selected, and electric field distribution tests are conducted to capture the fundamental distortion characteristics induced by degradation. Subsequently, artificial simulation experiments are performed to investigate local electric field distortion characteristics under varying degradation severities, positions, detection distances and different installment configurations. Based on these findings, a four-array local electric field detection method and criteria are proposed and validated through testing on field-degraded insulators. The results indicate that the four-array detection method effectively identifies carbonization and decay defects in composite insulator core rods, with characteristic criteria being that the ratio of maximum to minimum electric field amplitudes Q<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub> satisfies 1<Q<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub><1.4~1.6;the ratio of maximum electric field amplitude to the average of the other three probes Q<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub> satisfies 1<Q<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub><1.3~1.5;and the electric field variation coefficient ΔE<10.

    "abstract": "Few-shot hyperspectral image classification (FHSIC) is crucial for precise land cover identification when labeled samples are scarce, mitigating the prohibitive annotation costs associated with hyperspectral image (HSI) data. However, existing FHSIC methods primarily follow a feature refinement paradigm, which struggles to effectively model the holistic relational structure among samples. Meanwhile, the commonly used attention mechanism tends to focus solely on sample-specific local information, limiting its ability to capture global category knowledge and promote cross-domain generalization. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient Progressive Correlation Refinement Network (PCRNet). Our work pioneers a correlation refinement paradigm, shifting the objective from enhancing feature representations to explicitly reasoning upon the structured query-class relationships. Specifically, PCRNet first constructs a learnable generalized correlation matrix that encodes the inter-sample relationships. Then, we present a simple yet effective memory-guided global attention mechanism to facilitate the injection of category commonality priors into the relational structure from a holistic perspective. This is further combined with query-level adaptive modulation and symmetrical gated integration modules to achieve progressive refinement of the generalized correlation matrix. Finally, the refined correlation is projected as the classification logit, enabling accurate identification of land covers. Experiments on four benchmark HSI datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our approach. We believe this new paradigm opens a promising direction for future FHSIC model design.

A two-stage solution employing a step-up ac-dc stage followed by a step-down dc-dc stage is typically employed to achieve grid to 48 V conversion. This approach suffers from the efficiency penalty of a cascade of power converters and typically lower power density due to the design of two separate power conversion stages. A single-stage, buck-type PFC rectifier where the output dc voltage is lower than the peak ac voltage circumvents these issues. Recently, capacitor-based multi-level power converters have demonstrated superior power density and efficiency compared to conventional two-level designs. This work analyzes and develops a single-stage buck-type PFC rectifier utilizing a six-level flying capacitor multilevel (FCML) converter with active flying capacitor voltage balancing and inductor current control to achieve high performance rectification in a single-stage solution and validates this concept in a hardware prototype. This work is the first to achieve active balancing of the flying capacitor voltages in tandem with PFC operation in a step-down FCML rectifier."

V-TDL supports diverse traffic conditions and road geometries by generating channel instances through well-established probability distributions. Also, it effectively models the parameters of the distributions through realistic geometry-based simulations, achieving the accuracy of a ray-tracing-based model while maintaining the low complexity of a purely stochastic approach. In contrast to existing models, V-TDL accounts for the correlation between propagation paths. Our findings show that this correlation is inherent in high-speed vehicular environments and neglecting it leads to a significant overestimation of channel diversity and system performance. We compare our model to existing alternatives to assess the performance of OTFS and OFDM modulations. The results demonstrate that, unlike traditional models such as the 3GPP EVA, V-TDL captures variations in channel diversity influenced by traffic intensity and road geometry, which impact the OTFS and OFDM performance. Although OTFS is penalized by path correlation, it consistently outperforms OFDM in all evaluated vehicular environments, confirming its suitability for high-speed vehicular communication scenarios."

    "abstract": "The emergence of spatial transcriptomics has greatly advanced our understanding of disease mechanisms, identified novel therapeutic targets, and contributed to progress in personalized medicine. However, its high costs and technical complexity limit its widespread application. A promising alternative is to predict spatial gene expression from H&E-stained pathology images, yet existing methods have not fully exploited the hierarchical information from pathological images. We propose HFFST, a hierarchical feature fusion algorithm for predicting spatial gene expression from H&E-stained pathology images. Leveraging multi-level feature extraction and fusion from whole-slide images, our method employs a coarse-to-fine regression framework to predict spatial transcriptomic profiles. To validate the algorithm's performance, we conducted cross-validation on five public datasets and performed external validation using high-resolution Visium data from 10X Genomics. HFFST has shown promise in predicting spatial gene expression and identifying spatial regions, demonstrating certain advantages over state-of-the-art methods.

In order to address this challenge, the paper introduces L-MACD (Learning-based Multi-modal Adaptive CAPTCHA Defense) a reinforcement learning architecture which modifies the difficulty of CAPTCHA in real-time. The system uses feedback as input continuously to modify its complexity to adapt to the specific user input through the simulated human user and also the AI agents to adjust its the most important parameters like visual distortion, background noise or image rotation. It predicts the most effective defense configuration to be applied in every situation using an adaptive model implemented as a random forest algorithms. Also, a new metric has been proposed, namely Adversarial Gain Equilibrium (AGE), to quantify the extent to which a system remains human-usable and resistant to automated attacks. Four configurations of the framework were tried, being Baseline (G1), LLM-ZSA-CG (G2), Human-Expert (G3) and RL-Adaptive (G4).The findings indicate that L-MACD decreases the AI success rate from 68% to 8% (approximately 85% reduction), while maintaining 85–90% human usability. A t-test supported approach to statistical analysis shows that RL-Adaptive approach is better than static base methodologies. Additional research with SHAP-based explainability shows that rotation and distortion parameters have the greatest effect on adversarial gain reduction. To summarize, L-MACD is a versatile and transparent defense mechanism, which is capable of combating the increasing threat of sophisticated multimodal AI systems."

In this paper, we revisit frequency domain and propose a novel lightweight spatial-frequency joint tuning (SFJT) plugin for referring image segmentation. We decompose 4 mainstream methodology paradigms into two general stages consisting of roughly semantic-level object understanding and precisely pixel-level contour segmentation, then respectively enhance them with parameter-efficient spatial-frequency tuning strategies. Specifically, we develop a spatial-frequency joint prompting technique (SFJ-Prompt) during early object understanding stage, which mines bidirectional spatial-frequency information to realize mutually spatial-frequency boosting, facilitating more comprehensive object understanding. Besides, we introduce a LoRA-based high-frequency auxiliary branch (HF-LoRA) during latter contour segmentation stage, which compensates for heavy high-frequency degeneration issues in spatial neural networks, facilitating more precise contour segmentation. Eventually, extensive experiments of 4 mainstream methodology paradigms for referring image segmentation on 4 large-scale datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method."

We propose a novel approach by employing a microwave radiometer as the core receiver for thermal noise communication systems, based on an equivalent brightness temperature physical model. This model provides a clear and intuitive framework for describing the wireless transmission process of thermal noise, enabling precise analysis of signal generation, propagation, and detection. Theoretical analysis includes deriving the bit error probability (BEP) and investigating the relationships between system parameters and communication performance. Using this model, we separately analyzed the performance of the existing passive thermal noise communication and the active thermal noise communication with additional radio frequency (RF) amplification. Furthermore, we demonstrate a practical covert thermal noise communication system operating at 220 GHz, achieving a transmission distance of 7.7 km at a data rate of 20 kbps. Experimental results validate the theoretical models and highlight the potential of thermal noise communication for high-covertness applications in scenarios such as ground-to-ground, satellite, and uncrewed aerial vehicle communications. This work bridges microwave remote sensing techniques with communication engineering, offering a new paradigm for secure and low-power wireless systems."

    "abstract": "Routing-driven timely data collection in Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks (UASNs) is crucial for marine environmental monitoring, disaster warning, and underwater resource exploration, etc. However, harsh underwater conditions, including high delays, limited bandwidth, and dynamic topologies, make efficient routing decisions challenging in UASNs. In this paper, we propose a smart interrupted routing scheme for UASNs to address dynamic underwater challenges. We first model underwater noise influences from real underwater routing features, e.g., turbulence and storms. We then propose a Software-Defined Networking (SDN)-based Interrupted Software-defined UASNs Reinforcement Learning (ISURL) framework, which ensures adaptive routing through dynamical failure handling (e.g., energy depletion of sensor nodes or link instability) and real-time interrupted recovery. Based on ISURL, we propose the MA-MAPPO algorithm, integrating multi-head attention mask mechanism with MAPPO to filter out infeasible actions and streamline training. Furthermore, to support interrupted data routing in UASNs, we introduce MA-MAPPO_i, MA-MAPPO with interrupted policy, to enable smart interrupted routing decisions in UASNs. The evaluations demonstrate that our proposed routing scheme achieves exact underwater data routing decisions with faster convergence speed and lower routing delays than existing approaches."

Firstly, this paper proposes a novel double stator consequent-pole transverse flux motor (DSCP-TFM) to enhance torque density and motor space utilization. The DSCP-TFM features the tooth and permanent magnets (PMs) distributed on both stators and the rotor. Secondly, the magnetic saturation phenomenon at the tooth tips is explained using the saturation leakage-flux equivalent magnetic-circuit model (SLF-EMCM). It provides a different perspective for analysis. Thirdly, a new structure of the trapezoidal PMs and tooth is proposed. It can reduce magnetic saturation at the tooth tips, further reduce cogging torque, and flux linkage harmonics. Additionally, a 3D finite element analysis (3D-FEA) is conducted to verify the theoretical analysis and to assess the impact of different tooth and PM shapes on motor performance. The effects of trapezoidal tooth angle and air-gap length are also evaluated. Finally, a prototype is manufactured, and experiments are conducted. The experimental results demonstrate that the DSCP-TFM exhibits higher torque output and lower harmonics in the coil flux linkage than existing TFMs, thereby validating the design and analysis."

Still, they often face challenges such as high computational costs and difficulties in parameter tuning. We propose a semi-supervised MVC method called Graph-Regularized and One-Hot-Constrained Symmetric NMF (MGOCS) to avoid these issues relatively. The key advantage of MGOCS includes the introduction of a parameter-free semi-supervised strategy that encodes partial label information as one-hot vectors during decomposition, the use of a shared consistency indicator matrix directly as the clustering assignment matrix for all views, and the incorporation of graph regularization terms for each view. These features effectively balance model complexity with information utilization. An iterative optimization algorithm is developed to solve MGOCS, accompanied by complexity and convergence analysis. Clustering experiments conducted on six multi-view datasets demonstrate that MGOCS outperforms various state-of-the-art methods in terms of clustering performance.

    "abstract": "The global automotive industry is rapidly moving toward electricity for propulsion of personal and commercial mobility. Designing and assembling batteries in house is a priority for many automakers, which brings a new level of complexity and workplace safety challenges to the industry. Lithium-ion batteries powering today’s electric vehicles (EVs) are posing new electrical, thermal, and chemical hazards to the workforce. Battery design standards under IEC, SAE, IEEE, UL, and UN focus on operational and shipping safety of lithium-ion batteries while leaving worker safety to administrative controls such as training, insulated tools, and personal protective equipment (PPE). This article intends to identify some of the hazards posed by these large batteries. There are no lockout/tagout methods available to disable the high voltage inside these batteries. The modular design of some batteries allows for segmentation to reduce the level of hazard, but the trend of cell-to-pack design is making battery segmentation within the energy box challenging. Product design controls are the highest form of hazard elimination in the hierarchy of ­controls, and this article will discuss some aspects of design that can address these hazards and lays the foundation for industry’s best practices and potential future safety requirements in this emerging technology area of battery production, service, and recycling. This article will also discuss some administrative controls where hazard elimination via design solution is not feasible."

    "abstract": "In response to the need for vibration monitoring in high-temperature harsh environments, this paper proposes a miniaturized temperature self-compensated high-temperature and vibration sensor based on step-coated metallized fiber Bragg grating (FBG) twin reflection spectrum. By nickel-plating the half-length region of a single FBG, the reflection spectrum is induced to split into twin peaks. The wavelength difference between the metallized and non-metallized regions is exploited to decouple temperature and vibration signals, eliminating the need for an additional reference FBG. The sensor employs laser welding to fix the step-coated FBG onto a 310S stainless steel flexible hinge elastomer, replacing the traditional adhesive encapsulation, thereby improving its high-temperature resistance up to 600°C. The theoretical models for the nickel plating thickness, temperature-vibration decoupling, and installation stiffness influence are derived and validated. Sensor performance is verified through numerical simulations and experimental tests. The results indicate that, under threaded mounting conditions, the sensor operates within a frequency range of 100–1000 Hz, with a maximum vibration sensitivity of 8.38 pm/g and a natural frequency of 2142 Hz. The lateral interference error is less than 6.54%, and the sensor can withstand shock loads exceeding 80 g. In high-temperature environments, the temperature sensitivities of the metallized and non-metallized FBGs are 24.55 pm/°C and 13.25 pm/°C, respectively, with linear fitting coefficients greater than 0.996. The overall sensor size is Φ22 mm × 15 mm, with a compact structure, making it suitable for health monitoring in high-temperature harsh environments, such as those in gas turbines."

    "abstract": "Press-pack power modules are valued for their reliability and stability, making them indispensable to ensure safe operation of power electronics within smart grids. However, the complex coupling of multiple physical fields in press-pack power modules can present risks to their electrical performance. Accurate measurement of both dc leakage currents and high-frequency switching currents is essential for the comprehensive evaluation of long-term degradation and transient electrical stress in power devices. We proposed a noninvasive dual-mode current sensor based on a wound coil with Co-based amorphous wire core. By sharing a single magnetic core and coil, the sensor exhibits both the giant magneto-impedance (GMI) effect and electromagnetic induction. Integrating the GMI effect for dc to low-frequency measurements with inductive sensing for high-frequency components, the sensor achieves a wide bandwidth from dc to 10 MHz. Compared to single-chip and hybrid current sensors, this design overcame the bandwidth limitations and simplified the sensors. The 10 kHz press-pack fast recovery diode (FRD) was selected for experimental validation due to its accessibility and typical characteristics. The proposed sensor enabled real-time current monitoring, accurately capturing waveform transitions across half-wave rectification, with performance closely matching that of a commercial reference probe. Although the nominal frequency of the FRD is 10 kHz, the associated transient behavior and harmonic content extend into the megahertz range. The dual-mode current sensor accommodates this broadband spectrum, enabling precise waveform reconstruction and comprehensive capture of current transitions."

    "abstract": "Accurate extraction of water surface and width of river systems is essential for hydrological modeling, flood monitoring, and water resource management. Traditional field-based measurements are often labor-intensive, time-consuming, and error-prone. With advances in satellite imaging and geospatial data processing, automated methods are increasingly replacing manual approaches. Yet, remote sensing-based river width extraction remains challenging due to dynamic water levels, vegetation interference, variable discharge, spectral reflections, and heterogeneous surface appearance. Existing convolutional neural network (CNN)–based encoder-decoder models have performed well for large rivers but struggle with narrow ones due to limited high-level semantic representation. Recent transformer-based models capture long-range dependencies through self-attention but are computationally heavy and underexplored in remote sensing. This paper presents <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">RiWiX</i> (River Water Width Extraction), a lightweight six-level segmentation model with an integrated width extraction module. Built upon the Swin Transformer architecture, RiWiX employs an efficient encoder-only design with a simple up-sampling module to restore the output mask, thereby improving computational efficiency. A graph-based algorithm further derives continuous water widths by generating a centerline and computing perpendicular distances along the flow direction, effectively generalizing complex river geometries. Experiments on a public water dataset demonstrate that RiWiX achieves competitive accuracy with reduced complexity compared to baseline methods. Tests on geo-referenced imagery yield a mean absolute error of 0.02%for wide rivers (width>500m), 0.06% for moderate rivers (50m < width < 70m), and 0.11% for narrow rivers (width < 20m), underscoring the robustness and scalability of the proposed framework for river-water-width extraction. The implementation process and code has been made publicly available for researchers to use and extend this work. The full repository is accessible at: https://github.com/FahimaHasanAthina/RiWIX."

The framework addresses three critical limitations: Dynamic movement primitives (DMPs)’ inability to represent preference uncertainty, inadequate trajectory generation beyond observation range in probabilistic movement primitives (ProMPs), and unreliable via-point modulation in hybrid approaches. Our solution features three innovations: First, we establish dynamic-probabilistic consistency conditions for unified DMP-ProMP frameworks, which enable stochastic modeling of human preferences while preserving attractor stability. Second, a novel scaling method decouples shape modulation from model hyperparameters, enabling flexible motion adaptation. Third, consistency-guaranteed expectation-maximization resolves parameter optimization within the unified framework. Experiments on lifting trajectory imitation demonstrate strong extrapolation beyond demonstration distributions, particularly for via-points outside training data, thereby validating adaptability to variable task conditions. In hip exoskeleton-assisted lifting tasks, our approach achieves a 28% improvement in assistance efficiency over conventional implementations."

    "abstract": "Adversarial imitation learning (AIL), a prominent approach in imitation learning, has achieved significant practical success powered by neural network approximation. However, existing theoretical analyses of AIL are primarily confined to simplified settings—such as tabular and linear function approximation—and involve complex algorithmic designs that impede practical implementation. This creates a substantial gap between theory and practice. This paper bridges this gap by exploring the theoretical underpinnings of online AIL with general function approximation. We introduce a novel framework called optimization-based AIL (OPT-AIL), which performs online optimization for reward learning coupled with optimism-regularized optimization for policy learning. Within this framework, we develop two concrete methods: model-free OPT-AIL and model-based OPT-AIL. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that both variants achieve polynomial expert sample complexity and interaction complexity for learning near-expert policies. To the best of our knowledge, they represent the first provably efficient AIL methods under general function approximation. From a practical standpoint, OPT-AIL requires only the approximate optimization of two objectives, thereby facilitating practical implementation. Empirical studies demonstrate that OPT-AIL outperforms previous state-of-the-art deep AIL methods across several challenging tasks."

However, existing VLT methods are limited to 2D spatial tracking or single-object 3D tracking and do not support multi-object 3D tracking within monocular video. This limitation arises because advancements in 3D multi-object tracking have predominantly relied on sensor-based data (e.g., point clouds, depth sensors) that lacks corresponding language descriptions. Moreover, natural language descriptions in existing VLT literature often suffer from redundancy, impeding the efficient and precise localization of multiple objects. We present the first technique to extend VLT to multi-object 3D tracking using monocular video. We introduce a comprehensive framework that includes (i) a Monocular Multi-object 3D Visual Language Tracking (MoMo-3DVLT) task, (ii) a large-scale dataset, MoMo-3DRoVLT, tailored for this task, and (iii) a custom neural model. Our dataset, generated with the aid of Large Language Models (LLMs) and manual verification, contains 8,216 video sequences annotated with both 2D and 3D bounding boxes, with each sequence accompanied by three freely generated, human-level textual descriptions. We propose MoMo-3DVLTracker, the first neural model specifically designed for MoMo-3DVLT. This model integrates a multimodal feature extractor, a visual language encoder-decoder, and modules for detection and tracking, setting a strong baseline for MoMo-3DVLT. Beyond existing paradigms, it introduces a task-specific structural coupling that integrates a differentiable linked-memory mechanism with depth-guided and language-conditioned reasoning for robust monocular 3D multi-object tracking. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods on the MoMo-3DRoVLT dataset. Our dataset and code are available at Github."

This design enables effective fault compensation without conservative disturbance bound selection while maintaining computational efficiency through saturation-based activation. This work establishes uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB) of the closed-loop system under both normal operation and parameter bound violations through Lyapunov analysis.

To address these limitations, we propose ManiVID-3D, a novel 3D RL architecture designed for robotic manipulation, which learns view-invariant representations through self-supervised disentangled feature learning. The framework incorporates ViewNet, a lightweight yet effective module that automatically aligns point cloud observations from arbitrary viewpoints into a unified spatial coordinate system without the need for extrinsic calibration. Additionally, we develop an efficient GPU-accelerated batch rendering module capable of processing over 5000 frames per second, enabling large-scale training for 3D visual RL at unprecedented speeds. Extensive evaluation across 10 simulated and 5 real-world tasks demonstrates that our approach achieves a 40.6% higher success rate than state-of-the-art methods under viewpoint variations while using 80% fewer parameters. The system's robustness to severe perspective changes and strong sim-to-real performance highlight the effectiveness of learning geometrically consistent representations for scalable robotic manipulation in unstructured environments."

However, the causal confusion remains an open problem. To address this issue, we propose the BEVDrive-E2E to explore the interpretability of the end-to-end model by using visual abstractions in bird's eye view (BEV). We design a hybrid BEV fusion module (HBFM) that combines the feature aggregation capabilities of CNN and transformer in both local and global areas. To fully exploit the benefits of BEV representation, we perform BEV detection and segmentation to form a unified semantic BEV map and adopt a two-stage training schedule. We leverage the transformer decoder to predict the sequential path points in an autoregressive manner. Our proposed approach shows the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both CARLA leaderboard 1.0 and leaderboard 2.0."

    "abstract": "Existing constrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (CMOEAs) frequently employ the information provided by the unconstrained Pareto front (UPF) to facilitate the identification of the constrained Pareto front (CPF) for constrained multiobjective optimization problems (CMOPs). However, obtaining a UPF with favorable convergence and diversity is not straightforward, and the obtained UPF is sometimes difficult to effectively assist in the identification of CPF for certain complex CMOPs. To this end, a novel algorithm called DREMCO is proposed, which endeavors to obtain a good UPF and is capable of utilizing the obtained UPF to consistently assist in the identification of CPF. DREMCO consists of a main population for the original problem and a two-phase (propulsion phase and recovery phase) auxiliary population with a dynamics regulation mechanism. In the propulsion phase, the auxiliary population ignores constraints and employs an improved aggregation function to obtain a good UPF, thereby pulling the main population across infeasible regions. In the recovery phase, the auxiliary population uses a penalty function method to converge to CPF and continuously refines the CPF of the main population. Concurrently, a novel phase judgment method is proposed for seamless transition between phases. Furthermore, an information-sharing strategy is proposed, which is capable of sharing information of the parents and offspring in offspring generation and environment selection, respectively. The experimental results with 11 state-of-the-art CMOEAs on five benchmark suites and eight real-world CMOPs demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm."

This review examines a critical paradox in XAI research. While explanation methods can generate insights, three main challenges limit their effectiveness. Firstly, adversarial manipulations can exploit explanations by creating new attack surfaces with over ninety percent success while preserving model accuracy. Secondly, evaluation practices remain primarily computational. Only twenty-six percent of user studies follow human-centered protocols and fewer than twenty-three percent involve domain experts. Thirdly, regulatory requirements, such as the GDPR right to explanation, lack clear technical implementations, complicating compliance. We analyzed the literature across finance, healthcare, and cybersecurity and found that current research emphasizes algorithmic innovation over practical deployment. Moving toward reliable AI requires shifting from simple explanation methods (XAI 1.0) to systems that are aligned with human understanding, resistant to adversarial attacks, and compliant with legal requirements (XAI 2.0). This review provides guidance on key technical advances, evaluation strategies and regulatory clarifications necessary for deployment. trustworthy AI."

    "abstract": "Massive connectivity supports the sporadic access of a vast number of devices without requiring prior permission from the base station (BS). In such scenarios, the BS must perform joint activity detection and channel estimation (JADCE) prior to data reception. Message passing algorithms have emerged as a prominent solution for JADCE under a Bayesian inference framework. The existing message passing algorithms, however, typically rely on some hand-crafted and overly simplistic priors of the wireless channel, leading to significant channel estimation errors and reduced activity detection accuracy. In this paper, we focus on the problem of JADCE in a multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) grant-free random access network. We propose to incorporate a more accurate channel prior learned by score-based generative models (a.k.a. diffusion models) into message passing, so as to push towards the performance limit of JADCE. Specifically, we develop a novel turbo message passing (TMP) framework that models the entire channel matrix as a super node, rather than factorizing it element-wise. This design enables the seamless integration of score-based generative models as a minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) denoiser. The variance of the denoiser, which is essential in message passing, can also be learned through score-based generative models. Our approach, termed score-based TMP for JADCE (STMP-JADCE), takes full advantages of the powerful generative prior and, meanwhile, benefits from the fast convergence speed of message passing. Numerical simulations show that STMP-JADCE drastically enhances the activity detection and channel estimation performance compared to the state-of-the-art baseline algorithms."

This study reveals for the first time that the mutual inductance of DD-type coils initially increases but then decreases as the number of cores in the DD-type receiver increases, contradicting the inherent assumption that mutual inductance is maximized when the core is fully distributed. Furthermore, a core optimization method based on improved deep reinforcement learning is introduced. By integrating a residual structure into the deep neural network, the feature extraction ability of the network is improved. The survival of the fittest strategy is used to identify core locations with high contributions to mutual inductance to improve the optimization speed. The core region is divided into inner and outer layers, and a hierarchical selection strategy is proposed for selecting the two regions separately to reduce the optimization space. A 30-kW prototype and experimental platform were developed to validate the proposed core structure. Compared with the conventional fully filled core structure, the optimized receiver achieved a 28% reduction in core volume and a 2.3% increase in mutual inductance, while maintaining misalignment tolerance, shielding effectiveness, and overall efficiency."

This paper proposes a novel hybrid deep learning framework, ResViViT50, for enhanced recognition of such events in real-world surveillance scenarios. The proposed approach integrates a Reduced ResNet-50 architecture for efficient spatial-temporal feature extraction with a Video Vision Transformer augmented by a motion-aware token selection module that prioritizes salient motion tokens, thereby improving long-range dependency modeling and contextual understanding of group interactions. The Reduced ResNet-50 efficiently processes video frames to learn discriminative features related to individual actions, while the ViViT leverages its attention mechanism to model the spatial and temporal relationships between multiple individuals, enabling accurate recognition of group activities and identification of potentially suspicious collective behaviors. Evaluated on the challenging Real-World Fights 2000 and Real-Life Violence Situations datasets, the proposed model achieves competitive recognition accuracy (up to 92.71% on RLVS and 79% on RWF-2000), while maintaining a low computational complexity of 17.23 GFLOPs and efficient inference times of 5724.11 ms on both datasets. These results underscore the efficacy of the approach in enhancing proactive security applications. This comprehensive evaluation ensures that the proposed approach not only delivers high recognition performance but also meets the practical constraints of real-time automated video surveillance systems.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in spaceborne SAR missions enable multi-frequency soil moisture retrieval; however, the performance of standard surface scattering models at S- and P-bands remains largely underexplored compared to L-, C-, and X-bands. Accordingly, this study has evaluated three widely used surface scattering models (Dubois, Oh, and AIEM) across C-, S-, L- and two alternative P-band frequencies using a combination of satellite and airborne data. These surface scattering models were also calibrated under two scenarios, one characterized by limited spatial and temporal variability and the other having considerable spatial and temporal variability. Results showed that the semi-empirical Dubois and Oh models performed reliably at L-band, with RMSE values around 2.4 dB. However, the AIEM model revealed large biases, under- or over-estimating the backscatter by up to 6.5 dB. However, when calibrating these models against a dataset with similar temporal and spatial characteristics, the bias was reduced considerably, yielding an RMSE below 2 dB in most cases. Nonetheless, model performance deteriorated when applied to data with larger spatial and temporal characteristics, with RMSE increasing to ~3 dB. While the Dubois model outperformed the Oh model in terms of empirical adaptability, both models had poor performance at P-band, likely due to the dominance of subsurface scattering. Meanwhile, the AIEM model results were improved substantially at C-, S-, and L-band when calibrated, but its formulation based solely on surface scattering made it unsuitable for application to P-band, where subsurface contributions were considered to be substantial, especially when the surface was dry, and so could not be compensated through conventional roughness parameter adjustments. Overall, while calibration could enhance the performance of these semi-empirical and theoretical models under consistent temporal and spatial conditions, the greater penetration depth at P-band demands a more advanced scattering representation for accurate backscatter simulation."

    "abstract": "The growing integration of variable renewable energy (VRE) sources into small-scale, isolated, low-inertia power systems has intensified frequency fluctuations, placing increased stress on conventional high-inertia generators and their governors. This study addresses the urgent need for a cost-effective, intermediate solution to mitigate these fluctuations, particularly in systems with limited access to high-capital technologies such as battery storage. A modified Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is proposed, integrating a non-linear inertia weight function and a storming mechanism to overcome the local optimum limitations of conventional PSO. The algorithm was applied to the Laxapana Hydro Complex in Sri Lanka, a key power generation and frequency regulation facility, and an ideal example of a small-scale isolated power system. Real-world system data were used in simulations conducted in MATLAB and PSSE environments. Simulation results across three operational scenarios: general generation fluctuations, solar intermittency, and wind intermittency, demonstrate that the optimized governor settings significantly reduce long-term mechanical movement while maintaining system stability. Specifically, under solar intermittency, governor actuator exhibited approximately a 20% reduction in movement compared to the baseline configuration. This reduction minimizes wear and tear, leading to lower maintenance costs and improved long-term reliability. These findings highlight the potential of the proposed method as a low-cost, adaptable solution for improving governor performance in renewable-integrated systems, offering a pathway toward more reliable and cost-effective power system operations."

Integrated energy systems, with the introduction of external energy networks, hold strong potential for mitigating frequency deviations. This paper proposes a coordinated scheduling framework of multiple frequency services in an electricity-gas-hydrogen coupled integrated energy system based on federated warm starts. On top of the scheduling model of a closed-loop electricity-gas-hydrogen system, we formulate the set of frequency security constraints as linear/bilinear constraints, where generators and electrolyzers with heterogeneous frequency support capabilities collectively contribute to enhanced/primary frequency control. In terms of the bilinear term in the reconfigured nadir frequency constraint, we propose a SplitNN-based federated learning framework to allow the energy systems to collectively generate warm starts for the bilinear variables in a privacy-preserving manner, with which the McCormick envelope can be significantly tightened. Case studies show that the electrolyzers in the hydrogen system can significantly mitigate frequency deviations, while the proposed warm start approach achieves a higher accuracy and computational efficiency."

Experimental results reveal that the force-electric response is characterized by a transient voltage pulse, which escalates during loading and decays prior to macroscopic fracture, irrespective of continued stress application. The peak output voltage and the extent of depolarization exhibit strong strain-rate dependence. We identify a critical intrinsic strain threshold of 9% for PZT-5H, beyond which domain switching saturates and the voltage peaks. A mechanistic model for stress-mediated ferroelastic domain switching (90°, 70°, 109°) is proposed to explain the observed nonlinearity. Furthermore, a constitutive energy release model is developed to accurately predict the total discharged charge as a function of strain rate and load, validated against experimental data with high fidelity (R2 > 0.97). This model provides a robust predictive framework for designing and optimizing ferroelectric-based energy discharge devices."

However, existing studies focus on conventional stochasticity such as fading channels and random task arrivals, while largely overlooking the dynamic service availability of rapidly deployed ad-hoc GBSs in extreme, high-demand scenarios, characterized by a stress-driven lifecycle including resource depletion, probabilistic service disruptions, and delayed recovery. Such dynamics may cause severe energy inefficiency and queue backlogs, undermining system reliability. To address these issues, we formulate a joint optimization problem of resource allocation and 3D trajectory planning, which explicitly integrates a multi-dimensional GBS reliability-aware model to capture this service lifecycle, aiming to minimize the weighted energy–delay system cost while ensuring long-term queue stability. We develop a dual-layer online optimization framework: the outer layer reformulates the objective function using a time-adaptive velocity-triggered penalty term (TA-VTPT) to suppress energy spikes from abrupt velocity changes, then leverages Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty to decompose the original problem into per-slot subproblems; the inner layer proposes a Lyapunov-guided multi-agent dual actor-critic (LyMADAC) algorithm to generate real-time decentralized decisions without future information. Simulations show that our approach effectively reduces the system cost while ensuring queue stability across heterogeneous traffic patterns and extreme stress scenarios, and further demonstrates robustness under representative non-idealities (e.g., wind disturbance and battery aging)."

However, the combination of PM and PS in healthcare still presents a number of challenges, including the incorporation of additional medical specialties, the involvement of healthcare experts, the optimization of data quality, and the promotion of further research that seeks to strengthen the combination of these two areas. The present paper contributes to overcoming these challenges by introducing PROcess Mining & Simulation for Healthcare Analysis: PROMSHA-Methodology, a methodology that provides the necessary steps for process analysis by combining PM and PS in the field of healthcare. The methodology herein addresses certain challenges related to the quality of medical data and includes the participation of experts.

An experimental model was established with an impact source. The AC current limiting and fusing tests were conducted with the new superconducting fuse and the fuse without a narrow neck. Experimental results show that compared to the fuse without a narrow neck, the new superconducting fuse achieves a reduction of at least 40 A in peak current, an increase of at least 77.4% in arc voltage, a decrease of at least 17% in front arc I^2t, and a shorting of at least 0.872 ms in pre-arcing time.

Unlike conventional methods that rely solely on visible-color contrast, our approach captures heartbeat-induced variations. This method was validated through two experiments. Experiment 1 confirmed that the proposed technique could consistently detect foundation-applied areas across a diverse group of participants. Experiment 2 demonstrated that the degree of signal suppression, and thus, the visualization contrast, increased with the amount of foundation applied, even when the foundation color closely matched the natural skin tone. In addition, the use of reference signals from the palm yielded comparable results, underscoring the practical versatility of this method."

    "abstract": "Movable antennas (MAs) fully exploit spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) in continuous space through dynamic position adjustment, thereby enhancing the performance of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. This paper investigates robust beamforming and antenna position optimization in MA assisted ISAC systems under bounded channel uncertainty. A position-dependent channel estimation error model is first derived, jointly accounting for errors induced by antenna movement, angle estimation, and signal strength estimation. Based on this model, a robust optimization problem is formulated to maximize sensing performance while satisfying the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirements of multiple communication users. To address the non-convexity arising from the coupling between antenna positions and beamforming vectors, a low-complexity alternating optimization algorithm is developed, incorporating the S-procedure, semidefinite relaxation (SDR), and successive convex approximation (SCA). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms fixed-position antenna (FPA)-based schemes, achieving up to a 40% improvement in sensing beampattern gain while ensuring the SINR requirements."

The proposed framework integrates sliding mode concepts to enhance the robustness of the system. To address the challenge of limited leader information sharing among followers, a distributed estimation mechanism is designed to reconstruct leader states in a fixed time, thereby eliminating the need for fully informed followers. Based on this, a critic-only adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) framework is employed to learn optimal coordination strategies for both containment behavior and attitude tracking under time-varying environments. Within this ADP framework, the critic neural network (NN) weights are adjusted according to a fixed-time convergent update rule constructed from auxiliary errors associated with the Bellman residual. The framework ensures that the networked aerial vehicle system converges within a fixed time, and the corresponding convergence properties are rigorously verified through comprehensive mathematical analysis. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves rapid convergence and improved containment performance in inspection tasks."

    "abstract": "Power amplifiers (PAs) are key components in modern consumer wireless electronics, where compact design, high power efficiency, and excellent linearity are required to guarantee transmission quality under stringent cost and size constraints. However, the nonlinear and time-varying characteristics of PAs, especially in wideband 5G and emerging 6G systems, pose significant challenges for accurate behavioral modeling. Traditional data-driven models often lack robustness and adaptability when deployed in resource-limited consumer devices. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a bio-inspired multi-resolution dynamic neural network (MRDNN) for efficient and precise PA behavioral modeling. Drawing inspiration from biological adaptive perception, the MRDNN integrates a multi-resolution feature fusion mechanism to jointly capture short-term nonlinearities and long-term memory effects, together with a liquid-state dynamic core that adapts to time-varying signal environments. This hierarchical architecture achieves high modeling accuracy with low computational complexity, enabling hardware-efficient deployment in real-world communication systems. Experimental results on multiple PA datasets demonstrate that the MRDNN outperforms state-of-the-art neural models, improving the adjacent channel error power ratio (ACEPR) by up to 3.5 dB. These findings highlight the promise of biologically inspired dynamic learning for next-generation energy-efficient and intelligent RF systems in consumer electronics.

    "abstract": "India aims to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2070 and increase the share of renewable energy (RE) to 50% of its installed electricity capacity by 2030. This large-scale transition is expected to significantly reduce system inertia due to the displacement of conventional synchronous machines by converter-based resources. To address this challenge, this article proposes a hybrid virtual synchronous control (HVSC) strategy that enables phase-locked loop (PLL)-free grid-forming operation. The control integrates virtual synchronous machine (VSM) dynamics, synthetic torque emulation, and virtual synchronous generator (VSG) functionality to provide autonomous frequency and voltage regulation, maintaining grid support even during severe disturbances. The proposed method is implemented on grid-side converters for both type-4 wind turbine generators (WTGs) and battery energy storage systems (BESS) and evaluated through detailed MATLAB/Simulink simulations. Further validation is carried out using real-time hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing on an OPAL-RT OP4610XG platform with an FPGA-based electrical solver. The experimental results demonstrate that HVSC achieves a faster voltage recovery approximately 45 ms, reduces overshoot by 8.5%, and improves damping compared to conventional control schemes, confirming its robustness and suitability for future low-inertia, RE-dominated power grids."

    "abstract": "Electrostatic adhesion (EA) is widely used in mobile robotics, haptics, and robotic end effectors for its adaptability to diverse substrates and low energy consumption. Force sensing is important for feedback control, interaction, and monitoring in the EA system. However, EA force monitoring often relies on bulky and expensive sensors, increasing the complexity and weight of the entire system. This paper presents an acoustic-pressure-based method to monitor EA forces without contacting the adhesion pad. When the EA pad is driven by a bipolar square wave voltage to adhere a conductive object, periodic acoustic pulses arise from the EA system. We employed a microphone to capture these acoustic pressure signals and investigate the influence of peak pressure values. Results show that the peak value of acoustic pressure increased with the mass and contact area of the adhered object, as well as with the amplitude and frequency of the driving voltage. We applied this technique to mass estimation of various objects and simultaneous monitoring of two EA systems. Then, we integrated this technique into an EA end effector that enables monitoring the change of adhered object mass during transport. The proposed technique offers a low-cost, non-contact, and multi-object monitoring solution for EA end effectors in handling tasks."

However, it is essentially a method based on the motor model, meaning that the accuracy of motor parameters has a significant impact on the system performance. Especially in the low-speed region, since the voltage drop across the stator resistance directly impacts the observer input, it plays a decisive role compared with other resistance and inductance. Given that the stator resistance is highly susceptible to variations in temperature, it limits the practical applicability of observer. To address the problem, a meticulous design of observer feedback matrix is presented for stator resistance robustness improvement. The studied method adopts an intuitive graphical analysis for the adaptive full-order observer, avoiding complex formula derivation. The universal issue for different induction motors is considered by designing the parameters of the feedback matrix meticulously. The experimental results on a 2.2 kW induction motor platform validate the effectiveness of the studied method."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Existing decentralized secondary frequency control methods can be mainly classified into two categories from the perspective of the actual regulation effect of the droop curve: intercept adjustment methods and slope adjustment methods. As the name implies, the intercept adjustment method restores system frequency by adjusting the intercept of the droop curve, which reduces the regulation margin of the distributed generators' primary control in responding to subsequent load disturbances. On the other hand, the slope adjustment method restores system frequency by adjusting the slope of the droop curve. When the load power increases, the regulation margin of the primary control can be maintained unchanged by adopting this method. However, when the load power decreases, using this method will still reduce the regulation margin of the primary control. The decrease in regulation margin can adversely affect system stability and reliability. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel decentralized secondary frequency control method. In the proposed approach, only the slope is adjusted when the load demand increases, while both the intercept and slope are adjusted when the load demand decreases. As a result, the regulation margin of primary control can be preserved under any load variation conditions. In addition, this paper establishes a synchronized adjustment mechanism and further investigates the case of consecutive application of the proposed method. The stability of the proposed method is analyzed, and its feasibility is verified through simulations and hardware experiments."

    "abstract": "The use of Signal Quality Monitoring (SQM) methods for the detection of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) spoofing has been extensively studied. However, existing SQM methods struggle to balance correlator resources and detection performance. To overcome this issue, an enhanced spoofing detection method based on joint detection metrics is proposed. The proposed method integrates two complementary metrics: a correlation-based metric to capture spoofing-induced distortions in autocorrelation function (ACF), and an energy-driven metric to detect anomalous power variation. These metrics are combined through a logical OR fusion strategy, leveraging their complementary responses to distinct stages of spoofing. The simulation results show that the proposed method can detect more than 96% of the spoofing signals with various code phase and carrier phase at a false alarm probability of 0.01%. Validation on the Texas Spoofing Test Battery (TEXBAT) datasets further confirms performance, achieving a 95% average detection rate under identical false alarm probability. The method can be implemented with only four additional pairs of correlators, achieving a better balance between correlator resources and detection performance compared to previous SQM methods."

Domain experts utilize DSLs to create precise, high-level specifications that can be customized to their application domains. However, challenges regarding usability, semantic correctness, and syntax design are often encountered in the development process. With recent advances in LLaMA, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini, and ChatGPT, it is now possible to automate and refine several DSL development stages through carefully written prompts. The proposed framework provides structured prompt patterns that are customized to each successive stage of the DSL life cycle: domain knowledge acquisition, grammar definition, syntax construction, and validation. A case study involving a hospital monitoring system is used to explore the effectiveness of the models and the prompting strategies. This study also classifies the prompting techniques and assesses five LLMs in terms of readability, expressiveness, accuracy, syntax clarity, and completeness. The findings suggest that prompt engineering significantly contributes to the development of DSLs, with the five LLMs excelling in different evaluation measurements. For example, DeepSeek and LLaMA display superior syntactic precision, while Claude and ChatGPT perform better in terms of expressiveness and readability. The need to align the choice of LLM with stakeholder expectations, whether they be technical or domain specific, is highlighted by expert assessments. This research contributes to the body of knowledge relating to LLM-assisted DSL development and provides a basis for further study in adaptive prompting and multimodal integration."

    "abstract": "Aerial docking of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is essential for advanced applications like persistent surveillance and in-flight recharging. Conventional underactuated multirotors, with only four control inputs for six degrees of freedom, lack independent control over their full pose. This fundamental limitation prevents them from achieving arbitrary attitudes and precise lateral forces required for docking maneuvers that impose specific angular constraints. While fully-actuated or over-actuated designs offer improvements, they often increase mechanical complexity or struggle with reliability. This letter addresses these limitations by introducing a reconfigured hexacopter design and tailored control approach. The proposed hexacopter features two dedicated lateral rotors providing bi-directional lateral thrust, significantly enhancing lateral force capability and decoupling horizontal control from the primary attitude loop. Crucially, we prove this hybrid design (combining longitudinal and lateral thrusters) is differentially flat. Leveraging this property, we develop a differential flatness-based control (DFBC) framework. Real-world experiments validate the platform and controller through representative demonstrations."

First, different sample attention levels are assigned according to the sample distribution, and the edge samples are given higher attention levels to enhance the classification boundary. Second, the sample generation area is adaptively adjusted according to its attention level, and the generation area for boundary samples is set relatively conservatively to avoid the sample overlapping issue.

    "abstract": "Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) is considered an innovative technology in sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks, where utilizing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) communication signals for sensing provides a cost-effective solution for implementing ISAC. However, the sensing performance of matched and mismatched filtering schemes can be significantly deteriorated due to the signaling randomness induced by finite-alphabet modulations with non-constant modulus, such as quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) constellations. Therefore, improving sensing performance without significantly compromising communication capability (i.e., maintaining randomness), remains a challenging task. To that end, we propose a unified probabilistic constellation shaping (PCS) framework that is compatible with both matched and mismatched filtering schemes, by maximizing the communication rate while imposing constraints on mean square error (MSE) of sensing channel state information (CSI), power, and probability distribution. Specifically, the MSE of sensing CSI is leveraged to optimize sensing capability, which is illustrated to be a more comprehensive metric compared to the output SNR after filtering (SNRout) and integrated sidelobes ratio (ISLR). Additionally, the internal relationships among these three sensing metrics are explicitly analyzed. Building upon this, we further reveal that the normalized MSE can be interpreted as a penalty function version of the dynamic range, which is usually exploited to evaluate the behavior of delay-Doppler profiles. Finally, both simulations and field measurements validate the efficiency of proposed PCS approach in achieving a flexible S&C trade-off, as well as its credibility in enhancing 6G wireless transmission in real-world scenarios."

Electric field measurement is a useful technique to identify faults and thus there is an increasing interest in non-invasive observation of electric field for insulator condition monitoring. Fibre Bragg grating (FBG) sensing is a promising technology for such application since it is dielectric, small, power passive and can be used to measure various parameters. Thus, this paper presents a packaged FBG electric field sensor for monitoring overhead line insulators. The sensor was built by bonding a substrate of piezoelectric material, PMN-PT, to a polyimide coated FBG sensor and casting into a probe using epoxy resin. When placed in a uniform field, the probe exhibited a stable response in the tested range of 0.05-0.43 kV/mm, which is representative of that encountered in the vicinity of live insulators. Further tests were then conducted on an energised cap and pin insulator string to determine and validate the potential of the sensor to perform diagnostics. The results show that the FBG electric field sensor measurements can indicate the presence of faulty discs on the string and therefore has potential to provide an effective solution for condition monitoring of insulators."

The proposed joint dynamic hybrid beamforming network (DyHBFNet) comprises three key components: 1) An analog beamforming network (ABFNet) that optimizes the analog beamforming matrices and provides auxiliary information for the antenna selection network (ASNet) design, 2) an ASNet that dynamically optimizes the connections between antennas and RFCs, and 3) a digital beamforming network (DBFNet) that optimizes digital beamforming matrices by employing a model-driven weighted minimum mean square error algorithm for improving beamforming performance and convergence speed. The proposed ABFNet, ASNet, and DBFNet are all designed based on advanced Transformer encoders. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly enhances spectral efficiency and EE compared to baseline schemes.

Current scheduling algorithms consider this problem under relatively limited assumptions and a critical yet unjustified conjecture. In this work, we first consider more general assumptions with operation failures and, accordingly, extend a tree-based modeling for joint swapping and purification. Then, we analytically prove the previous conjecture that the optimal strategy under <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Binary system</i> is always to purify the entanglements before any swapping.

    "abstract": "High-mobility and large-bandwidth applications at high frequencies make the acquisition of doubly-selective channels costly and complex, as the fast fading channel causes a surge in pilot overheads and inter-carrier interference. Accurate estimation of the complex channel gain (CG) and the carrier frequency offset (CFO) is required to support subsequent high-accuracy channel prediction that alleviates the heavy pilot burden. The emerging technology of the wireless channel map (WCM) can approximately reproduce the actual propagation environment digitally with customized channel parameters, offering an opportunity to accurately estimate the complex CG and CFO. In this paper, a WCM-based prior distribution construction method and a joint complex CG and CFO estimation algorithm are proposed. Specifically, a parameterized linear estimation problem for the complex CG is generated based on a nonuniform delay-domain off-grid channel representation, and with more realistic prior distributions constructed by the knowledge from the WCM-provided angular-delay power spectrum density, the joint estimation problem is solved under the Bayesian inference framework. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm, with a better performance in terms of estimation accuracy and bit error rates (BER) than existing baselines. It is also verified that the proposed WCM-based algorithm is highly adaptable to different WCM precision and robust to different user speeds."

A waterproof medical-grade adhesive layer protects the outer surface, while a flexible PCB connector ensures the connection with the acquisition system. Bench tests were conducted to assess mechanical conformability and US transparency. Results showed that ReGrid conformed to curved surfaces, other than allowing for B-mode US imaging without artifacts: both the support and the electrodes resulted transparent to ultrasound. In-vivo tests on the tibialis anterior muscle confirmed low and stable electrode-skin impedance and noise levels comparable to conventional gel-based electrodes. HD-sEMG signals were recorded during isometric contractions at two force levels (10% and 20% MVC), with and without a US probe placed directly over the electrodes. Conduction velocity estimates and HD-sEMG decomposition outcomes were not significantly affected by the US probe, nor was the level of power-line interference. Thanks to its conformability, ultrasound transparency, and high signal quality, ReGrid enables combined HD-sEMG and ultrasound acquisitions from the same muscle region, supporting novel applications such as 3D and panoramic ultrasound imaging integrated with HD-sEMG."

    "abstract": "Because of variations in measurement conditions and marine environments, Forward-Looking Sonar (FLS) images are susceptible to uncertain noise disturbances, which can lead to degradation of FLS images and unreliable detection outcomes. To address the aforementioned issue and enhance the noise robustness of object detectors, this study proposes three models, which are DN-YOLO, SL-DN-YOLO, and FSL-DN-YOLO. Specifically, we design a Noise Injection Module (NIM) and a Denoising Module (DM), incorporating them sequentially into the backbone network of YOLOv11s for end-to-end training. The NIM is utilized only during the training phase to introduce noise into the network, which enables the DM to be trained with denoising capabilities. Furthermore, we investigate how combination methods, insertion positions, and training methods of two proposed modules affect network noise robustness. The distinctions among DN-YOLO, SL-DN-YOLO, and FSL-DN-YOLO arise from their insertion positions and training methods of NIM and DM in the YOLOv11s backbone network. DN-YOLO is employed when hardware computational capacity is limited and faced with low noise levels, whereas SL-DN-YOLO is used when there are significant noise levels. FSL-DN-YOLO is applicable when adequate computational capacity is available and dealing with noise disturbances. Experimental results confirm that all three proposed models exhibit strong resistance to noise disturbances."

A coupled radiation–electronic model is established, from which a limit-detection-distance model based on noise-equivalent power is derived and generalized to the binocular differential architecture to quantify range gain. A hardware prototype with matched dual-lens photodiode channels, a high common-mode rejection ratio differential front end, Sallen–Key band-pass filtering, and threshold triggering achieves simultaneous signal amplification and common-mode/high-frequency noise suppression. Experiments show model–measurement deviation below 0.5% and a 2.8× increase in maximum detection distance over a monocular system; field tests confirm reliable triggering of explosive infrared flashes at 3.2 km with trigger delay < 10 μs, demonstrating a compact and quantitatively designable solution for high-sensitivity, long-range explosive flash sensing."

    "abstract": "Monocular 3D object detection has been studied as a promising task for diverse applications, such as autonomous driving, due to its lower cost and more straightforward configuration than multiple sensors. However, existing studies have focused on clear weather without considering diverse weather conditions with varying intensity, such as rain, snow, and fog, affecting detection performance. In this paper, we propose MonoRange, a monocular 3D object detection method that uses object-centric images and range maps in adverse weather conditions. Leveraging the 2D detection results, MonoRange generates range maps from images via an object-centric range map reconstruction. Furthermore, MonoRange flexibly removes adverse weather noise in images via weather intensity adaptive image restoration with a weight modulation transformer. Then, MonoRange fuses the range map and restored image and predicts 3D bounding boxes via the range map aligned detector. Introducing the projected box consistency loss between 2D and 3D boxes also enables to consistent and accurate 3D object detection. Experimental results on diverse weather datasets demonstrate that MonoRange surpasses existing monocular 3D object detection approaches.

However, the lack of scalable methods significantly impedes the practical development of multi-spacecraft games. In this paper, we address the multi-spacecraft pursuit-evasion problem with area capture, a generalization of the intercept and rendezvous games based on point capture. First, the qualitative solution of the game is characterized by the backward reachability set derived from the zero-level set of the value function of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs partial differential equations (HJI PDE). The explicit Hopf formula is used to address the curse of dimensionality inherent in dynamic programming. Then, the minimum time feedback strategy is efficiently constructed by solving a series of unconstrained convex subproblems, ensuring a win within a finite time. A large disturbance compensation method is proposed to depict the degradation of capture time through an augmented evader. The game of kind and the game of degree are unified in the HJI framework. The strategy synthesis of multi-pursuer multi-evader is also conducted using dynamical maximum graph matching to reduce the terminal time of group capture. Finally, extensive numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed strategies, and the robustness and performance guaranteed are analyzed. The strong time consistency of the proposed strategy is validated in nonlinear dynamics with measurement uncertainty."

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) devices have brought invaluable convenience to our daily lives. However, they also introduce significant security challenges. Common vulnerabilities in numerous IoT devices predominantly reside in their web services. Unfortunately, existing vulnerability detection methods either incur heavy execution overhead or produce excessive false positives/negatives. This significantly hinders the efficient analysis of vulnerabilities in web services. This paper proposes CID4IoT, a novel static automated vulnerability detection approach designed to effectively detect command injection vulnerabilities in web services provided by IoT devices. Inspired by the concept of taint analysis, CID4IoT first analyzes vulnerability reports to identify taint source functions and sink functions. Then, CID4IoT extracts pseudocode between taint source functions and sink functions to form critical code snippets. Subsequently, it utilizes LLM to analyze these critical code snippets for vulnerability detection.We implemented a prototype of CID4IoT and evaluated it on real firmware devices. CID4IoT discovered 54 previously unknown vulnerabilities, of which 39 are confirmed by CVE. Compared with state-of-the-art tools KARONTE and SaTC, it identified significantly more vulnerabilities in the test set while achieving notable improvements in analysis efficiency. The results demonstrate that CID4IoT is effective in detecting flaws in IoT devices"

This paper introduces cost-effective massive MIMO-ISAC architectures employing one-bit digital-to-analog and analog-to-digital converters (DACs/ADCs). While one-bit quantization facilitates the deployment of large-scale antenna arrays and enhances spatial resolution, it also introduces nonlinear distortion that necessitates sophisticated signal processing for effective compensation. To overcome these challenges, we propose novel MIMO-ISAC transceiver designs that integrate symbol-level precoding (SLP) to preserve communication quality, alongside radar waveform synthesis and space-time adaptive processing (STAP) techniques for robust clutter suppression. Specifically, for target detection, we formulate the maximization of the signal-to-quantization-plus-clutter-plus-noise ratio (SQCNR) as a joint optimization problem involving the transmit waveform and receive filtering, which is efficiently solved through the majorization-minimization (MM) and alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithms. For target parameter estimation, we design transmit waveforms aimed at minimizing beam pattern sidelobes, thereby enhancing spatial selectivity. Additionally, we develop a MUSIC-based joint angle-Doppler estimation approach, exploiting Doppler-induced frequency shifts to effectively distinguish moving targets from stationary clutter without requiring prior clutter information. Extensive simulation results confirm the benefits of adopting one-bit DACs/ADCs in MIMO-ISAC systems. Notably, compared to conventional high-resolution systems using 8 antennas, our proposed one-bit architecture with 32 antennas achieves approximately 10 dB higher SQCNR and reduces angular estimation error by up to 85%. These results underscore the significant potential of one-bit quantization architectures as practical, high-performance solutions for future cost-effective MIMO-ISAC implementations."

Although contrastive learning has shown promise, most existing approaches rely on convolutional neural networks or transformers, which are inefficient for modeling long sequences. Recently, the Mamba State Space Model has emerged as a scalable alternative, offering linear complexity and strong sequence modeling capabilities. However, current HSI classification methods still depend on discrete class labels, which lack rich semantic information and limit the effectiveness of representation learning. To address this limitation, we propose Text-guided Contrastive Mamba (Mamba-TGC), a novel text-guided contrastive learning framework for HSI classification. In Mamba-TGC, each contrastive branch integrates a Mamba encoder that separately models spectral and spatial patch embeddings, which are then fused to capture rich spectral-spatial representations. These features are further aligned with category-level textual descriptions through contrastive loss, enabling the model to learn more discriminative and semantically informative representations. Extensive evaluations of three benchmark hyperspectral image datasets demonstrate that Mamba-TGC consistently surpasses existing methods, highlighting the effectiveness of combining Mamba-based spectral-spatial modeling with text-guided supervision for robust hyperspectral representation learning."

The learnable noise scale parameters in activations converge to non-zero values after training, demonstrating the existence of stochastic resonance in deep attention mechanisms.

We formulate the problem as a multistage stochastic mixed-integer programming (SMIP) model. Dynamic decisions of matching service capacities with stochastic demands for first visit and multitype multiple revisits are made at each stage, which ensure that each type of revisit is assigned appointment on the patient preferred day as much as possible under meeting the interval restrictions of two consecutive revisits. We reformulate the model into an equivalent formulation that can be solved directly and develop a decomposition-based adaptive capacity allocation with revisit priority algorithm to solve the model. Numerical results illustrate the superiority of our proposed approach in terms of computation time and solution quality compared with commercial solver. In addition, to aid practitioners in applying the decision-making model more effectively, we also provide managerial insights into key factors such as capacity and demand patterns, revisit intervals, and cost coefficients. For instance, managers can identify and implement the optimal capacity pattern for a given demand pattern, as well as the best combinations of demand and capacity patterns, to minimize operation costs."

This letter proposes a novel interference suppression technique that exploits the cross-logical-domain projection properties of waveforms. Initially, we demonstrate that the interfering OFDM signal behaves as an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) with uniform power distribution in the affine domain. Building upon that, an adaptive iterative windowing scheme is developed, applied over the pilot guard interval, to jointly suppress OFDM interference and detect channel taps prior to CE in the affine domain. Simulation results confirm that the proposed method effectively mitigates interference and significantly improves channel parameter estimation accuracy, while maintaining a low system complexity."

This makes it challenging for conventional modulation strategies to achieve their coordinated mitigation. To address this issue, this paper proposes an improved asymmetric regular sampling variable-switching-frequency PWM (ARS-VSFPWM) strategy incorporating a cost function model. First, to overcome the failure of symmetric regular sampling (SRS) under low-switching-frequency conditions, a predictive model for PCC and ZSCC is established based on ARS while accounting for control delay. Then, cost-function-based online optimization of vector selection achieves qualitative coordinated suppression of both circulating currents. Furthermore, variable switching frequency introduces an additional degree of freedom, dynamically adjusting the switching frequency per control cycle to quantitatively constrain peak circulating currents to predefined thresholds. Finally, results from 36-MW simulations and experiments validate the effectiveness and superiority over conventional methods."

The proposed dual-band multi-gap coupled resonator (DMCR) is constructed on a glass substrate with copper structure gaps to generate resonance, exhibiting high sensitivity at both resonance frequency. The polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based microfluidic chip employs a spiral channel architecture to achieve continuous cell separation through the synergistic effects of inertial lift forces and Dean vortices. The spiral microfluidic device achieves 74.13% separation efficiency for WBCs and 84.6% for CTCs at designated outlets, with detection sensitivities of 3.51 MHz/(10⁴ cells/mL) and 11.6 MHz/(10⁴ cells/mL) for MCF-7 and THP-1 cell lines, respectively.

    "abstract": "One of the most prominent requirements of future Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) networks will be to provide Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication (URLLC) in support of critical physical processes underlying the production chains. However, standard protocols for allocating wireless resources may not be able to optimize the latency-reliability trade-off, especially for uplink communication. For example, centralized (e.g., grant-based) scheduling can ensure almost zero collisions, but introduces delays in the way resources are requested by the User Equipments (UEs) and then granted by the Next Generation Node B (gNB). On the other hand, distributed scheduling (e.g., based on random access), in which UEs autonomously choose the physical resources to transmit uplink data, may lead to potentially many collisions especially when the density of UEs (and so the traffic) increases. Along these lines, in this work we propose DIStributed combinatorial NEural linear Thompson Sampling (DISNETS), a novel scheduling framework that combines the best of the two worlds. By leveraging a feedback signal sent from the gNB and reinforcement learning, the UEs are trained to autonomously optimize their uplink transmissions by selecting the available physical resources so as to minimize the number of collisions, disaggregated from the network and without additional message exchange to/from the gNB. DISNETS is a distributed, multi-agent adaptation of the Neural Linear Thompson Sampling (NLTS) algorithm, which has been further extended to admit multiple actions in parallel. We apply DISNETS to the context of IIoT, and demonstrate by extensive simulations the superior performance of the proposed approach in addressing URLLC compared to other baselines."

    "abstract": "Transparent and specular objects are frequently encountered in daily life, factories, and laboratories. However, due to the unique optical properties, the depth information on these objects is usually incomplete and inaccurate, which poses significant challenges for downstream robotics tasks. Therefore, it is crucial to accurately restore the depth information of transparent and specular objects. Previous depth completion methods for these objects usually generate structure-less or ambiguous depth predictions. To address these issues, we propose a geometry-aware assisted depth completion method for transparent and specular objects, which focuses on exploring the 3D structural cues of the scene. Specifically, besides extracting 2D features from RGB-D input, we back-project the input depth to a point cloud and build the 3D branch to extract hierarchical scene-level 3D structural features. To exploit 3D geometric information, we design several gated cross-modal fusion modules to effectively propagate multi-level 3D geometric features to the image branch. In addition, we propose an adaptive correlation aggregation strategy to appropriately assign 3D features to the corresponding 2D features. Extensive experiments on ClearGrasp, OOD, TransCG, and STD datasets show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. We further demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the performance of downstream robotic grasping tasks. The code will be available at: https://github.com/lyz3356/GAA-TSO."

    "abstract": "To efficiently and economically assess the insulating condition of widely used cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) power cables, a non-destructive method for quantitatively predicting breakdown properties based on near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is proposed in this work. The NIR spectra of 24 XLPE samples with different aging conditions was established for calibration set. 40 key wavelengths near 1715, 1730, 1750, and 1763 nm strongly associated with breakdown strength were selected among 301 wavelengths by competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS). The selected wavelengths are proved to be related with crystallinity which is positively correlated with breakdown strength. Further results of surface potential decay (SPD) reveal that breakdown strength is modulated by deep trap energy level which is positively correlated with the intensities at 1730 and 1763 nm. On that basis, a back-propagation (BP) neural network model with an R2 value of 0.96 and a relative RMSE of 3.20% was constructed using these wavelengths, achieving better predicting abilities than the models without CARS. It also achieves only 1.34% error in predicting the breakdown strength of XLPE samples from cables that have been in service for 6 different times. This work provides an accurate and efficient method for evaluating insulating condition of power cables."

    "abstract": "The dynamic nature of tasks and environments in Internet of Things (IoT) systems require deep learning models to continuously retrain on evolving data to ensure their effectiveness. Existing continual learning (CL) methods aim to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, where the model loses knowledge of previous tasks when learning new ones. However, these methods often ignore the memory resource competition caused by the parallel execution of multiple applications, which limits the realworld IoT application of CL in resource-constrained edge devices. In this article, we propose EDCL, a novel approach that enhances the training efficiency and model accuracy of CL methods while ensuring the uninterrupted operation of high-priority inference programs. Specifically, we first implement a custom batch sampler that can dynamically load batches and measure the memory usage and training time recorded via offline profiling. In the online stage, by monitoring the resource consumption of high-priority programs, EDCL can dynamically select batch policies that meet resource constraints and facilitate efficient training. Additionally, we propose an adaptive hierarchical buffer swap method to enhance the model’s ability to retain previously learned knowledge and mitigate forgetting. Extensive experiments show that EDCL effectively balances training efficiency and model accuracy while preventing high-priority inference programs from failing due to memory contention, demonstrating promising performance compared to baselines."

However, providing reconfigurability while preserving ultra-narrow bandwidth remains challenging. Here we present a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI)-coupled microring filter based on thin-film lithium tantalate (TFLT), showing the ability to control bandwidth, extinction ratio (ER) and resonance wavelength. After electrode integration, the device maintains a minimum bandwidth of 63 MHz. The filter supports continuous bandwidth tuning from 63 MHz to 1.4 GHz and ER control from 0 to 20 dB. In addition, it performs wavelength tuning ability with an efficiency of 1.29 pm/mW, making it suitable for handling interference signals within a wide frequency range. This device is promising for reconfigurable optical communications, dynamic channel management, and on-chip narrowband optical microwave filtering and interference mitigation."

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral imagery (HSI) and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data joint classification leverages multi-modal information to improve classification performance. However, existing methods often suffer from inadequate feature representation due to their reliance on spatial-spectral domains while ignoring complementary frequency-domain cues, limiting their ability to capture cross-modal variations. Moreover, even when frequency information is incorporated, most approaches fail to achieve deep cross-domain interaction, either treating spatial and frequency features in isolation or relying on single-stage fusion, which hinders effective modality gap bridging. To address these challenges, we propose a novel progressive spatial-spectral-frequency fusion learning (PS2F2L) network, a lightweight yet powerful framework for HSI and LiDAR classification. Our method employs a multi-stage progressive fusion strategy to hierarchically integrate multimodal features, mitigating modal conflicts while capturing discriminative features. In the first stage, dual branches—spatial-spectral feature learning (S2FL) and spatial-frequency feature learning (SF2L)—jointly extract features from complementary domains, overcoming single-domain limitations. The S2FL branch combines 1D/2D convolutions to model spectral-spatial relationships, while SF2L utilizes discrete wavelet transforms to capture spatial-frequency patterns. In the second stage, an interactive spatial-spectral-frequency fusion module enhances feature discriminability by promoting deep information exchange between spatial-spectral and spatial-requency representations. Finally, adaptive decision-level fusion refines classification by consolidating multi-domain predictions. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the superiority of PS2F2L, validating its effectiveness in achieving robust and accurate multimodal classification."

    "abstract": "Radar technology has emerged as a promising tool for contactless monitoring of sleep physiology and related disorders. Nocturnal hypoglycemia is a critical safety concern in people with diabetes, particularly in vulnerable populations such as children, older adults, and individuals in long-term care, where body-worn devices are often not used. To assess the feasibility of radar-based hypoglycemia detection, we conducted a scoping review of studies published between January 2007 and July 2025 that investigated radar monitoring of physiological parameters during sleep or sleep-related disorders with overlapping autonomic and motor physiological signatures. A structured search and data extraction were performed, covering bibliographic, technical, clinical, and performance variables. Across 78 studies, radar was consistently validated for respiration, heart rate and heart rate variability, body movement, and posture, with reported accuracies frequently exceeding 90%. Sleep staging showed lower but meaningful performance (63–85%). Disease-focused applications demonstrated robust results in sleep-disordered breathing, including obstructive sleep apnea and sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome, as well as initial explorations in asthma, insomnia, and seizure detection. Together, these studies establish radar as a reliable, contactless sleep monitoring modality for respiration, HR and HRV, movement, posture, and sleep staging, which are physiological signals known to change during nocturnal hypoglycemia. Building on this foundation, radar is well positioned to enable indirect nocturnal hypoglycemia detection, especially where wearables are not feasible. Establishing clinical performance now requires studies that pair radar with glucose measurements and report event level diagnostic accuracy."

We demonstrate the extremely low cross-correlation of MCR-IM signals across different spread factors, showing that the proposed MCR-IM system also inherits the characteristics of ZC sequences modulation. Moreover, we derive an approximate approximate closed-form expression for the bit-error-rate (BER) of the proposed MCR-IM system over Nakagami-<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</i> fading channels. Simulation results confirm the accuracy of the derived approximate closed-form expression and demonstrate that the MCR-IM system achieves higher levels of spectral efficiency (SE) compared to existing systems like frequency-shift chirp spread spectrum with index modulation (FSCSS-IM), group-based CSS (GCSS), layered CSS (LCSS), and layered group-based CSS (LGCSS). In this context, assigning multiple chirp rates to each user results in a reduction in the number of parallel channels. To mitigate this issue, we propose a peak detection based successive interference cancellation (PD-SIC) algorithm to accommodate more users. Results further show that the proposed system with the PD-SIC algorithm achieves a lower BER and higher throughput than the orthogonal scatter CSS (OrthoRa) system under collision scenarios, making it a compelling solution for future large-scale, high-throughput Internet of Things network."

    "abstract": "The dynamic external environment and communication constraints among unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) pose challenges to UAV swarm control. Existing methods struggle to ensure the coordination and optimality of swarm movement due to local interactions within the heterogeneous UAV swarm. To address this issue, this article proposes an approach that integrates human intelligence in perception and decision-making into the trajectory planning cost function through a human-machine interaction interface. This makes the planned trajectories more consistent with human intent and environmental constraints. Moreover, individuals within the UAV swarm are divided into different levels, which helps guide the heterogeneous UAV swarm to fly safely in complex environments. High-level UAVs are designated as human-guided UAVs to track the planned trajectory, thus ensuring the smoothness and optimality of swarm movement. Subordinate UAVs operate based on the designed flocking control algorithm, allowing the heterogeneous UAV swarm to navigate through dense environments quickly and safely. Comparative simulation results demonstrate the feasibility, effectiveness, and advantages of the proposed method in improving swarm trajectory smoothness and movement coordination."

    "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that emotions elicit responses in various physiological systems that underlie emotional experience. However, these studies have focused almost solely on how emotions alter the activity of individual physiological systems. Moreover, recent research has highlighted that the human organism is an integrated entity, wherein physiological systems constantly interact to form a dynamic network. Therefore, in this study, we attempted to evaluate whether the physiological network changes with different emotions. We employed multivariate transfer entropy to assess the interaction between six types of emotion-related physiological signals and subsequently constructed physiological networks across forty emotional trials. Additionally, topological parameters were applied to each physiological network to quantify its overall structure. The results revealed that emotion has a significant impact on the topology of physiological networks, indicating the integrated behavior of physiological systems in response to emotion at the macro-scale level. Furthermore, different physiological systems may play diverse roles within the physiological network. In summary, we propose a system-level integrative approach, referred to as the physiological network, to study the physiological responses to emotion. This not only contributes to a deeper understanding of emotional mechanisms but also demonstrates potential for disease research and engineering applications."

    "abstract": "The development of drone techniques has extensive applications to fields like last-mile parcel delivery. For economic and efficiency advantages, collaborative truck-drone systems have attracted great attention and formulated as truck-drone routing problems. In this paper, a multi-visit traveling salesman problem with drones is investigated. We decompose it into a two-layer structure and formulate it as a new bi-level model (Bi-MTSPD). The major advantage of the bi-level model is its ability to represent the complex interactions between truck and drone routes by dispatching the drones under the premise of truck routes. To solvethe bi-level model, we propose a novel surrogate-assisted bi-level optimization method. The upper-level subproblem can be treated as a traveling salesman problem with customer assignment, and high-quality truck routes are identified by the K-nearest neighbor-based surrogate model with newly proposed features in order to allocate more computational resources to promising upper-level solutions. For the lower-level drone location routing problem (DLR), a customized memetic algorithm is developed to optimize the drone routes for the corresponding truck route. Comprehensive experimental results show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art algorithms across most benchmark instances. Further analysis verifies the congruence of the bi-level optimization for MTSP-D and the effectiveness of upper-level and lower-level solvers."

    "abstract": "At present, optical fiber surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensing technology faces two significant challenges, enhancing the detection performance and expanding the detected target types. To address this, this paper proposes a novel optical fiber SPR biosensor, modified with programmable polypeptide nanofibers (PNs) and polydopamine nanospheres covered gold nanoparticles (Au@PDA NPs). Peptide sequences have been applied in optical fiber SPR sensing due to their editable, self-assembling, and low-toxicity properties. In reported sensors, peptide sequences are engineered to self-assemble into peptide nanofibers, increasing the sensor’s specific surface area and providing customizable active sites. Au@PDA NPs further enhance the refractive index sensitivity and surface activity of the sensor. In this study, an SPR biosensor was employed to detect rabbit IgG. The results demonstrate a biological sensitivity of 0.0262 nm/(ng/mL) and a detection limit of 3.85 ng/mL. Compared to SPR sensors modified with single nanoparticles, the proposed sensor exhibits significant improvements in both sensitivity and detection limit. In addition to performance enhancement, this work also offers a systematic approach to improving the performance of sensors for different targets. By programming peptide sequences, various detectable substances can be detected. The method is cost-effective and highly efficient, which holds great significance for improving the commercial value of optical fiber SPR sensors."

    "abstract": "Effective policy optimization in multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) necessitates extensive exploration of high-dimensional state-action spaces. However, such exploration may not only trigger unsafe states but also compromise system stability, posing significant challenges for deployment in safety-critical systems. To address this challenge, this article proposes a safety-stability layer that integrates robust control barrier functions (RCBFs) and input-to-state stable control Lyapunov functions (ISS-CLFs) for multiagent systems operating in unknown environments with uncertain dynamics. Furthermore, by integrating safety-stability constraints with a MARL framework, during the training phase, we exclusively focus on goal-reaching objectives to expand the policy network’s exploration space, while in the deployment phase, policy outputs are filtered through a real-time safety-stability layer. In addition, an event-triggered mechanism for action compensation calculation is designed based on safety condition assessments to conserve computational resources. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through simulation experiments in dynamic multiunicycle environments. The results demonstrate that our approach not only ensures strict adherence to safety constraints but also significantly enhances the task execution efficiency of multiagent systems."

In this article, Gaussian-heuristic fast marching tree (GH-FMT), including heuristic expansion and sampling, is proposed to provide high-quality solutions while simultaneously improving efficiency of planning and replanning in unknown dynamic environments. Specifically, an adaptive expansion region is defined using a boundary-based Gaussian distribution, minimizing potential redundant collision checking and supports effective and comprehensive exploration of the environments. A hybrid incremental search strategy is designed to reduce sample density and prioritized exploration of the search tree in promising directions using a heuristic single sampling method. Moreover, a hybrid optimization strategy is employed under time constraints to identify potential nodes, enabling efficient convergence toward high-quality solutions. Finally, through a series of challenging simulation scenarios and real-world experimental investigations, and by benchmarking against current-leading variants in the sampling-based planning class, the proposed GH-FMT demonstrated favorable advantages in flexibility, safety, and rapidity. It is shown that the search time is reduced on average by 15.8% and the path cost is reduced by on average 13.5%."

The PVA–LS–SA hydrogel matrix prepared via low-temperature 3D printing possessed stable mechanical strength and controllable structural morphology. After being conductively functionalized, the hydrogel exhibited reliable strain sensing performance based on the synergistic mechanism of microcracks in the silver particle layer and the tunneling effect within the soft matrix, which was effectively used to monitor various human motion signals including finger, wrist and knee joint movements. A clear polynomial relationship was identified between the relative change in resistance and the applied strain. When connected in the form of an array to a resistance acquisition and display system, the sensor was able to accurately provide real-time feedback with small errors on the magnitude and location of the applied load in practical measurement. The low-temperature 3D printing offered strong supports for the customized preparation and practical application of soft sensing materials and provided a feasible approach for developing conductive hydrogel sensors suitable for micro-strain detection."

    "abstract": "Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are widely used in industrial applications for energy storage and power supply. The failure of LIBs has attracted significant attention since severe accidents caused by thermal runaway. Electrolyte leakage in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) represents a significant hidden risk to LIB systems and serves as an early indicator of potential thermal runaway. Current electrolyte leakage detection technologies often lack the sensitivity, cost-effectiveness, and longevity required for modern battery safety systems. To address this challenge, we investigate the phase transitions of leaked electrolytes and changes in particle size of ambient aerosols, and propose a pack-level optical electrolyte leakage sensor for early safety warning of LIBs failures in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications. Experiments demonstrate that the particle size of ambient aerosol increases rapidly due to phase change condensation of the leaked electrolyte vapor. Correspondingly, the light scattering efficiency of ambient aerosol increases, providing measurable indicators for electrolyte leakage monitoring. Our optical sensor can promptly detect leakage in the overcharging test, slightly surpassing the PPB gas sensor in response time while reducing cost to 1/10 due to mature commercial optical components and increasing lifespan 3 times according to the lifespan of core elements. Utilizing readily available commercial components, this method offers a high-sensitivity, cost-effective, and durable solution for improving safety in LIB systems."

    "abstract": "Semantic Change Detection (SCD) in remote sensing imagery requires models that integrate extensive spatial context for broad geographic patterns, computational efficiency for large-scale datasets, and sensitivity to class-imbalanced land-cover transitions to detect rare or asymmetric changes. Early SCD approaches relied on Convolutional Neural Networks, which excel in local feature extraction but falter in modeling global spatial context due to limited receptive fields. Transformers mitigate this by capturing long-range dependencies via self-attention, yet their quadratic complexity impairs efficiency on vast remote sensing data. Emerging Mamba architectures, based on state-space models, strike a balance with linear complexity and robust long-range modeling, delivering efficient global context capture and improved performance. In this study, we introduce Mamba-FCS, an SCD framework leveraging a Visual State Space Model backbone, with three key contributions: (1) a Joint Spatio-Frequency Fusion block that integrates log-amplitude frequency-domain features to sharpen edges and mitigate illumination artifacts, (2) a Change-Guided Attention (CGA) module that explicitly bridges the intertwined Binary Change Detection and SCD tasks, and (3) a novel loss function inspired by the Separated Kappa (SeK) metric to optimize for class imbalance. Experiments on the benchmark datasets show that Mamba-FCS consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art algorithms. Ablation studies indicate that spatio–frequency fusion and CGA mainly sharpen boundaries and suppress hallucinated changes, while the SeK-inspired loss improves minority-class semantics. These results highlight the potential of Mamba-FCS as a scalable and accurate approach for remote sensing change detection.

Currently, the predominant methods involve handheld metal scanners that require active cooperation by the subject, generally suffering from low efficiency, limited detection range, and blind spots for nonmetallic objects. Millimeter-wave-based PSS technology, featured by its speediness, harmlessness, and capability of detecting nonmetallic materials, represents an emerging trend in security screening. However, traditional millimeter-wave system-wide dynamic scanning schemes face challenges such as bulky size, high complexity, and poor integration. To address these problems, we develop a wide-angle metalens based on a neural-network-assisted end-to-end inverse design method, aiming to replace thick and heavy dielectric lenses in traditional millimeter-wave PSS systems, thereby enhancing system integration and lightweight capabilities while improving wide-angle scanning performance. As proof of concept, we propose a system-wide static noninteractive wide-angle dual-polarized meta-detector, which consists of a dynamic beam steering transmitter, dual-polarized receivers, and a data acquisition module. This meta-detector can rapidly, precisely, and statically identify concealed objects of various materials on the human body in a noninteractive manner within a 32° horizontal and 26.8° vertical field-of-view at an operating range of 15–25 m. The proposed PSS system offers long detection range, high integration, and noninteractive operation, highlighting its potential for practical deployment in real-world public security screening scenarios."

To address the limitations of traditional MPC methods in handling system disturbances and uncertainties, we integrate GMM into the MPC framework to model and account for these disturbances probabilistically. By reformulating the chance constraints within this framework, the proposed approach provides high-probability safety guarantees. Specifically, GMM can capture complex disturbance distributions in dynamic systems compared with traditional Gaussian processes, thereby enabling more precise prediction and optimization within the MPC loop. This ensures that the resulting control strategies not only satisfy safety constraints but also enhance system performance. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance in satisfying high-probability safety requirements while enhancing the overall robustness of the system. Compared to conventional MPC approaches, the proposed method can effectively tackle the challenges posed by uncertainties, ensuring stability and safety under diverse conditions. This approach has broad applications in domains that require robust control under uncertainties, including autonomous driving, robotic manipulation, and other complex engineering systems."

Perturbing impedance and radiation pattern measurements. In this study, we analyze the contributions of these multiple reflections and reintroduce a metal flange cover, e.g., ‘scattering cap,’ to mitigate the errors introduced by such reflections and with it, improve the measurement system. The design methodology is presented and validated across three frequency bands within 26–330 GHz using simulations, for probe geometries including open-ended waveguides and horn antennas. Its effectiveness is experimentally evaluated for near- and far-field measurements with an open-ended waveguide probe antenna alongside various types of electromagnetic absorbing materials in the 90–140 GHz frequency band. However, whereas carbon based absorbers typically degrade and inconsistently affect the probe antenna behavior, the scattering cap does not. The scattering cap reduces standing-wave ripples in near-field measurements from 1.3 dB to 0.5 dB peak-to-peak, representing a reduction of more than 60%. The proposed scattering cap provides an effective, cheap and easy-to-manufacture solution with wideband applicability to reduce multiple reflections, making it highly suitable for accurate and consistent antenna measurements."

    "abstract": "3D object detection, a sought-after feature for connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), offers precise localization and classification of obstacles by estimating their spatial attributes from 2D images. This approach addresses the limitation of traditional 2D detection, which lacks spatial information. However, the task becomes challenging in complex environments with occlusions and restricted line-of-sight views, such as intersections and winding roads. Fortunately, roadside infrastructure equipped with traffic cameras, commonly deployed at these critical locations, offers a wider field of view. It can therefore provide valuable support to CAVs and improve object detection performance. Vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) cooperative 3D detection frameworks leverage vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication to transmit roadside data to CAVs. By integrating multi-view observations from both vehicle-mounted and roadside cameras, these frameworks enable a more accurate and semantically rich understanding of the driving environment. In this paper, we propose V2IFormer, a multi-view feature fusion framework based on BEV representations, designed to enhance 3D object detection. Specifically, V2IFormer extracts semantic features from 2D images captured by both vehicle-mounted and roadside cameras and transforms them into BEV features. At the CAV side, a deformable mutual-attention algorithm is employed to dynamically select spatial features and fuse the most informative BEV representations from both sources. This strategy reduces interference from irrelevant or corrupted features and improves fusion efficiency. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of V2IFormer on the DAIR-V2X benchmark. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art 3D object detection performance, particularly in scenarios with occlusion and limited line-of-sight."

Existing approaches suffer from static topological assumptions and lack principled uncertainty quantification for sensing decisions. To address this, we present temporal-implicit topology attention network (TITAN)-strategic multicriteria active resource targeting (SMART), a unified framework integrating the TITAN with SMART. TITAN incorporates three innovations: implicit topology relation learner (ITRL), dynamic attention neighborhood aggregator (DANA), and temporal propagation attention module (TPAM). Importantly, TITAN is a spatio-temporal attention network, where ITRL and DANA operate on implicit and explicit spatial relationships, while TPAM captures multiscale temporal propagation dynamics. Experimental validation demonstrates that TITAN–SMART achieves target accuracy with up to 46.2% less resource cost than state-of-the-art baselines, maintaining scalability across large-scale networks. By explicitly targeting the gap between passive prediction on fully observed graphs and active sensing under strict sensing-resource constraints, TITAN–SMART enables principled selection of where to sense next rather than only forecasting future states. The framework’s interpretable decision patterns establish it as a practical solution for industrial Internet of Things (IoT) deployments."

    "abstract": "With the development of AI, robotics is gradually becoming one of the most popular research topics. Current robotic applications, such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), robotic manipulators, and humanoid robots, all require stereo vision to perceive the accurate depth map of the environment in real time for subsequent decision-making. In the field of autonomous driving, learning-based stereo depth estimation methods achieve significantly higher accuracy compared to traditional methods. However, for the diverse environments in robots, self-adaptive deep stereo is considered as a promising approach to improve the poor generalization of learning-based methods. Although existing neural network accelerators are available for real-time stereo depth estimation, they all present limitations when it comes to self-adaptive scenarios. Some accelerators focus solely on optimizing the computational flow of forward or backward propagation, failing to support the computation of the self-supervised loss function and exploit the specific workload characteristics commonly found in self-adaptive algorithms. On the other hand, accelerator designers typically rely on domain knowledge from hardware rather than robotic applications to optimize compute-system metrics such as accuracy or latency, leading to suboptimal outcomes for application-level performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a hardware-software co-design approach of real-time Self-Adaptive deep Stereo towards RObotic applications named SASRO. It includes a heterogeneous computing architecture consisting of an off-the-shelf inference accelerator and our designed Self-Adaptive Processing Unit (SAPU). Based on this architecture, a quantization-friendly network architecture is proposed. We believe that this design can fully leverage its efficiency in self-adaptive deep stereo, achieving a 20% improvement in accuracy and a 1.95× reduction in latency. Different from traditional design methods towards a single workload, SASRO additionally contains an automatic design framework which optimizes the end-to-end robotic metrics instead of isolated compute-system metrics. Taking robot navigation as an example, SASRO achieves a 1.3∼2.2× increase in navigation speed compared to the low-latency and high-accuracy designs."

    "abstract": "Underwater Acoustic Sensor Network (UASN) faces significant challenges in dynamic environments, including frequent topology changes, high propagation delay, and limited node energy, which collectively shorten network lifetime and degrade performance. This paper proposes a clustering routing protocol for dynamic UASN based on Voronoi dynamic clustering and multi-index cluster head selection, named CRDVM. This paper constructs a 3D dynamic underwater acoustic network model, and a multi-index cluster head node (CH) selection scheme is designed, which comprehensively considers the residual energy, connectivity, hop-count, and distance to the sink node, and then dynamically selects CHs through a fuzzy inference system. Then, the intra-cluster routing employs a distance weighted minimum spanning tree (MST) to shorten transmission paths, whereas inter-cluster routing uses an MST weighted by dual metrics to balance CH energy consumption while low delay. Voronoi graph theory is introduced to realize adaptive clustering in a dynamic environment. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared with QD-DCR, UCPSO, LCOA-ASPPM, and CCCS, the proposed CRDVM achieves a longer network lifetime and better energy balance while keeping delay low."

RFFP models have been demonstrated to classify transmitters based on features within the transmitted signal, although to validate these models when deployed in real-time applications, they must be invariant to changes in ambient temperature. Several papers have mentioned the potential impact of ambient temperature on RFFP classification performance, but to the best of the author’s knowledge, none have directly confirmed this assertion. In this work, we employ an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) waveform implemented using a custom SDR testbed to apply Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Design of Experiments (DOE) concepts to measure the effects of temperature, transmitted power, and center frequency on overthe-air machine learning data sets across a range of operating temperatures to assess performance. RFFP models based on these features are trained using over-the-air data sets at nominal temperatures, and the models are tested to see their performance when the radios operate at different temperatures.

    "abstract": "Biasing remains one of the key scalability bottle necks in superconducting digital circuits, as traditional DC bias networks impose excessive power dissipation, large direct current requirements resulting in significant power overhead. Fast Phase Logic (FPL), an all-Josephson Junction (JJ) logic family, achieves ultra-high density by eliminating resistors and large inductors; however, existing FPL designs still rely on DC bias. This paper introduces a novel architecture: AC-biased FPL (ACFPL), which integrates single-phase AC/SFQ converters with FPL cells to deliver bias currents as quantized pulses, thereby eliminating the need for a global DC distribution network. Circuit-level simulations at 10 GHz demonstrate that AC biasing achieves up to 25× lower power consumption compared to DC bias for RSFQ circuits, and 14.3× reduction in power consumption for FPL circuits in our design-under-test (DUT), which combines FPL JTL, FPL DFF, and FPL AND cells. These results estab lish ACFPL as a scalable and energy-efficient alternative for large-scale superconducting digital systems, effectively combining compact FPL cell design with practical AC/SFQ bias delivery, allowing superconductor VLSI."

    "abstract": "Low-income customers are more vulnerable to power outages because they live in areas with poorly equipped distribution systems. However, existing approaches to improve grid resilience focus on the overall system condition and ignore the outage experiences of low-income customers, which leads to significant energy inequities in resilience. Therefore, this paper explores a new resilience-oriented planning method for distributed generator (DG) siting and sizing, by embedding an additional energy vulnerability constraint (EVC). First, the expected load shedding index (ELSI) is defined as the ratio of the load shedding to the original load, which quantifies the resilience-oriented energy vulnerability. Then, the DG siting and sizing problem is formulated as a two-stage stochastic programming with the EVC. The first stage determines the optimal sites and sizes of DG units under investment constraints and EVCs, while the second stage optimizes expected costs of unserved load. A violation variable is introduced to ensure the model’s solvability. Finally, numerical studies are performed on the IEEE 33-bus and 123-bus systems to verify the effectiveness of the proposed DG planning model in reducing energy vulnerability. Three observations are presented as future guidelines for resilience-oriented DG planning."

We present SpikeLet, the first multi-chiplet neuromorphic system tailored for large-scale SNNs. SpikeLet employs a hierarchical transmission interconnect with an extend-AER protocol to aggregate spikes and decouple intra- and inter-chiplet communication, an event-driven spatial–temporal parallel dataflow that enables cross-layer and cross-timestep parallelism, and a communication-aware hierarchical mapping based on cooperative co-evolution to balance computation and communication across chiplets and cores. On a 4×4-chiplet prototype, SpikeLet reduces transmission latency by 74.2%, improves throughput by 36.6×, and boosts energy efficiency by 39.2× over a 2D multi-chip baseline, demonstrating a compact and scalable platform for next-generation neuromorphic computing."

The PVA–LS–SA hydrogel matrix prepared via low-temperature 3D printing possessed stable mechanical strength and controllable structural morphology. After being conductively functionalized, the hydrogel exhibited reliable strain sensing performance based on the synergistic mechanism of microcracks in the silver particle layer and the tunneling effect within the soft matrix, which was effectively used to monitor various human motion signals including finger, wrist and knee joint movements. A clear polynomial relationship was identified between the relative change in resistance and the applied strain. When connected in the form of an array to a resistance acquisition and display system, the sensor was able to accurately provide real-time feedback with small errors on the magnitude and location of the applied load in practical measurement. The low-temperature 3D printing offered strong supports for the customized preparation and practical application of soft sensing materials and provided a feasible approach for developing conductive hydrogel sensors suitable for micro-strain detection."

Initially, the impact of the temperature on the electromagnetic force (EMF) waves of the excitation source is investigated. A finite element (FE) model for calculating the temperature field of the PMSMs is established, and the temporal and spatial harmonic characteristics of the EMF that significantly contribute to electromagnetic vibration and noise are analyzed. Then, from the perspective of the thermal effect on the material properties of motor structure and thermal stress, the influence of thermal load on structural modes is studied. Finally, a multi-physics FE model for the PMSM, integrating magnetic, thermal, structural, and acoustic fields, is established to predict electromagnetic vibration and noise, and the mechanism of the thermal load on the electromagnetic vibration and noise is revealed. The results indicate that the temperature rise caused by complex vehicular operating conditions simultaneously alters the amplitude of EMFs, modal frequencies, and structural damping. This leads to more complex characteristics in the electromagnetic vibration and noise of vehicular motors."

In this work, we investigate how p-type doping, sulfur vacancy defects, and metal-MoS<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub> coupling jointly determine the contact barrier in monolayer and multilayer MoS<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>. A combined approach using first-principles calculations and device-level simulations is employed to capture contact physics. Experimental measurements of FET devices reveal a systematic thickness-dependent transition from p-type to ambipolar and n-type behavior, which cannot be fully explained by Schottky's model alone. Atomistic modeling shows that ionized dopants generate an interfacial dipole that lowers the hole injection barrier, while sulfur vacancies introduce donor-like gap states that compensate this dipole and strengthen Fermi-level pinning. In parallel, the metal-MoS<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub> interaction varies strongly with the van der Waals gap.

The computational demands of massive data challenge centralized cloud networks, leading to a novel CAV paradigm supported by mobile edge computing (MEC) and built on Web3. CAVs in Web3 can efficiently and securely offload compute-intensive tasks to edge devices in a decentralized and self-controlled manner, necessitating dependable task offloading schemes. However, existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based offloading schemes face two challenges: overlooking security risks like privacy exposure in dependability definitions, while being constrained by reward function formulation, resulting in poor generalization. In this paper, we propose a dependable offloading scheme based on intelligence and active inference for CAVs in Web3. First, we introduce a dependable offloading framework utilizing double-layer blockchain and decentralized identifiers to ensure offloading source dependability. Then, by introducing a security-measuring dependability metric called cost from energy consumption, delay, and privacy exposure risk (cEDP), we formulate the dependable offloading optimization problem from an intelligence and active inference perspective, enabling higher-level environmental cognition without rewards. The problem is solved by the proposed intelligence-based active inference (INAI) algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that reward-free INAI outperforms mainstream DRL and heuristic approaches in convergence, efficiency, and generalization capabilities."

The design incorporates a Light Emitting Diode (LED) model building upon the frameworks of Time-Delay Reservoir Computing (TDRC) and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN). In contrast to traditional RC, which uses a randomly connected neural network reservoir, the proposed method integrates a physical model that emulates the nonlinear electro-optical behavior of LEDs into the reservoir layer. This approach directly incorporates the intrinsic characteristics of LEDs, enabling the equalizer to more effectively capture the signal distortions caused by VLC channels. As a result, the model-driven RC significantly improves signal recovery under varying channel conditions, including different bandwidths and modulation voltages. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves up to 56.0% and 34.6% reductions in Bit Error Rate (BER) compared to traditional RC and Volterra equalizers, respectively. The method also improves average subcarrier Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) by 1.2 dB over Volterra and by 1.5 dB over traditional RC, resulting in an achievable rate improvement by nearly 10%. Additionally, the model-driven RC offers a key advantage in terms of data efficiency for the training stage, requiring only 20% of the total dataset compared to the 50% required by traditional RC and Volterra equalizers."

To achieve output consensus, we design a novel fully distributed estimator-based control protocol without requiring prior knowledge of global network topology. Specifically, the fully distributed estimator is formulated through a graphical game perspective, modeling agent-neighbor interactions as zero-sum conflicts, to overcome the fragility of cooperative estimation in adversarial or resource-constrained environments. By employing min-max strategies, each agent can robustly optimize its local estimation policy against neighbors’ worst-case policies. To demonstrate the applicability of this approach to intelligent transportation networks, we develop a corresponding fully distributed platooning control algorithm that ensures coordinated motion of heterogeneous connected vehicles. Finally, numerical simulations and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed protocols."

To address this issue, a table tennis training action analysis framework is proposed, which integrates rotation-enhanced three-dimensional convolutional neural networks (3D CNN), multi-head spatiotemporal attention (MSTA), and graph convolutional networks combined with dynamic time warping (GCN+DTW). The modules were arranged sequentially for feature extraction, temporal dependency modeling, alignment correction, and structural evaluation, forming a progressive fusion mechanism. The results show that the proposed model achieved over 92% Rank-1 accuracy in action recognition tasks, while the mean absolute error (MAE) in quality scoring is reduced by more than 30% compared with other methods. In the consistency analysis, the weighted DTW improved the agreement with human scores by about 15%–20% on eight typical actions. These results show that the model improves recognition accuracy and scoring consistency, confirming the effectiveness of its joint design. The study provides strong support for the development of action recognition and action quality assessment methods."

First, a reconfigurable processing element (RPE) design for modular arithmetic and a reusable data generator for polynomial sampling are developed to support the various operations in FHE. Second, a configurable RPE array supporting polynomial operations and a decoupled automorphism unit (DAU) necessary for homomorphic rotations are proposed to accelerate the FHE primitives with complex dataflow. Finally, an on-chip data generation strategy and a cache-aware operation scheduling (CAOS) method are introduced to alleviate the memory bottleneck in the end-to-end execution of FHE applications.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates social-aware edge caching in device-to-device (D2D) networks with multiple user equipments (UEs). Each file is encoded hierarchically and divided into multiple layers of sub-files, allowing each UE to cache partial layers and share them with others via D2D links. The system operates in discrete time slots, where contents can be retrieved in the following order: local cache, socially-connected D2D peers, and remote content servers. D2D sharing is restricted to users with social ties, quantified by a multi-attribute model combining interest similarity and social trust. We intend to maximize total backhaul bandwidth savings by jointly optimizing content placement, D2D user pairing, and base station (BS) bandwidth allocation, under constraints on storage capacity, unique pairing, total BS bandwidth, and service delay, etc. Given the NP-hardness of this joint optimization problem, we propose an Improved Constrained Fireworks Algorithm (ICFWA) that efficiently explores the solution space with low complexity and strong global search capability. In the algorithm, each firework or spark represents a feasible solution encompassing the three types of decision variables. Three explosion strategies are designed by modifying one category of variables for local search, and Gaussian mutation simultaneously modifies all variables to enhance global exploration. Simulation results demonstrate that ICFWA exhibits strong convergence performance and significantly outperforms baseline methods in maximizing backhaul bandwidth savings."

    "abstract": "Current congestion control algorithms ignore the application-layer delay, where the untransmitted data waiting at source nodes degrades the delay performance of services. Moreover, differentiated priorities are necessary for the application services with various delay requirements, especially for mission-critical services. Different from the existing works only considering the network delay, in this paper, by adding the flow queueing delay at source nodes, we formulate the network utility maximization (NUM) problem with additional deterministic service delay constraints. We propose a general TCP-based two-timescale congestion window control (TCWC) framework with delay-aware priority to enhance traditional algorithms. Specifically, to handle the obstacle of new delay constraints, we transform them to the time-average stability of virtual queues. By solving the new NUM problem via Lyapunov optimization, we design a short-term congestion window adjustment strategy in each time slot. To further guarantee the service delay, we apply extreme value theory (EVT) to evaluate the priorities of different flows, and determine the long-term control of window update rates. We deploy the proposed framework in three classic algorithms including NewReno, Vegas and DCTCP. In addition, simulation results show that our TCWC framework can significantly reduce the average service delay and provide deterministic guarantees compared with time-aware TCP congestion control algorithms such as TIMELY and BBRv2."

However, existing methods still face challenges such as confusing linear features with farmland boundary texture, boundary shift due to downsampling, and deep feature edge structure degradation when accurately inscribing change boundaries. To this end, this paper proposes a farmland change detection network (AMDDSMNet) based on asymmetric multidirectional convolutional attention and dynamic spatial modulation. The network first suppresses interference and irrelevant changes through spatial-spectral dual-domain difference modelling; subsequently, it introduces a library of learnable primitives via a Dynamic Spatial Modulator (DSM) to incorporate topological priors, thereby significantly enhancing edge continuity. Concurrently, an asymmetric multi-directional convolutional attention (AMCA) module is employed to dynamically focus on multi-scale linear boundaries via a directional attention mechanism, effectively enhancing edge response sensitivity. Comprehensive experiments on three farmland-specific datasets, CLCD, GFSWCLCD, and LJCLCD, and the building change dataset, HRSCU-CD, show that, for the farmland change detection task, AMD-DSMNet achieves the optimal performance on all the dedicated datasets, with F1 scores improved by <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$0.13\\%$</tex-math></inline-formula> - <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$1.32\\%$</tex-math></inline-formula> compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms.

This architecture supports collaborative model training among multiple edge nodes, while ensuring user data privacy and overcoming the limitations of centralized systems. To validate system performance, we performed extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets (ToN_IoT, IoT-23, and UNSW-NB15). Experimental results show that compared to centralized IDS, our edge computing-assisted distributed IDS achieves significant reductions in training time, up to 44. 4% faster, while maintaining competitive detection performance. These improvements are particularly important for real-time applications in B5G/6G networks.

However, as IoV networks increase in scale and complexity, ensuring trustworthy interactions among vehicles, infrastructure, and service providers becomes paramount. This paper, therefore, presents a comprehensive review of trustworthiness management for an IoV network. Firstly, the transition of Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) to IoV followed by an examination of the notion of trust in various domains has been explored. Subsequently, the characteristics of trust, salient constituents of trust, key trust attributes, trust evaluation parameters, and trust-based attacks in the context of an IoV network have been delineated. Moreover, the five key processes involved in the trust management, i.e., trust formation, trust propagation, trust aggregation, trust update, and trust decision, have been investigated vis-à-vis the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, the advanced trust management models, i.e., conventional and artificial intelligence-based ones, have been analyzed in-depth. Finally, simulation tools and datasets employed in IoV-based trust management models have been introduced, along with an outline of key open research directions in this domain"

In particular, a novel asymmetric risk fields considering human drivers’ attention is incorporated to guide safe and timely intrinsic decision.

To address these issues, an encode–transmit–decode detector (ETD-Det) is presented, co-optimized across encoding, transmission, and decoding. On the encoding side, a spectral diffusion encoder (LapSpecEnc) is proposed. Frequency-domain diffusion is performed by LapSpecEnc to suppress high-frequency background noise and to maintain coherent, orientation-consistent features. On the decoding side, an Extended Gaussian Distribution (EGD) together with a Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence-based loss (EGKLD) are introduced. This design provides direction-sensitive geometric representation and mitigates the angle-gradient degradation observed in standard Gaussian formulations, particularly for nearly square targets. Extensive evaluation has been conducted, demonstrating strong effectiveness and generalization: ETD-Det achieves 90.61% mAP on HRSC2016, 90.37% mAP on UCAS-AOD, 81.54% mAP on DOTA-v1.0, and an F-measure of 82.33% on ICDAR2015. These results surpass existing methods under comparable settings and support ETD-Det as a robust and accurate solution for high-precision AOOD."

First, an equivalent structural model is established according to system architecture. For each component, a fuzzy state transition model is built based on triangular fuzzy numbers and Markov process. Then, the UGF method is integrated to express and infer the state probability and performance level distribution of system paths and branches, based on which three multi-state reliability indexes are calculated, respectively reliability, average performance, and performance shortfall. The propagation of component state transition uncertainty results in system reliability uncertainty. Their uncertain degree is quantified by a fuzzy entropy-based index. Finally, a case of MEA EPS is studied, and the comparative results show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method, supporting the reliability design and maintenance of MEA EPS."

    "abstract": "Interferometric microwave radiometers often suffer from land-sea contamination (LSC) in coastal brightness temperature (TB) observations due to the Gibbs effect. This contamination leads to anomalously high nearshore TB, significantly affecting data quality and subsequent applications. The nodal sampling (NS) can correct this contamination but have limitations under complex coastal conditions. This study proposes an improved NS algorithm targeted at the coastal regions, named LSC-NS. The method enhances nearshore details through spatial oversampling and constructs sinusoidal surrogate signals in contaminated regions. The method was first validated using an interferometric microwave radiometer (IMR) simulation system. Then, SMOS data were used for three-level evaluation. In orbit validation over open sea regions, the average normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) decreased from 14.97% to 7.91%. In more challenging closed sea regions, the average NRMSE dropped from 33.52% to 25.05%, with a significant reduction in coefficient of variation as well. These results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm effectively mitigates land contamination and substantially improves TB accuracy and spatial consistency. The method provides essential algorithm support for operational applications of IMRs in coastal areas and offers valuable reference for similar future satellite missions."

However, MRI-based subtype classifications are often confounded by co-occurring pathologies and non-AD factors, such as genetic predisposition and environmental influences, limiting their clinical interpretability. We propose 3D-DisAD, an unsupervised deep learning framework that disentangles AD-specific neuroanatomical variations from unrelated influences and clusters patients into subtypes with homogeneous brain phenotypes. The framework comprises two synergistic networks: (1) Contrastive Disentanglement Network, which separates AD-specific variations from those shared by AD patients and healthy controls; and (2) Transformation Generation Network, which refines these disease-specific variations by transforming healthy brain representations into realistic, pathology-consistent anatomies via diffusion-based generative modeling. Evaluated on four public datasets, 3D-DisAD reveals strong correlations between the disentangled AD-specific variations and diverse clinical and biological profiles, validating their relevance. Using these variations, we identify four AD subtypes with significant differences in biomarkers, cognitive trajectories, and genetic signatures, and uncover distinct longitudinal progression patterns that suggest potential windows for early intervention. By disentangling AD-specific variations, our method enables more precise patient stratification and personalized treatments, particularly in the early stage of AD.

    "abstract": "Effective and efficient sensor data analysis is crucial for achieving scientific and reliable machinery fault diagnosis. Recently, federated learning (FL) has been widely studied to collaboratively train fault diagnosis models on the distributed sensor data while protecting data privacy. Nevertheless, the performance of existing FL methods is often hampered by intraclient and interclient data heterogeneity. Moreover, they typically require all model parameters to be transmitted between the server and clients, resulting in substantial communication overhead. To address these challenges, a novel parameter-efficient federated adaptive fine-tuning framework is developed. First, the label-smoothing strategy is introduced to facilitate collaborative model pre-training across multiple clients. Then, a lightweight feature scaling and shifting pool is designed to adjust the features extracted by the pre-trained model through federated fine-tuning. Finally, to make the global model adapt to the heterogeneous measurement data of different clients, an instance-adaptive fault diagnosis mechanism is developed to set customized tuning parameters for the model based on the features of each test sample. Extensive experiments conducted on two self-built test platforms show that the proposed method improves diagnosis accuracy by 3.47% and reduces communication cost by 92.40% compared with state-of-the-art FL methods. These results demonstrate the superiority and practicality of our method in heterogeneous industrial environments."

    "abstract": "We propose a novel method for dual open-stopband (OSB) suppression in a slotline-based dual-band leaky-wave antenna (LWA) through a stub-loaded configuration. Firstly, a stub modeled as a series impedance is introduced in the right half-period. By optimizing its position relative to the input, the Bloch impedance near the -1st spatial harmonic (SH) broadside frequency is tuned to achieve impedance matching conditions, thereby suppressing the OSB in the lower band. Similarly, placing an identical stub in the left half-period and adjusting its position suppresses the OSB associated with the -2nd SH. Finally, loading both stubs at their pre-optimized positions achieves simultaneous dual-OSB suppression in the dual-band LWA. A prototype was fabricated and measured, showing good agreement with simulations. The measured results demonstrate for the -1st SH a scanning range of -61° to +69° (6.8–11.6 GHz) with a peak gain of 9.6 dBi, corresponding to a scanning rate of 2.49°/%, while the -2nd SH exhibits a scanning range of -68° to +43° (12.8 19.2 GHz) with a peak gain of 12.4 dBi and a scanning rate of 2.78°/%. Compared to the reference design, the proposed antenna exhibits measured performance enhancements, including 3.3 dB gain with 23.3% higher efficiency near 8.8 GHz and 1.6 dB gain with 10.6% higher efficiency near 16.2 GHz, along with more stable radiation performance across both operating bands. The proposed technique offers an effective and compact solution for dual-band LWAs in 5G frequency-division duplex systems."

    "abstract": "In addition to securely handling objects, grippers endowed with a sense of touch are desirable for handling delicate objects. Force sensors can be mounted distally at the fingertips, but a simpler option is to estimate fingertip forces from motor current at the base. This approach, which is not new, reduces wire routing and recesses electronics away from the sensed surface for operation in wet environments. However, for such a strategy to work, the actuating motor must have no or low gearing, which increases its transparency to external torques, but greatly limits its own torque output. Therein lies a trade-off. In addition to gearing, the transmission ratio from motor to fingertip is also defined by the gripper linkage itself. In this work, the trade-off is overcome by introducing a linkage capable of reconfiguring without the need of an extra actuator. Reconfiguration is performed by moving across an output singularity to select between a mode which is biased for force sensing (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">sense mode</i>) and a mode which is biased for force production (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">grip mode</i>). These novel kinematics are embodied as a mostly monolithic compliant mechanism, leaving just one traditional pin joint in the entire gripper assembly. Experiments show that force mode exhibits 3.1× more force output, and sense mode can measure 2.6× smaller forces. Corollary to the latter, sense mode is ideal for estimating the stiffness of objects, including small fruits with stiffness lower than 150 N/m. As an illustration, we demonstrate the usage of sense mode to estimate the ripeness of small fruits, followed by a transition to force mode in order to pluck the fruit. Ripeness is distinguished with up to <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\approx 90\\%$</tex-math></inline-formula> accuracy based on estimates of stiffness and fruit size using sense mode."

Through-focus scanning optical microscopy (TSOM) is an optical non-destructive nanoscale measurement IC technique. However, the research on uncertainty evaluation is insufficient in TSOM. The application of Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout in TSOM cannot balance the measurement accuracy and uncertainty evaluation. In this paper, we propose an enhanced adaptive Bayesian MC Dropout method with a novel loss function incorporating learnable parameters. This approach simultaneously evaluates data and model uncertainties while optimizing the precision-uncertainty tradeoff through adaptive parameter learning. Then, we propose a verification method to validate the proposed uncertainty evaluation method.

However, the addition operation in LNS is relatively complex and difficult to balance between precision and hardware overhead. In this work, we observe that the input patterns of the computing units in the inference phase of LLMs exhibit highly skewed frequencies, resulting in non-uniform contributions to the final error. Based on this observation, we propose the Beyond Uniform Approximation (BUA) to enhance the efficiency of LNS additions. From the perspective of Lookup Tables (LUTs), we propose LUT reshaping to efficiently reduce the approximation error, as well as LUT trimming, a heuristic method for simplifying LUTs within a given error budget. From the perspective of the entire LNS adder, we introduce auxiliary circuit approximation, which further reduces the hardware cost by simplifying computing data paths that are less frequently activated. Together, these techniques enable efficient approximate computing in LNS. Experimental results indicate that, compared to the Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) unit using the naive LNS adder, BUA significantly reduces perplexity across various LLMs while reducing Area-Delay Product (ADP) by 26.7% and Power-Delay Product (PDP) by 30.8%. Compared to the traditional integer MAC unit, LNS with BUA achieves higher zero-shot accuracy while reducing ADP by 35.1% and PDP by 44.0%. Moreover, we also offer additional approximation options that provide greater hardware savings with only minor degradation in accuracy."

    "abstract": "Dynamic resource allocation in mobile wireless networks involves complex, time-varying optimization problems, motivating the adoption of deep reinforcement learning (DRL). However, most existing works rely on pre-trained policies, overlooking dynamic environmental changes that rapidly invalidate the policies. Periodic retraining becomes inevitable but incurs prohibitive computational costs and energy consumption-critical concerns for resource-constrained wireless systems. We identify three root causes of inefficient retraining: high-dimensional state spaces, suboptimal action spaces exploration-exploitation trade-offs, and reward design limitations. To overcome these limitations, we propose Diffusion-based Deep Reinforcement Learning (D2RL), which leverages generative diffusion models (GDMs) to holistically enhance all three DRL components. GDMs’ iterative refinement process and distribution modelling enable (1) the generation of diverse state samples to improve environmental understanding, (2) balanced action space exploration to escape local optima, and (3) the design of discriminative reward functions that better evaluate action quality. Our framework operates in two modes: Mode I leverages GDMs to explore reward spaces and design discriminative reward functions that rigorously evaluate action quality, while Mode II synthesizes diverse state samples to enhance environmental understanding and generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that D2RL achieves faster convergence and reduced computational costs over conventional DRL methods for resource allocation in wireless communications while maintaining competitive policy performance. This work underscores the transformative potential of GDMs in overcoming fundamental DRL training bottlenecks for wireless networks, paving the way for practical, real-time deployments."

    "abstract": "The characteristics of seabed types are of great importance for understanding the marine environment and the changes taking place there, spatial planning, seabed investments, and natural resources extraction. Currently, machine learning methods and expert interpretations are often used in the classification of seabed types. Despite the strong development of automated methods in natural science research, which significantly accelerate the analysis of large areas, their results are not fully consistent with reality. The validation of semi-automatic classification results also remains an important issue. Expert analysis, although time-consuming and sometimes subjective, remains the most accurate tool for identifying bottom classes, but in practice it is very difficult to perform it over large areas. In order to reduce these problems, the authors present a data processing scheme starting with data registration, through machine learning, determining probability and accuracy of prediction, determining hybrid classes (combining information about possible types of bottom) and finally expert interpretation using the results of semi-automatic classification. This minimizes the time spent by experts and reduces subjectivity, identifies areas with low probability where expert interpretation is very valuable, and improves the semi-automatic classification result. The work was performed using point information on seabed sediment types and bathymetric and backscatter data recorded with multibeam echosounder (MBES), on the basis of which second-order parameters were prepared. The CatBoost training algorithm and Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV) were used. The average accuracy score from 50 repetitions of the predictive algorithm was 75%. Using the results of semi-automatic classification, developed hybrid classes, probabilities, and originally recorded data, the expert prepared a map of bottom types, correcting errors in semi-automatic classification. The presented results are valuable due to the described semi-automatic classification procedure applied to marine data, as well as the use of hybrid classes and the indication of the importance of combining the capabilities of machine learning methods with expert knowledge."

    "abstract": "Reliable long-horizon dynamics prediction for UAVs is crucial for mitigating collision risks as urban air mobility expands rapidly. However, current prediction methods suffer from distribution shift and error accumulation due to complex nonlinear dynamics and noisy data. To address these issues, we propose a stability-guaranteed dynamics modeling (SGDM) method which integrates a spatial-temporal linear Transformer (STLT) with a neural Lyapunov function (NLF). The STLT enables efficient long-horizon dynamics prediction while eliminating error accumulation and distribution shift through spatial-temporal decoupled multi-head attention, linear-complexity attention, and a non-autoregressive decoder. The NLF enforces global exponential stability by restricting predictions to a Lyapunov stable subspace. Then, a stability-constrained optimization algorithm is proposed to optimize STLT and NLF jointly, thereby assuring both prediction accuracy and stability. Experimental results on helicopter and quadrotor datasets demonstrate that SGDM outperforms state-of-the-art models, reducing RMSE by 48-71% and accelerating inference by 14-45%. This work effectively bridges data-driven learning with Lyapunov stability theory, providing reliable long-horizon dynamics prediction for safety-critical UAV operations."

This innovation not only facilitates the seamless application of super-resolution DOA estimators but also enables robust DOA estimation, accurately localizing more sources than the number of physical antenna elements. We introduce two bespoke FA array structures and mobility strategies tailored to scenarios with aligned and misaligned received signals, respectively, demonstrating a hardware-driven approach to overcoming complexities typically addressed by intricate algorithms. A key contribution is a light-of-sight (LoS)-centric, closed-form DOA estimator, which first employs an eigenvalue-ratio test for precise LoS path number detection, followed by a polynomial root-finding procedure. This method distinctly showcases the unique advantages of FAS by simplifying the estimation process while enhancing accuracy. Numerical results compellingly verify that the proposed FA array designs and estimation techniques yield an extended DoFs range, deliver superior DOA accuracy, and maintain robustness across diverse signal conditions."

A single-mode fiber serves as the sensor, forming a Fabry-Pérot-like interferometer with reflections from the fiber endface and SAW surface. The method achieves high sensitivity (10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-6</sup> relative to optical wavelength) through phase amplification and coherent sampling enabled by the optical wave's high speed comparing with surface acoustic velocity. An analytical Fabry-Pérot-like model relates the sensor response to SAW amplitude, accounting for spatial averaging to yield true amplitudes with 0.09 μm lateral resolution – far below the 9 μm fiber spot size without additional optics. Experimental results show linear amplitude dependence on interdigital transducer voltage (up to ~10 pm at 1 V root-mean-square), validated theoretically and experimentally.

    "abstract": "In recent years, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based remote sensing image super-resolution (SR) has made great progress and attracted much attention. However, applying them to low computing capacity devices in the real world is challenging due to the vast number of parameters. This paper proposes a Multibranch Skip Feature Fusion Network (MSFFN) with minimal parameters and better restoration performance. The primary objective of the proposed work is to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) images in the multiwavelet domain. The proposed model utilizes the balanced Geronimo-Hardin-Massopus (GHM) Multiwavelet Transform (MWT) to decompose images into sixteen subbands, thereby enabling an efficient representation of fine edges and textures. A MSFFN is designed to aggregate hierarchical features across scales, while the Channel Splitting Distillation Block (CSDB) refines hierarchical features by separating and fusing contextual and high-frequency information. Furthermore, the Feature Enhancement Attention Module (FEAM) adaptively emphasizes salient features, ensuring precise detail recovery. Experiments conducted on three benchmark remote sensing image datasets demonstrate that the proposed MSFFN achieves superior reconstruction accuracy. The image of the Gangotri glacier captured on September 9, 2001, by NASA’s Terra satellite, is also included in the model’s performance analysis for real-time images with complex patterns and textures. The reconstructed images have better visual quality than the existing approaches with 719 k parameters."

    "abstract": "This paper presents an adaptive fuzzy tracking control protocol for a category of uncertain nonlinear multi-agent systems (MASs) subject to deception attacks and multiple constraints (time-varying asymmetry constraints on tracking error and system states). Fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) are employed to approximate the unknown nonlinear dynamics in MASs. Since deception attacks over the sensor network make the actual states of the MASs unavailable, this paper employs the compromised states for feedback control. Based on the relationship between the compromised states and actual states, the problem of satisfying the original state constraints boils down to the new constraints on compromised states. The use of a nonlinear mapping together with the dynamic surface control (DSC) strategy can ensure that the multiple constraints are solved with the constraint boundaries of system output being freely selected by the user, the feasibility requirement on the virtual controller is removed, and the computational explosion is mitigated. Under this control protocol, the tracking performance of MASs subject to deception attacks is achieved, while all constraints are not violated. Ultimately, simulation results verify the effectiveness and advantage of the developed control method."

    "abstract": "Bitcoin's security is based on the assumption that a sufficient amount of benign computing power participates in “mining” new blocks by generating publicly verifiable proofs. The blockchain denial of service (BDoS) attackers generate a valid proof but withhold the whole block, resulting in honest miners stopping the participation service but waiting for the exposure of the new block, and attackers achieving 21% computing power would significantly threaten the security of blockchain applications. We find that the threshold value 21% is based on the assumption that honest miners are only concerned with current short-term benefits, i.e., they have an immediate tendency to stop mining once a BDoS attack occurs and their short-term gains decline. However, similar to the altruistic behavior observed in biological systems, certain blockchain nodes exhibit a form of rational altruism during attacks. When the blockchain system is under threat, these nodes prioritize the long-term stability of the network and choose to continue mining honestly. This phenomenon has not yet been well studied. Motivated by the above observation, we propose a resumption strategy that enables honest miners to resume mining after pausing (<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$S_\\text{CMP}$</tex-math></inline-formula>) for a while, mitigating BDoS attacks and maintaining blockchain security. Subsequently, we formalize a two-stage evolutionary game model to quantitatively analyze the defensive capacity against BDoS with the <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$S_\\text{CMP}$</tex-math></inline-formula> strategy. Theoretical analysis shows that BDoS attackers can only successfully stop blockchain mining when the attacking power and profit factor satisfy a certain condition <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\text{Cd}_{dead}(\\gamma,w,\\alpha _{A},c)$</tex-math></inline-formula>, where our proposed strategy enables the attack mining power threshold to be raised to 33.1% approaching 1/3, which is the upper bound of the byzantine false tolerance.

    "abstract": "Emotional support conversation systems have emerged as a promising complement to traditional mental health consultations, offering context-aware dialogue to support seekers’ emotional well-being. Despite their potential, two fundamental challenges remain unresolved: 1) modeling long-term emotional trajectory beyond short-term relief; and 2) adapting support strategies to context in a psychologically coherent manner. To address these challenges, we propose CAIWO, a novel framework that integrates world modeling and causality-enhanced imitation learning to systematically support seekers, alleviate psychological stress, and restore emotional balance. Specifically, CAIWO comprises two core components. The first is an emotional world model, which captures long-term emotional trajectories from historical interactions to inform anticipatory guidance. The second is a causality-enhanced imitation learning module, which infers latent causal dependencies to facilitate coherent strategy transitions and mitigate compounding errors typical of conventional imitation learning. By incorporating the final latent variables into the response decoder, CAIWO dynamically adjusts the strategies and generates emotionally resonant responses. Extensive experiments on the ESConv benchmark demonstrate that CAIWO outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 8.6%, significantly improving the generation of responses that align with seekers’ emotional development and psychological needs."

The sensor employs a self-fabricated, large-core HC-ARF (0.75m) and a uniquely designed coupling unit to achieve a fully fiber optic architecture, offering a rapid response time of 9.4 s. The system demonstrated concentration sensitivities of 0.0006 V/ppm (R² = 99.95%) for CH₄ and 0.0019 V/ppm (R² = 99.96%) for C₂H₂. The minimum detection limit (MDL), derived from experimental standard deviation, was 36 ppm for CH₄ and 4.2 ppm for C₂H₂. Furthermore, Allan deviation analysis enabled the optimization of the MDL to 0.63 ppm (at an integration time of 7.93 s) for CH₄ and 0.08 ppm (at 9.57 s) for C₂H₂. The sensor was successfully deployed in a laboratory-simulated industrial gas leak scenario, which was proved capable of real-time concentration monitoring and precise leak localization. The detection limit of the proposed sensor can be further improved by selecting gas absorption lines with higher intensity or by using a longer HC-ARF."

In particular, the target decay and capture solenoid for the Muon Collider and the central solenoid of next-generation fusion devices both demand solenoids capable of producing a 20 T peak field in a bore larger than 1 m, at 20 K, with stored energy exceeding 300 MJ (single coil). Such performance is well beyond present state-of-the-art, requiring a dedicated programme to validate conductor technologies, magnet architectures, and protection strategies. This paper presents the results of a feasibility study originated from discussions between CERN and Eni on a common solenoid concept serving as technology validation for both high-energy physics experiments and magnetic-confinement fusion devices such as tokamaks. The main result of the study, which brought together universities and research centers, is a “20@20” model coil concept. We report here the rationale for the selection of the target performance of the “20@20” model coil, and the highlights of the study, which was instrumental to identify high priority developments required towards its realization."

    "abstract": "This study addresses the cooperative tracking control for multiple vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) drones operating in networked environments. The problem is particularly challenging due to the strongly nonlinear dynamics of drones, uncertain time-varying disturbances, limited communication bandwidth, and control chattering on the first-order sliding manifold. Existing approaches often address only part of these challenges or lack rigorous fixed-time convergence guarantees. To tackle these issues, this article proposes a novel adaptive neural network event-triggered fixed-time super-twisting (ANEFS) control strategy within a double closed-loop hierarchical framework. In the outer loop, a novel auxiliary variable-based distributed fixed-time estimator (ADFE) is designed, which, unlike conventional asymptotic estimators, guarantees fast and accurate estimation of the leader’s trajectory. This is integrated into an event-triggered fixed-time super-twisting (EFST) control law that ensures precise position tracking while significantly reducing network usage. In the inner loop, an adaptive neural network fixed-time super-twisting (ANFST) torque controller robustly handles complex system nonlinearities and uncertainties, ensuring rapid attitude tracking. The effectiveness of the proposed method in providing fast, robust, and resource-efficient cooperative tracking is demonstrated through both numerical simulations and real-world flight experiments using lightweight Crazyflie quadcopters."

    "abstract": "FAS-enabled cooperative non-orthogonal multiple access (FAS-CoNOMA) systems capture the potential of fluid antenna systems in enhancing network performance. In this system, a base station (BS) transmits a superposition signal to a central user (CU) and a cell-edge user (EU), both equipped with FAS. Specifically, the CU decodes the signal intended for the EU and cooperatively relays it to improve the EU’s communication performance. The EU employs selective combining (SC) or maximum ratio combining (MRC) to receive signals from both the BS and CU. By leveraging the dynamic properties of FAS to improve user differentiation, the CoNOMA system effectively enhances network performance compared to traditional NOMA, OMA, and fixed position antenna (FPA) systems. To address the challenging spatial correlation properties in FAS, we utilize the block-diagonal matrix approximation (BDMA) model to calculate the outage probabilities for both the CU and EU. We then derive upper bound, lower bound, and asymptotic approximation of the outage probabilities to gain deeper insights. Furthermore, we optimize the EU’s outage probability under the CU’s outage constraint and total transmit power limits by adjusting the power allocation coefficient for the CU and the transmit powers for both the BS and CU. To simplify the optimization process, we reduce the number of variables and apply the alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to break down the problem into two sub-problems. Each sub-problem is solved using the bisection search method and gradient descent algorithm (GDA). Simulation results demonstrate that FAS significantly improves outage performance, especially for the EU, and that CoNOMA notably captures the potential of FAS beyond NOMA and OMA, offering a promising solution for future wireless networks."

The method is demonstrated through the design, fabrication, and experimental validation of an F-band mixer. Due to the absence of a supporting substrate in MISL, incorporating the specific mechanical support design is indispensable to ensure mechanical stability. To address this challenge, the innovative approach in this article fully leverages the dual functionality of the short-circuit structures within filters in the mixer for both filtering and support. This eliminates the dependency on additional support structures, thereby reducing redundant circuit area usage and associated insertion loss. By establishing an EM-mechanical bi-objective evaluation function, both the intermediate frequency (IF) and local oscillator (LO) filter structures were designed and optimized. For the first time in terahertz circuit design, mechanical reliability is incorporated from the initial design stage. Experimental results demonstrate that the mixer exhibits conversion losses ranging from 5.48 to 7.72dB across 113–120 GHz, which aligns well with simulation curves, demonstrating competitive radio frequency (RF) performance and verified mechanical fabrication reliability. This approach provides a new solution for terahertz circuit packaging and MISL circuit design, achieving high performance and miniaturization."

    "abstract": "Accurate characterization of fractured porous media is essential for hydrocarbon exploration and coal mine safety, with traditional seismic methods often failing to provide reliable parameter estimates. Fractured porous media, characterized by horizontally aligned fractures embedded within a porous background, can be modeled as a transversely isotropic medium with a vertical symmetrical axis (VTI). A relaxation function was employed to establish quantitative links between porosity (ϕ), fracture weakness (δ<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</sub>), water saturation (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">S<sub>w</sub></i>), and the full elastic stiffness tensor. While the linearized Rüger approximation was commonly adopted as the forward operator in prestack inversion for VTI media, its accuracy degraded significantly at moderate to large incidence angles, limiting reliable parameter estimation. To address this limitation, this study proposes an exact Graebner-based multi-domain inversion (EGMI) framework that leverages the exact Graebner equation for enhanced angular accuracy. A Bayesian inversion scheme was constructed using a Cauchy distribution as the prior, and joint time-frequency inversion was performed to exploit the noise robustness of time-domain data and the resolution enhancement from frequency-domain information. The inversion was implemented via a Levenberg–Marquardt optimization, with analytical Jacobians. Comparative experiments on both synthetic and field data showed that the EGMI method provides superior accuracy and resolution for fractured reservoir characterization, with significant implications for unconventional resource exploration and product optimization."

The proposed system integrates a micro-loop resonator (MLR) coated with hydroxyethyl cellulose/poly(vinylidene fluoride) (HEC/PVDF) and a D-shaped fiber coated with Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The two sensors were experimentally characterized, achieving a 0.076 dBm/%RH sensitivity to relative humidity for the MLR and a 0.045 dB/°C response to temperature for the D-shaped fiber. A multimodal dataset was produced from the MLR’s transmission spectrum and the D-shaped fiber’s power output to train a deep learning fusion model combining convolutional neural networks (CNN) and a multilayer perceptron (MLP). This approach was selected to exploit the full spectral characteristics of the MLR rather than single-peak features, enabling robust compensation of temperature-induced cross-sensitivity. The fusion model was trained using a leave-one-temperature-out approach and achieved a mean absolute error of 0.499 ± 0.173 %RH. The results demonstrate that deep-learning-based sensor fusion effectively mitigates temperature cross-sensitivity and improves the robustness of relative humidity sensing."

Building on the technique, a novel time-varying gain fuzzy state observer is designed to identify unmeasured states. Additionally, computational complexity can be avoided, and new adaptive laws can be created by implementing the nonlinear filter and smooth projection operator, respectively. Then, an observer-based fuzzy adaptive prescribed-time output feedback control algorithm is proposed, which can show that all of the platoon system's signals are bounded within a prescribed time, and the tracking and observe errors can asymptotically converge to zero via Lasalle theorem.

Crowdsensing data trading (CDT) systems provide an effective means to collect opinions from distributed workers for ranking tasks. However, these systems face several challenges, including preserving privacy, maintaining ranking accuracy, optimizing worker participation, and ensuring incentive compatibility for all stakeholders. To address these challenges, we propose OPAR-IC, an integrated framework designed to enhance efficiency and privacy in CDT systems. The proposed framework integrates a multi-armed bandit (MAB) based approach to dynamically adjust ranking granularity, a hybrid privacy-preserving mechanism combining logarithmic and binary methods to safeguard worker data, and a combinatorial MAB model for efficient worker recruitment. To enhance worker participation and ensure incentive compatibility among all stakeholders, we integrate a hierarchical Stackelberg game into the framework, balancing competing incentives and achieving equilibrium. Our approach is thoroughly validated through theoretical analysis, offering theoretical guarantees for privacy, ranking accuracy, worker participation, and incentive compatibility. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate significant improvements in adaptive ranking accuracy, privacy preservation, worker recruitment, and three-party incentive compatibility."

    "abstract": "In addition to securely handling objects, grippers endowed with a sense of touch are desirable for handling delicate objects. Force sensors can be mounted distally at the fingertips, but a simpler option is to estimate fingertip forces from motor current at the base. This approach, which is not new, reduces wire routing and recesses electronics away from the sensed surface for operation in wet environments. However, for such a strategy to work, the actuating motor must have no or low gearing, which increases its transparency to external torques, but greatly limits its own torque output. Therein lies a trade-off. In addition to gearing, the transmission ratio from motor to fingertip is also defined by the gripper linkage itself. In this work, the trade-off is overcome by introducing a linkage capable of reconfiguring without the need of an extra actuator. Reconfiguration is performed by moving across an output singularity to select between a mode which is biased for force sensing (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">sense mode</i>) and a mode which is biased for force production (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">grip mode</i>). These novel kinematics are embodied as a mostly monolithic compliant mechanism, leaving just one traditional pin joint in the entire gripper assembly. Experiments show that force mode exhibits 3.1× more force output, and sense mode can measure 2.6× smaller forces. Corollary to the latter, sense mode is ideal for estimating the stiffness of objects, including small fruits with stiffness lower than 150 N/m. As an illustration, we demonstrate the usage of sense mode to estimate the ripeness of small fruits, followed by a transition to force mode in order to pluck the fruit. Ripeness is distinguished with up to <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\approx 90\\%$</tex-math></inline-formula> accuracy based on estimates of stiffness and fruit size using sense mode."

    "abstract": "Existing Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models are limited to either full reference or no reference evaluation tasks, while humans can seamlessly switch between these assessment types. This motivates us to explore resolving these two tasks using a versatile model. In this work, we propose a novel framework that unifies full reference and no reference IQA. Our approach utilizes an encoder to extract multi-level features from images and introduces a Hierarchical Attention module to adaptively handle spatial distortions for both full reference and no reference inputs. Additionally, we develop a Semantic Distortion Aware module to analyze feature correlations between shallow and deep layers of the encoder, thereby accounting for the varying effects of different distortions on these layers. Our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance for both full-reference and no-reference IQA tasks when trained separately. Furthermore, when the model is trained jointly on both types of tasks, it not only enhances performance in no-reference IQA but also maintains competitive results in full-reference IQA. This integrated approach facilitates a single training process that efficiently addresses both IQA tasks, representing a significant advancement in model versatility and performance."

    "abstract": "The complex electromagnetic and structural response of pulsed septum electromagnets is currently being studied, aiming to reveal insights into the prediction of their life cycles. The fault prediction remains a key challenge, requiring efforts in modelling and onsite instrumentation. Recently, a high-fidelity numerical model was developed, which allowed us to deepen our understanding of the system's behavior. The insight on critical stress/strain conditions are now allowing to better understand early fatigue observations in the coil conductor and required peripheral equipment. As a next step, a numerical parametric study has been conducted, enabling the prediction of the mechanical and electromagnetic dynamic response under different operation conditions. A stringent experimental campaign has been carried out to validate these results. These tests required developing the test setup, including careful selection of non-contact and on-device instrumentation, as well as the data acquisition system. The setup has demonstrated the feasibility of potential implementation in the CERN accelerator complex. In parallel, significant efforts have been made to study the possibility of using Machine Learning (ML) models to reduce the time-consuming simulation process based on analytical solvers. Several custom loss functions reflecting physical constraints, as well as augmentation techniques, have been implemented to overcome the challenge of a strongly limited dataset size. The created ML pipelines and dedicated Graphical User Interface (GUI) are now enabling instantaneous response of the device's model. The paper will summarize the efforts and project status with the long-term vision to develop a digital twin for septum magnets."

    "abstract": "In Wireless Sensor Networks-based Internet of Things environments, efficient Cluster Head (CH) selection remains a fundamental challenge, as the limited energy resources of sensor nodes critically affect network lifetime and service sustainability. Existing clustering strategies are often reactive, overlooking temporal dependencies in CH election processes, which leads to unnecessary energy dissipation and increased communication overhead. To address this gap, we propose a predictive clustering paradigm that leverages Temporal Convolutional Networks combined with Bayesian Optimization (TCN-BO). The core novelty of this work lies in formulating CH election as a time series forecasting problem and applying deep temporal learning to proactively guide clustering decisions, an aspect not explored in prior AI-based approaches. Unlike conventional methods, our approach explicitly models the temporal evolution of CH roles in the form of binary time series, enabling proactive CH election planning instead of reactive selection. The proposed TCN-BO framework achieves high-accuracy forecasting of CH sequences (MAPE = 10.04%) and translates these predictions into effective energy-aware cluster formation.This work introduces a novel research direction by integrating deep temporal learning into clustering protocols, thereby bridging prediction and network management. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method reduces communication overhead, improves energy balancing, and significantly enhances network longevity compared to existing clustering strategies."

However, constrained by high operating frequencies and device current/voltage ratings, conventional class D/E, half-bridge, and full-bridge CPT topologies can no longer meet the requirements of high-power applications. To address this, based on the phase expansion concept, a three-phase CPT topology with constant voltage output and an associated parameter design method are proposed. Firstly, a simplified equivalent circuit model of the three-phase CPT is established, and the AC-DC conversion relationship between the load and voltage is derived. Secondly, the output characteristics and operational constraints of various third-order compensation networks are analyzed based on the two-port network theory. Then, taking the LCL-CLC compensation network as an example, sensitivity and operational efficiency models are developed, and a parameter design method for the three-phase CPT is proposed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed three-phase CPT topology and its design method is validated through simulations and experiments."

    "abstract": "Achieving adaptive swarm navigation for quadrotors in cluttered environments presents significant challenges, stemming from limited individual sensing capabilities and delayed collective responses. To address these issues, this paper proposes a swarm control approach that integrates a motion-salience-based coordination rule (MS-CR) with obstacle avoidance guided by a boundary-point-based rotational potential field (BP-RPF), thereby enabling safe and adaptive swarm navigation in cluttered environments. For coordination, a motion salience (MS) metric is introduced, enabling each quadrotor to dynamically weight its neighbors based on local perception. This allows local stimuli to propagate efficiently throughout the swarm, enhancing collective responsiveness. For obstacle avoidance, the BP-RPF-based approach relies solely on detected obstacle boundary points, eliminating the need for full obstacle reconstruction. A rotational potential field (RPF) is introduced to guide quadrotors in executing stable avoidance and surface-following maneuvers. These components are unified within a multi-rule swarm navigation framework that combines coordination, obstacle avoidance, and task-oriented behaviors. Extensive six-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) simulations in cluttered environments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing baselines in maintaining inter-agent spacing, enhancing obstacle avoidance success rates, and improving task completion efficiency. Real-world experiments with a quadrotor swarm further confirm the method’s robustness and practical feasibility. These results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and highlight its potential for real-world deployment in complex and constrained environments."

    "abstract": "Controlling a flexible wheeled robot for complex tasks such as stair climbing is highly challenging. The nonlinearity inherent in soft materials hinders accurate modeling, creating a trade-off in Reinforcement Learning (RL) between simulation fidelity and learning speed. We propose an RL-friendly, multi-body model that approximates the deformation of the flexible wheel as a Mass-Spring-Damper (MSD) system composed of rigid links and joints. This model enables end-to-end RL within a fast rigid-body simulator, facilitating a blind control policy that relies solely on proprioceptive feedback. To reduce the reality gap and enhance policy robustness, we randomize the main parameters of the MSD system. In real-world experiments, a robot successfully climbed an 18 cm step, corresponding to approximately 51% of the wheel radius—a feat impossible for a rigid-wheeled equivalent. To our knowledge, this is the first successful application of RL-based blind control for stair climbing with a flexible wheeled robot. However, structural limitations in our model and challenges in parameter identification hinder sim-to-real transfer, and improving robustness remains a key issue for future work."

    "abstract": "Accurately measuring topography in forested areas using single-baseline InSAR data is challenging due to volume scattering effects and a limited number of observations. To address these limitations, we propose a new dual-baseline InSAR framework for retrieving sub-canopy topography utilizing two bistatic TanDEM-X InSAR observations. Our approach adopts the Random Volume over Ground (RVoG) model to estimate two spatially varying terms: ground-to-volume amplitude ratio and forest canopy height. Using these parameters we then estimate the phase center height (PCH), representing the elevation difference between the conventional InSAR-based digital elevation model (DEM, a numerical representation of terrain elevations) and the true ground surface. By subtracting the estimated PCH from the conventional InSAR DEM provided by each baseline, our method produces two individual sub-canopy topography products. Further refinement is achieved through a fusion process that integrates the sub-canopy topography maps derived from different baselines, enhancing the accuracy of the output. To validate the proposed framework, we conducted experiments in Sweden and Spain, across diverse forest types, climates, and terrain conditions. The accuracy of the estimated sub-canopy topography was assessed against airborne lidar data. At the Krycklan site in Sweden, our method achieved a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 2.04 m, demonstrating a performance improvement of 60% and 70% over conventional InSAR, depending on the baselines used. In Spain, the Vegaquemada and Covaleda sites yielded RMSEs of 3.44 m and 4.70 m, respectively, surpassing conventional InSAR DEMs for forested regions as well as simple single-baseline approaches which leverage space-borne LiDAR to fit model parameters, though with some influence from terrain slope. This approach has the potential to support largescale sub-canopy topography with InSAR data."

However, a primary challenge is data collisions among active users due to limited channel resources. To address this, new multiple access techniques are essential. This paper introduces resource hopping multiple access for grant-free random access in mMTC. In RHMA, user data packets are segmented and mapped to multiple channel resources, effectively resolving collisions. Theoretical analysis of the collision resolution capability of RHMA is provided. Also, an improved receiver design incorporating successive interference cancellation is proposed to further improve collision resolution. Numerical simulations validate the analysis of resolution capability, demonstrating that RHMA supports reliable grant-free random access for massive users. Moreover, the improved receiver design is verified to boost the collision resolution performance."

To fill this gap, this article first identifies all potential oscillation modes utilizing the small-signal model of the MC-VSC. Then, the damping effects of existing methods for the MC-VSC are quantitatively evaluated. Results indicate that existing oscillation-damping methods are similar in structure and fail to dampen all oscillation modes. To holistically dampen all identified oscillation modes, this article first proposes a simple and equivalent proportional integral derivative (PID)-based matching control strategy; then, a Biquad filter (BF)-based enhancement method is proposed specifically to dampen oscillation modes that existing methods fail to suppress effectively. The proposed method, combining the PID-based matching control with the BF-based method, demonstrates great potential for practical application. Simulations and experiments verify the accuracy of theoretical analysis results and the superiority of the proposed stability enhancement method."

    "abstract": "The timely installation of software updates has become an accepted best practice for protecting connected systems from persistent threats. Modern software update frameworks and trust anchor management protocols allow for the use of multiple digital signatures on update messages to protect against the potential compromise or loss of a digital signature private key or compromise of the underlying digital signature platform. The choice of whether to use multiple signatures and the specific number of signatures to use should be based on a risk assessment. We have developed a probability model that provides relative risk metrics for several different policy and system design options that include multiple signatures. The model enables system architects and operators to make a risk-based decision when considering multiple signatures to protect critical software updates."

    "abstract": "Electrostatic adhesion (EA) is widely used in mobile robotics, haptics, and robotic end effectors for its adaptability to diverse substrates and low energy consumption. Force sensing is important for feedback control, interaction, and monitoring in the EA system. However, EA force monitoring often relies on bulky and expensive sensors, increasing the complexity and weight of the entire system. This paper presents an acoustic-pressure-based method to monitor EA forces without contacting the adhesion pad. When the EA pad is driven by a bipolar square wave voltage to adhere a conductive object, periodic acoustic pulses arise from the EA system. We employed a microphone to capture these acoustic pressure signals and investigate the influence of peak pressure values. Results show that the peak value of acoustic pressure increased with the mass and contact area of the adhered object, as well as with the amplitude and frequency of the driving voltage. We applied this technique to mass estimation of various objects and simultaneous monitoring of two EA systems. Then, we integrated this technique into an EA end effector that enables monitoring the change of adhered object mass during transport. The proposed technique offers a low-cost, non-contact, and multi-object monitoring solution for EA end effectors in handling tasks."

This study develops a low-cost operational Digital Twin (DT) for a 3.7 kW induction motor pump at IIIT-Hyderabad (IIIT-H), optimised for resource-constrained settings with limited bandwidth and power. Using an ESP32 gateway, temperature, current, and vibration data are streamed to ThingSpeak, stored in MongoDB, and synchronised with a Simulink model via Eclipse Ditto. The system continuously compares simulated and actual pump data and raises alerts when abnormal behaviour is detected using a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)-based anomaly detector. A dashboard was developed to enable remote motor operation and automated shutdown during unsafe conditions. The twin operates in a partially closed-loop mode: sensor streams continuously update the virtual model and generate alerts, while relay-based actuation allows automated start/stop motor operation. From August to November 2024, 160,000 minutely-sampled records demonstrated an≈8-second end-to-end latency, which is characterised as near real-time and adequate for supervisory pump monitoring. This meets the SCADA real-time standards, with 5% modelling error. The system enabled anomaly detection, detecting faults hours early without labelled data, and achieved rapid operator adoption with minimal training. This open-source solution bridges a research gap for 3-5 HP pumps, offering a scalable blueprint for small utilities and supporting future enhancements like fully closed-loop control."

    "abstract": "Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) raises privacy concerns due to the risk of exposing sensitive training data. Federated learning (FL) mitigates this risk by keeping training samples on local devices, while facing the following privacy problems. (i) Recent studies show that adversaries can still infer private information in FL. (ii) LLM parameters are shared publicly during federated fine-tuning, while developers are often reluctant to disclose these parameters. (iii) Existing works focus on secure inference but neglects privacy-preserving fine-tuning. Inspired by above problems, we propose PriFFT, a privacy-preserving federated fine-tuning mechanism, to protect both model parameters and users' privacy. Due to considerable LLM parameters, we present hybrid secret sharing combining arithmetic secret sharing (ASS) and function secret sharing (FSS) to build secure operations and implement secure neural network layers and activation functions for fine-tuning. We optimize several secure protocols based on FSS, including reciprocal calculation, tensor products, natural exponentiation, softmax, sigmoid, hyperbolic tangent, and dropout. The hybrid secret sharing enables PriFFT to apply our optimized FSS protocols while combining ASS protocols to support complex computation without extra communication. PriFFT reduces execution time and communication overhead in privacy-preserving fine-tuning up to 59.1% and 77.0% without accuracy drop compared to the existing secret sharing methods."

However, deaf children born to hearing parents (approximately 90% of cases) [1] lack early exposure to their natural language, as the communication channels used by parents and children are different. Consequently, the child suffers a delay in having contact with sign language, leading to damage to their learning, cognitive development, and family relationships. A conceptual model was developed from a detailed study of language construction and variables related to the process of sign language acquisition by deaf child, while also considering the target audience and available computing technology. Thus, we propose a model that is divided into objective, target audience, and technology. From this model, we derived guidelines for the development of tools aimed at language acquisition in young deaf children."

    "abstract": "Aircraft cabin communication takes on a key role in communication networks. Due to the increasing demand for high data rates among passengers, millimetre-wave (mmWave) and sub-Terahertz (sub-THz) bands, with abundant spectrum resources, are envisioned as promising options. Therefore, detailed channel measurements are required to understand significant channel characterization in aircraft cabins. This paper presents a comprehensive comparison and analysis of channel characterization at 28 GHz, 38 GHz, and 130 GHz based on extensive measurements conducted in an aircraft cabin. A total of 84 transmitter-receiver (Tx-Rx) positions are measured, covering both line-of-sight (LoS) and non-LoS conditions, with Tx-Rx distance ranging from 1 m to 10 m. Based on the measured data, both large-scale and small-scale channel characterization parameters are extracted and analyzed. Statistical models of path loss, shadow fading, Rician K-factor, root-mean-square (RMS) delay spread, and RMS angular spread are proposed. The characterization is analyzed using the power-delay-angular profile and power-angular spectrum. The multipath components are clustered using the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise algorithm to analyze their intra-cluster delay spread and intra-cluster angle spread. In addition, this paper analyses the system capacity and outage probability, providing some basis for communication system design and planning. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to have both mmWave and sub-THz measurements and analysis performed on an aircraft cabin."

In the constant-torque region, the torque model employed by VSIC-MTPA is analytically refined by accounting for the effects of injected virtual signals and inverter nonlinear voltage drops. This analysis identifies key error terms in the original model, which are subsequently compensated to improve torque modeling accuracy and thereby enhance MTPA control precision. Furthermore, a novel switching mechanism and region-transition criterion are developed to enable smooth and rapid transitions between the constant-torque and field-weakening regions. The proposed design also reduces the current ripple during steady-state operation in the field-weakening region. Experimental results under various operating conditions validate the effectiveness and superior performance of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "This study tackles the problem of rejecting disturbances with different frequencies for a control system subject to measurement noise. The equivalent-input-disturbance (EID) approach is widely employed to address this problem, as it actively estimates and compensates for disturbances. However, its performance in handling multifrequency disturbances, particularly high-frequency ones, is compromised by measurement noise. This work presents a multifrequency EID (MEID) approach characterized by a new multilevel structure, where each level operates at a distinct bandwidth to overcome this limitation. First, the multilevel structure is described in detail. One level is designed to handle constant and low-frequency disturbances using an EID estimator with a low-pass filter. The others are constructed to handle disturbances in different frequency domains using EID estimators with bandpass filters. Then, a comprehensive comparison with two recently proposed alternative structures is provided. A frequency-domain analysis reveals that the MEID approach not only enhances disturbance rejection across a broad spectrum but also improves measurement noise suppression. Thereby, it successfully decouples the conflicting design requirements inherent to conventional methods. Finally, experimental results validate the method’s effectiveness, demonstrating its superior performance over other related approaches."

Existing restoration networks struggle to effectively combine local, regional, and global features, thereby limiting their ability to handle diverse impacts of such weather. This study proposes the local-region-global transformer (LRGFormer), a transformer-based image restoration model for multiscale feature perception. The model comprises a basic module composed of multi-scale fusion attention (MSFSA) and a channel-spatial dual-attention feed-forward network (CSDF). Specifically, this study designs an MSFSA module. For the first time, it combines rotation-equivariant convolution with local attention for local information extraction and introduces a frequency-domain adaptive attention mechanism. By incorporating a query-aware global adaptive sparse attention mechanism for global information extraction, the network gradually fuses along the channel dimension, enabling progressive capture of spatial and frequency-domain information from the local and regional to global scale. Secondly, a CSDF network structure was designed to enhance channel-spatial interaction and improve the representational capacity of the model. By constructing a basic U-Net framework, the excellent basic modules for image restoration proposed in recent years are compared on a unified framework. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed basic module can not only better extracts multi-scale features of images and restores image distortion caused by various degradation factors, and also exhibits good universality and generalization."

    "abstract": "We present a novel framework for CBCT-to-MDCT translation, grounded in the Schrödinger Bridge (SB) formulation, which integrates GAN-derived priors with human-guided conditional diffusion. Unlike conventional GANs or diffusion models, our approach explicitly enforces boundary consistency between CBCT inputs and pseudo-targets, ensuring both anatomical fidelity and perceptual controllability. Binary human feedback is incorporated via classifier-free guidance (CFG), effectively steering the generative process toward clinically preferred outcomes. Through iterative refinement and tournament-based preference selection, the model internalizes human preferences without relying on a reward model. Subtraction image visualizations reveal that the proposed method selectively attenuates shading artifacts in key anatomical regions while preserving fine structural detail. Quantitative evaluations further demonstrate superior performance across RMSE, SSIM, LPIPS, and Dice metrics on clinical datasets—outperforming prior GAN- and fine-tuning-based feedback methods—while requiring only 10 sampling steps. The present validation was conducted exclusively on head and neck CBCT datasets, which represent the most clinically relevant use case for dental and craniofacial imaging. These findings underscore the effectiveness and efficiency of our framework for real-time, preference-aligned medical image translation."

The physical remoteness of cloud servers makes it challenging to ensure timely and secure data transmission. Therefore, it is essential to fully utilize edge servers and vehicular terminals equipped with small-scale generative AI servers to form a vehicular network. However, the allocation and transmission of tasks to vehicles face many challenging issues, such as underutilization of idle vehicle resources. In this paper, we establish an incentive mechanism driven by rewards based on different resource costs and design a multi-stage Stackelberg game under conditions of information asymmetry to address the issue of resource wastage in vehicular terminals. Specifically, self-interested vehicles are not forced to share resources or reveal their private information, such as vehicle dwell time and resource quantity. We first prove the existence and uniqueness of a Stackelberg equilibrium under complete information sharing. To handle information asymmetry without requiring vehicles to reveal private parameters, we then propose a proximal policy optimization (PPO)-based Vehicular terminal Resource Pricing mechanism (PVRP) that learns pricing strategies from interaction histories; this approach both preserves vehicular privacy and enables efficient convergence toward the Stackelberg equilibrium in dynamic settings. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism greatly outperforms existing methods in both static and dynamic vehicular networks."

    "abstract": "Underwater vision is central to marine robotics and ecological monitoring, yet turbidity, color cast, and backscatter degrade appearance and confound object boundaries. Existing enhancement–detection pipelines often optimize perceptual quality, keep the enhancement branch active during inference, and process features uniformly in the spatial domain, yielding residual artifacts, domain sensitivity, and nontrivial latency. We propose Underwater Enhancement-Assisted Object Detection (UEAOD), a lightweight detector that unifies frequency-aware factorization with physics-guided self-supervision. Specifically, a Fourier Frequency Decoupling Module adaptively splits each feature map into low- and high-frequency components using a learnable threshold optimized with a straight-through estimator. Building on this base–detail separation, a Contextual Dual-Stream Network compatible with the Path Aggregation Network refines the low-frequency base through a top-down path and consolidates high-frequency detail with content-aware upsampling. Then it performs clean feature fusion followed by detector-only bottom–up aggregation. A training-only enhancement head estimates background light, transmission, and clean radiance and enforces the Jaffe-McGlamery model via self-supervised reconstruction and guided refinement. This head is removed during inference. On RUOD, URPC2022, and RUIE-UHTS datasets, UEAOD improves mean average precision by 2–3% over a strong YOLOv12s baseline while preserving real-time throughput with a compact model size. These results indicate that explicit base–detail decomposition, coupled with physics-consistent supervision, yields domain-stable features and accurate, efficient underwater detection without incurring additional inference overhead.

In contrast to existing studies, the sojourn-time probability density functions of semi-Markov kernel are considered to be incompletely known, relaxing the assumption of completely known sojourn-time distributions. The main novelty lies in constructing a novel learning-based SMC scheme to realize the attainment of the quasi-sliding mode, overcoming the difficulty caused by incomplete sojourn-time information. By utilizing the upper bounds of sojourn time for each subsystem mode and constructing the multiple-Lyapunov function, sufficient conditions for mean-square stability are derived for the resulting closed-loop system. Moreover, a recursive sliding mode learning controller is developed to ensure finite-time reachability of the sliding motion and to effectively suppress both parametric uncertainties and switching-induced chattering. The effectiveness and practical applicability of the proposed method are validated through the DC-DC buck converter application."

    "abstract": "The exponential growth of cloud storage adoption has introduced new attack surfaces and privacy concerns, necessitating advanced methods for secure and covert communication. Traditional steganographic techniques, particularly in distributed settings, often struggle with balancing undetectability, embedding capacity, and security. Recent indirect methods that avoid file modification have improved undetectability but remain constrained by low capacity and reliance on cryptographic secrecy alone. This paper introduces Contextual Cloud Steganography (CCS), a novel framework that replaces traditional base-based encoding with contextual protocols based on deterministic file ordering within cloud directories. CCS leverages pre-established sorting criteria (e.g., cryptographic hashes, creation dates) to embed secret data by selecting files from sorted lists, achieving a multiplicative increase in capacity of 3.2× to 4.3× over state-of-the-art base-B methods. The framework simultaneously enhances security through protocol-dependent protection, making message extraction computationally infeasible without the precise contextual protocol, even if the stego-folder is discovered. We provide formal security proofs under established steganographic models, detailed algorithms with cryptographic enhancements, and extensive experimental evaluation across major cloud platforms (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive) over a 30-day period. Results demonstrate CCS's practical efficiency and robustness in dynamic environments, establishing it as a significant advancement in cloud-based covert communication that breaks the traditional capacity-security trade-off."

    "abstract": "Industrial control systems must support both periodic and aperiodic traffic, each with distinct timing and reliability constraints. In particular, aperiodic traffic is classified into three priority levels based on time urgency. While periodic tasks follow fixed schedules, aperiodic tasks are event-driven and require either deadline-aware access or low latency. To address these heterogeneous quality of service (QoS) requirements in duty-cycled, bandwidth-constrained long range (LoRa) networks, we propose QoS-LoRa, a deterministic MAC protocol designed for mixed-criticality traffic. QoS-LoRa integrates three key mechanisms: logical frame partitioning with distributed contention slots, deadline-aware contention window scheduling, and delay-slot-based prioritized access. Together, these components ensure low collision probability, bounded delay, and priority-respecting access across different class tasks. Simulation results show that QoS-LoRa achieves over 95% packet delivery ratio (PDR) for deadline-constrained traffic and over 92% for best-effort traffic, even under 60% aperiodic load. QoS-LoRa significantly outperforms RT-LoRa-LFP and ALOHA-based baselines in PDR, while maintaining end-to-end delay comparable to RT-LoRa-LFP, validating its effectiveness in industrial environments."

This paper proposes a multi-phase rule-based protein classification framework that hierarchically integrates biologically meaningful features. An early-exit decision strategy is employed. Feature extraction is performed across four progressive phases comprising chemical properties, hydropathy characteristics, behavioral sequence patterns through n-gram and six-letter exchange encoding, and functional attributes via normalized distance-based encoding. Family-specific knowledge matrices constructed exclusively from training data enable deterministic min–max rule evaluation at each phase for efficient candidate pruning and early termination. Experiments conducted on 8,555 human protein sequences spanning ten families achieve an average classification accuracy of 97.66%. 5-fold, 25-fold, and 45-fold cross-validation statistically confirm performance stability under class-imbalanced conditions. Further cross-species validation on zebrafish and mouse protein datasets yields accuracies of 96.11% and 94.89%, respectively, demonstrating robust generalization across diverse biological distributions. Comparative evaluation against machine-learning-based and transformer-based baselines shows that the proposed framework achieves a superior accuracy-efficiency trade-off while maintaining an overall time complexity of <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$O(n\\log n)$</tex-math></inline-formula>."

    "abstract": "Semiconductor industry has become the core domain of technological competition among countries nowadays. Suppliers with high-end chip technology, a key generic technology in the semiconductor industry, can significantly disrupt downstream product manufacturers and reshape the competitive dynamics by imposing a technology blockade. This paper focuses on high-end chip market, and builds a game model within a vertical supply chain structure to analyze how technology blockade affects the technological catch-up incentives for local chip suppliers. Our analysis reveals that before technology blockade, the monetary externality directs initial benefits to downstream manufacturers, diminishing high-end chip suppliers' rent extraction capacity. Local chip suppliers ' technology advancement reduces high-end chip suppliers' rent extraction capacity. This incentivizes high-end chip suppliers to talent foreclosure, and raises the cost of government support. The low-to-mid-end market plays an important role in accumulating innovation resource. After technology blockade, the chip supply chain is bifurcated into a high-end and a local mid-to-low-end chip supply chain. Government attention allocation intensity negatively moderates innovation policies intensity and, together with the low-to-mid-end market, alleviates the policies pressure from multiple dimensions. When the roles of high-end chip talents exceed a certain threshold, even if innovation policies are withdrawn, local chip suppliers can also be self-sufficient. As local chip supplier's technology catch-up, a new game situation gradually emerges in high-end market, characterized by the coexistence of the local and the existing high-end chip supply chain. The core findings are robust to the relaxed key assumptions, which substantiates the research rigour of this paper."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across diverse applications, yet their susceptibility to malicious exploitation remains a critical challenge. Notably, LLMs are known to be vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks, where adversaries craft malicious inputs to induce harmful or unethical outputs. In this paper, motivated by the unique effectiveness and scalability of In-Context Learning (ICL) in LLMs, we explore its potential to modulate the safety alignment of LLMs. Specifically, we propose the In-Context Attack (ICA), which employs harmful demonstrations to subvert LLMs' safety, and the In-Context Defense (ICD), which bolsters their resilience through examples that demonstrate refusal to produce harmful responses. By adjusting the distribution of safety in LLM outputs through adversarial demonstrations, our proposed in-context attack and defense facilitate effective manipulation of their alignment. We first provide theoretical insights to illustrate how minimal in-context demonstrations can efficiently alter safety alignment. Empirically, we validate ICA and ICD across multiple models, datasets, and attack baselines, showing their efficacy and scalability for red-teaming evaluations and robust safeguards for real-world deployment. Overall, our work unveils the pivotal yet understudied role of ICL in LLM safety, opening new avenues for understanding and improving them."

    "abstract": "In an inductive power transfer (IPT) system, due to the presence of ferrite cores, changes in the air gap can alter the coil parameters (self-inductances and mutual inductance), leading to system detuning, resulting in efficiency degradation. To address this problem, an impedance self-adjustment method based on an integrated LCC-LCC topology with two variable inductors is proposed for IPT systems to enhance efficiency. Combined with the second-generation non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) for system parameter design, the proposed method can mitigate secondary-side detuning and offer variable input impedance to realize wide-range zero-voltage switching of the inverter with phase-shifting (PS) control. The proposed method does not need additional components or complex controls. Experimental results show that with the air gap variation from 30 mm to 60 mm (the self-inductance variation is 17.47%, the mutual inductance variation is 80.91%) and the load variation of 50%, an accurate output is achieved with PS control, and the system efficiency ranges from 92.6% to 94.23%. Compared with the traditional method, the maximum efficiency improvement is up to 16.92%."

However, existing algorithms often prioritize personalization over learning goals, leading to issues such as \"cold start\" and \"data sparsity\" that hinder effective resource recommendation. This study proposes the SKM algorithm, a goal-oriented learning recommendation algorithm for multi-source heterogeneous e-learning resources. SKM leverages a dual knowledge graph to align recommendations with learning objectives and integrates a graph label-connected cluster clustering algorithm (KGLC) to enhance recommendation effectiveness. Evaluated across four types of datasets, SKM demonstrates superior performance, achieving a 3.9 times higher correction rate compared to mainstream algorithms. The KGLC algorithm further improves SKM’s correction effect by efficiently clustering similar labels. The proposed SKM and KGLC algorithms address key limitations in existing recommendation systems, providing a robust solution for online learning resource recommendation. This work contributes to advancing educational technology and lays a foundation for future research in goal-oriented learning systems."

    "abstract": "Vehicle-centric perception plays a crucial role in many intelligent systems, including large-scale surveillance systems, intelligent transportation, and autonomous driving. Existing approaches typically employ general pre-trained weights to initialize backbone networks, followed by task-specific fine-tuning. However, these models lack effective learning of vehiclerelated knowledge during pre-training, resulting in poor capability for modeling general vehicle perception representations. To handle this problem, we propose VehicleMAE-V2, a novel vehicle-centric pre-trained large model. By exploring and exploiting vehicle-related multimodal structured priors to guide the masked token reconstruction process, our approach can significantly enhance the model’s capability to learn generalizable representations for vehicle-centric perception. Specifically, we design the Symmetry-guided Mask Module (SMM), Contour-guided Representation Module (CRM) and Semantics-guided Representation Module (SRM) to incorporate three kinds of structured priors into token reconstruction including symmetry, contour and semantics of vehicles respectively. SMM utilizes the vehicle symmetry constraints to avoid retaining symmetric patches and can thus select high-quality masked image patches and reduce information redundancy. CRM minimizes the prob23 ability distribution divergence between contour features and reconstructed features and can thus preserve holistic vehicle structure information during pixel-level reconstruction. SRM aligns image-text features through contrastive learning and cross-modal distillation to address the feature confusion caused by insufficient semantic understanding during masked reconstruction. To support the pre-training of VehicleMAE-V2, we construct Autobot4M, a large-scale dataset comprising approximately 4 million vehicle images and 12,693 text descriptions. Extensive experiments on five downstream tasks demonstrate the superior performance of VehicleMAE-V2. The source code, dataset, and pre-trained large models are available on https://github.com/Vehicle-AHU/VehicleMAE."

However, the current data-driven framework in LSSNs could not burden the ever-increasing specialized data transmission demands including reliability, timeliness, and lightweightness in the complex time-varying topology. Recently, Large Language Model (LLM) with excellent decision-making, personalized target-oriented services, and adaptive learning and optimization, expands rapidly into the IoE networks. With these remarkable advantages, LLM exhibits exploitable coordination with LSSNs for the comprehensive applications in next-generation networks since it could cope with massive multi-source data transmission and adaptive topology optimization. In this article, a comprehensive perspective of LLMs when exploited in LSSNs for IoE structures, including architectures, challenges, and solutions, is extensively discussed with prospective scenarios. A case study with Task-oriented Intelligent DeliverY (TIDY) framework for LSSNs is proposed and compared with the current advanced State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) methods.

    "abstract": "In the field of image segmentation, foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) demonstrate remarkable zero-shot generalization capabilities on high-quality images. However, their performance significantly deteriorates when applied to low-quality images commonly encountered in real-world scenarios, such as those corrupted by noise, blur, or low-light conditions. Although existing diffusion-based image enhancement methods can improve visual quality, they often introduce \"hallucinated\" details that are geometrically inconsistent with the input, thereby compromising the structural accuracy essential for segmentation tasks. To address this issue, this paper proposes a geometry-guided diffusion model (G²D), which, for the first time, explicitly incorporates geometric consistency as a constraint into the enhancement process. G²D leverages pre-trained geometric prior extractors (e.g., depth or edge estimation models) as a structural \"compass\" to guide the denoising process of the diffusion model via a cross-attention mechanism. Moreover, we innovatively propose a geometric consistency loss that forms a self-supervised closed loop, enforcing the enhanced images to preserve the original scene layout. Experiments on challenging benchmarks such as ImageNet-C and ACDC demonstrate that G²D, as a plug-and-play pre-processing module, significantly improves the performance of segmentation models like SAM on low-quality images without requiring fine-tuning. By effectively restoring visual appearance while preserving geometric structure, our work provides a new direction for task-oriented robust image enhancement."

Their conversion efficiency, however, may be significantly affected by different power ratios and relative phase differences of the constituent modes. Therefore, diagnosing the ratios of different modes is essential for designing hybrid MCs. This article presents an effective and straightforward method to diagnose the power ratios using a coaxial coupling probe through theoretical analysis, simulation, and experiments. By theoretical analysis and simulation, we demonstrate that the power coupled to the probe is proportional to the square of the amplitude of radial electric field at the diagnostic point. A periodic dependence between the coupled power and the relative phase difference of the modes is obtained. Experimentally, both small-signal and HPM experiments were conducted. In the small-signal experiment, the power proportions of TM<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">01</sub> and TM<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">02</sub> modes output from three different hybrid MCs were determined with no more than 5% error. In the HPM experiment, the method was applied to an X-band dual-mode relativistic backward wave oscillator (RBWO), indicating that the TM<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">01</sub> mode constitutes approximately 25% of the total output power. With proper calibration of the probe coupling coefficients, this method can be extended to real-time mode ratio diagnostics."

    "abstract": "Technology-intensive industries face accelerating change driven by disruptive innovations, geopolitical shifts, and the dynamics of Industry 4.0. In this environment, managers require strategic tools that can align markets, products, and technologies over time while retaining adaptability. Technology roadmaps (TRMs) are widely used for this purpose; however, current practice remains largely qualitative, workshop-led, and reliant on subject matter expertise. This constrains their utility in dynamic environments. This paper develops a Model-Based Systems Engineering framework for Technology Roadmaps (MBSE-TRM) to address these limitations. The research advances theory by introducing a conceptual metamodel that captures the ontology of TRM, formalizing its structure and lifecycle using SysML, and demonstrating how tacit practitioner logic can be represented explicitly. Validation is undertaken in the domain of Electronic Warfare (EW) against radar, a technology-intensive field characterized by rapid innovation cycles and strategic importance. The findings show that MBSE-TRM enables improved transparency, traceability, and adaptability, supporting managers and engineers in steering innovation strategies under conditions of volatility. By bridging systems engineering principles with technology strategy, MBSE-TRM provides a structured yet flexible framework for aligning strategic intent with evolving technology options in Industry 4.0 and beyond."

    "abstract": "Accurate calibration and robust localization are fundamental for downstream tasks in spinning actuated LiDAR applications. Existing methods, however, require parameterizing extrinsic parameters based on different mounting configurations, limiting their generalizability. Additionally, spinning actuated LiDAR inevitably scans featureless regions, which complicates the balance between scanning coverage and localization robustness. To address these challenges, this letter presents a targetless LiDAR-motor calibration (LM-Calibr) on the basis of the Denavit-Hartenberg convention and an environmental adaptive LiDAR-inertial odometry (EVA-LIO). LM-Calibr supports calibration of LiDAR-motor systems with various mounting configurations. Extensive experiments demonstrate its accuracy and convergence across different scenarios, mounting angles, and initial values. Additionally, EVA-LIO adaptively selects downsample rates and map resolutions according to spatial scale. This adaptivity enables the actuator to operate at maximum speed, thereby enhancing scanning completeness while ensuring robust localization, even when LiDAR briefly scans featureless areas.

    "abstract": "The demand for high-power electroacoustic transducers operating over wide frequency ranges is steadily increasing, but designing suitable impedance matching circuits for these transducers remains challenging. Conventional passive analog matching networks struggle to deliver optimal active power to the load while maintaining wideband operation. Although recent tunable multi-switched capacitor designs address this issue to some extent, they typically require feedback loops and complex control circuitry. To overcome these limitations, we propose a sequential analog impedance matching design method that achieves very wide bandwidth using positive or negative impedance converters. The proposed method adopts a stage-wise optimization strategy, in which circuit parameters at each stage are sequentially estimated to maximize input active power over a target bandwidth. The optimal number of stages is also determined based on the estimated incremental improvement in active power at each step. The matching network components can be implemented using either passive LC branches or active branches incorporating negative impedance converters, enabling flexible and effective wideband matching. The feasibility including power limit of the proposed method is analyzed theoretically and validated through circuit simulations. Results demonstrate that the method provides superior matching performance compared to conventional LC networks and achieves performance comparable to digitally controlled matching systems, without requiring feedback controllers or digital logic. Experimental results using a Butterworth–Van Dyke (BVD) model equivalent to a commercial transducer further validate the proposed method, demonstrating outstanding active power performance and confirming that the simple design scheme is both effective and practical for a wide range of wideband transducer applications."

    "abstract": "By leveraging the superposition property, over-the-air computation (OAC) of waveforms enables computations to be performed in an analog fashion in wireless environments, leading to faster computation, lower latency, and reduced energy consumption. In this paper, we investigate reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) OAC systems designed to emulate the fully-connected (FC) layer of a neural network (NN) via analog OAC, where the RIS and the transceivers are jointly adjusted to engineer the ambient wireless propagation environment to emulate the weights of the target FC layer. We refer to this novel computational paradigm as <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Air</i>FC. We first study the case in which the precoder, combiner, and RIS phase shift matrices are jointly optimized to minimize the mismatch between the OAC system and the target FC layer. To solve this non-convex optimization problem, we propose a low-complexity alternating optimization algorithm, where semi-closed-form/closed-form solutions for all optimization variables are derived. Next, we consider training of the system parameters using two distinct learning strategies, namely <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">centralized training</i> and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">distributed training</i>. In the centralized training approach, training is performed at either the transmitter or the receiver, whichever possesses the channel state information (CSI), and the trained parameters are provided to the other terminal. In the distributed training approach, the transmitter and receiver iteratively update their parameters through back and forth transmissions by leveraging channel reciprocity, thereby avoiding CSI acquisition and significantly reducing computational complexity. Subsequently, we extend our analysis to a multi-RIS scenario by exploiting its spatial diversity gain to enhance the system performance, i.e., classification accuracy. Simulation results show that the AirFC system realized by the RIS-aided MIMO configuration achieves satisfactory classification accuracy. Furthermore, it is shown that the multi-RIS system brings significant improvement in terms of the classification accuracy, especially in line-of-sight (LoS)-dominated wireless environments."

    "abstract": "Monocular 3D object detection has been studied as a promising task for diverse applications, such as autonomous driving, due to its lower cost and more straightforward configuration than multiple sensors. However, existing studies have focused on clear weather without considering diverse weather conditions with varying intensity, such as rain, snow, and fog, affecting detection performance. In this paper, we propose MonoRange, a monocular 3D object detection method that uses object-centric images and range maps in adverse weather conditions. Leveraging the 2D detection results, MonoRange generates range maps from images via an object-centric range map reconstruction. Furthermore, MonoRange flexibly removes adverse weather noise in images via weather intensity adaptive image restoration with a weight modulation transformer. Then, MonoRange fuses the range map and restored image and predicts 3D bounding boxes via the range map aligned detector. Introducing the projected box consistency loss between 2D and 3D boxes also enables to consistent and accurate 3D object detection. Experimental results on diverse weather datasets demonstrate that MonoRange surpasses existing monocular 3D object detection approaches.

Accurate assessment of durian maturity is essential to ensure optimal quality and prevent premature harvesting, which negatively affects consumer satisfaction and export standards. This study proposed a method for predicting the dry matter content (DMC), a key indicator of durian maturity, using near-infrared hyperspectral imaging (NIR-HSI) combined with machine learning and neural network algorithms. In total, 300 Mon Thong durian fruits were analyzed across six maturity stages. Spectral data were preprocessed using the standard normal variate (SNV), multiplicative scatter correction (MSC), and derivative transformations, followed by feature extraction via principal component analysis (PCA). Four predictive models were developed: partial least squares regression (PLSR), least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN). Model performance was evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R²), root mean square error (RMSE), mean bias error (MBE), ratio of performance to deviation (RPD), and range error ratio (RER) metrics. Based on the results, LS-SVM and 1D-CNN outperformed the other models, with 1D-CNN achieving the highest validation accuracy (R² = 0.97, RMSE = 1.49%, MBE = 0.06, RPD = 5.9, RER = 24.9) when combined with PCA and SNV preprocessing. While PLSR offered simplicity and interpretability, the neural network models demonstrated superior predictive performance and generalization. The findings highlighted the potential of integrating NIR-HSI with advanced learning algorithms for reliable durian maturity assessment, supporting improved quality control and market readiness."

This review explored the current landscape of QML-based methodologies applied to key medical imaging modalities - Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Computed Tomography (CT), X-rays, and histopathology. We systematically analyzed how quantum-enhanced models were employed for critical tasks such as image classification, segmentation, and reconstruction, and we compared their performance with that of classical counterparts. The review delved into the architectural innovations that enabled these quantum approaches, including hybrid quantum-classical frameworks, variational quantum circuits, and quantum convolutional neural networks. Particular emphasis was given to the clinical relevance of QML applications, from early diagnostics to real-time surgery planning, and how quantum advantage might influence data efficiency, interpretability, along computational scalability. Finally, we highlighted current challenges in data encoding, noise resilience, and hardware limitations, and discussed promising future directions that could enable the practical deployment of QML in healthcare settings.

This is an effective approach for realizing low-latency yet high performance for long polar codes, since all the perturbation-enhanced SC (PSC) decoding can be performed in parallel.

By better utilizing the decoding <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">a posteriori</i> LLRs, a set of possibly erroneous estimations can be formed and further perturbed, resulting in the proposed hybrid PSC (HPSC) decoding. During each new SC decoding attempt, it takes turns to flip the first erroneous bit by introducing a biased perturbation, while the subsequent erroneous estimations are corrected through random perturbations. Our simulation results validate that, for various codeword lengths and rates, the proposed IPSC decoding can achieve a similar performance as the conventional PSC decoding, but yield a significantly reduced perturbation complexity. With the same number of decoding attempts, the proposed HPSC decoding outperforms several state-of-the-art SC-based decoding, such as the thresholded SC-flip (TSCF) decoding and the dynamic SC-flip (DSCF) decoding."

To address this, we propose a hybrid experimental method combining a customizable tissue-mimicking gel phantom (fabricated using water, sugar, salt, and agar shaped in 3D-printed molds) with a living human subject. By employing a mobile setup with rotational freedom, we capture real-world channel gain and untethered received signal strength indicator (RSSI) variations, revealing a 20-dB disparity between line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS (NLOS) conditions, a critical metric undetectable with conventional bench-top phantoms.

This work formulates scalable superconducting quantum chip design as a geometric constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) and introduces GeoSynth, a constraint-aware automation framework to accelerate scalable quantum chip design. By leveraging global symmetry and local similarity of quantum chip, GeoSynth enables hierarchical constraint decomposition through four novel algorithms: adaptive launch pad allocation (GeoSynth-ALA), systematic component correspondence (GeoSynth-SCC), scalable template-based routing synthesis (GeoSynth-TRS), and global constraint propagation (GeoSynth-GCP). Implemented in EDA-Q, GeoSynth delivers an end-to-end automation flow for a 156-qubit flip-chip processor in 2,882 seconds. This represents a 2× speedup over a prior method that addressed only the routing subproblem for 64 qubits, and is crowned by the first fabrication validation of an automatically generated large-scale layout, achieving a T1 coherence time of 69.24 μs. Beyond fabrication validation, GeoSynth demonstrates robust scalability by successfully generating layouts for diverse configurations spanning 64 to 620 qubits across multiple architectural variants, confirming its capability to handle industrially relevant scales. GeoSynth’s efficient, constraint-driven automation offers a scalable solution for quantum hardware industrialization."

Existing EC optimization methods for ECF electrodeposition are limited to offline operation, yielding optimal process parameter combinations under static conditions. Consequently, these methods exhibit poor dynamic adaptability and are susceptible to performance degradation caused by concept drift during long-term machine operation. To address these limitations, this article proposes an incremental soft actor-critic (I-SAC) method for online EC optimization in ECF electrodeposition. Specifically: 1) an SAC learner and optimizer are constructed to train an actor policy network and determine optimal process parameters, respectively; 2) an incremental module is designed to continuously update the EC model within the objective function and actor policy network within SAC learner using new samples. This enables online knowledge learning and periodic updating of the actor policy network, thereby enhancing the method’s dynamic adaptability. Finally, the proposed method is validated using a dataset collected from industrial sites. Comparative evaluations against other optimization algorithms and reinforcement learning methods demonstrate its superior performance."

    "abstract": "In recent years, the practical application of machine learning technology has rapidly progressed, accelerating its adoption across various fields. In this context, studies into the effective operation of machine learning systems in real-world environments have become essential. In actual operational settings, the distribution of input data often changes over time, leading to a significant decline in the predictive performance of models. Additionally, the lack of ground-truth data for test data during operation can sometimes make adaptation through retraining difficult. This study proposes a framework that autonomously adapts to changes in input data distribution, even in environments where ground-truth data for test data is unavailable during operation. This framework analyzes the distribution of input data and selects the appropriate predictive model based on the state of the distribution. To ensure optimal model selection, the framework employs two complementary approaches: (1) dynamically switching between multiple pre-trained models with different feature sets according to environmental changes, and (2) building ensemble models based on the distribution of the test data. These approaches enable the framework to autonomously adapt to shifts in data distribution, even in operational settings where ground-truth data is unavailable. Evaluation experiments using both simulated and real-world data assessed the predictive performance of the proposed method through metrics such as R², RMSE, and MAE. Compared to conventional single model predictions, the proposed method consistently demonstrated higher accuracy. These results indicate that the proposed approach effectively adapts to data distribution shifts in operational environments where ground-truth data is unavailable."

    "abstract": "Multi-view clustering (MVC) has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its ability to leverage shared information across heterogeneous data sources. However, most existing methods focus on improving clustering performance while often neglecting potential conflicts between views and the uncertainty in view distributions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework named dual-reliable contrastive fusion multi-view clustering (DRCFMVC). This framework organically integrates uncertainty and conflict within a multi-view contrastive clustering paradigm for the first time. Through an innovative dual reliability weighting mechanism, uncertainty and conflict are systematically incorporated into contrastive learning. Specifically, high-dimensional features are first mapped to cluster distributions via a clustering network. Subsequently, Dempster–Shafer Theory (DST) estimates prediction uncertainty within each view, while Jensen–Shannon (JS) divergence quantifies conflict levels between views. These two complementary types of information are further integrated through the proposed dual-reliable weighting (DRW) fusion strategy, effectively guiding the contrastive optimization process to learn more stable and discriminative representations. Extensive experiments on eleven public benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance across multiple clustering evaluation metrics compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Various DL models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), VGG16, MobileNet, MobileNetV2, and InceptionV3, were evaluated, and accuracy of 82.66%, 91.33%, 90.00%, 90.67%, and 95.71% respectively for each model was achieved. The models were trained on a dataset of fingernail images, and their performance was assessed based on classification accuracy. The accuracy of InceptionV3 achieved was the highest. Building upon this model's success, a mobile application integrated with sensor-based functionality was developed allowing users to upload fingernail images and receive instant diagnostic feedback conveniently enabling early detection.

Therefore, proposing a scientifically valid computational method for precise prediction of phosphorylation sites carries substantial importance. In this study, we propose and evaluate a novel method, PEGN-PSP, based on graph techniques and language models for the prediction of general phosphorylation sites. This method employs an adaptive feature fusion strategy, combining sequence embeddings and pretrained model embeddings to enhance the model's capability in representing features. The use of graph neural network attention mechanisms not only captures local patterns of protein sequences, but also effectively captures long-range dependency information between residues in protein sequences. Independent test results indicate that, in comparison to the current state-of-the-art methods for general phosphorylation site prediction, PEGN-PSP improves the Matthews correlation coefficient for S/T sites by 4.6% and for Y sites by 6.5%. Additionally, PEGN-PSP has good robustness in predicting lysine crotonylation sites, indicating that our method PEGN-PSP has strong potential in predicting other protein posttranslational modification sites.

While 2D vision-language models offer rich pretraining knowledge, bridging the 2D-3D gap remains challenging. To address this issue, we propose OpenVL and utilize the framework of the Vision-Language model for Open-vocabulary understanding. First, we construct a channel that connects 2D and 3D features through the method of 3D Patches, which largely avoids the problems arising from the scarcity of 3D data. Secondly, we propose a Multi-level 3D Patches Alignment. By achieving dense alignment with 3D Patches at the point, instance, and scene levels, our method not only preserves the spatial perception ability within 3D scenes but also enables a fine-grained understanding of these scenes. Experimental results across multiple bench-marks demonstrate that our approach has achieved state-of-the-art performance. OpenVL achieves significant performance improvements on ScanNet (+6.7% mAP) and nuScenes (+1.9% mAP).

    "abstract": "Traditional appliance recognition models in non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) are constrained by a static label space, making them unable to recognize unknown or newly introduced appliance types. Incremental learning provides a potential solution by enabling continuous model adaptation; however, its application in NILM is often hindered by catastrophic forgetting, where learning new classes degrades performance on previously learned ones. To address this challenge, we propose a novel class-incremental learning method based on a Nearest Class Mean Forest (NCM-Forest). The proposed approach redesigns the random forest structure by replacing axis-aligned splits with dynamic, centroid-based partitions. This design allows new classes to be incorporated seamlessly through centroid updates, while a partial subtree retraining strategy effectively balances stability and plasticity. Extensive experiments on three NILM datasets demonstrate that our method achieves robust and scalable incremental recognition with an accuracy of up to 93.33 ± 1.52%. Furthermore, deployment on edge devices confirms its practicality, featuring low memory footprint, rapid model updates, and strong potential for real-time edge-based NILM applications."

To overcome the aforementioned difficulties, this study presents a novel algorithm based on the deep learning process for the topology optimization of thin-walled energy absorbers. In this way, different random patterns of holes have been considered on the walls of a square tube, and the force-displacement responses under axial crushing have been calculated numerically. Considering such results as input data for a deep learning process, the convolutional neural network (CNN) models for the force-displacement response have been extracted. The obtained deep neural network has been used in a multi-objective optimization process considering the pattern of holes as the design variables and crashworthiness criteria as objective functions. After the optimization process, several optimal points were identified as the Pareto front. To investigate the behavior of the obtained optimal thin-walled energy absorbers under oblique loads, different oblique load cases have been considered, and their response has been calculated numerically. Finally, using multi-criteria decision-making methods, one thin-walled energy absorber with a specific pattern of holes has been chosen, considering crashworthiness criteria in the oblique loading. In one of the optimized topologies, the specific mean crushing force and peak crushing force reached 139% and 62% of the baseline values, respectively, under axial loading, with improvements also observed under oblique angles."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate a bistatic integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system, consisting of a base station (BS) with multiple transmit antennas, a sensing receiver with multiple receive antennas, a single-antenna communication user (CU), and a point target to be sensed. Specifically, the BS transmits a superposition of Gaussian information and deterministic sensing signals to support ISAC. The BS aims to deliver information symbols to the CU, while the sensing receiver aims to estimate the target’s direction-of-arrival (DoA) with respect to the sensing receiver by processing the echo signals reflected by the target. For the sensing receiver, we assume that only the sequences of the deterministic sensing signals and the covariance matrix of the information signals are perfectly known, whereas the specific realizations of the information signals remain unavailable. Under this setup, we first derive the corresponding Cram´er-Rao bounds (CRBs) for DoA estimation and propose practical estimators to accurately estimate the target’s DoA. Subsequently, we formulate the transmit beamforming design as an optimization problem aiming to minimize the CRB, subject to a minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirement at the CU and a maximum transmit power constraint at the BS. When the BS employs only Gaussian information signals, the resulting beamforming optimization problem is convex, enabling the derivation of an optimal solution. In contrast, when both Gaussian information and deterministic sensing signals are transmitted, the resulting problem is non-convex and a locally optimal solution is acquired by exploiting successive convex approximation (SCA). Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the utilization of additional deterministic sensing signals is critical for sensing performance enhancement, while solely employing Gaussian information signals leads to a notable performance degradation for target sensing. It is unveiled that the proposed transmit beamforming design achieves a superior ISAC performance boundary compared with various benchmark schemes."

The PVA–LS–SA hydrogel matrix prepared via low-temperature 3D printing possessed stable mechanical strength and controllable structural morphology. After being conductively functionalized, the hydrogel exhibited reliable strain sensing performance based on the synergistic mechanism of microcracks in the silver particle layer and the tunneling effect within the soft matrix, which was effectively used to monitor various human motion signals including finger, wrist and knee joint movements. A clear polynomial relationship was identified between the relative change in resistance and the applied strain. When connected in the form of an array to a resistance acquisition and display system, the sensor was able to accurately provide real-time feedback with small errors on the magnitude and location of the applied load in practical measurement. The low-temperature 3D printing offered strong supports for the customized preparation and practical application of soft sensing materials and provided a feasible approach for developing conductive hydrogel sensors suitable for micro-strain detection."

In this paper, we propose a novel multiple BSs cooperative passive integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework in FD-RAN for low-altitude aerial vehicles. It utilizes the Doppler shift information from uplink orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals to achieve efficient localization without incurring additional sensing overhead. Specifically, the carrier frequency offset (CFO) compensation process at each BS captures Doppler shift resulting from the relative motion between the aerial vehicle and the BS. Considering the position and velocity of the aerial vehicle as unknown variables, the localization is achieved by formulating and solving a system of equations describing these Doppler shifts. Furthermore, to enable accurate trajectory tracking, we design a learning-based adaptive double-filter (LADF) algorithm, which leverages temporal correlations in both Doppler shift measurements and vehicle trajectories to improve the time-continuous localization. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed ISAC framework in low-altitude FD-RAN, which can enhance the coverage performance and efficiently provide accurate localization for aerial vehicles."

    "abstract": "In large-scale offshore wind power flexible high-voltage direct current transmission systems, the frequency-dependent (FD) characteristics and the mutual inductance of long AC/DC submarine cables cannot be neglected in the system small-signal stability analysis. However, most existing cable equivalent models either ignore FD and mutual inductance characteristics, or simulate FD impendence depend on historical data and convolution operations, which is not suitable for small-signal stability analysis. The small-signal modeling method mostly focuses on single cable, without considering mutual inductance between AC/DC cables. To overcome these limitations, this paper constructs a multi-RL multi-π equivalent circuit model with compensation current source based on per-unit length impedance data of phase-domain FD model. The proposed model has the RLC circuit structure and therefore is convenient to derive the small signal model. Firstly, this paper constructs a single π-type equivalent circuit with multiple RL branches in the vector fitting methods, based on the per-unit length impedance data extracted from phase-domain FD model. Next, the distribution and delay characteristics of single cables are emulated through cascading multiple π-type circuits. Then, based on phase-mode transformation, the terminal voltage-current relationship of AC/DC cable is derived to include the mutual inductance characteristics. Then, the cable mutual inductance equivalent circuit based on differential /common-mode RLC circuit and compensation current source is established. Furthermore, the modular small-signal model of AC/DC cable equivalent circuit considering FD and mutual inductance characteristics is established. Finally, the transient dynamic characteristics and small-signal stability of proposed model and real cable are compared in PSCAD/EMTDC to verify the correctness of proposed modeling method."

Current state-of-the-art detection approaches leverage multiple modalities, including user metadata, textual content, and social network relationships. However, these approaches often fail to adequately account for the influence of tweet sequence positions or to exploit the semantic and structural relevance among neighboring nodes, which limits their effectiveness in detecting advanced Twitter bots that deliberately mimic genuine user behavior. To address this issue, a novel multimodal detection framework is proposed, which jointly captures semantic relationships and social network structures for Twitter bot detection. Specifically, BotSCG first introduces a multi-head attention mechanism with sequential relative position bias to extract the semantic consistency of individual users. Then, a dual-modulation mechanism over the connection and relevance matrices to construct a structurally constrained semantic graph, which models the semantic and structural interactions among neighboring nodes and yields user semantic relationship representations. Finally, the semantic consistency features are fused with user relevance representations to measure the overall information consistency of users.

To tackle this challenge, this letter introduces ARBoids, a novel adaptive residual reinforcement learning framework that integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with the biologically inspired, force-based Boids model. Within this framework, the Boids model serves as a computationally efficient baseline policy for multi-agent coordination, while DRL learns a residual policy to adaptively refine and optimize the defenders' actions. The proposed approach is validated in a high-fidelity Gazebo simulation environment, demonstrating superior performance over traditional interception strategies, including pure force-based approaches and vanilla DRL policies.

    "abstract": "In-memory computing (IMC) architecture has emerged as a highly promising approach, enhancing the energy efficiency of multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operations in deep neural networks (DNNs) by embedding parallel computations directly into memory arrays. However, existing ferroelectric FET (FeFET)-based analog IMC designs are often constrained to cell-level optimizations and struggle to achieve high-precision MAC operations. In contrast, high-precision analog IMC architectures typically perform MAC operations for partial inputs and weights within the array in a single cycle and then accumulate partial results over multiple cycles. During this procedure, circuits that handle weight shift-and-add process, whether in digital or analog form, incur significant overhead. This paper presents energy-efficient high-precision analog IMC designs leveraging FeFET technology, which inherently support a shift-and-add mechanism for weights. Initially, we introduce an IMC array paradigm that performs partial MAC operations within each column, and seamlessly incorporates the shift-and-add process for weights by utilizing the analog storage properties of FeFET-based cells. Building upon this paradigm, we propose single-level cell (SLC) FeFET-based designs, namely CurFe and ChgFe, operating in the current and charge modes, respectively. Additionally, to leverage FeFET’s multi-level cell (MLC) properties, we propose a novel hybrid SLC-MLC FeFET-based design, MulFe, which offers higher storage density and energy efficiency. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted at both the circuit and system levels, and the results indicate that the average energy efficiency of the proposed FeFET-based analog IMC designs is 1.32× to 2.71× higher compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) IMC designs."

    "abstract": "Muscle fatigue is a leading contributor to Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSDs), which cause significant workplace disability and absenteeism. The biceps brachii are especially susceptible in manual labor due to prolonged use during tasks like lifting and carrying. Early detection of fatigue can help prevent MSDs by enabling timely interventions, such as workload adjustments or the use of assistive devices. This study presents a real-time, noninvasive, and cost-effective system for modeling biceps muscle fatigue during dumbbell curl exercises, which simulate industrial lifting movements. Two Inertial Measurement Units captured arm kinematics, and a Long Short-Term Memory neural network was trained to predict fatigue levels on a 0–7 scale using participants’ perceived exertion ratings. After offline training and optimization, the model was implemented in real-time and evaluated across 18 experiments, achieving a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 1.2. Accuracy was assessed using RMSE thresholds (±5, ±3.3, ±2), reaching 100 % at ±5 and exceeding 87 % for offline and online implementations. Compared to previous studies, this approach achieved higher accuracy with fewer sensors and demonstrated reliable real-time performance, highlighting its potential for workplace fatigue monitoring and injury prevention."

    "abstract": "Reasoning segmentation (RS) interprets implicit textual instructions to accurately segment target regions. This reasoning capability transforms ambiguous non-expert queries into precise pixel-level masks, thereby enabling downstream tasks like area measurement and density analysis with a level of precision unattainable by detection methods. However, existing RS models are not tailored for agriculture and lack domain-specific knowledge, which poses challenges in handling similar pest appearances and small target scales. To bridge this gap, we introduce a fine-grained pest RS task with two subtasks: Pest Discriminative Referring Expression Segmentation (PDRES) and Pest Exclusion Reasoning Segmentation (PERS). Based on this, we propose PestScope, which integrates vision, language, and reasoning for fine-grained pest segmentation. To tackle the exclusion of small non-target pests, we introduce a dedicated [NON] token alongside the standard [SEG] token for target pests. This guides the model to prioritize small target pests and suppress non-target background regions. To further address pest similarity, we propose an Exclusivity Suppression Loss, applying differentiated supervision to [SEG] and [NON] tokens to better separate target and non-target pests. Additionally, we develop an automated dataset construction pipeline to address the scarcity of fine-grained, difficulty-controllable pest RS datasets. It produces 45k and 27.6k image-text-mask samples for the PDRES and PERS tasks, respectively, covering 18 pest categories. Experiments show that in small and similar pest scenarios, integrating PestScope into mainstream models improves average gIoU by 4.28% on PDRES and 6.49% on PERS. For unseen pest categories, gIoU increases by 21.72% and 8.66%, respectively, demonstrating strong generalization. Code and datasets will be available at: https://github.com/aluodaydayup/PestScope."

Most existing studies rely upon self-report or manual measures from bulky wearable sensors, thus lacking efficiency and accuracy in capturing quantitative screen exposure data. In this work, we developed a novel screen detection framework that utilizes egocentric images from a wearable sensor, named the screen time tracker (STT), and a vision language model (VLM). In particular, we devised a multi-view VLM that takes multiple views from egocentric image streams and interprets screen exposure dynamically. We validated our approach by using a dataset of children's free-living activities, demonstrating significant improvement over existing methods in conventional vision language models and object detection models. The combination of vision language model and lightweight hardware design provides a novel solution in screen detection for children. The proposed framework has great potential to benefit children's behavioral study."

A 3-DOF manipulator was then constructed using three FCDEAs and robotic linkages fabricated via an origami-inspired microfabrication process. The linear displacement of the FCDEAs was converted into rotational motion at the joints through these linkages, enabling full 3-DOF end-effector motion. The fabricated manipulator features a compact form factor (25 mm × 20 mm × 10 mm) and lightweight structure (1.2 g).

    "abstract": "Timely and effective early warning is essential for proactive intervention to mitigate students’ learning risks. Existing studies on learning early warning primarily predict students’ knowledge mastery based on academic performance. However, they lack the assessment of course development objective achievement. According to the outcome-based education (OBE) concept, the course objective achievement serves as the foundation for comprehensive student assessment spanning knowledge acquisition, learning ability, and learning attitude. Using the course objective achievement as a guide for learning early warning can help to obtain more objective and accurate warning results. This article proposes a novel approach to learning early warning guided by course objective achievement via knowledge state and learning state modeling. This approach constructs knowledge states related to course objectives through a deep knowledge tracing model and derives the learning states comprising learning ability and learning attitude from multidimensional learning behavior data. The achievement state, fusing the knowledge and learning states, is then fed into a transformer model to capture the temporal dynamics of the achievement state and predict the achievement levels for each course objective. Based on these predictions, a four-level warning rule is employed to assess students’ learning risks. Experiments based on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach. The approach provides a new research paradigm and a feasible solution to achieve accurate personalized early learning warning."

    "abstract": "The rapid development of mobile internet has turned multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) into a prominent research focus. Despite the progress achieved by existing models, the heterogeneity problem resulting from modality differences presents significant challenges to MSA. Furthermore, while much focus has been placed on dynamic learning within a single sample, the learning of inter-sample and inter-class relationships has been largely overlooked. To tackle these problems, we propose a multi-scale text-guided progressive fusion network. Initially, a domain adaptation strategy is employed to fine-tune BERT model, enhancing its support for downstream tasks. Subsequently, we design a progressive fusion module that centers on text as the core modality, guiding the integration of audio and visual modalities to generate more enriched derivative feature representations. Within the cross-modal transformer, the integration of core and super-modal features captures fine-grained cross-modal dependencies. Furthermore, we introduce dual contrastive learning to facilitate the modeling of inter-sample and cross-category relationships, which further alleviates the impact of distributional discrepancies among modalities. Experimental results on the widely used CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and CH-SIMS datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing methods in multimodal sentiment classification tasks. The method achieved sentiment binary classification accuracies of 84.90%, 85.03%, and 81.76% on these datasets, and its effectiveness is further validated through multiple experiments."

    "abstract": "Implantable neurostimulators are critical for treating neurological disorders and require compact CMOS systems with long-term reliability. Electrostatic discharge (ESD) can damage thin oxide layers in the CMOS and can cause significant damage to systems. Conventional ESD protection circuits, such as clamp-based schemes with implicit or explicit diodes, are practical but require considerable area and complexity. Conversely, simpler protection architectures are more suitable for high-voltage neural interfaces, for which area and robustness are the key requirements. The major challenge is to achieve efficient ESD protection while ensuring operational safety and low layout area. This paper presents a compact back-to-back diode–based ESD protection design for neurostimulators in 65 nm CMOS technology, primarily targeting HBM-level ESD protection. The circuit has also been tested for CDM-level robustness; however, the main focus of this work remains on achieving reliable HBM performance. The proposed back-to-back diode design reduces clamping voltage by ~53% and dynamic resistance by ~89% when compared with implicit clamps while meeting the normal voltage operation range. In addition, the proposed design reduces dynamic resistance by more than 92% compared to the typical foundry design. As a result, ESD protection can be decoupled from stimulator drivers, allowing for more modular and area-efficient H-bridge designs. This simplifies the layout, eliminates the need for clamping transistors, and provides robust bidirectional ESD protection. Our work proposes a scalable ESD strategy appropriate for next-generation implantable SoC-based biomedical devices by addressing electrical and physical constraints."

    "abstract": "Cricket, one of the most popular sports worldwide, involves a wide variety of batting shots that directly affect match outcomes and play a central role in analyzing player performance. In this context, our study focuses on building an extensive dataset for cricket shot classification from videos and addressing the challenges of existing approaches. We observe that previous works suffer from the time-consuming task of manually trimming match videos into individual shot clips, which has led to relatively small datasets. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel approach that leverages recurring patterns in cricket broadcasts to automatically split long videos into multiple shot clips. This reframes the task into a form similar to text or image annotation, thereby facilitating the construction of large-scale datasets. Using this method, we build a dataset, called CricShot10k, consisting of 10,086 video clips across 15 shot classes. Our dataset is nearly eight times larger and more diverse than existing ones, covering shots from all formats, and being the first to include women’s and under-19 matches, as well as older matches dating back to 1996. Building on this dataset, we present a modified cricket shot classification framework, CricShotNet, which incorporates two new layers: cropping and segmentation. To identify the best-performing architecture for the subsequent layers, we conduct an extensive comparison across 15 deep feature extractors and 9 variations of temporal feature extractors using GRU, LSTM, and BiLSTM. Our experiments show that EfficientNetV2-S combined with a GRU of 128 units achieve the highest accuracy of 89% on CricShot10k and outperform other state-of-the-art approaches on existing cricket shot video datasets, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

In this letter, we investigate in detail how these factors are interrelated under different programming conditions. We show that, under time constraints, lower energy consumption can be achieved using faster programming pulses at the cost of increased power dissipation. Conversely, when limiting the maximum power is the priority, longer programming times are required to minimize energy consumption. These trade-offs ultimately stem from the physical response time of ions and vacancies involved in the formation and dissolution of the conductive filament within the oxide layer of a metal-insulator-metal (MIM) structure. We begin by analytically examining the effect of applying a single trapezoidal pulse to the device. Next, we extend the analysis to multiple pulses, using a compact recursive approach to model both potentiation and depression. Finally, we perform SPICE simulations under unconstrained programming conditions. Modeling and simulations are based on the Dynamic Memdiode Model, combined with the Method of Elementary Solvers. Given the variability of device parameters and experimental conditions, we provide the complete SPICE schematic to allow interested readers to explore different scenarios and tailor the analysis to their specific use cases."

    "abstract": "The integration of sub-6 GHz, centimeter-wave, and millimeter-wave bands through cross-band coordination is recognized as a pivotal approach to optimize system performance in the sixth generation (6G) research. The existing standard channel models, e.g., 3GPP TR 38.901 and QuaDRiGa, support cross-band channel simulations. However, both models assume that multipath components observed at different bands are identical, which is inconsistent with channel measurements. In this paper, we propose a general cross-band channel model, which considers the birth and death of clusters across different bands. The evolution of clusters in temporal and spatial domains is also incorporated, where the common clusters observed at different bands are modeled to undergo identical birth-death processes. Furthermore, the frequency-dependent blockage losses caused by obstacles are embedded in the proposed model. A comprehensive analysis of channel statistical properties is conducted, including the delay/angular/Doppler spreads and stationary times/distances. Moreover, the similarities of cross-band channels in angular and delay domains are analyzed. To validate the accuracy of the proposed model, cross-band channel measurements across 0.7 to 39 GHz are conducted by time-domain channel sounders, which are capable of simultaneously measuring channels at two bands. Comparisons of simulation results from the proposed model, enhanced 6G pervasive channel model, and 3GPP TR 38.901 with measurement data reveal that the proposed model demonstrates the best alignment with measurements."

    "abstract": "Internet of Vehicles (IoV) communication serves as a critical enabler for intelligent transportation systems, where the reliability of data sharing fundamentally determines overall system performance. Data reliability not only dictates the quality of IoV services but also constitutes a core factor in ensuring traffic safety and improving road operational efficiency. At present, IoV data sharing confronts several key challenges: (i) degradation of message credibility due to malicious attackers; (ii) ineffectiveness of conventional reputation mechanisms under high vehicular mobility; and (iii) channel congestion and information loss caused by redundant data transmissions. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Hybrid Hash Chord Protocol, which integrates Geohash geocoding with the Chord distributed lookup algorithm to establish a location-aware peer-to-peer data forwarding mechanism. This approach enables efficient data transmission with reduced hop count. In addition, a recursive traffic data filtering method is introduced to effectively suppress duplicate data reporting. Moreover, a Bayesian Dynamic Fading Reputation Model is developed, incorporating time decay factors and historical behavior weighting to mitigate intelligent attacks and node inertia, thereby enhancing road safety and traffic efficiency. Experimental results indicate that, within an IoV data-sharing context, the proposed model improves traffic efficiency by approximately 4% and reduces overall communication overhead by 36% compared to existing schemes. When the reputation threshold is set to 0.35, the model achieves a 100% malicious vehicle detection rate, whereas benchmark methods remain below 80% under the same threshold. In summary, the proposed framework achieves a notable balance among enhancing data trustworthiness, optimizing traffic performance, and minimizing communication costs, offering a practicable solution for building efficient and reliable IoV data-sharing systems."

However, existing methods face challenges from grain fullness, complex soil backgrounds and weeds. This research proposes a mature rice yield estimation approach that consists of Fusion Yield Network (FusYieldNet) model and five-points sampling method. To estimate the yield of small plot with fixed size, FusYieldNet model is designed with RGB, multispectral, and fusion branches for feature extraction and fusion. Efficient Multi-scale Convolution Attention Module (EMCAM) is introduced in three branches, and Parallel Path Attention (PPA) in the RGB branch to capture multi-scale features. Furthermore, in the RGB branch, a novel Dilated Deformable Dense Block (DDDB) is developed by enabling convolutions in the module DenseBlock dilated and deformable to extract features from changeable-size and deformable image regions. With the loss of three branches, the gradient blending technique is employed to mitigate the risk of overfitting and improve the model's generalization capability. Afterward, the field yield is estimated as the average yield of five sampled small plots with five-points sampling method. Experimental results demonstrate that FusYieldNet achieves a mean absolute error of 18.03 kg, a relative error of 1.74%, and a co-efficient of determination (R²) of 0.9927, outperforming all unimodal and competing multimodal fusion approaches. The proposed five-points sampling method enables in-field rice yield estimation with approximately 3% relative error and 2-second computational efficiency, effectively meeting practical application requirements."

    "abstract": "In addition to securely handling objects, grippers endowed with a sense of touch are desirable for handling delicate objects. Force sensors can be mounted distally at the fingertips, but a simpler option is to estimate fingertip forces from motor current at the base. This approach, which is not new, reduces wire routing and recesses electronics away from the sensed surface for operation in wet environments. However, for such a strategy to work, the actuating motor must have no or low gearing, which increases its transparency to external torques, but greatly limits its own torque output. Therein lies a trade-off. In addition to gearing, the transmission ratio from motor to fingertip is also defined by the gripper linkage itself. In this work, the trade-off is overcome by introducing a linkage capable of reconfiguring without the need of an extra actuator. Reconfiguration is performed by moving across an output singularity to select between a mode which is biased for force sensing (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">sense mode</i>) and a mode which is biased for force production (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">grip mode</i>). These novel kinematics are embodied as a mostly monolithic compliant mechanism, leaving just one traditional pin joint in the entire gripper assembly. Experiments show that force mode exhibits 3.1× more force output, and sense mode can measure 2.6× smaller forces. Corollary to the latter, sense mode is ideal for estimating the stiffness of objects, including small fruits with stiffness lower than 150 N/m. As an illustration, we demonstrate the usage of sense mode to estimate the ripeness of small fruits, followed by a transition to force mode in order to pluck the fruit.

    "abstract": "This work proposes an S-shaped power-sharing control (S-PSC) for enhancing scalability of the DC-coupled electric vehicle (EV) charging stations. The scheme provides DC-link voltage regulation while coordinating the charging activities of multiple EVs and integrating battery energy storage systems (BESSs), supercapacitors, renewable energy sources, and a bidirectional voltage source inverter (B-VSI). While existing inertial droop-based control strategies require measurements of the DC-source output power to tune their response according to the assigned inertia, the proposed S-PSC relies solely on DC-link voltage measurements to decouple the DC power demand into multiple inertia-response levels. The S-shaped function prioritizes the compensation of these response levels by dynamically coordinating the operation of the B-VSI, BESS, and EV storage units, ensuring acceptable state of charge, adequate inertia support, and operation close to nominal power levels. A small-signal analysis confirms voltage stability and attenuation of the BESS current. Experimental validation using hardware-in-the-loop under 60 minutes of intensive EV charging during peak hour demonstrated that the S-PSC reduces BESS stress by 40%, increases energy delivery to EVs by 32%, enhances the economic benefit of BESS utilization, and mitigates flicker in the low-voltage grid when compared with the conventional benchmark solution for industrial applications."

    "abstract": "Accurate calibration and robust localization are fundamental for downstream tasks in spinning actuated LiDAR applications. Existing methods, however, require parameterizing extrinsic parameters based on different mounting configurations, limiting their generalizability. Additionally, spinning actuated LiDAR inevitably scans featureless regions, which complicates the balance between scanning coverage and localization robustness. To address these challenges, this letter presents a targetless LiDAR-motor calibration (LM-Calibr) on the basis of the Denavit-Hartenberg convention and an environmental adaptive LiDAR-inertial odometry (EVA-LIO). LM-Calibr supports calibration of LiDAR-motor systems with various mounting configurations. Extensive experiments demonstrate its accuracy and convergence across different scenarios, mounting angles, and initial values. Additionally, EVA-LIO adaptively selects downsample rates and map resolutions according to spatial scale. This adaptivity enables the actuator to operate at maximum speed, thereby enhancing scanning completeness while ensuring robust localization, even when LiDAR briefly scans featureless areas.

    "abstract": "Accurate beam alignment is a critical challenge in extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems, especially in the near-field regime, where conventional far-field assumptions no longer hold. While 2D polar-domain codebooks can capture near-field effects, they incur high time and computational complexity. To address this, we propose a novel line-of-sight (LoS) near-field beam alignment scheme that reuses the conventional discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebook, commonly employed in far-field systems, ensuring backward compatibility without modifying the beam set. By introducing a new method to analyze the energy spread effect, we define the concept of an ϵ-approximated signal subspace, spanned by DFT vectors that exhibit significant correlation with the near-field channel vector. Building on this analysis, the proposed hybrid scheme integrates model-based principles with data-driven techniques, using DFT properties for efficient coarse alignment and a deep neural network (DNN)-aided fine alignment in a reduced search space. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the proposed scheme attains higher alignment accuracy than existing methods, while providing substantial reductions in both computational load and neural network model size. These advantages make it well suited for practical large-scale near-field deployments."

Leveraging the global control capabilities of a geostationary (GEO)-resident software-defined networking (SDN) controller, we introduce opportunistic routing, which aims to minimize delivery delay by forwarding packets to any currently available ground gateways rather than fixed destinations. This makes it a promising approach for achieving low-latency and robust data delivery in highly dynamic LEO networks. Specifically, we formulate a constrained stochastic optimization problem and employ a residual reinforcement learning framework to optimize opportunistic routing for reducing transmission delay. Simulation results over multiple days of orbital data demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements in queue length reduction compared to classical backpressure and other well-known queueing algorithms."

To address this issue, this article proposes a novel structural optimization network: a hybrid embedding segment anything model (SAM) guided feedback network (GFNet). This network is based on the SAM framework and achieves multimodal structural alignment by transforming the semantic prior (SP) extractor through module-level fine-tuning of the image encoder. Furthermore, this article proposes a cross-architecture knowledge transfer (CAKT) mechanism, injecting the structural awareness capability of SAM into the backbone features of each layer, achieving dual optimization of alignment and enhancement. To address the issues of intermodal heterogeneity and semantic conflict, this article combines complementary fusion at different frequencies and cross-modal similarity enhancement strategies to achieve fine-grained semantic fusion and consistency modeling, supplemented by a dual-supervised constraint mechanism to improve modal independence and robustness.

The UHF sensor performance is investigated and tested experimentally for PD detection in an oil tank, the corona discharges in air gaps, as well as the surface tracking UHF signals of the leakage current bursts on the surface of the polymer insulator, and has proven highly accurate in capturing the UHF signals in both cases. FFT was generated for the captured UHF signals, and the results are used to identify the type of UHF signal. This helps in the discrimination among different types of sites."

Constrained by the intricate operating environment of GIS and the transient and stochastic nature of PD, acquiring sufficient PD samples in practical applications remains challenging. Therefore, this paper proposes an improved capsule generative adversarial network (GAN) for small-sample GIS PD diagnosis. Firstly, capsule network is introduced in both the generator and the discriminator to extract more comprehensive feature information from PD signals, thus avoiding the potential loss of crucial features due to pooling operations. Then, a dual-mode optimization method is used to update the model parameters of the generator, and sample quality and diversity are used as evaluation indicators to guide the training process of the generator, realizing automatic optimization of generator parameter-level model construction. Meanwhile, the discriminator stabilizes the GAN training by adopting the Wasserstein distance and incorporating a gradient penalty term. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves diagnostic accuracy of 97.47% in small datasets, significantly outperforming other methods and exhibiting robust performance, provides a viable solution for high-precision and robust GIS PD diagnosis with limited samples."

However, its industrial application faces many challenges, especially in terms of complicated cutting conditions and limited accuracy. In this article, a novel approach of physics-informed liquid neural networks (PILNNs) is proposed for tool wear prediction under varying cutting conditions. The model extracts multidimensional features related to tool wear from the acceleration signals and inputs them into a multilayer perceptual machine. Physical constraints are constructed through a tool wear model to provide physical priori knowledge for the neural networks. Liquid time-constant neurons are constructed by the neural circuit policies method to build the liquid neural networks (LNNs). In this case, the PILNNs merge both physical laws and LNN structures, which significantly enhances the generalization performance towards tool wear prediction. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated by the data obtained under varying cutting conditions, as well as the comparison against traditional physics-informed neural networks and other machine learning models through the same dataset. The results illustrate that the proposed model shows high accuracy and stability in terms of tool wear prediction under varying cutting conditions, which is also superior to the traditional machine learning models."

However, efficiently discovering high-performance neural network architectures that simultaneously optimize multiple objectives remains a significant challenge in NAS. Existing methods often suffer from limited population diversity and inadequate exploration of the search space, particularly in regions with extreme complexity values. To address these challenges, we propose a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA)-BUS, an innovative MOEA based on bipopulation with uniform sampling for NAS, aimed at simultaneously optimizing both accuracy and network complexity. In MOEA-BUS, a novel uniform sampling method is proposed to initialize the population, ensuring that architectures are distributed uniformly across the objective space. Furthermore, to enhance exploration, we deploy a bipopulation framework where two populations evolve synergistically, facilitating comprehensive search space coverage. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet demonstrate MOEA-BUS’s superiority, achieving top-one accuracies of 98.39% on CIFAR-10, and 80.03% on ImageNet. Notably, it achieves 78.28% accuracy on ImageNet with only 446 M MAdds. Ablation studies confirm that both uniform sampling and bipopulation mechanisms enhance population diversity and performance. In addition, in terms of Kendall’s tau coefficient, the SVM achieves an improvement of at least 0.035 compared to the other three commonly used machine learning models, and uniform sampling provided an enhancement of approximately 0.07."

Both simulation and experimental results, conducted under various load conditions and modulation indices, demonstrate up to a 50% reduction in CMV magnitude while maintaining balanced DC-link capacitor voltages. Although a marginal increase in total harmonic distortion (THD) is observed in one phase, the average THD across all three phases remains within acceptable IEEE 519-2022 standard. Furthermore, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis verifies the effective suppression of dominant CMV spectral components.

It unfolds the iterative optimization steps into a stack of sequentially linked blocks. Each block consists of a Gradient Descent Module (GDM) and a Proximal Mapping Module (PMM) which is equivalent to a denoiser from a Bayesian perspective, operating on Gaussian noise with a known level. However, existing DUNs suffer from two critical limitations: (i) their PMMs share identical architectures and denoising objectives across stages, ignoring the need for stage-specific adaptation to varying noise levels; and (ii) their chain of structurally repetitive blocks results in severe parameter redundancy and high memory consumption, hindering deployment in large-scale or resource-constrained scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce generalized Deep Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) Unfolding Networks for image restoration, named LoRun, harmonizing denoising objectives and adapting different denoising levels between stages with compressed memory usage for more efficient DUN. LoRun introduces a novel paradigm where a single pretrained base denoiser is shared across all stages, while lightweight, stage-specific LoRA adapters are injected into the PMMs to dynamically modulate denoising behavior according to the noise level at each unfolding step. This design decouples the core restoration capability from task-specific adaptation, enabling precise control over denoising intensity without duplicating full network parameters and achieving up to <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i> times parameter reduction for an <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>-stage DUN with on-par or better performance.

In this paper, a realistic downlink communication scenario is introduced in which an aerodynamic HAPS flies along a circular trajectory and serves handheld users in an urban environment. Stochastic geometry-based analysis is conducted, along with the assimilation of approximations using simulation data to incorporate the circular aperture antenna model of the HAPS. Analytical expressions are derived for the coverage probability and the ergodic capacity, and the validity of these expressions is demonstrated through extensive Monte Carlo simulations. Although there are slight gaps in the performance analysis, the general tendencies between the analysis and simulation results show a close match. The impact of aerodynamic parameters such as flight radius and altitude on the coverage probability is demonstrated to be relatively marginal to that of communication system parameters such as the number of simultaneous service users and the total transmission power. In terms of ergodic capacity, both aerodynamic parameters show improved performance as their values decrease, with the altitude being more dominant. Although smaller flight radii are favorable for improving network performance, such configurations impose additional constraints on aircraft design, highlighting the need to carefully consider the limitations of size, weight, and power (SWaP). A discussion on real-world HAPS design is supplemented in order to offer practical guidelines for balancing communication performances with the SWaP constraints of the HAPS."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the performance of a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-enhanced active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system under a non-terrestrial network (NTN) framework. The performance is analyzed in terms of outage probability, ergodic capacity, beampattern gain, and probability of detection (PoD). To this end, the end-to-end equivalent channel distribution under maximum ratio transmission beamforming is derived and modeled as a Gamma distribution. Based on this, a closed-form expression for the outage probability (OP) is obtained in terms of Meijer G-functions. The accuracy of the analytical results is validated through Monte Carlo simulations. To provide further insight, we derive the asymptotic expression of the OP and the corresponding diversity order. Additionally, an approximate expression for the ergodic capacity is derived using the method of moments, along with its upper and lower bounds. To evaluate the impact of the active RIS in mitigating the impact of multiplicative fading through amplification of the incident signal, its performance is compared against a baseline passive RIS scheme, revealing significant performance improvements. In particular, the outage probability is improved by approximately 72.94% and 73.33% for the weak user (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">D<sub>1</sub></i>) and strong user (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">D<sub>2</sub></i>), respectively, when employing an active RIS compared to a passive RIS at a transmit SNR of 22 dBm. The influence of practical impairments, including hardware impairments, imperfect channel state information, and imperfect successive interference cancellation, is also examined. The results show that increasing the number of RIS elements and the number of antennas at the satellite can effectively alleviate the adverse effects of these impairments. On the sensing side, the proposed ISAC system is compared with a conventional radar system in terms of the PoD for aerial targets located at various positions, and it additionally demonstrates beampattern gain. The results are obtained under the assumptions of ideal RIS phase configuration and line-of-sight (LoS) between the satellite and targets, representing key limitations of the analysis."

    "abstract": "Tree-based ensemble models perform well on tabular data, but their assumption of feature independence restricts their ability to capture the complex relationships between features and samples. To overcome this limitation, several deep learning based approaches have been proposed. However, most prior studies have focused on a single relational axis, either the relations between features or between samples. While some recent efforts have attempted to incorporate both axes jointly, research that integrates feature interactions within a sample, along with the existing relational axes, remains limited. In this study, we propose a framework that utilizes three types of relational information in tabular data: relations between features, relations between samples, and interactions among features within each sample. We note that the importance of the features can vary across samples. As such, our model integrates both unsupervised, structure-aware feature importance, estimated through global inter-feature relations, and Attention-based sample representations derived from the FT-Transformer encoder. The proposed architecture consists of three components: (i) A Feature Graph-based tournament that identifies the most informative numerical features using global feature relations. (ii) An FT-Transformer encoder that captures within-sample feature interactions. (iii) A Sample Graph that models structural relations between samples. Experiments on 11 benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model achieves a 1.3% improvement in average AUC-ROC compared to gradient boosted decision trees (GBDT) and a 6.2% improvement over representative deep learning models. Regarding efficiency, our framework demonstrates a shorter average training time compared to TabNet and SAINT on the same datasets. Furthermore, its computational complexity scales approximately linearly with the number of samples and selected features, making it well-suited for medium-scale tabular datasets."

    "abstract": "This article introduces a novel, compact, fully textile-based multifunctional system that, for the first time, simultaneously achieves near- and far-field (NFF) communication and wireless power transfer (WPT) capabilities within a truly wearable platform. The proposed hybrid system covers the three most widely used frequency bands and supports multiple functionalities simultaneously. The near-field communication (NFC) and energy-harvesting functions are realized by a coil antenna operating at a frequency of 13.56 MHz; the body-centric communication function is achieved by an antenna that operates at 2.45 GHz and adopts omnidirectional radiation mode; and the power transfer function is implemented by an antenna operating at 5.8 GHz with directional radiation mode and a rectifier circuit. In virtue of the shared-aperture design, the entire system features simplicity, compactness, and low profile, making it more suitable for integration on all-textile substrates. Measurement results show that the body-centric communication operates in the frequency band of 2.43–2.53 GHz, and the power transfer covers the frequency band of 5.72–5.96 GHz. The interband isolation between the two antennas is better than −30 and −25 dB, respectively, thus ensuring minimal interference between system functions and reliable multimode operation. The rectifier achieves a maximum conversion efficiency of 70%. In addition, the NFC and energy-harvesting modules support data exchange (reading and writing) and can deliver an output voltage of 1.4 V when used with existing commercial smartphones, which demonstrates the remarkable communication and energy-harvesting capabilities. Finally, the proposed design was experimentally evaluated under practical wearable conditions. These results demonstrate that the system can simultaneously perform its intended functionalities while maintaining excellent compatibility with IoT platforms."

    "abstract": "Atmospheric haze and cloud cover severely degrade remote sensing image quality, adversely affecting critical tasks like object recognition and change detection. Existing dehazing methods face significant challenges with such images: traditional physical models often cause over-dehazing and color distortion, while single-stage deep learning models generalize poorly due to fixed regression paths. To address these limitations, this paper proposes FS-FlowNet, a dual-domain frequency-spatial residual flow network for remote sensing image dehazing. We innovatively combine frequency-spatial domain processing with multi-stage ordinary differential equation optimization within an efficient end-to-end architecture. First, during coarse dehazing, an enhanced U-Net encoder–decoder conducts multi-layer feature extraction with skip connections to capture haze-related features while preserving spatial structures. Next, a dual-domain module extracts amplitude and phase spectra via FFT, using a dual-branch (frequency-spatial) strategy to improve high-frequency detail. We employ a flow matching algorithm to cast dehazing as a multi-stage flow-field optimization problem; Here, a fourth-order Runge–Kutta (RK4) solver is used to activate/solve the underlying ordinary differential equations, yielding smooth and physically plausible flow transformations. Extensive experiments on the real world benchmark and multiple synthetic datasets demonstrate superior performance in both real and synthetic scenarios."

However, the reliability limitations of FC systems under variable altitude conditions have hindered widespread use in plateau transportation. This study proposes a coordinated control method combining adaptive cathode surge suppression and optimized anode purging aimed at enhancing the reliability of the FC gas supply system under variable altitude conditions. A model-adaptive updating strategy is adopted to design a model predictive control (MPC) approach for cathode gas flow and pressure regulation, integrating a dual-layer surge discrimination mechanism to prevent surge in altitude-gradient air compressors under extreme conditions. For anode pressure and flow regulation, a super-twisting algorithm-based control method is implemented. An entropy-weighted TOPSIS framework is employed to optimize purge strategies within a multiindex evaluation system. Under the China Heavy-duty commercial vehicle test cycle (CHTC) condition, the maximum control errors for oxygen excess ratio (OER) and cathode pressure demonstrate 19.88% and 10.72% reductions, respectively, compared with sliding mode control (SMC). The absolute error of anode pressure at 4000 m altitude decreases by 4.21% per cycle relative to plain-area strategies. Finally, hardware-in-the-loop experiments validate the method’s feasibility."

    "abstract": "Accurate and continuous measurement of key process variables in modern coal-fired power plants is critical, yet challenging due to ”concept drift” induced by flexible operating regimes. Frequent start-ups, shutdowns, and rapid load changes introduce complex, variable, and unknown operating conditions, which degrade the performance and adaptability of conventional soft-sensing instruments. To address this measurement problem, this paper proposes a novel soft-sensing model with high accuracy and robust tracking capabilities: the Tracking Structured State Space Sequence Model (TS4). The TS4 architecture is composed of three key innovations for superior measurement performance. First, a Probabilistic Structured State Space Sequence (PS4) model is developed to establish a highly accurate baseline measurement under stable conditions and provide probabilistic uncertainty quantification. Second, a lightweight Probabilistic Kernel Recursive Least Squares (PKRLS) algorithm with a forgetting factor is derived, enabling the soft sensor to rapidly adapt to new operating conditions through online updates. Finally, a dynamic posterior weight updating strategy is designed to intelligently fuse the deep representation of PS4 with the online tracking ability of PKRLS, creating a single, robust measurement model. The proposed soft sensor was validated on operational data from a large-scale coal-fired power plant for the task of power generation measurement. Compared to various baseline models, the TS4-based instrument demonstrates significantly improved measurement accuracy and superior capability in tracking dynamic operating conditions, proving its value for enabling intelligent, safe, and efficient plant operations."

    "abstract": "The scarcity of high-quality labeled data in sensor-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) hinders model performance and limits generalization across real-world scenarios. Data augmentation is a key strategy to mitigate this issue by enhancing the diversity of training datasets. Signal Transformation-based Data Augmentation (STDA) techniques have been widely used in HAR. However, these methods are often physically implausible and can produce data misaligned with activity labels. In this study, we propose Physically Plausible Data Augmentation (PPDA) enabled by physics simulation. PPDA leverages human body movement data from motion capture or video-based pose estimation and incorporates realistic variability through physics simulation, including changes in body movements, sensor placements, and hardware-related effects. We compare the performance of PPDA methods with traditional STDA methods on three public datasets of activities of daily living and fitness workouts: REALDISP (34 classes), REALWORLD (8 classes), and MM-Fit (11 classes). First, we compare each PPDA method with its closest STDA counterpart, showing that PPDA improves macro F1 scores by an average of 3.7 percentage points (pp), with gains up to 13 pp. Second, we assess to what extent combining PPDAs can reduce the need for initial data collection, and in comparison with combined STDAs, we observe that PPDA achieves competitive performance with up to 60% fewer training subjects. As the first systematic study of PPDA in HAR, these results highlight the advantages of pursuing physical plausibility in data augmentation and the potential of physics simulation for generating synthetic Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data for training deep learning HAR models. This cost-effective and scalable approach therefore helps address the annotation scarcity challenge in HAR."

    "abstract": "The swift growth in ubiquitous connectivity, such as 5G and 6G, cloud computing, which enables data-driven automation and increases efficiency across industries, gave rise to the Internet of Things. This proliferation significantly expands the network attack surface, making IoT-based networks increasingly vulnerable to a multitude of attacks. To mitigate the attacks, Intrusion detection systems are developed. While developing the IDS, a primary challenge is the data collection of attack patterns and their training. The data collected is often massive, heterogeneous, and, critically, imbalanced. Training conventional models on such imbalanced data typically leads to poor performance, particularly in overlooking minority attack classes during multi-class classification. Our proposed system directly addresses this challenge of data imbalance. We introduce a hybrid technique, the Transformed Image Generative Adversarial Network (TIGAN), that generates high-fidelity attack samples and is then used to augment underrepresented attack classes, complemented by downsampling of overrepresented ones. The balanced data allows our lightweight deep learning model, Transformed Image Convolutional Neural Network (TICNN), to achieve robust attack detection. The experimental TICNN-based IDS delivers a faster detection time and detection accuracy of 99.56% at the macro level, which showcases its strong capability to identify diverse attacks, sporadic minority classes, in challenging IoT settings."

    "abstract": "This study proposes a new Sliding Mode Control (SMC) approach in which a proportional–integral–retarded (PIR) structure is employed as the sliding surface for second-order dynamical processes. Unlike conventional sliding surfaces that rely on proportional–derivative structures, the proposed PIR sliding surface integrates proportional, integral, and intentional delay terms directly into the surface definition, thereby eliminating explicit derivative action while improving transient shaping capability and noise robustness. A complete analytical formulation is provided, including the derivation of the PIR-based sliding surface, the associated closed-form SMC control law, and a Lyapunov-based stability analysis ensuring finite-time convergence and closed-loop stability. The controller parameters are optimally tuned using the MATLAB fmincon algorithm based on four integral performance criteria, namely ISE, IAE, ITSE, and ITAE. The proposed PIR-SMC scheme is evaluated through comprehensive simulation studies on a second-order electromechanical system. The results demonstrate fast reference tracking, reduced overshoot, and accurate steady-state performance. Robustness is further assessed by applying ±10% variations to the process parameters without retuning, where consistent dynamic behavior is maintained. Additionally, by delivering an external disturbance at various time instants, the suggested controller's disturbance rejection capability is examined. In all cases, the PIR-SMC-controlled system suppresses the disturbance effectively and restores the output to the reference value within 0.5–1 s without steady-state error. Comparative analyses indicate that ISE-based optimization provides superior transient performance, while ITAE-based optimization minimizes long-duration errors. Overall, the proposed PIR sliding surface–based SMC offers a robust and flexible control framework suitable for second-order processes and represents a viable alternative to conventional sliding surface based designs."

A tripolar electrode configuration is adopted to ensure tool-independence and broad compatibility across instruments and anatomical sites. The optimal layout of electrode radius, inter-electrode spacing, and placement was identified through a systematic parametric study.

In all settings, proximity distance estimates were accurate and robust across different insertion angles. In simulation, it achieved 0.55 mm RMSE/1.06 mm MAE when the target layer was less conductive than the first layer and 0.40 mm RMSE/1.21 mm MAE when it was more conductive. In saline, four insertion angles yielded millimeter errors with no angle dependence. In <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ex vivo</i> layered tissue, accuracy remained near the millimeter level across angles (RMSE 1.00–1.13 mm and MAE 1.30–1.58 mm), which is slightly lower than saline yet consistent across orientations. Together, these results establish a general, instrument-agnostic framework for absolute proximity distance sensing during needle interventions with the potential to enhance safety and efficiency in minimally invasive procedures. Furthermore, by first focusing on a two-layer model, this work provides a clear pathway to multi-layer tissue modeling and broader anatomical generalization."

    "abstract": "Stock trend prediction aims to classify trading decisions into buy, hold, and sell signals with the goal of ensuring traders maximize profits. With the application of deep learning models and their efficiency across multiple tasks, there is an increasing research direction into their applications in stock trend prediction. However, most of these models are not trained to understand complex market structures and are sometimes oversimplified, making them not very useful in real-world trading performance. This study proposes a meta-adaptive multi-horizon forecasting model that integrates historical price data with domain-specific structural features to improve market trend prediction across 1, 3, 7, and 10-day horizons. The model utilizes fair value gaps (FVG) derived via a deterministic three-bar imbalance rule that captures liquidity voids, inefficiency zones, and institutional trading points. These features are also augmented by order block attributes and rolling-window hurst exponents that capture fractal persistence and market transitions in a principled form. The proposed model employs a variable selection network for dynamic soft-gating over the input set, and a multi-scale projection module that transforms each sequence using learned pooled-up sampling before fusing them through trainable attention weights. This fused representation is then passed through the feature-wise linear modulation block, which is adjusted based on a global context vector that enables horizon-specific adaptability. The temporal dependencies are modeled with a gated attention unit encoder and a gated residual decoder that classifies the buy, hold, and sell labels across different future horizons. The model was evaluated on eight indices, namely BSE, DJIA, FTSE, NASDAQ, NIFTY, N225, S&P500, and SSE, using time series cross-validation with <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</i> = 3, 5, and 7 fold settings.

A real-time trading simulation assesses the practical impact of the window size, considering 5, 10, and 15 days, with subsequent statistical validation through a paired t-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test against benchmarks. Conclusively, this study provides valuable insights and demonstrates how both short and long-term traders can effectively leverage the proposed model using historical price data, market cues, and smart money concepts to accurately classify stock price movement."

When autonomous vehicles enter degraded scenarios such as tunnels, self-localization may fail due to the sparse geometric features and high similarity structures. This paper introduces AD-LIO, an adaptive voxel LiDAR inertial odometry framework designed for IoVs, which can quantitatively evaluate the degradation of scenarios to guide the framework in dealing with challenging scenarios. Points-based registration is utilized to guarantee the full details of the feature-lack scene can be described. To ensure this robust registration, a novel point-to-plane strategy, which employs the LiDAR geometry and intensity constraints, is incorporated into the point-to-plane matching. The framework can adaptively change voxel size to adjust the scenario condition in realtime by proposing a lightweight scene degradation factor. This factor can be simply calculated and attached to the scan-to-map optimization process. Extensive experiments under degradation and non-degradation scenarios show that the proposed AD-LIO framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in robustness and estimation precision. The framework also achieves a favorable balance between precision and computational efficiency across LiDAR configurations from 16 to 128 beams. Furthermore, AD-LIO enables reliable large-scale pose estimation over trajectories exceeding 60 km. Our demonstration video is available now at https://youtu.be/Qy2mD4347mQ."

    "abstract": "Accurate traffic flow prediction is fundamental to intelligent transportation systems, yet it remains challenging due to the complex spatio-temporal dynamics of road networks. Most existing approaches model traffic conditions as discrete snapshots, which fail to capture the underlying continuous evolution of traffic states and lead to significant information loss. Moreover, many methods insufficiently model spatial heterogeneity, inadequately distinguishing between local geographic proximity and global semantic correlations. To address these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Forecasting with Adaptive Continuous learning and Heterogeneity awareness (STFACH), a novel framework for traffic forecasting. First, we introduce an Adaptive Continuous Learning module that bridges discrete observations and continuous dynamics, while capturing intrinsic volatility often filtered out by deterministic interpolation. Driven by a learnable control path derived from intrinsic traffic volatility, this module leverages attentive neural differential equations to reconstruct continuous latent trajectories and explicitly model fine-grained temporal evolution. Second, we design a Heterogeneity-Aware module to resolve spatial ambiguity by disentangling spatial dependencies into dual branches, constructing adaptive adjacency matrices that jointly capture local geometric relations and global semantic affinities. Extensive experiments on ten real-world benchmark datasets spanning diverse traffic scenarios demonstrate that STFACH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, validating its effectiveness and robustness in modeling both continuous dynamics and structural heterogeneity. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/MaxRubby/STFACH_2026."

    "abstract": "The lack of actionable guidance is a fundamental limitation in Action Quality Assessment (AQA), as traditional methods provide overall scores without offering specific insights for improvement. Moreover, existing interpretable approaches often rely on expensive supervised spatial annotations or yield noisy, unsigned saliency maps. To address these challenges, we propose Learning Interpretability Based Supervoxels (LIBS), a novel framework for generating instructional feedback. Distinguishing itself from fully supervised methods, LIBS employs an unsupervised soft-clustering mechanism to segment videos into coherent supervoxels without requiring pixel-level mask annotations. This allows for scalable, fine-grained spatio-temporal analysis while preserving action continuity. Furthermore, we introduce a sensitivity propensity analysis to quantify the contribution of each supervoxel. Unlike traditional attribution methods, this mechanism explicitly decomposes the quality score into positive (strengths) and negative (flaws) components, enabling the system to decode abstract scores into concrete, actionable instructions. Experimental validation across multiple datasets demonstrates that LIBS achieves superior interpretability and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines, marking an improvement from diagnostic to instructional AQA applications."

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) emerged as a solution for collaborative medical image classification while preserving data privacy. However, label noise, which arises from inter-institutional data variability, can cause training instability and degrade model performance. Existing FL methods struggle with noise heterogeneity and the imbalance in medical data. Motivated by these challenges, we propose FedGSCA, a novel framework for enhancing robustness in noisy medical FL. FedGSCA introduces a Global Sample Selector that aggregates noise knowledge from all clients, effectively addressing noise heterogeneity and improving global model stability. Furthermore, we develop a Client Adaptive Adjustment (CAA) mechanism that combines adaptive threshold pseudo-label generation and Robust Credal Labeling Loss. CAA dynamically adjusts to class distributions, ensuring the inclusion of minority samples and carefully managing noisy labels by considering multiple plausible labels. This dual approach mitigates the impact of noisy data and prevents overfitting during local training, which improves the generalizability of the model. We evaluate FedGSCA on one real-world colon slides dataset and two synthetic medical datasets under various noise conditions, including symmetric, asymmetric, extreme, and heterogeneous types. The results show that FedGSCA outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, excelling in extreme and heterogeneous noise scenarios. Moreover, FedGSCA demonstrates significant advantages in improving model stability and handling complex noise, making it well-suited for real-world medical federated learning scenarios."
