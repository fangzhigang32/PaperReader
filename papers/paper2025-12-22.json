It is determined by measuring a theoretically well-known process, which, ideally, can be computed with arbitrary precision in the perturbation theory. However, yet undiscovered new physics could give a non-negligible contribution to the cross section of the luminosity monitoring process, thus invalidating the uncertainty determination of measured quantities. We assess the theoretical error of non-Standard Model origin to the small-angle Bhabha scattering in various future colliders scenarios. In addition, a possible running strategy to constrain unknown heavy interactions is proposed, relying on asymmetries that do not depend on the absolute luminosity."

    "abstract": "Predicting ground state energies of quantum many-body systems is one of the central computational challenges in quantum chemistry, physics, and materials science. Krylov subspace methods, such as Krylov Quantum Diagonalization and Sample-based Krylov Quantum Diagonalization, are promising approaches for this task on near-term quantum computers. However, both require repeated quantum circuit executions for each Krylov subspace and for every new Hamiltonian, posing a major bottleneck under noisy hardware constraints. We introduce Generative Krylov Subspace Representations (GenKSR), a framework that learns a classical generative representation of the entire Krylov diagonalization process. To enable effective modeling of quantum systems, GenKSR leverages a conditional generative model framework. We investigate two representative backbone architectures, the standard Transformer and the Mamba state-space model. By learning the distribution of measurement outcomes conditioned on Hamiltonian parameters and evolution time, GenKSR generates Krylov subspace samples for unseen Hamiltonians and for larger subspace dimensions than those used in training. This enables full energy reconstruction purely from the classical model, without additional quantum experiments. We validate our approach through simulations of 15-qubit 1D and 16-qubit 2D Heisenberg models, as well as a hardware experiment on a 20-qubit XXZ chain executed on an IBM quantum processor. Our model successfully learns the distribution from experimental data and generates a high-fidelity representation of the quantum process. This representation enables classical reproduction of experimental outcomes, supports reliable energy estimates for unseen Hamiltonians, and significantly reduces the need for further quantum computation."

A principal relies on an agent who privately exerts costly due diligence effort and then recommends whether to invest. Outcomes are observable ex post even when an opportunity is declined, allowing compensation to reward both successful investments and prudent decisions to pass. We characterize profit maximizing contracts that induce information acquisition and truthful reporting. We show that three tier contracts are sufficient, with payments contingent on the agent's recommendation and the realized return. In symmetric environments satisfying the monotone likelihood ratio property, the optimal contract further simplifies to a threshold contract that pays only when the recommendation is aligned with an extreme realized return. These results provide guidance for performance based compensation that promotes diligent screening while limiting excessive risk taking."

To reduce repetitive data collection, we present Real2Edit2Real, a framework that generates new demonstrations by bridging 3D editability with 2D visual data through a 3D control interface. Our approach first reconstructs scene geometry from multi-view RGB observations with a metric-scale 3D reconstruction model. Based on the reconstructed geometry, we perform depth-reliable 3D editing on point clouds to generate new manipulation trajectories while geometrically correcting the robot poses to recover physically consistent depth, which serves as a reliable condition for synthesizing new demonstrations. Finally, we propose a multi-conditional video generation model guided by depth as the primary control signal, together with action, edge, and ray maps, to synthesize spatially augmented multi-view manipulation videos. Experiments on four real-world manipulation tasks demonstrate that policies trained on data generated from only 1-5 source demonstrations can match or outperform those trained on 50 real-world demonstrations, improving data efficiency by up to 10-50x. Moreover, experimental results on height and texture editing demonstrate the framework's flexibility and extensibility, indicating its potential to serve as a unified data generation framework."

A challenge in these studies is experimental design, specifically, determining the optimal pairs to compare to maximize statistical efficiency. Constructing static experimental designs for these studies requires spectral decomposition of a covariance matrix over pairs of pairs, which becomes computationally infeasible for studies with more than approximately 150 objects. We propose a scalable method based on reduced basis decomposition that bypasses explicit construction of this matrix, achieving computational savings of two to three orders of magnitude. We establish eigenvalue bounds guaranteeing approximation quality and characterise the rank structure of the design matrix. Simulations demonstrate speedup factors exceeding 100 for studies with 64 or more objects, with negligible approximation error. We apply the method to construct designs for a 452-region spatial study in under 7 minutes and enable real-time design updates for classroom peer assessment, reducing computation time from 15 minutes to 15 seconds."

    "abstract": "Contemporary GUI agents, while increasingly capable due to advances in Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), often operate with a critical limitation: they treat each task in isolation, lacking a mechanism to systematically learn from past successes. This digital ''amnesia'' results in sub-optimal performance, repeated errors, and poor generalization to novel challenges. To bridge this gap, we introduce EchoTrail-GUI, a novel framework designed to mimic human-like experiential learning by equipping agents with a dynamic, accessible memory. Our framework operates in three distinct stages. First, during Experience Exploration, an agent autonomously interacts with GUI environments to build a curated database of successful task trajectories, validated by a reward model. Crucially, the entire knowledge base construction is thus fully automated, requiring no human supervision. Second, in the Memory Injection stage, upon receiving a new task, our system efficiently retrieves the most relevant past trajectories to serve as actionable ''memories''. Finally, during GUI Task Inference, these memories are injected as in-context guidance to inform the agent's reasoning and decision-making process. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on benchmarks including Android World and AndroidLab. The results show that EchoTrail-GUI significantly improves the task success rate and operational efficiency of baseline agents, validating the power of structured memory in creating more robust and intelligent GUI automation."

    "abstract": "Purpose: Surgical workflow recognition enables context-aware assistance and skill assessment in computer-assisted interventions. Despite recent advances, current methods suffer from two critical challenges: prediction jitter across consecutive frames and poor discrimination of ambiguous phases. This paper aims to develop a stable framework by selectively propagating reliable historical information and explicitly modeling uncertainty for hard sample enhancement. Methods: We propose a dual-pathway framework DSTED with Reliable Memory Propagation (RMP) and Uncertainty-Aware Prototype Retrieval (UPR). RMP maintains temporal coherence by filtering and fusing high-confidence historical features through multi-criteria reliability assessment. UPR constructs learnable class-specific prototypes from high-uncertainty samples and performs adaptive prototype matching to refine ambiguous frame representations. Finally, a confidence-driven gate dynamically balances both pathways based on prediction certainty. Results: Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on AutoLaparo-hysterectomy with 84.36% accuracy and 65.51% F1-score, surpassing the second-best method by 3.51% and 4.88% respectively. Ablations reveal complementary gains from RMP (2.19%) and UPR (1.93%), with synergistic effects when combined. Extensive analysis confirms substantial reduction in temporal jitter and marked improvement on challenging phase transitions. Conclusion: Our dual-pathway design introduces a novel paradigm for stable workflow recognition, demonstrating that decoupling the modeling of temporal consistency and phase ambiguity yields superior performance and clinical applicability."

Machine learning (ML) is an emerging tool that is useful in drawing valuable science out of incomprehensibly large datasets, identifying complex trends in data that are otherwise overlooked. Moreover, ML can potentially enhance the quality and quantity of scientific data as it is collected. This paper explores how a new ML method can improve the rate of classification of rare Ic-BL supernovae (SNe). New parameters called magnitude rates were introduced to train ML models to identify SNe Ic-BL in large datasets. The same methodology was applied to a population of SN Ia transients to see if the methodology could be reproducible with another SN class. Three magnitudes, three time differences, two magnitude rates and the second derivative of these rates were calculated using the first three available photometric data points in a single filter. Initial investigations show that the Random Forest algorithm provides a strong foundation for the early classifications SNe Ic-BL and SNe Ia. Testing this model again on an unseen dataset shows that the model can identify upward of 13% of the total true SN Ic-BL population, significantly improving upon current methods. By implementing a dedicated observation campaign using this model, the number of SN Ic-BL classified and the quality of early-time data collected each year will see considerable growth in the near future."

We implement generation, detection, and testing on Llama 2 7B, and evaluate true-positive rate, false-positive rate, and text quality.

Existing methods often lack adaptability to dynamic conditions and fail to optimize decision making in real time. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid reinforcement learning framework integrating Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for enhanced spoilage prediction. This hybrid architecture captures temporal dependencies within sensor data, enabling robust and adaptive decision making. In alignment with interpretable artificial intelligence principles, a rule-based classifier environment is employed to provide transparent ground truth labeling of spoilage levels based on domain-specific thresholds. This structured design allows the agent to operate within clearly defined semantic boundaries, supporting traceable and interpretable decisions. Model behavior is monitored using interpretability-driven metrics, including spoilage accuracy, reward-to-step ratio, loss reduction rate, and exploration decay. These metrics provide both quantitative performance evaluation and insights into learning dynamics. A class-wise spoilage distribution visualization is used to analyze the agents decision profile and policy behavior. Extensive evaluations on simulated and real-time hardware data demonstrate that the LSTM and RNN based agent outperforms alternative reinforcement learning approaches in prediction accuracy and decision efficiency while maintaining interpretability. The results highlight the potential of hybrid deep reinforcement learning with integrated interpretability for scalable IoT-based food monitoring systems."

    "abstract": "Remote sensing image change detection is one of the fundamental tasks in remote sensing intelligent interpretation. Its core objective is to identify changes within change regions of interest (CRoI). Current multimodal large models encode rich human semantic knowledge, which is utilized for guidance in tasks such as remote sensing change detection. However, existing methods that use semantic guidance for detecting users' CRoI overly rely on explicit textual descriptions of CRoI, leading to the problem of near-complete performance failure when presented with implicit CRoI textual descriptions. This paper proposes a multimodal reasoning change detection model named ReasonCD, capable of mining users' implicit task intent. The model leverages the powerful reasoning capabilities of pre-trained large language models to mine users' implicit task intents and subsequently obtains different change detection results based on these intents. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that the model achieves excellent change detection performance, with an F1 score of 92.1\\% on the BCDD dataset. Furthermore, to validate its superior reasoning functionality, this paper annotates a subset of reasoning data based on the SECOND dataset. Experimental results show that the model not only excels at basic reasoning-based change detection tasks but can also explain the reasoning process to aid human decision-making."

    "abstract": "Irreversibility implies a preferred flow of time, yet special relativity denies the existence of a preferred clock. This tension has long obstructed the formulation of a relativistic master equation: standard Markovian approximations either break Lorentz covariance, trigger catastrophic vacuum heating, or depend arbitrarily on the observer's foliation. In this work, we derive a Lorentz-invariant description of irreversibility for quantum fields. We take an approach that explicitly models the measurements required to observe irreversible dynamics. Instead of evolving the system along an abstract geometric time parameter, we anchor the dynamics to a physical, relational scalar clock field. Using a relational Tomonaga-Schwinger framework, we derive a local, non-Markovian master equation that is manifestly covariant and completely positive. We show that the finite resolution of the physical clock acts as a covariant regulator, preventing the vacuum instability that plagues white-noise models. This framework demonstrates that a consistent relativistic theory of decay exists, provided the reference frame is treated as a dynamical quantum resource rather than a gauge choice. In a gravitating context, the resulting dynamics is described by a hybrid classical-quantum (CQ) evolution that remains completely positive and trace preserving (CPTP)."

In this work, we adopt a realistic assumption of IRS-induced time delay for physical layer security (PLS) enhancement. We consider an indoor VLC system where an IRS is used to shape the channel so that the reflected signals add constructively at the legitimate user and create intersymbol interference at eavesdroppers located inside the coverage area. The resulting secrecy capacity maximisation over the IRS element allocation is formulated as a complex combinatorial optimisation problem and is solved using deep reinforcement learning with proximal policy optimisation (PPO). The approach is evaluated for both colluding eavesdroppers, which combine their received signals, and non-colluding eavesdroppers, which act independently. Simulation results are shown for various simulation setups, which demonstrate significant secrecy capacity gains. In a worst-case scenario, where the eavesdroppers have stronger channels than the legitimate user, the proposed PPO-based IRS allocation improves secrecy capacity by 107\\% and 235\\% in the colluding and non-colluding cases, respectively, compared with allocating all IRS elements to the legitimate user.

    "abstract": "Whole Slide Images (WSIs) are typically analyzed using multiple instance learning (MIL) methods. However, the scale and heterogeneity of WSIs generate highly redundant and dispersed information, making it difficult to identify and integrate discriminative signals. Existing MIL methods either fail to discard uninformative cues effectively or have limited ability to consolidate relevant features from multiple patches, which restricts their performance on large and heterogeneous WSIs. To address this issue, we propose DeltaMIL, a novel MIL framework that explicitly selects semantically relevant regions and integrates the discriminative information from WSIs. Our method leverages the gated delta rule to efficiently filter and integrate information through a block combining forgetting and memory mechanisms. The delta mechanism dynamically updates the memory by removing old values and inserting new ones according to their correlation with the current patch. The gating mechanism further enables rapid forgetting of irrelevant signals. Additionally, DeltaMIL integrates a complementary local pattern mixing mechanism to retain fine-grained pathological locality. Our design enhances the extraction of meaningful cues and suppresses redundant or noisy information, which improves the model's robustness and discriminative power. Experiments demonstrate that DeltaMIL achieves state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, for survival prediction, DeltaMIL improves performance by 3.69\\% using ResNet-50 features and 2.36\\% using UNI features. For slide-level classification, it increases accuracy by 3.09\\% with ResNet-50 features and 3.75\\% with UNI features.

    "abstract": "The holographic product formula is used to determine the general form taken by holographic spectral functions in the near-extremal hydrodynamic regime, with energy $ω$, momentum $k$ and temperature $T$ much smaller than a hard scale $μ$. The resulting expressions simplify in the extremal limit $T \\ll ω,k\\ll μ$, for which the low-temperature gapless modes and the IR conformal behavior factorize. In some cases, this factorization extends to the general near-extremal regime $ω,k,T\\llμ$ at leading order in $T/μ$. Several examples are discussed with different types of gapless modes and IR CFTs, including new numerical results for low temperature quasi-normal modes. We end with a concrete application that shows how the inclusion of the IR conformal behavior improves the description of the spectral function at low energies."

In MPC, $M$ machines with per-machine memory $S$ hold a partition of the input graph, in NCC, each node knows its full neighborhood but can send/receive only a bounded number of $C$ words per round. We are particularly interested in the strongly sublinear regime where $S=C=n^δ$ for some constant $0 < δ<1$. Our goal is determine when round-preserving simulations between these models are possible and when they are not, when total memory and total bandwidth $SM=nC$ in both models are matched, for different problem families and graph classes. On the positive side, we provide techniques that allow us to replicate the specific behavior regarding input representation, number of machines and local memory from one model to the other to obtain simulations with only constant overhead. On the negative side, we prove simulation impossibility results, which show that the limitations of our simulations are necessary."

Furthermore, star-forming galaxies dominate the low-mass end of the total GSMF, whereas passive galaxies mainly shape the intermediate-to-high-mass regime. (ii) The GSMF of central galaxies dominates the high-mass end, whereas satellites and ungrouped galaxies shape the intermediate-to-low-mass regime. Additionally, we find a relative increase in the abundance of low-mass galaxies moving from dense group environments to isolated systems. (iii) More massive halos host more massive galaxies, have a higher fraction of passive systems, and show a steeper decline in the number of intermediate-mass galaxies. Finally, our results reveal larger differences between passive and star-forming GSMFs than predicted by a phenomenological quenching model, but generally confirm the environmental quenching trends for centrals and satellites reported in other works."

As sensor networks grow in scale and complexity, identifying the most informative sensors becomes essential to reduce deployment costs without compromising monitoring quality. While Graph Signal Processing (GSP) has shown promise by leveraging spatial correlations among sensor nodes, conventional approaches often overlook the temporal dynamics of structural behavior. To overcome this limitation, we propose Time-Vertex Machine Learning (TVML), a novel framework that integrates GSP, time-domain analysis, and machine learning to enable interpretable and efficient sensor placement by identifying representative nodes that minimize redundancy while preserving critical information. We evaluate the proposed approach on two bridge datasets for damage detection and time-varying graph signal reconstruction tasks. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing SHM systems by providing a robust, adaptive, and efficient solution for sensor placement."

We demonstrate that neck-pinch singularities correspond to zero-amplitude nodes in the spinor field, suggesting a mechanism for analytic continuation without curvature blow-up. The flow minimizes a spinorial Dirichlet energy monotonically and distinguishes between spherical and toroidal topologies via the existence of parallel versus Killing spinors. This work provides an analytically regularized approach to geometric flows that aims to preserve topological information while navigating through metric singularities."

    "abstract": "Understanding and monitoring the socio-economic impacts of climate hazards requires extracting structured information from heterogeneous news articles on a large scale. To that end, we have developed CienaLLM, a modular framework based on schema-guided Generative Information Extraction. CienaLLM uses open-weight Large Language Models for zero-shot information extraction from news articles, and supports configurable prompts and output schemas, multi-step pipelines, and cloud or on-premise inference. To systematically assess how the choice of LLM family, size, precision regime, and prompting strategy affect performance, we run a large factorial study in models, precisions, and prompt engineering techniques. An additional response parsing step nearly eliminates format errors while preserving accuracy; larger models deliver the strongest and most stable performance, while quantization offers substantial efficiency gains with modest accuracy trade-offs; and prompt strategies show heterogeneous, model-specific effects. CienaLLM matches or outperforms the supervised baseline in accuracy for extracting drought impacts from Spanish news, although at a higher inference cost. While evaluated in droughts, the schema-driven and model-agnostic design is suitable for adapting to related information extraction tasks (e.g., other hazards, sectors, or languages) by editing prompts and schemas rather than retraining. We release code, configurations, and schemas to support reproducible use."

To address this, we developed Think2Seg-RS, a decoupled framework that trains an LVLM prompter to control a frozen Segment Anything Model (SAM) via structured geometric prompts. Through a mask-only reinforcement learning objective, the LVLM learns to translate abstract semantic reasoning into spatially grounded actions, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the EarthReason dataset. Remarkably, the learned prompting policy generalizes zero-shot to multiple referring segmentation benchmarks, exposing a distinct divide between semantic-level and instance-level grounding. We further found that compact segmenters outperform larger ones under semantic-level supervision, and that negative prompts are ineffective in heterogeneous aerial backgrounds. Together, these findings establish semantic-level reasoning segmentation as a new paradigm for geospatial understanding, opening the way toward unified, interpretable LVLM-driven Earth observation.

    "abstract": "As the CMOS technology enters nanometer scales, integrated circuits (ICs) become increasingly sensitive to radiation-induced soft errors, which can corrupt the state of storage elements and cause severe reliability issues. Many hardened designs have been proposed to mitigate soft errors by using filtering elements. However, existing filtering elements only protect their inputs against soft errors and leave their outputs unprotected. Therefore, additional filtering elements must be added to protect outputs, resulting in extra overhead. In this paper, we first propose a novel Output-Split C-element (OSC) to protect both its input and output nodes, and then a novel LOw-COst single-node-upset (SNU) self-resilient latch (LOCO) to use OSCs to achieve both soft error resilience and low overhead. The usage of OSCs effectively reduce the short-circuit current of the LOCO latch during switching activities. Furthermore, the usage of clock gating and high-speed path reduces power consumption and delay, respectively. Compared with state-of-the-art SNU-resilient hardened designs, the LOCO latch achieves 19% fewer transistors, 63.58% lower power, 74% less delay, and 92% lower power-delay-product (PDP) on average. In addition, the LOCO latch exhibits better stability under variations in PVT (Process, Voltage, and Temperature)."

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) has recently emerged as a revolutionary approach to collaborative training Machine Learning models. In particular, it enables decentralized model training while preserving data privacy, but its distributed nature makes it highly vulnerable to a severe attack known as Data Poisoning. In such scenarios, malicious clients inject manipulated data into the training process, thereby degrading global model performance or causing targeted misclassification. In this paper, we present a novel defense mechanism called GShield, designed to detect and mitigate malicious and low-quality updates, especially under non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data scenarios. GShield operates by learning the distribution of benign gradients through clustering and Gaussian modeling during an initial round, enabling it to establish a reliable baseline of trusted client behavior. With this benign profile, GShield selectively aggregates only those updates that align with the expected gradient patterns, effectively isolating adversarial clients and preserving the integrity of the global model. An extensive experimental campaign demonstrates that our proposed defense significantly improves model robustness compared to the state-of-the-art methods while maintaining a high accuracy of performance across both tabular and image datasets. Furthermore, GShield improves the accuracy of the targeted class by 43\\% to 65\\% after detecting malicious and low-quality clients."

They can act as quasi-particles that can be generated, manipulated and annihilated, and hold promise for future memory and logic devices. As of now, all-optical stochastic nucleation of skyrmion ensembles, mostly in small applied magnetic fields, has been shown. However, to research their true potential, the ability to selectively toggle switch individual single skyrmions would be highly beneficial. In this paper, we demonstrate the field-free optical control of single stable skyrmions via single femtosecond laser pulses with diameters down to 175 nm, containing a fixed chirality. By engineering ferrimagnetic Co/Gd-based multilayers, we resolve the competition between deterministic and stochastic processes, and thereby overcome the challenge of optically writing and annihilating sub-micron skyrmions on demand. Our work is envisioned to fuel applications of skyrmion-based applications and opens up further endeavors in research related to the behaviour of more complicated skyrmion-based textures."

    "abstract": "Blazars are a class of active galactic nuclei, supermassive black holes located at the centres of distant galaxies characterised by strong emission across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves to gamma rays. Their relativistic jets, closely aligned to the line of sight from Earth, are a rich and complex environment, characterised by the presence of strong magnetic fields over parsec-scale lengths. Owing to their cosmological distance from Earth, these sources serve as ideal targets to probe non-standard gamma-ray propagation. In particular, axion-like particles (ALPs) could be detected through their coupling to photons, which enables ALP-photon conversions in external magnetic fields, leading to distinct signatures in the blazars' gamma-ray spectra. In this work, we explore a novel approach to constrain the ALP parameter space using gamma-ray observations, based on the use of machine-learning classifiers. We apply this technique to simulated observations of two bright blazars -- Mrk 501 and PKS 2155$-$304 -- with the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), a next-generation gamma-ray facility well suited to probe such features, thanks to its improved energy resolution and point-source sensitivity with respect to present ground-based gamma-ray telescopes. The obtained $2σ$ exclusion regions on the ALP parameter space are consistent with those found by applying a standard likelihood-ratio test, and suggest that the CTAO sensitivity to ALPs could be extended beyond existing constraints over a wide mass range."

The estimation relies on measurements from Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) mounted on both systems, assuming there is a suitable communication channel to exchange data, together with visual information provided by an onboard monocular camera, from which the bearing (line-of-sight direction) to the platform's center and the normal vector of its planar surface are extracted. We propose a cascade observer with a complementary filter on SO(3) to reconstruct the relative attitude, followed by a linear Riccati observer for relative position and velocity estimation. Convergence of both observers is established under persistently exciting conditions, and the cascade is shown to be almost globally asymptotically and locally exponentially stable. We further extend the design to the case where the platform's rotation is restricted to its normal axis and show that its measured linear acceleration can be exploited to recover the remaining unobservable rotation angle. A sufficient condition to ensure local exponential convergence in this setting is provided. The performance of the proposed observers is validated through extensive simulations."

In the simplest implementation, the valence quarks are assumed to form a symmetric triangular configuration. We find that variations in these geometric structures significantly influence the t-slope of the coherent cross section. In particular, the rotational degree of freedom strongly affects the cross section at t > 0.5 GeV^2, while the small-t region remains largely insensitive to variations in this parameter."

Doing the same for a fast-rotator in the habitable zone of a G-class star would be prohibitively challenging.

This results in a new definition of the Brakke flow, as that of a space-time measure which satisfies the Brakke inequality in a distributional sense. Each such space-time measure corresponds to a class of equivalent (classical) Brakke flows, thus yielding an equivalence between the classical definitions of the Brakke flow, and this new definition.

Although the overall effect of individual perturbers is generally weak, the combined gravitational influence of the full multi-planet configuration produces a modest contraction of the outer stable radius, notably for \\texttt{TRAPPIST-1 b} and \\texttt{TRAPPIST-1 e}. For each of the seven planets, the outer stability limit for satellites is at 40-45\\% of the Hill radius, consistent with previous work.

This raises a basic question: is there a general, modality-agnostic way to quantify how acquisition itself preserves or destroys the information that downstream learners could use? Here we propose an acquisition-level scalar $ΔS_{\\mathcal B}$ based on instrument-resolved phase space. Unlike pixelwise distortion or purely spectral errors that often saturate under aggressive undersampling, $ΔS_{\\mathcal B}$ directly quantifies how acquisition mixes or removes joint space--frequency structure at the instrument scale. We show theoretically that \\(ΔS_{\\mathcal B}\\) correctly identifies the phase-space coherence of periodic sampling as the physical source of aliasing, recovering classical sampling-theorem consequences. Empirically, across masked image classification, accelerated MRI, and massive MIMO (including over-the-air measurements), $|ΔS_{\\mathcal B}|$ consistently ranks sampling geometries and predicts downstream reconstruction/recognition difficulty \\emph{without training}. In particular, minimizing $|ΔS_{\\mathcal B}|$ enables zero-training selection of variable-density MRI mask parameters that matches designs tuned by conventional pre-reconstruction criteria. These results suggest that phase-space entropy at acquisition reflects downstream learnability, enabling pre-training selection of candidate sampling policies and as a shared notion of information preservation across modalities."

In addition, we obtain several results on root strings in the super setting, analogous to those of Billig and Pianzola, and show that graded embeddings arise as root generated subalgebras associated with linearly independent $π$-systems."

    "abstract": "Perception research is increasingly modelled using streetscapes, yet many approaches still rely on pixel features or object co-occurrence statistics, overlooking the explicit relations that shape human perception. This study proposes a three stage pipeline that transforms street view imagery (SVI) into structured representations for predicting six perceptual indicators. In the first stage, each image is parsed using an open-set Panoptic Scene Graph model (OpenPSG) to extract object predicate object triplets. In the second stage, compact scene-level embeddings are learned through a heterogeneous graph autoencoder (GraphMAE). In the third stage, a neural network predicts perception scores from these embeddings. We evaluate the proposed approach against image-only baselines in terms of accuracy, precision, and cross-city generalization. Results indicate that (i) our approach improves perception prediction accuracy by an average of 26% over baseline models, and (ii) maintains strong generalization performance in cross-city prediction tasks. Additionally, the structured representation clarifies which relational patterns contribute to lower perception scores in urban scenes, such as graffiti on wall and car parked on sidewalk. Overall, this study demonstrates that graph-based structure provides expressive, generalizable, and interpretable signals for modelling urban perception, advancing human-centric and context-aware urban analytics."

    "abstract": "This study investigates the paradigm of intraoperative analgesic dosage using a data-driven approach based on retrospective clinical data. Remifentanil, an analgesic widely used during anesthesia, presents a dosing challenge due to the absence of an universally accepted indicator of analgesia. To examine how changes in patient state correlate with adjustments in remifentanil target concentration triggered by the practitioner, we analyzed data from two sources: VitalDB (Seoul, Korea) and PREDIMED (Grenoble, France). Results show that only features derived from arterial pressure are consistently associated with changes in remifentanil targets. This finding is robust across both datasets despite variations in specific thresholds. In particular, increases in remifentanil targets are associated with high or rising arterial pressure over short periods (1--2 minutes), whereas decreases are linked to low, stable, or declining arterial pressure over longer periods (5--7 minutes). By capturing anesthesiologists' dosing strategies we provide a foundation for the future development of closed-loop control algorithms. Beyond the specific example of remifentanil's change prediction, the proposed feature generation and associated sparse fitting approach can be applied to other domain where human decision can be viewed as sensors interpretation."

Our analysis spans quiescent, high, and pre-eruption dip states. We find that brightening amplitudes increase toward shorter wavelengths in both optical and UV bands, while the UV and X-ray fluxes are generally anti-correlated throughout all phases. During the 2023-2024 pre-eruption dip, soft and hard X-rays increased as optical and ultraviolet (UV) brightness declined, consistent with a transition from an optically thick to thin boundary layer driven by a reduction in the accretion rate. We also report, for the first time, a second, lower-amplitude dip occurring between September 2024 and February 2025 following the primary 2023-2024 pre-eruption dip. The observed variability supports an accretion-variation scenario as a unifying explanation for both the high and dip states, and may signal an imminent nova eruption."

    "abstract": "Despite the abundance of benchmark problems for optimization algorithms, there is a notable scarcity of such problems in multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO). To address this gap, we introduce a novel methodology that enables the transformation of any optimization problem with a known solution into an equivalent MDO problem. This equivalence holds for a large class of coupling functions, including non-linear ones. The proposed methodology exploits a ''link function'' that effectively eliminates the coupling variables from the MDO problem, without influencing the solution. This approach allows for the creation of benchmark problems with reference solutions, facilitating the comparison and evaluation of various MDO algorithms. Moreover, it is adaptable to scalable optimization problems, where the dimensions of the search and constraint spaces can be configured. We also present a variant tailored to linear coupling functions with constant coefficients sampled independently at random, for which we derive a closed-form solution to the coupling equations. For the sake of illustration, we put our approach into action on a multidimensional Rosenbrock problem, varying the number of disciplines and design variable sizes. This example showcases the versatility and applicability of our methodology in generating benchmark problems for MDO."

    "abstract": "Neural code models have been increasingly incorporated into software development processes. However, their susceptibility to backdoor attacks presents a significant security risk. The state-of-the-art understanding focuses on injection-based attacks, which insert anomalous patterns into software code. These attacks can be neutralized by standard sanitization techniques. This status quo may lead to a false sense of security regarding backdoor attacks. In this paper, we introduce a new kind of backdoor attacks, dubbed Semantically-Equivalent Transformation (SET)-based backdoor attacks, which use semantics-preserving low-prevalence code transformations to generate stealthy triggers. We propose a framework to guide the generation of such triggers. Our experiments across five tasks, six languages, and models like CodeBERT, CodeT5, and StarCoder show that SET-based attacks achieve high success rates (often >90%) while preserving model utility. The attack proves highly stealthy, evading state-of-the-art defenses with detection rates on average over 25.13% lower than injection-based counterparts. We evaluate normalization-based countermeasures and find they offer only partial mitigation, confirming the attack's robustness. These results motivate further investigation into scalable defenses tailored to SET-based attacks."

    "abstract": "Accurate characterization of hippocampal substructure is crucial for detecting subtle structural changes and identifying early neurodegenerative biomarkers. However, high inter-subject variability and complex folding pattern of human hippocampus hinder consistent cross-subject and longitudinal analysis. Most existing approaches rely on subject-specific modelling and lack a stable intrinsic coordinate system to accommodate anatomical variability, which limits their ability to establish reliable inter- and intra-individual correspondence. To address this, we propose HippMetric, a skeletal representation (s-rep)-based framework for hippocampal substructural morphometry and point-wise correspondence across individuals and scans. HippMetric builds on the Axis-Referenced Morphometric Model (ARMM) and employs a deformable skeletal coordinate system aligned with hippocampal anatomy and function, providing a biologically grounded reference for correspondence. Our framework comprises two core modules: a skeletal-based coordinate system that respects the hippocampus' conserved longitudinal lamellar architecture, in which functional units (lamellae) are stacked perpendicular to the long-axis, enabling anatomically consistent localization across subjects and time; and individualized s-reps generated through surface reconstruction, deformation, and geometrically constrained spoke refinement, enforcing boundary adherence, orthogonality and non-intersection to produce mathematically valid skeletal geometry. Extensive experiments on two international cohorts demonstrate that HippMetric achieves higher accuracy, reliability, and correspondence stability compared to existing shape models."

    "abstract": "Einstein's equations of General Relativity form a highly nonlinear system, so most exact solutions rely on symmetry assumptions. Spherically symmetric spacetimes have been particularly important, providing a tractable yet physically rich setting. Despite extensive study, many open questions remain, especially regarding the physical interpretation of perfect fluid solutions. Many such solutions were derived without a specified equation of state or under restrictive or non-physical assumptions, limiting their physical relevance. The aim of this thesis is to study the physical viability of spherically symmetric perfect fluid solutions, with extensions to plane and hyperbolic symmetries. The first part reviews the hydrodynamic approach, which interprets a perfect fluid energy-momentum tensor as a fluid in local thermal equilibrium. Interpretations as a generic ideal gas, a classical ideal gas, and fluids with transport coefficients are analysed. The framework is extended to the ultrarelativistic Synge gas, and methods to approximate its equation of state are developed. These results are applied to three families of solutions: T-models, geodesic R-models with flat synchronisation, and thermodynamic Stephani universes. For each family, general expressions for the fluid flow, energy density, pressure, speed of sound, and admissible thermodynamic schemes are obtained. Physical viability is assessed using standard energy, positivity, and compressibility conditions, with emphasis on compatibility with a generic ideal gas. In all cases, wide spacetime regions are found where the solutions represent physically admissible perfect fluids. The thesis concludes with xIdeal, a Mathematica package implementing IDEAL algorithms for the analysis of exact solutions, including spacetime characterisations, a metric database, and examples."

By treating the toroidal limit as a perturbation from an analytical cylindrical solution, we demonstrate that these equilibria align well with the inviscid magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) description. Using the aspect ratio as a perturbation parameter, we compute particle trajectories sampled from the kinetic equilibrium distribution, confirming the overall stability of the solutions. However, under burning plasma conditions, chaotic dynamics emerge for particles with supra-thermal and even thermal energies. This destroys the adiabatic invariance of the magnetic moment. The exact consequences are unclear, but they could undermine the foundational assumptions of gyrokinetic modelling in burning plasmas. Nevertheless, these results suggest the possibility of unaccounted transport losses in future burning plasma operations. The interplay between turbulence and energetic particles in the presence of Hamiltonian chaos certainly warrants further investigation."

This imbalance causes traditional evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, to often overstate model performance in these conditions, masking failures on minority attack classes that are most important in practice. In this paper, we evaluate a set of base and meta classifiers on low-traffic attacks in the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 dataset and compare their reliability in terms of accuracy and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC). The results show that accuracy consistently inflates performance, while MCC provides a more accurate assessment of a classifier's performance across both majority and minority classes. Meta-classification methods, such as LogitBoost and AdaBoost, demonstrate more effective minority class detection when measured by MCC, revealing trends that accuracy fails to capture. These findings establish the need for imbalance-aware evaluation and make MCC a more trustworthy metric for IDS research involving low-traffic cyberattacks."

Such examples arise, for example in models of opinion dynamics, where a small number of leaders (influencers) can steer the behaviour of a large population of followers. In this context, we study a partial mean-field limit where the number of followers tends to infinity, while the number of leaders stays constant. The partial mean-field limit dynamics is then given by a McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equation (SDE) for the followers, coupled to a controlled Itô-SDE governing the dynamics of the lead agents. For a given cost functional that the lead agents seek to minimise, we show that the unique optimal control of the finite agent system convergences to the optimal control of the limiting system. This establishes that the low-dimensional control of the partial (mean-field) system provides an effective approximation for controlling the high-dimensional finite agent system. In addition, we propose a stochastic gradient descent algorithm that can efficiently approximate the mean-field control. Our theoretical results are illustrated on opinion dynamics model with lead agents, where the control objective is to drive the followers to reach consensus in finite time."

In addition, we study how the nanometric thickness of the suspended film and its material impact the detectivity of such sensors. It is found that the blackbody-related photon noise limit of the detectivity can be surpassed with thin films. These results emphasize pathways for improvements of thermal-radiation detectors."

The study evaluates the ability of each model to reproduce the observed expansion history of the Universe through a joint statistical assessment based on the chi-squared statistics, Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC), and Bayes factor. While both models yield acceptable fits, $Λ$CDM consistently attains lower information-criterion values and higher likelihood, indicating a superior overall performance. An examination of the redshift evolution of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ and the deceleration parameter $q(z)$ shows that $Λ$CDM naturally captures the transition from early-time deceleration to late-time acceleration, where as $R_h=ct$ predicts a strictly linear expansion. We also estimate the age of the Universe within both models, finding that $Λ$CDM prediction agrees with the Planck 2018 result, while the linear expansion in $R_h=ct$ leads to an older cosmic age. Recent JWST observations of unexpectedly mature high-redshift galaxies have reopened the discussion regarding whether the Universe may be older than implied by the standard model; although these results remain under active investigation, they underscore that fully resolving cosmic evolution may require refinements beyond the concordance paradigm."

Our case study analyses 8,924 R package repositories on GitHub, examining commits and communications. Our quantitative findings show that researchers, alongside non-affiliated contributors, are the most frequent owners of R package repositories and their most active contributors. Researchers are more likely to hold official roles compared to the average, and to engage in collaborative problem-solving and support work during package development. This means there is, underneath the 'recognised' category of star researchers who transition between academia and industry and secure generous funding, an 'unrecognised' category of researchers who not only create and maintain key statistical infrastructure, but also provide support to industry employees, for no remuneration. Our qualitative findings show how this unrecognised labour affects practitioners. Finally, our analysis of the ideology and practice of free, libre and open source software (FLOSS) shows how this ideology and practice legitimate the use of 'university rents' by Big Tech."

In recent years, many dedicated detectors have been developed for such scenarios which are designed to extend the sensitivity to weakly coupled particles with macroscopic $cτ$. In this work, we investigate the LLP signatures of the neutral component of the fermiophobic fiveplet $H_5^0$ in the Georgi-Machacek model. Due to its fermiophobic nature at tree level, it possesses suppressed decay widths in the low mass region and can naturally be long-lived over a wide region of parameter space. We show that $H_5^0$ can be produced with an appreciable flux in the forward region from the meson decay through loop-induced couplings leading to observable LLP signatures in forward detectors. We evaluate the sensitivity of representative forward detectors to this scenario and compare the result with existing constraints from terrestrial experiments and astrophysical observations. Our results demonstrate that the forward detectors can probe the $s_H$ down to $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-5})$ for sub-GeV scalar masses, and hence providing a powerful and complementary probe of the extended Higgs sectors that is inaccessible to conventional searches."

Precisely, we investigate chaos through the topological horseshoes associated with the first, second, and third return maps, obtained by varying the amplitude of an external force term while keeping all other parameters fixed. Our new finding demonstrates that, when the force amplitude exceeds a certain value, the topological (Smale) horseshoe degenerates into a pseudo-horseshoe, while chaotic invariant set persists. This phenomenon indicates that the lower bound of the topological entropy decreases as the force amplitude increases, thereby enriching the dynamics in the perturbed Duffing system. Furthermore, we identify a critical value of the force amplitude governing the attractivity of the chaotic invariant set. For amplitudes slightly below this value, the basin of attraction of the chaotic invariant set progressively shrinks as the amplitude increases. In contrast, for larger amplitudes, both Lyapunov exponents become negative while the topological horseshoe persists, suggesting that the chaotic invariant set loses attractivity as the amplitude grows."

    "abstract": "The unusual properties of GW231123, including component masses within the pair-instability mass gap ($137^{+22}_{-17}\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ and $103^{+20}_{-52}\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ at 90\\% credible intervals) and extremely large spins near the Kerr limit, have challenged standard formation scenarios. While gravitational lensing has been proposed as an explanation, current millilensing studies suggest the signal consists of three overlapping images, a configuration that exceeds the predictions of the isolated point-mass lens model. In this work, we investigate a binary lens model embedded within a strong lensing galaxy. This is the simplest model that not only naturally produces the observed number of images but also aligns with the fact that microlensing objects usually reside in galaxies. To overcome the high computational cost of the diffraction integral required for wave optics, we constructed a Transformer-based neural network that accurately generates lensing waveforms within milliseconds per waveform. Using the NRSur7dq4 waveform model, we find primary and secondary lens masses of $714^{+239}_{-309} \\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ and $87^{+139}_{-73} \\mathrm{M}_\\odot$, respectively. We also find a strong lensing magnification of $5.56^{+2.78}_{-1.98}$ (at 90\\% credible intervals) and a Bayes factor of $\\log_{10}B^\\mathrm{Binary}_\\mathrm{Single}\\simeq1.34$. This result underscores the necessity of considering multi-body and environmental effects in microlensing studies. More crucially, under this embedded binary lens interpretation, the inferred source-frame binary black hole masses ($80.0^{+21.3}_{-14.4} \\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ and $62.0^{+19.8}_{-29.4} \\mathrm{M}_\\odot$) and spins ($0.37^{+0.51}_{-0.33}$ and $0.40^{+0.52}_{-0.35}$) shift to values consistent with the current population constrained from O1--O3."

    "abstract": "Despite the remarkable success of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in generative tasks, we observe that they exhibit a counterintuitive deficiency in the zero-shot multimodal retrieval task. In this work, we investigate the underlying mechanisms that hinder MLLMs from serving as effective retrievers. With the help of sparse autoencoders (SAEs), we decompose MLLM output representations into interpretable semantic concepts to probe their intrinsic behavior. Our analysis reveals that the representation space of MLLMs is overwhelmingly dominated by textual semantics; the visual information essential for multimodal retrieval only constitutes a small portion. This imbalance is compounded by the heavy focus of MLLMs on bridging image-text modalities, which facilitates generation but homogenizes embeddings and finally diminishes the discriminative power required for multimodal retrieval. We further discover that the specific feature components that contribute most to the similarity computations for MLLMs are in fact distractors that actively degrade retrieval performance. Overall, our work provides the first in-depth interpretability analysis of MLLM representations in the context of multimodal retrieval and offers possible directions for enhancing the multimodal retrieval capabilities of MLLMs."

The vertical directions of camera views can be easily obtained using inertial measurement units (IMUs) which have been widely used in autonomous vehicles, mobile phones, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Given the known vertical directions, our lgorithms only need to solve for two rotation angles and two translation vectors. In this paper, a linear closed-form solution has been described, requiring only four point correspondences in three views. We also propose a minimal solution with three point correspondences using the latest Gröbner basis solver. Since the proposed methods require fewer point correspondences, they can be efficiently applied within the RANSAC framework for outliers removal and pose estimation in visual odometry. The proposed method has been tested on both synthetic data and real-world scenes from KITTI. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the estimated poses is superior to other alternative methods."

Meanwhile, recent 2D Gaussian Splatting (GS) methods (\\textit{e.g.}, GaussianImage) offer promising alternatives through efficient primitive-based rendering. However, these methods require excessive Gaussian primitives to maintain high visual fidelity. To exploit the potential of GS-based approaches, we present GaussianImage++, which utilizes limited Gaussian primitives to achieve impressive representation and compression performance. Firstly, we introduce a distortion-driven densification mechanism. It progressively allocates Gaussian primitives according to signal intensity. Secondly, we employ context-aware Gaussian filters for each primitive, which assist in the densification to optimize Gaussian primitives based on varying image content. Thirdly, we integrate attribute-separated learnable scalar quantizers and quantization-aware training, enabling efficient compression of primitive attributes. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. In particular, GaussianImage++ outperforms GaussianImage and INRs-based COIN in representation and compression performance while maintaining real-time decoding and low memory usage."

    "abstract": "Topology and geometry are deeply intertwined in the study of surfaces, though their interaction manifests differently in smooth and discrete settings. In the smooth category, a classical result asserts that any closed smooth surface embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ with constant Gaussian curvature must be a sphere, reflecting the strong rigidity of differential geometry. In contrast, the discrete setting, where curvature is represented as an angular defect concentrated at vertices, admits far greater flexibility. For instance, a flat torus can be realised as a polyhedral surface in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ with zero curvature at every vertex. We establish a general result: any closed surface, whether orientable or non-orientable and of arbitrary genus, can be realised in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ as a (possibly self-intersecting) polyhedral surface in which every vertex has the same angular defect. This highlights a fundamental distinction between discrete and smooth settings, showing that curvature constraints in the discrete realm impose fewer restrictions. Our proof is constructive and, once recognised, entirely elementary. Yet this fundamental fact appears to have gone unnoticed in the existing literature."

However, quality of the raw sensing data may degrade in occluded or distant regions, undermining the fidelity of constructed BEV map. In this paper, we propose BEVCooper, a novel collaborative perception framework that can guarantee accurate and low-latency BEV map construction. We first define an effective metric to evaluate the utility of BEV features from neighboring CAVs. Then, based on this, we develop an online learning-based collaborative CAV selection strategy that captures the ever-changing BEV feature utility of neighboring vehicles, enabling the ego CAV to prioritize the most valuable sources under bandwidth-constrained vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) links. Furthermore, we design an adaptive fusion mechanism that optimizes BEV feature compression based on the environment dynamics and real-time V2V channel quality, effectively balancing feature transmission latency and accuracy of the constructed BEV map. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that, BEVCooper achieves asymptotically optimal CAV selection and adaptive feature fusion under dynamic vehicular topology and V2V channel conditions. Extensive experiments on real-world testbed show that, compared with state-of-the-art benchmarks, the proposed BEVCooper enhances BEV perception accuracy by up to $63.18\\%$ and reduces end-to-end latency by $67.9\\%$, with only $1.8\\%$ additional computational overhead."

As an alternative, modified teleparallel gravity theories such as $f(T)$ gravity offer a purely geometric mechanism to explain cosmic acceleration. In this work, we construct a plane-symmetric anisotropic cosmological model in the framework of exponential $f(T)$ gravity, adopting the functional form $f(T) = T + u e^{-vT}$. A key novelty of this study is that the Hubble function $H(z)$ is derived self-consistently from the field equations rather than being prescribed phenomenologically. Furthermore, we provide the first comprehensive observational test of an anisotropic $f(T)$ model using a combination of DESI, gravitational-wave (GW) data, and complementary datasets including OHD, CMB, and Pantheon+SH0ES. Our best-fit analysis yields $70 \\lesssim H_0 \\lesssim 73~\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}\\,Mpc^{-1}}$, $0.28 \\lesssim Ω_m \\lesssim 0.34$, and $-0.99 \\lesssim ω\\lesssim -0.69$, all consistent with current late-time cosmological observations. The model accurately reproduces the distance modulus of Type Ia supernovae and the luminosity-distance relation from gravitational-wave standard sirens. These results demonstrate that the proposed anisotropic exponential $f(T)$ model can account for the observed cosmic acceleration without invoking a dark-energy component, thereby offering a novel and observationally consistent framework for studying anisotropic extensions of gravity."

The magnitude of this conductivity is comparable to that of GaAs despite silicon's much weaker spin-orbit coupling, and its robustness against NIR photon energy rules out a spin-polarization-based origin, which occurs only in the vicinity of the bandgap.

Traditional detection methods that rely solely on high-confidence identity links suffer from limited coverage, while approaches using all available linkages often result in fragmented graphs with reduced clustering effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based fraud detection framework that addresses the challenge of large-scale heterogeneous graph clustering through a principled link transformation approach. Our method distinguishes between \\emph{hard links} (high-confidence identity relationships such as phone numbers, credit cards, and national IDs) and \\emph{soft links} (behavioral associations including device fingerprints, cookies, and IP addresses). We introduce a graph transformation technique that first identifies connected components via hard links, merges them into super-nodes, and then reconstructs a weighted soft-link graph amenable to efficient embedding and clustering. The transformed graph is processed using LINE (Large-scale Information Network Embedding) for representation learning, followed by HDBSCAN (Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) for density-based cluster discovery. Experiments on a real-world payment platform dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves significant graph size reduction (from 25 million to 7.7 million nodes), doubles the detection coverage compared to hard-link-only baselines, and maintains high precision across identified fraud clusters. Our framework provides a scalable and practical solution for industrial-scale fraud detection systems."

Unlike traditional backdoors that only change classes, 6DoF attacks must control continuous parameters like translation and rotation, rendering 2D methods inapplicable. We propose 6DAttack, a framework using 3D object triggers to induce controlled erroneous poses while maintaining normal behavior. Evaluations on PVNet, DenseFusion, and PoseDiffusion across LINEMOD, YCB-Video, and CO3D show high attack success rates (ASRs) without compromising clean performance. Backdoored models achieve up to 100% clean ADD accuracy and 100% ASR, with triggered samples reaching 97.70% ADD-P. Furthermore, a representative defense remains ineffective.

Gravitational waves can resonantly excite the drumhead modes of the ion crystal, particularly the parity-odd modes.

Furthermore, gravitational wave detection beyond the standard quantum limit becomes possible as a squeezed spin state is generated through this entanglement. The sensitivity gets better with a larger ions crystals as well as a larger number of the ions.

The dark sector couples to the visible sector only via gravity, and we analyze two unavoidable channels: (i) inflaton condensate annihilation, $φ+φ\\to X+X$, and (ii) thermal scatterings, ${\\rm SM}+{\\rm SM}\\to X+X$, both mediated by graviton exchange. Working in the Fierz-Pauli framework for a free massive spin-2 field of mass $m_2$, we derive the graviton-mediated amplitudes and perform a full helicity decomposition of the final state. The relic abundance is obtained analytically in terms of $m_2$ and the reheating temperature $T_{\\rm RH}$. In the light mass regime $m_2 \\ll m_φ$ (with $m_φ$ the inflaton mass during oscillations), production is overwhelmingly dominated by the longitudinal (helicity-0) mode: the $2\\to2$ cross section is parametrically enhanced, scaling as $\\sim (m_φ/m_2)^4$, and yields efficient dark matter production despite purely gravitational couplings. Compared to lower-spin cases (spin-$0$, $1/2$, $1$, and $3/2$), massive spin-$2$ production is substantially more efficient for the same reheating history. Over most of the parameter space the inflaton condensate channel dominates the yield, while the thermal contribution is negligible. Avoiding overproduction typically requires either a relatively low $T_{\\rm RH}$ or a spin-$2$ mass near threshold, $m_2 \\lesssim m_φ$. This places the spin-$2$ portal on similar footing to other higher spins in reheating scenarios, while emphasizing the central role of the helicity-$0$ mode and the reheating history in setting the dark matter density."

    "abstract": "With the press of global climate change, extreme weather and sudden weather changes are becoming increasingly common. To maintain a comfortable indoor environment and minimize the contribution of the building to climate change as much as possible, higher requirements are placed on the operation and control of HVAC systems, e.g., more energy-efficient and flexible to response to the rapid change of weather. This places demands on the rapid modeling and prediction of zone air temperatures of buildings. Compared to the traditional simulation-based approach such as EnergyPlus and DOE2, a hybrid approach combined physics and data-driven is more suitable. Recently, the availability of high-quality datasets and algorithmic breakthroughs have driven a considerable amount of work in this field. However, in the niche of short- and long-term predictions, there are still some gaps in existing research. This paper aims to develop a time series forecast model to predict the zone air temperature in a building located in America on a 2-week horizon. The findings could be further improved to support intelligent control and operation of HVAC systems (i.e. demand flexibility) and could also be used as hybrid building energy modeling."

    "abstract": "The proliferation of IoT devices and their reliance on Wi-Fi networks have introduced significant security vulnerabilities, particularly the KRACK and Kr00k attacks, which exploit weaknesses in WPA2 encryption to intercept and manipulate sensitive data. Traditional IDS using classifiers face challenges such as model overfitting, incomplete feature extraction, and high false positive rates, limiting their effectiveness in real-world deployments. To address these challenges, this study proposes a robust multiclass machine learning based intrusion detection framework. The methodology integrates advanced feature selection techniques to identify critical attributes, mitigating redundancy and enhancing detection accuracy. Two distinct ML architectures are implemented: a baseline classifier pipeline and a stacked ensemble model combining noise injection, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and meta learning to improve generalization and reduce false positives. Evaluated on the AWID3 data set, the proposed ensemble architecture achieves superior performance, with an accuracy of 98%, precision of 98%, recall of 98%, and a false positive rate of just 2%, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. This work demonstrates the efficacy of combining preprocessing strategies with ensemble learning to fortify network security against sophisticated Wi-Fi attacks, offering a scalable and reliable solution for IoT environments. Future directions include real-time deployment and adversarial resilience testing to further enhance the model's adaptability."

    "abstract": "Developers often struggle to specify correct training labels and rewards. Perhaps they don't need to. We propose recontextualization, which reduces how often language models \"game\" training signals, performing misbehaviors those signals mistakenly reinforce. We show recontextualization prevents models from learning to 1) prioritize evaluation metrics over chat response quality; 2) special-case code to pass incorrect tests; 3) lie to users; and 4) become sycophantic. Our method works by generating completions from prompts discouraging misbehavior and then recontextualizing them as though they were in response to prompts permitting misbehavior. Recontextualization trains language models to resist misbehavior even when instructions permit it. This mitigates the reinforcement of misbehavior from misspecified training signals, reducing specification gaming without improving the supervision signal."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in agentic systems, where their interactions with diverse tools and environments create complex, multi-stage safety challenges. However, existing benchmarks mostly rely on static, single-turn assessments that miss vulnerabilities from adaptive, long-chain attacks. To fill this gap, we introduce DREAM, a framework for systematic evaluation of LLM agents against dynamic, multi-stage attacks. At its core, DREAM uses a Cross-Environment Adversarial Knowledge Graph (CE-AKG) to maintain stateful, cross-domain understanding of vulnerabilities. This graph guides a Contextualized Guided Policy Search (C-GPS) algorithm that dynamically constructs attack chains from a knowledge base of 1,986 atomic actions across 349 distinct digital environments. Our evaluation of 12 leading LLM agents reveals a critical vulnerability: these attack chains succeed in over 70% of cases for most models, showing the power of stateful, cross-environment exploits. Through analysis of these failures, we identify two key weaknesses in current agents: contextual fragility, where safety behaviors fail to transfer across environments, and an inability to track long-term malicious intent. Our findings also show that traditional safety measures, such as initial defense prompts, are largely ineffective against attacks that build context over multiple interactions. To advance agent safety research, we release DREAM as a tool for evaluating vulnerabilities and developing more robust defenses."

We present an efficient and systematically evaluated defense architecture that mitigates these threats through a lightweight, multi-stage pipeline. Its core component is a semantic filter based on text normalization, TF-IDF representations, and a Linear SVM classifier. Despite its simplicity, this module achieves 93.4% accuracy and 96.5% specificity on held-out data, substantially reducing attack throughput while incurring negligible computational overhead. Building on this efficient foundation, the full pipeline integrates complementary detection and mitigation mechanisms that operate at successive stages, providing strong robustness with minimal latency. In comparative experiments, our SVM-based configuration improves overall accuracy from 35.1% to 93.4% while reducing average time to completion from approximately 450s to 47s, yielding over 10 times lower latency than ShieldGemma. These results demonstrate that the proposed design simultaneously advances defensive precision and efficiency, addressing a core limitation of current model-based moderators. Evaluation across a curated corpus of over 30,000 labeled prompts, including benign, jailbreak, and application-layer injections, confirms that staged, resource-efficient defenses can robustly secure modern LLM-driven applications."

    "abstract": "We investigate a natural extension of the standard $Λ$CDM framework, the $Ω_1Ω_2$-$Λ$CDM model, in which the total energy density of the universe is expanded in powers of $1+z$. This parameterization recovers the standard $Λ$CDM scenario and introduces two additional, observationally testable contributions to the dark energy sector, $Ω_1(1+z)$ and $Ω_2(1+z)^2$, alongside the cosmological constant. Using Planck CMB and DESI BAO data, we find that this framework is suitable for relaxing the Hubble tension. The Planck CMB data alone allow substantial freedom in late-time dynamics, yielding $H_0 = 75.4^{+3.9}_{-2.3}\\;\\mathrm{km\\;s^{-1}\\;Mpc^{-1}}$, fully consistent with distance-ladder measurements from the SH0ES collaboration. When DESI BAO data are included in the analysis, the late-time expansion history becomes more tightly anchored, reducing the $H_0$ discrepancy to $\\sim 2.5σ$ level. This highlights the limited constraining power of currently available low-redshift data measurements, especially in the context of the $Ω_1Ω_2$-$Λ$CDM model, where dynamical dark energy dominates the background expansion over a relatively large redshift range. The model naturally exhibits a smooth quintessence--phantom transition followed by asymptotic de Sitter behavior of the dark energy equation of state, alters late-time cosmic dynamics, and preserves standard early-universe physics. Overall, our results demonstrate that controlled late-time deviations from $Λ$CDM can improve cosmological concordance."

Furthermore, the generated code frequently suffers from poor modularity, making it difficult to maintain. To bridge this gap, we introduce Modular Layout Synthesis (MLS), a hierarchical framework that merges visual understanding with structural normalization. Initially, a visual-semantic encoder maps the screen capture into a serialized tree topology, capturing the essential layout hierarchy. Instead of simple parsing, we apply heuristic deduplication and pattern recognition to isolate reusable blocks, creating a framework-agnostic schema. Finally, a constraint-based generation protocol guides the LLM to synthesize production-ready code with strict typing and component props. Evaluations show that MLS significantly outperforms existing baselines, ensuring superior code reusability and structural integrity across multiple frameworks"

The region was observed by the JCMT SCUBA-2/POL-2 polarimeter. The filament has a line mass (~80 Msun/pc) larger than the critical (magnetic) line mass (~37 Msun/pc); and hosts one starless, three prestellar, and four protostellar cores, with masses in the range 0.13 to 9.13 Msun. The mean (debiased) polarisation fraction of the filament and core pixels was calculated to be 5.3+/-0.3% and 3.2+/-0.3%, respectively, likely reflecting their distinct physical conditions. The polarisation fraction for the cores does not depend on the type of core, and was found to decrease with increasing column density, varying from 6-11% at the filament edges to 1$^{+0.7}_{-0.1}$% in the denser parts ($N_{H2}\\gtrsim$2x10$^{22}$cm$^{-2}$). Magnetic field orientation of the protostellar cores, in contrast to prestellar cores, appears to be relatively aligned with the magnetic field orientation of the local filament in this region. Using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi formalism the plane-of-sky magnetic field strength for the protostellar cores (~39-110 microG) was found to be higher than that of the prestellar cores (~22-61 microG); and weakest for the starless core (~6 microG). The average value for the filament was found to be ~31 microG. The magnetic field-volume density relation for the prestellar/starless cores and protostellar cores suggests a transition from weak field case to strong field case as the cores evolve from prestellar to protostellar phase."

We exploit Vogel spirals, an aperiodic geometry where a single parameter dictates spatial correlations, to show how correlation strength reshapes the modal spectrum and transient dynamics of near-field coupling. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate that aperiodic configurations outperform both uncorrelated (random) and periodic arrays in controlling near-field radiative heat-transfer dynamics. These results establish deterministic aperiodic order as a powerful platform for tailoring correlated electromagnetic responses in next-generation nanophotonic devices."

Additionally, we extend single-round strategy imitation to multiple rounds to better capture players' potential non-rational behavior. Using intensive simulations, we explore the effects of transition probabilities and game parameters on game transitions and cooperation. Our study finds that strategy-driven game transitions promote cooperation, and increasing the transition rates of Markov decision chains can significantly accelerate this process. By designing different Markov decision chains, these results provide simulation based guidance for practical applications in swarm intelligence, such as strategic collaboration."

This paper bridges this gap by presenting a novel framework that unlocks a realistic performance analysis for FAS-RIS systems with finite elements. Leveraging a Gamma distribution approximation, we derive a new, tractable closed-form expression for the outage probability. Numerical results validate our approach, demonstrating that it offers a significantly more accurate performance characterization than conventional CLT-based methods, particularly in the practical regime of small-scale RIS.

This limitation leads to ``Semantic-Visual Dissonance,'' where accurate facial geometry clashes with the input's unique atmosphere, causing an unnatural ``sticker-like'' effect. We propose **DVI (Disentangled Visual-Identity)**, a zero-shot framework that orthogonally disentangles identity into fine-grained semantic and coarse-grained visual streams. Unlike methods relying solely on semantic vectors, DVI exploits the inherent statistical properties of the VAE latent space, utilizing mean and variance as lightweight descriptors for global visual atmosphere. We introduce a **Parameter-Free Feature Modulation** mechanism that adaptively modulates semantic embeddings with these visual statistics, effectively injecting the reference's ``visual soul'' without training. Furthermore, a **Dynamic Temporal Granularity Scheduler** aligns with the diffusion process, prioritizing visual atmosphere in early denoising stages while refining semantic details later. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DVI significantly enhances visual consistency and atmospheric fidelity without parameter fine-tuning, maintaining robust identity preservation and outperforming state-of-the-art methods in IBench evaluations."

Here, we present a Sagnac-loop integrated system (SLIS) that, for the first time, combines ring-based quantum key distribution (QKD) with fiber-based weak measurement (WM) enhanced sensing and disturbance localization capabilities. In the event of communication interruption due to external disturbances, the SLIS seamlessly switches to perception system, employing interference measurement and WM techniques to monitor channel disturbances. By integrating null-frequencies localization (NFL) mode, the system precisely determines the disturbance location, enabling rapid identification of security vulnerabilities along the link. Experimental results demonstrate that, over a 30 km Sagnac loop channel, the SLIS achieves a raw key generation rate of 22.4 kbps with stable operation and clear scalability toward network expansion. In terms of perception performance, the SLIS exhibits strong capability for both dynamic and quasi-static disturbances. For dynamic perturbations, the system detects transient impacts and PZT-driven frequency variations down to 100 Hz, and enables long-distance localization via NFL alignment, with improved localization performance as the disturbance position moves farther away along the loop. For quasi-static disturbances, gravitational changes as small as 100 g are resolved, corresponding to a time-delay variation of 9.81 as. This work provides a novel technical pathway toward self-diagnosing, robust quantum networks through integrated communication and sensing functionalities."

However, many quantum algorithms require deep quantum circuits, which are challenging to implement on current noisy devices. To address this limitation, variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have been actively developed, enabling practical quantum computing in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. Among them, the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) stands out as a leading approach for solving problems in quantum chemistry, many-body physics, and even integer factorization. The VQE algorithm can be implemented on various quantum hardware platforms, including photonic systems, quantum dots, trapped ions, neutral atoms, and superconducting circuits. In particular, photonic platforms offer several advantages: they operate at room temperature, exhibit low decoherence, and support multiple degrees of freedom, making them suitable for scalable, high-dimensional quantum computation. Here we present methodologies for realizing VQE on photonic systems, highlighting their potential for practical quantum computing. We first provide a theoretical overview of the VQE framework, focusing on the procedure for variationally estimating ground state energies. We then explore how photonic systems can implement these processes, showing that a wide variety of problems can be addressed using either multiple qubit states or a single qudit state."

Due to limitations in available data and increased learning complexity, previous methods tend to ignore hand motions, limiting the realism and expressivity of the interactions. Additionally, current diffusion-based approaches generate entire motion sequences simultaneously, limiting their ability to capture the reactive and adaptive nature of human interactions. To address these limitations, we introduce Interact2Ar, the first end-to-end text-conditioned autoregressive diffusion model for generating full-body, human-human interactions. Interact2Ar incorporates detailed hand kinematics through dedicated parallel branches, enabling high-fidelity full-body generation. Furthermore, we introduce an autoregressive pipeline coupled with a novel memory technique that facilitates adaptation to the inherent variability of human interactions using efficient large context windows. The adaptability of our model enables a series of downstream applications, including temporal motion composition, real-time adaptation to disturbances, and extension beyond dyadic to multi-person scenarios. To validate the generated motions, we introduce a set of robust evaluators and extended metrics designed specifically for assessing full-body interactions.

In the excitonic regime of a realistic model of Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$, the third order 2DCS signals are strongly enhanced by the condensate's amplitude and phase modes, with negligible contributions from single-particle excitations. In the linear optical response, in contrast, single-particle and collective-mode contributions overlap. With increasing electron-phonon coupling, the amplitude mode contribution to 2DCS initially remains robust, but then drops rapidly and remains small in the phonon-dominated regime -- even in systems with large order parameter. 2DCS also aids the detection of the massive relative phase mode, which is analogous to the Leggett mode in superconductors. Our analysis, based on the time-dependent Hartree-Fock approach, demonstrates that 2DCS can track the emergence of the symmetry-broken state and the crossover from Coulomb-driven to phonon-driven order."

In this paper, we present an innovative optimal-coupling-observer-based framework that rejects the impact of bounded sensor attacks in a network of connected and automated vehicles from safety and comfort point of view. We demonstrate its performance in car following with cooperative adaptive cruise control for platoons with redundant distance and velocity sensors. The error dynamics are formulated as a Linear Time Variant (LTV) system, resulting in complex stability conditions that are investigated using a Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) approach guaranteeing global asymptotic stability. We prove the capability of the framework to secure occupants' safety and comfort in the presence of bounded attacks. In the onset of attack, the framework rapidly detects attacked sensors and switches to the most reliable observer eliminating attacked sensors, even with modest attack magnitudes. Without our proposed method, severe (but bounded) attacks result in collisions and major discomfort. With our method, attacks had negligible effects on motion comfort evaluated using ISO-2631 Ride Comfort and Motion Sickness indexes. The results pave the path to bring comfort to the forefront of AVs security."

    "abstract": "Generating long-range, geometrically consistent video presents a fundamental dilemma: while consistency demands strict adherence to 3D geometry in pixel space, state-of-the-art generative models operate most effectively in a camera-conditioned latent space. This disconnect causes current methods to struggle with occluded areas and complex camera trajectories. To bridge this gap, we propose WorldWarp, a framework that couples a 3D structural anchor with a 2D generative refiner. To establish geometric grounding, WorldWarp maintains an online 3D geometric cache built via Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). By explicitly warping historical content into novel views, this cache acts as a structural scaffold, ensuring each new frame respects prior geometry. However, static warping inevitably leaves holes and artifacts due to occlusions. We address this using a Spatio-Temporal Diffusion (ST-Diff) model designed for a \"fill-and-revise\" objective. Our key innovation is a spatio-temporal varying noise schedule: blank regions receive full noise to trigger generation, while warped regions receive partial noise to enable refinement. By dynamically updating the 3D cache at every step, WorldWarp maintains consistency across video chunks. Consequently, it achieves state-of-the-art fidelity by ensuring that 3D logic guides structure while diffusion logic perfects texture.

About 20 to 50 patent entries are embedded on each page, arranged in a double-column format and printed in Gothic and Roman fonts. The font and layout complexity of our primary source material suggests to us that multimodal LLMs are a paradigm shift in how datasets are constructed in economic history. We open-source our benchmarking and patent datasets as well as our LLM-based data pipeline, which can be easily adapted to other image corpora using LLM-assisted coding tools, lowering the barriers for less technical researchers. Finally, we explain the economics of deploying LLMs for historical dataset construction and conclude by speculating on the potential implications for the field of economic history."

In this framework, the Bethe-root distribution of the associated quantum field theory yields an Abelian differential of the second kind on the elliptic Riemann surface specified by the spectral endpoints, a structure central to the algebro-geometric theory of solitons. The semiclassical parameter is identified with the large-rank limit of the internal symmetry group ($O(2N)$) of the underlying quantum field theory (the Gross-Neveu model with a chemical potential). Our analysis indicates that the analytic structure of the spectrum is dictated solely by the Dynkin diagram ($D_N$) and its large-rank limit ($D_\\infty$), independently of the particular integrable model used to realize it."

    "abstract": "The emergence of commercial satellite communications networks, such as Starlink and OneWeb, has significantly transformed the communications landscape over the last years. As a complement to terrestrial cellular networks, non-terrestrial systems enable coverage extension and reliability enhancement beyond the limits of conventional infrastructure. Currently, the high reliance on terrestrial networks exposes communications to vulnerabilities in the event of terrestrial infrastructure failures, e.g., due to natural disasters. Therefore, this work proposes the joint evaluation of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for two non-terrestrial satellite networks (Starlink and OneWeb) and two terrestrial cellular networks to assess the current performance of these technologies across three different environments: (i) urban, (ii) suburban, and (iii) forest scenarios. Additionally, multi-connectivity techniques are explored to determine the benefits in connectivity when two technologies are used simultaneously. For instance, the outage probability of Starlink and OneWeb in urban areas is reduced from approximately 12-21\\% to 2\\% when both solutions are employed together. Finally, the joint analysis of KPIs in both terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks demonstrates that their integration enhances coverage, improves performance, and increases reliability, highlighting the benefits of combining satellite and terrestrial systems in the analyzed environments."

    "abstract": "Circuit knitting is a family of techniques that enables large quantum computations on limited-size quantum devices by decomposing a target circuit into smaller subcircuits. However, it typically incurs a measurement overhead exponential in the number of cut locations, and it remains open whether this scaling is fundamentally unavoidable. In conventional circuit-cutting approaches based on the quasiprobability decomposition (QPD), for example, rescaling factors lead to an exponential dependence on the number of cuts. In this work, we show that such an exponential scaling is not universal: it can be circumvented for tree-structured quantum circuits via concatenated quantum tomography protocols. We first consider estimating the expectation value of an observable within additive error $ε$ for a tree-structured circuit with tree depth 1 (two layers), maximum branching factor $R$, and bond dimension at most $d$ on each edge. Our approach uses quantum tomography to construct, for each cut edge, a local decomposition that eliminates the rescaling factors in conventional QPD, instead introducing a controllable bias set by the tomography sample size. After cutting $R$ edges, we show that $\\mathcal{O}(d^3R^3\\ln(dR)/ε^2)$ total measurements suffice, including tomography cost. Next, we extend the tree-depth-1 case to general trees of depth $L\\geq2$, and give an algorithm whose total measurement cost $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(d^3K^{5}/ε^2)$ scales polynomially with the number of cuts for complete $R$-ary trees. Finally, we perform an information-theoretic analysis to show that, in a comparable tree-depth-1 setting, conventional QPD-based wire-cutting methods require at least $Ω((d+1)^R/ε^2)$ measurements. This exponential separation highlights the significance of tomography-based construction for reducing measurement overhead in hybrid quantum-classical computations."

In this paper, we address this issue and discover features aligned with Human and Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs) responses by studying statistical and machine learning metrics. Furthermore, we show that instructing GPTs to employ metrics used by Human can improve their judgment and conforming them better with human responses."

Decoherence is considered to be the most popular mechanism responsible for the emergence of classicality from quantum mechanics. The issue of formulating a measure of decoherence is addressed here. The approach taken here is that decoherence results from the entanglement of a quantum system with certain environment degrees of freedom, and quantifying this entanglement should yield the most natural measure of decoherence. A simple measure of decoherence is presented based on this notion, and it is examined for various example systems. The measure proves to be effective and is relatively straightforward to compute. In addition, a method has been proposed to measure decoherence in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer."

Modeled by chemical master equations, these processes are inherently stochastic, as fluctuations dominate deterministic order at mesoscopic scales. These classic many-body processes suffer from the so-called curse of high dimensionality, which makes exact mathematical descriptions exponentially expensive to compute. The exponential cost renders the study of the thermodynamic properties of such systems out of equilibrium intractable and forces approximations of system noise or assumptions of continuous particle numbers. Here, we use tensor networks to numerically explore the thermodynamics of chemical processes by directly solving the ensemble solution of the chemical master equation with efficient (sub-exponential) computational cost. We provide accurate estimates of the entropy production rate, heat flux, chemical work, and nonequilibrium thermodynamic potentials, free from sampling errors or mean-field approximations. We illustrate our results through a dissipative self-assembly model. In this way, we show how tensor networks can inform the design of efficient chemical processes in previously unattainable regimes."

While algorithms to compute ground states with quantum computers have been heavily investigated, algorithms to compute topological invariants in a quantum computer are still under active development. Here we demonstrate a quantum circuit to compute the many-body topological invariant of a second-order topological quantum magnet encoded in qubits. Our algorithm relies on a quantum circuit adiabatic evolution in transverse paths in parameter space, and we uncover hidden topological invariants depending on the traversed path.

    "abstract": "The two-stage stochastic unit commitment problem has become an important tool to support decision-making under uncertainty in power systems. Representing the uncertainty by a large number of scenarios guarantees accurate results but challenges the solution process. One way to overcome this is by using scenario reduction methods, which aim at finding a distribution supported on fewer scenarios, but leading to similar optimal first-stage decisions. In this paper, we recap the classical scenario reduction theory based on the distance of probability distributions and the optimal mass transportation problem. We then review and compare various formulations of the underlying cost function of the latter used in the literature. Using the Forward Selection Algorithm, we show that a specific formulation of the cost function can be proven to select the best possible scenario from a given sample on the first draw with respect to the Relative Approximation Error. We demonstrate this result and compare the quality of the approximation as well as the computational performance of the different cost functions using a modified version of the IEEE RTS 24-Bus System. In many cases, we find that the optimal solution of the two-stage stochastic unit commitment problem with 200 scenarios can be approximated with around 2% scenarios when using this cost function."

However, this abundance of tabular attributes does not reflect real-world datasets, where only a subset of attributes may be available. This discrepancy calls for methods that can leverage all the tabular data during training while remaining robust to missing values at inference. To address this challenge, we propose RoVTL (Robust Vision-Tabular Learning), a framework designed to handle any level of tabular data availability, from 0% to 100%. RoVTL comprises two key stages: contrastive pretraining, where we introduce tabular attribute missingness as data augmentation to promote robustness, and downstream task tuning using a gated cross-attention module for multimodal fusion. During fine-tuning, we employ a novel Tabular More vs. Fewer loss that ranks performance based on the amount of available tabular data. Combined with disentangled gradient learning, this enables consistent performance across all tabular data completeness scenarios. We evaluate RoVTL on cardiac MRI scans from the UK Biobank, demonstrating superior robustness to missing tabular data compared to prior methods. Furthermore, RoVTL successfully generalizes to an external cardiac MRI dataset for multimodal disease classification, and extends to the natural images domain, achieving robust performance on a car advertisements dataset.

This models the phase fluctuations which remain even when the mean phase is controlled. We aim to determine whether these phase-noisy input states still form a computationally difficult problem. To do this, we use Matrix Product Operators to model the system, a technique recently used to model boson sampling scenarios. Our investigation finds that the Entanglement entropy grows linearly with the number of input states even for noisy input states. This implies that, unlike boson loss, this form of experimentally relevant noise remains difficult to simulate with tensor networks and may allow for the demonstration of quantum advantage without the need for implementing the challenging task of input-state phase stabilisation."

    "abstract": "We present a system for learning generalizable hand-object tracking controllers purely from synthetic data, without requiring any human demonstrations. Our approach makes two key contributions: (1) HOP, a Hand-Object Planner, which can synthesize diverse hand-object trajectories; and (2) HOT, a Hand-Object Tracker that bridges synthetic-to-physical transfer through reinforcement learning and interaction imitation learning, delivering a generalizable controller conditioned on target hand-object states. Our method extends to diverse object shapes and hand morphologies. Through extensive evaluations, we show that our approach enables dexterous hands to track challenging, long-horizon sequences including object re-arrangement and agile in-hand reorientation. These results represent a significant step toward scalable foundation controllers for manipulation that can learn entirely from synthetic data, breaking the data bottleneck that has long constrained progress in dexterous manipulation."

    "abstract": "Double-wall cylindrical shells are widely used in applications where resistance to acoustic shock loading is critical. While the transient vibroacoustic behavior of single-walled shells has been extensively investigated, extending these analyses to double-wall cylindrical configurations introduces increased complexity due to multiple inter-shell acoustic reflections and strong coupling between acoustic fields and structural vibrations. These structures often feature mechanical interconnections between the shells to ensure structural integrity, load sharing, alignment, and enhanced resilience against static and dynamic loads. These links introduce additional pathways for vibration transmission and significantly influence the overall behavior of the system, thus making the analytical description of the coupled vibroacoustic response even more challenging. This study investigates the transient vibroacoustics of an inter-connected double-wall cylindrical shell subjected to an acoustic shock, considering fully coupled fluid-structure interactions. A comprehensive two-dimensional acoustoelastic model is developed in polar coordinates, incorporating the surrounding medium, the fluid occupying the inter-shell gap, and the fluid inside the inner shell. A semi-analytical solution method is employed to capture the time-domain evolution of acoustic fields and shell vibrations. The model's accuracy is verified by benchmarking against available data reported in the literature. Leveraging the passive dynamics of the system, we present a hybrid mechanism that integrates optimized nonlinear vibration absorbers with piezoelectric actuators to control the vibroacoustic behavior. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid mechanism in mitigating shock-induced acoustic pressure waves and enhancing the structural resilience of the double-wall cylindrical shell."

However, a key challenge lies in their ability to generalize beyond the specific environments and conditions they were trained on, which is presently difficult and expensive to evaluate in the real-world. To address this gap, we present REALM, a new simulation environment and benchmark designed to evaluate the generalization capabilities of VLA models, with a specific emphasis on establishing a strong correlation between simulated and real-world performance through high-fidelity visuals and aligned robot control. Our environment offers a suite of 15 perturbation factors, 7 manipulation skills, and more than 3,500 objects. Finally, we establish two task sets that form our benchmark and evaluate the π_{0}, π_{0}-FAST, and GR00T N1.5 VLA models, showing that generalization and robustness remain an open challenge. More broadly, we also show that simulation gives us a valuable proxy for the real-world and allows us to systematically probe for and quantify the weaknesses and failure modes of VLAs.

Within a suitable functional framework, we establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions, and their continuous dependence on the radiation parameters. We also prove that the long-time dynamics are described by a finite-dimensional global attractor and, moreover, that the system possesses a finite set of determining modes that governs its asymptotic behaviour. In particular, we show that the long-term evolution of the ocean's temperature can be reconstructed solely from observations of the velocity fields across the model's layers."

    "abstract": "Comparative effectiveness studies using electronic health records (EHR) consider data from patients who could ``enter'' the study cohort at any point during an interval that spans many years in calendar time. Unlike treatments in tightly controlled trials, real-world treatments can evolve over calendar time, especially if comparators include standard of care, or procedures where techniques may improve. Efforts to assess whether treatment efficacy itself is changing are complicated by changing patient populations, with potential covariate shift in key effect modifiers. In this work, we propose a statistical framework to estimate calendar-time specific average treatment effects and describe both how and why effects vary across treatment initiation time in EHR-based studies. Our approach projects doubly robust, time-specific treatment effect estimates onto candidate marginal structural models and uses a model selection procedure to best describe how effects vary by treatment initiation time. We further introduce a novel summary metric, based on standardization analysis, to quantify the role of covariate shift in explaining observed effect changes and disentangle changes in treatment effects from changes in the patient population receiving treatment. Extensive simulations using EHR data from Kaiser Permanente are used to validate the utility of the framework, which we apply to study changes in relative weight loss following two bariatric surgical interventions versus no surgery among patients with severe obesity between 2005-2011."

    "abstract": "The Kerr solution is the cornerstone of General Relativity (GR) for modelling astrophysical rotating black holes and for testing GR through gravitational-wave observations and black hole imaging. Understanding how the Kerr geometry is modified in alternative theories of gravity is therefore a crucial step toward constraining possible deviations from GR. Despite their importance, exact analytical solutions describing rotating black holes in modified gravity are rare, limiting our ability to explore novel phenomenology and to design robust observational tests of new physics. In this work, we present a new exact rotating black hole solution within a specific scalar-tensor theory belonging to the Horndeski class. The solution is obtained via a disformal transformation acting on a Kerr stealth black hole. Crucially, unlike previous constructions, the disformal transformation of our chosen seed configuration preserves circularity, ensuring that many of the geometrical and physical properties that make the Kerr spacetime so compelling are retained. We refer to the resulting geometry as the Circular Disformal Kerr solution. Remarkably, key features such as the structure of Killing horizons, the ergosphere, and the absence of causality violations closely mirror those of the Kerr metric. The spacetime is algebraically general, corresponding to Petrov type I. This new exact solution therefore provides a rare example of a rotating black hole beyond GR that closely mimics the Kerr geometry, offering a valuable theoretical laboratory to investigate the phenomenology of Kerr-like black holes in modified gravity."

Traditional machine learning approaches often treat solvent identity as a discrete categorical variable, which prevents systematic interpolation and extrapolation across the solvent space. This work introduces the \\textbf{Catechol Benchmark}, a high-throughput transient flow chemistry dataset comprising 1,227 experimental yield measurements for the rearrangement of allyl-substituted catechol in 24 pure solvents and their binary mixtures, parameterized by continuous volume fractions ($\\% B$). We evaluate various architectures under rigorous leave-one-solvent-out and leave-one-mixture-out protocols to test generalization to unseen chemical environments. Our results demonstrate that classical tabular methods (e.g., Gradient-Boosted Decision Trees) and large language model embeddings (e.g., Qwen-7B) struggle with quantitative precision, yielding Mean Squared Errors (MSE) of 0.099 and 0.129, respectively. In contrast, we propose a hybrid GNN-based architecture that integrates Graph Attention Networks (GATs) with Differential Reaction Fingerprints (DRFP) and learned mixture-aware solvent encodings. This approach achieves an \\textbf{MSE of 0.0039} ($\\pm$ 0.0003), representing a 60\\% error reduction over competitive baselines and a $>25\\times$ improvement over tabular ensembles.

This is the strongest possible separation result between monotone and non-monotone arithmetic computations and improves upon all earlier results, including the seminal work of Valiant (1980) and more recently by Chattopadhyay, Datta, and Mukhopadhyay (2021). We then boot-strap this result to prove strong monotone separations for polynomials of constant degree, which solves an open problem from the survey of Shpilka and Yehudayoff (2010). * By moving to the Boolean setting, we can prove superpolynomial monotone Boolean circuit lower bounds for specific Boolean functions, which imply that all the powers of certain monotone polynomials cannot be computed by polynomially sized monotone arithmetic circuits. * We then define a collection of problems with linear-algebraic nature, which are similar to span programs, and prove monotone Boolean circuit lower bounds for them. In particular, this gives the strongest known monotone lower bounds for functions in uniform (non-monotone) $\\textbf{NC}^2$. Our construction also leads to an explicit matroid that defines a monotone function that is difficult to compute, which solves an open problem by Jukna and Seiwert (2020). Our monotone arithmetic and Boolean circuit lower bounds are based on known techniques, such as reduction from monotone arithmetic complexity to multipartition communication complexity and the approximation method for proving lower bounds for monotone Boolean circuits, but we overcome several new challenges in order to obtain efficient upper bounds using low-depth circuits."

    "abstract": "Understanding and predicting the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is fundamental for precipitation forecasting and disaster prevention. To date, long-term and accurate MJO prediction has remained a challenge for researchers. Conventional MJO prediction methods using Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) are resource-intensive, time-consuming, and highly unstable (most NWP methods are sensitive to seasons, with better MJO forecast results in winter). While existing Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methods save resources and speed forecasting, their accuracy never reaches the 28 days predicted by the state-of-the-art NWP method, i.e., the operational forecasts from ECMWF, since neural networks cannot handle climate data effectively. In this paper, we present a Domain Knowledge Embedded Spatio-Temporal Network (DK-STN), a stable neural network model for accurate and efficient MJO forecasting. It combines the benefits of NWP and ANN methods and successfully improves the forecast accuracy of ANN methods while maintaining a high level of efficiency and stability. We begin with a spatial-temporal network (STN) and embed domain knowledge in it using two key methods: (i) applying a domain knowledge enhancement method and (ii) integrating a domain knowledge processing method into network training. We evaluated DK-STN with the 5th generation of ECMWF reanalysis (ERA5) data and compared it with ECMWF. Given 7 days of climate data as input, DK-STN can generate reliable forecasts for the following 28 days in 1-2 seconds, with an error of only 2-3 days in different seasons. DK-STN significantly exceeds ECMWF in that its forecast accuracy is equivalent to ECMWF's, while its efficiency and stability are significantly superior."

At room temperature, uniaxial tensile strain increases the resistivity tensor components by a comparable magnitude both parallel and perpendicular to the strain axis. In the case of biaxial strain, up to 20~K decrease in the CCDW-NCCDW phase transition temperature is observed. In the case of uniaxial strain, a new phase with two different CCDW-NCCDW phase transition temperatures is observed, the splitting exceeds 10 K. The occurrence of such a phase is associated with the transition of the CDW into the commensurate state along the tensile strain direction while maintaining nearly commensurability along the perpendicular one. The results allow to justify various models widely used in analysis of transport properties of 1T-TaS$_2$ in commensurate and nearly commensurate states."

    "abstract": "Detecting fraud and corruption in public procurement remains a major challenge for governments worldwide. Most research to-date builds on domain-knowledge-based corruption risk indicators of individual contract-level features and some also analyzes contracting network patterns. A critical barrier for supervised machine learning is the absence of confirmed non-corrupt, negative, examples, which makes conventional machine learning inappropriate for this task. Using publicly available data on federally funded procurement in Mexico and company sanction records, this study implements positive-unlabeled (PU) learning algorithms that integrate domain-knowledge-based red flags with network-derived features to identify likely corrupt and fraudulent contracts. The best-performing PU model on average captures 32 percent more known positives and performs on average 2.3 times better than random guessing, substantially outperforming approaches based solely on traditional red flags. The analysis of the Shapley Additive Explanations reveals that network-derived features, particularly those associated with contracts in the network core or suppliers with high eigenvector centrality, are the most important. Traditional red flags further enhance model performance in line with expectations, albeit mainly for contracts awarded through competitive tenders. This methodology can support law enforcement in Mexico, and it can be adapted to other national contexts too."

Coupled tensor decomposition (CTD)-based methods have gained traction in this domain, offering recoverability guarantees under various assumptions. Existing models such as canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) and Tucker decomposition provide strong expressive power but lack physical interpretability. The block-term decomposition model with rank-$(L_r, L_r, 1)$ terms (the LL1 model) yields interpretable factors under the linear mixture model (LMM) of spectral images, but LMM assumptions are often violated in practice -- primarily due to nonlinear effects such as endmember variability (EV). To address this, we propose modeling spectral images using a more flexible block-term tensor decomposition with rank-$(L_r, M_r, N_r)$ terms (the LMN model). This modeling choice retains interpretability, subsumes CPD, Tucker, and LL1 as special cases, and robustly accounts for non-ideal effects such as EV, offering a balanced tradeoff between expressiveness and interpretability for HSR. Importantly, under the LMN model for HSI and MSI, recoverability of the SRI can still be established under proper conditions -- providing strong theoretical support. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets further validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method compared with existing CTD-based approaches."

Since DMIR processes two images simultaneously as input, the combination relationships between features has grown exponentially, ultimately the model considers more interfering features during the feature modeling process. Introducing dynamics in the receptive fields and weights of the network enable the model to eliminate the interfering features combination and model the potential feature combination relationships. In this paper, we propose the Dynamic Stream Network (DySNet), which enables the receptive fields and weights to be dynamically adjusted. This ultimately enables the model to ignore interfering feature combinations and model the potential feature relationships. With two key innovations: 1) Adaptive Stream Basin (AdSB) module dynamically adjusts the shape of the receptive field, thereby enabling the model to focus on the feature relationships with greater correlation. 2) Dynamic Stream Attention (DySA) mechanism generates dynamic weights to search for more valuable feature relationships. Extensive experiments have shown that DySNet consistently outperforms the most advanced DMIR methods, highlighting its outstanding generalization ability.

We analyze the impact of this framework on the sensitivity of axion-like particle (ALP) dark-matter searches. The results show that both birefringence and misalignment contribute to sensitivity degradation in the low-mass regime; however, the adverse effects of misalignment can be mitigated by selecting a postselection angle greater than the misalignment angle. Furthermore, birefringence produces an additional resonance peak in the high-mass region, which remains largely unaffected by misalignment and postselection variations. This rigorous framework underscores the importance of considering birefringence in high-precision optical-cavity experiments for ALP detection."

At an effective redshift $z_{\\rm eff}=1.59$ (1.58 for ELGs), the Ly$α$ bias parameters will be measured with a 10-30\\% precision, depending on priors on other tracer's biases. We also forecast a marginal $2.5σ$ ($3.7σ$) detection of the BAO feature, corresponding to a $\\sim$10\\% (7\\%) constraint on the isotropic BAO scale, from the combination of Ly$α$ auto- and Ly$α$-QSO (ELG) cross-correlations. These results show that CSST can provide the first three-dimensional characterization of the low-redshift Ly$α$ forest and a complementary Ly$α$-based BAO measurement at $z < 2$, helping to link galaxy clustering surveys with high-redshift Ly$α$ forest studies."

    "abstract": "We examine unsourced random access in a fully asynchronous setup, where active users transmit their data without restriction on the start time over a fading channel. In the proposed scheme, the transmitted signal consists of a pilot sequence and a polar codeword, with the polar codeword distributed across the data part of the packet in an on-off pattern. The receiver uses a double sliding-window decoder, where the inner window employs iterative decoding with joint timing and pilot detection, channel estimation, single-user decoding, and successive interference cancellation to recover the message bits, while the outer window enhances interference cancellation. The numerical results indicate that the proposed scheme exhibits only a slight performance loss compared to the synchronous benchmark while being more applicable in practice."

    "abstract": "Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) is a temperature-responsive polymer that undergoes large volumetric deformations through a transition from a swollen to a collapsed state at the volume phase transition temperature (VPTT). Locally, these deformations stem from the coil-to-globule transition of individual chains. In this contribution, I revisit the study of Suzuki and Ishii (\"Phase coexistence of neutral polymer gels under mechanical constraint\"), which demonstrated that a PNIPAM rod can exhibit phase coexistence (i.e. comprise swollen and collapsed domains) near the VPTT when subjected to mechanical constraints. Specifically, that paper showed that (1) collapsed domains gradually form in a fixed swollen rod with time and (2) swollen domains can nucleate in a collapsed rod that under uniaxial extension. These behaviors originate from the local thermo-mechanical response of the chains, which transition between states in response to the applied mechanical loading. Here, I develop a statistical-mechanics based framework that captures the behavior of individual chains below and above the VPTT and propose a probabilistic model based on the local chain response that sheds light on the underlying mechanisms governing phase nucleation and growth. The model is validated through comparison with experimental data. The findings from this work suggest that in addition to the classical approaches, in which the VPTT is programmed through chemical composition and network topology, the transition can be tuned by mechanical constraints. Furthermore, the proposed framework offers a pathway to actively tailor the VPTT through the exertion of mechanical forces, enabling improved control and performance of PNIPAM hydrogels in modern applications."

    "abstract": "We present a functional calculus treatment of Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT) between Gaussian measures on separable Hilbert spaces, providing a unified framework that handles infinite-dimensional degeneracy. By leveraging the notion of proper alignment and the Schur complement, we reveal that the Gaussian EOT solution operates as a precise \\textit{spectral shrinkage}: the optimal coupling is uniquely determined by contracting the spectrum of the correlation operator via a universal scalar function. This geometric insight facilitates an algorithmic shift from iterative fixed-point schemes (e.g., Sinkhorn) to direct algebraic computation, enabling efficient multi-scale analysis, where a single spectral decomposition allows for the exact evaluation of entropic costs across arbitrary regularization parameters $\\varepsilon > 0$ at negligible additional cost. Furthermore, we investigate the asymptotic behavior as $\\varepsilon \\downarrow 0$ in settings where the unregularized Optimal Transport problem admits non-unique solutions. We establish a selection principle that the regularized limit converges to the most diffusive optimal coupling --characterized as the centroid of the convex set of optimal Kantorovich plans. This demonstrates that in degenerate regimes, the entropic limit systematically rejects deterministic Monge solutions (extremal points) in favor of the optimal solution with minimal Hilbert-Schmidt correlation, effectively filtering out spurious correlations in the null space. Finally, we derive stability bounds and convergence rates, recovering established parametric rates ($\\varepsilon \\log(1/\\varepsilon)$) in finite dimensions while identifying distinct non-parametric rates dependent on spectral decay in infinite-dimensional settings."

Here, we study its emergence in unsupervised generative models through the lens of rate-distortion theory (RDT), a normative framework for understanding information processing under limited resources. We train $β$-Variational Autoencoders -- which embody key formal principles of RDT -- on synthetic images containing varying numbers of items, as commonly used in numerosity perception research. We systematically vary the encoding capacity and assess the models' sensitivity to numerosity and the robustness of the emergent numerical representations through a comprehensive set of analyses, including numerosity estimation and discrimination tasks, latent-space analysis, generative capabilities and generalization to novel stimuli. In line with RDT, we find that behavioral performance in numerosity perception and the ability to extract numerosity unconfounded by non-numerical visual features scale with encoding capacity according to a power law. At high capacity, the unsupervised model develops a robust neural code for numerical information, with performance closely approximating a supervised model explicitly trained for visual enumeration. It exhibits strong generative abilities and generalizes well to novel images, whereas at low capacity, the model shows marked deficits in numerosity perception and representation. Finally, comparison with human data shows that models trained at intermediate capacity levels span the full range of human behavioral performance while still developing a robust emergent numerical code. In sum, our results show that unsupervised generative models can develop a number sense and demonstrate that rate-distortion theory provides a powerful information-theoretic framework for understanding how capacity constraints shape numerosity perception."

We propose a novel approach to prove the well-posedness of the mean-field CBO equation based on a truncation argument. The latter is performed through the introduction of a cut-off function, defined on the space of probability measures, acting on the fields. This procedure allows us to study the well-posedness problem in the classical framework of Sznitman. Through this argument, we recover the established result on the existence of strong solutions, and we extend the class of solutions for which pathwise uniqueness holds."

The frontend assigns per-operator latency using a tile-based model that accounts for SM under-utilization and multi-level memory traffic (SRAM/ L2/ HBM), and prunes memory-infeasible configurations using an activation-liveness traversal under recomputation, parallelism and ZeRO/FDSP sharding policies.

    "abstract": "We quantify how incident acoustic energy is converted into vortical motion and viscous dissipation for a two-dimensional plane-wave passing through a slit geometry. We perform direct numerical simulations over a broad parameter space in incident sound pressure level (ISPL), Strouhal number (St), and Reynolds number (Re). Spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) yields energy-ranked coherent structures at each frequency, from which we construct mode-by-mode fields for spectral kinetic energy (KE) and viscous loss (VL) components to examine the mechanisms of acoustic absorption. At ISPL=150dB, the acoustic-hydrodynamic energy conversion is highest when the acoustic displacement amplitude is comparable to the slit thickness, corresponding to a Keulegan-Carpenter number of order unity. In this regime, the oscillatory boundary layer undergoes periodic separation, resulting in vortex shedding that dominates acoustic damping. VL accounts for 20-60% of the KE contribution. For higher acoustic frequencies, the confinement of the Stokes layer produces X-shaped near-slit modes, reducing the total energy input by approximately 50%. The influence of Re depends on amplitude. At ISPL=150dB, larger Re values correspond to suppressed broadband fluctuations and sharpened harmonic peaks. At ISPL = 120dB, the boundary layers remain attached, vortex shedding is weak, absorption monotonically scales with viscosity, and the Re- and St-dependencies become comparable. Across all conditions, more than 99% of the VL is confined to a compact region surrounding the slit mouth. The KE-VL spectra describe parameter regimes that enhance or suppress acoustic damping in slit geometries, providing a physically interpretable basis for acoustic-based design."

    "abstract": "Numerical simulation of time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) is central to scientific and engineering applications, but high-fidelity solvers are often prohibitively expensive for long-horizon or time-critical settings. Neural operator (NO) surrogates offer fast inference across parametric and functional inputs; however, most autoregressive NO frameworks remain vulnerable to compounding errors, and ensemble-averaged metrics provide limited guarantees for individual inference trajectories. In practice, error accumulation can become unacceptable beyond the training horizon, and existing methods lack mechanisms for online monitoring or correction. To address this gap, we propose ANCHOR (Adaptive Numerical Correction for High-fidelity Operator Rollouts), an online, instance-aware hybrid inference framework for stable long-horizon prediction of nonlinear, time-dependent PDEs. ANCHOR treats a pretrained NO as the primary inference engine and adaptively couples it with a classical numerical solver using a physics-informed, residual-based error estimator. Inspired by adaptive time-stepping in numerical analysis, ANCHOR monitors an exponential moving average (EMA) of the normalized PDE residual to detect accumulating error and trigger corrective solver interventions without requiring access to ground-truth solutions. We show that the EMA-based estimator correlates strongly with the true relative L2 error, enabling data-free, instance-aware error control during inference. Evaluations on four canonical PDEs: 1D and 2D Burgers', 2D Allen-Cahn, and 3D heat conduction, demonstrate that ANCHOR reliably bounds long-horizon error growth, stabilizes extrapolative rollouts, and significantly improves robustness over standalone neural operators, while remaining substantially more efficient than high-fidelity numerical solvers."

The scalar hair triggers a rapid collapse of the Einstein-Rosen bridge at the would-be Cauchy horizon.

In contrast, neither approximation arguments nor symmetry assumptions are employed in the paper to obtain a ground state solution. Instead, we develop a new direct variational approach based on minimization over a Pohožaev manifold combined with profile decomposition techniques. Finally, we show that nonradial solutions exist whenever $N \\geq 4$; in particular, this settles a previously open problem in the case $N=5$."

Here, we demonstrate in-situ control over the dominant EDSR driving mechanism of a hole-spin qubit in a silicon fin field-effect transistor by applying microwave signals to two different gate electrodes, thereby tuning the orientation of the local electric field. We measure the effective g-factor, its electrical tunability, and the Rabi frequency as functions of magnetic-field orientation. Their distinct angular dependencies, analyzed using a g-matrix formalism, allow us to identify the underlying driving processes and track their relative contributions for different drive configurations. By selecting the drive electrode, we can switch from a regime dominated by g-factor modulation to one with a strong contribution from wavefunction displacement. This in-situ tunability provides direct experimental access to both spin-driving mechanisms and offers a route toward optimized spin-qubit performance."

Here, we present Stream.FM, a frame-causal flow-based generative model with an algorithmic latency of 32 milliseconds (ms) and a total latency of 48 ms, paving the way for generative speech processing in real-time communication. We propose a buffered streaming inference scheme and an optimized DNN architecture, show how learned few-step numerical solvers can boost output quality at a fixed compute budget, explore model weight compression to find favorable points along a compute/quality tradeoff, and contribute a model variant with 24 ms total latency for the speech enhancement task. Our work looks beyond theoretical latencies, showing that high-quality streaming generative speech processing can be realized on consumer GPUs available today. Stream.FM can solve a variety of speech processing tasks in a streaming fashion: speech enhancement, dereverberation, codec post-filtering, bandwidth extension, STFT phase retrieval, and Mel vocoding. As we verify through comprehensive evaluations and a MUSHRA listening test, Stream.FM establishes a state-of-the-art for generative streaming speech restoration, exhibits only a reasonable reduction in quality compared to a non-streaming variant, and outperforms our recent work (Diffusion Buffer) on generative streaming speech enhancement while operating at a lower latency."

To illustrate this method, we examined the structural features of the Virgo galaxy cluster and identified its substructure, comprising groups of galaxies of varying multiplicity. Galaxies in the substructure are somewhat brighter than those in the overall cluster, and each subgroup contains an active galaxy. Subgroups are considered to be the product of primordial ejections of matter from the central generator galaxy. It is shown that the average stellar magnitude of galaxies in subgroups positively correlates with their average velocity. This correlation can be interpreted as evidence of cluster expansion."

The emitter is coupled to phonon modes of the surrounding bulk semiconductor, described by a super-Ohmic spectral density. We show that the RF spectrum of this system consists of a central elastic line, a broad phonon sideband known from other linear and nonlinear spectra of such systems, as well as a narrow inelastic contribution, which is characteristic of scattering spectra and stems from noise-induced transient dynamics. At moderate phonon couplings or low temperatures, the interplay between the broad sideband and the inelastic feature leads to a Fano-like profile near the resonant energy with the Fano parameter determined by laser detuning. In the weak-coupling limit (where only single-phonon processes are included), the spectrum becomes an exact Fano shape and resonant light scattering is entirely suppressed. The amplitude of this spectral feature grows linearly with temperature, while its width depends solely on the spontaneous emission rate of the emitter. We relate the quantum character of the reservoir to the non-commutativity of noise observables and show that Fano resonance persists in the classical limit. We also discuss how the redistribution of optical coupling efficiency between the central line and the sidebands affects the total scattering rate under various excitation conditions."

    "abstract": "Temperature is a fundamental regulator of chemical and biochemical kinetics, yet capturing nonlinear thermal effects directly from experimental data remains a major challenge due to limited throughput and model flexibility. Recent advances in machine learning have enabled flexible modeling beyond conventional physical laws, but most existing strategies remain confined to surrogate models of end-point yields rather than full kinetic dynamics. Consequently, an end-to-end framework that unifies systematic kinetic data acquisition with machine learning based modeling has been lacking. In this paper, we present a unified framework that integrates droplet microfluidics with machine learning for the systematic analysis of temperature-dependent reaction kinetics. The platform is specifically designed to enable stable immobilization and long-term time-lapse imaging of thousands of droplets under dynamic thermal gradients. This configuration yields massively parallel time-resolved datasets across diverse temperature conditions that capture transient kinetics and provides particularly suitable inputs for training machine-learning models of reaction dynamics. Leveraging these datasets, we train Neural ODE models, which embed neural networks within differential equations to flexibly represent nonlinear temperature dependencies beyond conventional formulations. We demonstrate accurate prediction of enzymatic kinetics across diverse thermal environments, highlighting the robustness and versatility of the approach. Our framework bridges high-throughput experimental data acquisition with data-driven modeling, establishing a versatile foundation for enhanced predictive ability and rational analysis and design of temperature-sensitive biochemical processes."

    "abstract": "Modern learning systems act on internal representations of data, yet how these representations encode underlying physical or statistical structure is often left implicit. In physics, conservation laws of Hamiltonian systems such as symplecticity guarantee long-term stability, and recent work has begun to hard-wire such constraints into learning models at the loss or output level. Here we ask a different question: what would it mean for the representation itself to obey a symplectic conservation law in the sense of Hamiltonian mechanics? We express this symplectic constraint through Legendre duality: the pairing between primal and dual parameters, which becomes the structure that the representation must preserve. We formalize Legendre dynamics as stochastic processes whose trajectories remain on Legendre graphs, so that the evolving primal-dual parameters stay Legendre dual. We show that this class includes linear time-invariant Gaussian process regression and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck dynamics. Geometrically, we prove that the maps that preserve all Legendre graphs are exactly symplectomorphisms of cotangent bundles of the form \"cotangent lift of a base diffeomorphism followed by an exact fibre translation\". Dynamically, this characterization leads to the design of a Symplectic Reservoir (SR), a reservoir-computing architecture that is a special case of recurrent neural network and whose recurrent core is generated by Hamiltonian systems that are at most linear in the momentum. Our main theorem shows that every SR update has this normal form and therefore transports Legendre graphs to Legendre graphs, preserving Legendre duality at each time step. Overall, SR implements a geometrically constrained, Legendre-preserving representation map, injecting symplectic geometry and Hamiltonian mechanics directly at the representational level."

Structural optimization of the trees based on time evolution of the entanglement in the system allows to keep the necessary bond dimensions low and to maximally exploit the increased expressiveness of TTNs over MPS. In this way, we achieve more accurate results in all considered parameter regimes both below and above the ergodicity-to-localization crossover at a comparable compute-time cost."

This paper revisits and extends the microscopic formalism for calculating response coefficients -- here referred to as (generalized) polarizabilities -- in crystalline electronic insulators. The main focus is on the Berry phase polarization and orbital magnetization, for which we obtain general formulas describing the linear response to an arbitrary (but static and uniform) perturbation. The response of an arbitrary lattice-periodic observable (e.g. spin, layer pseudospin) to electric and magnetic fields is also examined, and serves as a basis for mircoscopically establishing Maxwell relations between conjugate generalized polarizabilities. We furthermore introduce and examine the notion of Berry curvature or Hall vector polarizability, i.e., the response of the Berry curvature to a general perturbation, and show how it relates to Berry phase polarization and orbital magnetization responses. For all polarizabilities considered, we obtain simplified formulas applicable to two- and four-band models, expressed directly in terms of the Hamiltonian and the perturbation. Three specific applications of these formulas are discussed: (i) a computation of the magnetoelectric polarizabilities of model antiferromagnets in one and two dimensions; (ii) a general proof of (quasi)topological signatures in the polarizabilities of Dirac fermions in two dimensions; (iii) a calculation of the strain-induced Berry curvature polarizability in an altermagnet."

We introduce IndoMER, the first multimodal emotion recognition benchmark for Indonesian, comprising 1,944 video segments from 203 speakers with temporally aligned text, audio, and visual annotations across seven emotion categories. The dataset exhibits realistic challenges including cross-modal inconsistency and long-tailed class distributions shaped by Indonesian cultural communication norms. To address these challenges, we propose OmniMER, a multimodal adaptation framework built upon Qwen2.5-Omni that enhances emotion recognition through three auxiliary modality-specific perception tasks: emotion keyword extraction for text, facial expression analysis for video, and prosody analysis for audio. These auxiliary tasks help the model identify emotion-relevant cues in each modality before fusion, reducing reliance on spurious correlations in low-resource settings. Experiments on IndoMER show that OmniMER achieves 0.582 Macro-F1 on sentiment classification and 0.454 on emotion recognition, outperforming the base model by 7.6 and 22.1 absolute points respectively. Cross-lingual evaluation on the Chinese CH-SIMS dataset further demonstrates the generalizability of the proposed framework.

Protons and antiprotons are identified at midrapidity ($|y| < 0.5$) with transverse momentum $0.4 < p_T < 2.0$ GeV/$c$. The proton factorial cumulants $κ_4$, $κ_5$, and $κ_6$ increase with order but exhibit no sign alternation within current uncertainties, offering no evidence for a two-component structure in the proton multiplicity distribution, as might be expected near a first-order phase transition. The cumulant ratios $C_{5}/C_{1}$ and $C_{6}/C_{2}$ fluctuate around zero in collisions at 0--40\\% centrality. The results are consistent with both the negative predictions from lattice QCD (LQCD) and the positive trends obtained from the Ultra-relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) model. At $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} \\gtrsim 27$ GeV, the $C_4/C_2$ and $C_5/C_1$ results are compatible with predictions from lattice QCD, functional renormalization group (FRG), and hadron resonance gas (HRG) models, while UrQMD describes the data better at lower energies.

    "abstract": "Recommender systems are enablers of personalized content delivery, and therefore revenue, for many large companies. In the last decade, deep learning recommender models (DLRMs) are the de-facto standard in this field. The main bottleneck in DLRM inference is the lookup of sparse features across huge embedding tables, which are usually partitioned across the aggregate RAM of many nodes. In state-of-the-art recommender systems, the distributed lookup is implemented via irregular all-to-all (alltoallv) communication, and often presents the main bottleneck. Today, most related work sees this operation as a given; in addition, every collective is synchronous in nature. In this work, we propose a novel bounded lag synchronous (BLS) version of the alltoallv operation. The bound can be a parameter allowing slower processes to lag behind entire iterations before the fastest processes block. In special applications such as inference-only DLRM, the accuracy of the application is fully preserved. We implement BLS alltoallv in a new PyTorch Distributed backend and evaluate it with a BLS version of the reference DLRM code. We show that for well balanced, homogeneous-access DLRM runs our BLS technique does not offer notable advantages. But for unbalanced runs, e.g. runs with strongly irregular embedding table accesses or with delays across different processes, our BLS technique improves both the latency and throughput of inference-only DLRM. In the best-case scenario, the proposed reduced synchronisation can mask the delays across processes altogether."

Specifically, GANeXt employs an efficient U-shaped generator constructed from stacked 3D ConvNeXt blocks with compact convolution kernels, while the discriminator adopts a conditional PatchGAN. To improve synthesis quality, we incorporate a combination of loss functions, including mean absolute error (MAE), perceptual loss, segmentation-based masked MAE, and adversarial loss and a combination of Dice loss and cross-entropy for multi-head segmentation discriminator. For both tasks, training is performed with a batch size of 8 using two separate AdamW optimizers for the generator and discriminator, each equipped with a warmup and cosine decay scheduler, with learning rates of $5\\times10^{-4}$ and $1\\times10^{-3}$, respectively. Data preprocessing includes deformable registration, foreground cropping, percentile normalization for the input modality, and linear normalization of the CT to the range $[-1024, 1000]$. Data augmentation involves random zooming within $(0.8, 1.3)$ (for MRI-to-CT only), fixed-size cropping to $32\\times160\\times192$ for MRI-to-CT and $32\\times128\\times128$ for CBCT-to-CT, and random flipping. During inference, we apply a sliding-window approach with $0.8$ overlap and average folding to reconstruct the full-size sCT, followed by inversion of the CT normalization. After joint training on all regions without any fine-tuning, the final models are selected at the end of 3000 epochs for MRI-to-CT and 1000 epochs for CBCT-to-CT using the full training dataset."

We provide a compact coding scheme and code-assisted labeling procedure to support reproducible annotations and baselines for fine-grained stroke understanding in racket sports.

Within this framework, Tyler's M-estimator (Tyler, 1987a) enjoys several optimality properties and robustness advantages. In this paper, we develop high-dimensional scatter matrix, covariance matrix and precision matrix estimators grounded in Tyler's M-estimation. We first adapt the Principal Orthogonal complEment Thresholding (POET) framework (Fan et al., 2013) by incorporating the spatial-sign covariance matrix as an effective initial estimator. Building on this idea, we further propose a direct extension of POET tailored for Tyler's M-estimation, referred to as the POET-TME method. We establish the consistency rates for the resulting estimators under elliptical factor models. Comprehensive simulation studies and a real data application illustrate the superior performance of POET-TME, especially in the presence of heavy-tailed distributions, demonstrating the practical value of our methodological contributions."

    "abstract": "Accurate reconstruction of cardiac anatomy from sparse clinical images remains a major challenge in patient-specific modeling. While neural implicit functions have previously been applied to this task, their application to mapping anatomical consistency across subjects has been limited. In this work, we introduce Neural Implicit Heart Coordinates (NIHCs), a standardized implicit coordinate system, based on universal ventricular coordinates, that provides a common anatomical reference frame for the human heart. Our method predicts NIHCs directly from a limited number of 2D segmentations (sparse acquisition) and subsequently decodes them into dense 3D segmentations and high-resolution meshes at arbitrary output resolution. Trained on a large dataset of 5,000 cardiac meshes, the model achieves high reconstruction accuracy on clinical contours, with mean Euclidean surface errors of 2.51$\\pm$0.33 mm in a diseased cohort (n=4549) and 2.3$\\pm$0.36 mm in a healthy cohort (n=5576). The NIHC representation enables anatomically coherent reconstruction even under severe slice sparsity and segmentation noise, faithfully recovering complex structures such as the valve planes. Compared with traditional pipelines, inference time is reduced from over 60 s to 5-15 s. These results demonstrate that NIHCs constitute a robust and efficient anatomical representation for patient-specific 3D cardiac reconstruction from minimal input data."

Existing methods often suffer from insufficient concept mixing, lack of rigorous evaluation, and suboptimal outputs-manifesting as conceptual imbalance, superficial combinations, or mere juxtapositions. To address these limitations, we propose Reinforcement Mixing Learning (RMLer), a framework that formulates cross-category concept fusion as a reinforcement learning problem: mixed features serve as states, mixing strategies as actions, and visual outcomes as rewards. Specifically, we design an MLP-policy network to predict dynamic coefficients for blending cross-category text embeddings. We further introduce visual rewards based on (1) semantic similarity and (2) compositional balance between the fused object and its constituent concepts, optimizing the policy via proximal policy optimization. At inference, a selection strategy leverages these rewards to curate the highest-quality fused objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate RMLer's superiority in synthesizing coherent, high-fidelity objects from diverse categories, outperforming existing methods. Our work provides a robust framework for generating novel visual concepts, with promising applications in film, gaming, and design."

To address these challenges, we introduce Helios, a large language model tailored to the smart energy domain, together with a comprehensive suite of resources to advance LLM research in this field. Specifically, we develop Enersys, a multi-agent collaborative framework for end-to-end dataset construction, through which we produce: (1) a smart energy knowledge base, EnerBase, to enrich the model's foundational expertise; (2) an instruction fine-tuning dataset, EnerInstruct, to strengthen performance on domain-specific downstream tasks; and (3) an RLHF dataset, EnerReinforce, to align the model with human preferences and industry standards. Leveraging these resources, Helios undergoes large-scale pretraining, SFT, and RLHF. We also release EnerBench, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs in smart energy scenarios, and demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances domain knowledge mastery, task execution accuracy, and alignment with human preferences."

Gaseous xenon time projection chamber (GXeTPC) detectors are a technology that may be able to meet this challenge due to their excellent background rejection power, scalability, and energy resolution. This paper explores how the design choices of a next-generation GXeTPC time projection chamber can impact the overall performance of the experiment. We study the performance of systems using xenon enriched in the isotope $^{136}$Xe or natural xenon, focusing on scenarios that incorporate one tonne of source isotope. The detector size, copper shielding mass, energy resolution, pressure, and diffusion amount are surveyed to evaluate the overall performance dependencies on these parameters. A detector optimized for using enriched xenon is preferred, with a factor of 10 lower background rate, driven by the large intrinsic backgrounds introduced by the copper shielding used in the detector. The performance of three types of gas TPC technologies was also explored based on different gas additives used to reduce diffusion to different levels. For all TPC technologies, we find background rates of a fraction of a count per tonne year in the region of interest are achievable. These performances are contingent on suitable energy resolution and event position placement in the drift direction being achieved for the specific detector technology. When factoring in the considerations for the construction of the detector in addition to the selection performance, there is no clear optimum pressure, with advantages and disadvantages if a high or low pressure default configuration is chosen."

Conventionally, spectral gap estimation relies on independently computing the ground-state and first-excited-state energies and then taking their difference. This work introduces an alternative procedure for estimating spectral gaps on digital quantum devices using the Adiabatic Preparation technique to create a specific superposition state. The expectation values of observables measured on such a state exhibit time-dependent fluctuations which, through a fitting process, can be used to estimate the energy gap. We successfully test our method on the 1D and 2D Ising models, and H2 and He2 molecules, implementing relatively shallow circuits both on noiseless and noisy simulators. The robustness of the approach is corroborated by additional experiments on the real IonQ Aria device for the 1D Ising model up to 20 qubits, demonstrating the applicability of the proposed method for currently available digital quantum devices and paving the way for more complex energy gap calculation requiring deeper circuits in the fault-tolerant era to come."

This design allows training the planner on action-free or even non-robot data sources (e.g., videos), providing transferable high-level guidance. Nevertheless, grounding these high-level plans into executable actions remains challenging, especially with the limited availability of high-quality robot data. To this end, we propose to improve the low-level policy through online interactions. Specifically, our approach collects online rollouts, retrospectively annotates the corresponding high-level goals from achieved outcomes, and aggregates these hindsight-relabeled experiences to update a goal-conditioned imitation policy. Our method, Hindsight Flow-conditioned Online Imitation (HinFlow), instantiates this idea with 2D point flows as the high-level planner. Across diverse manipulation tasks in both simulation and physical world, our method achieves more than $2\\times$ performance improvement over the base policy, significantly outperforming the existing methods. Moreover, our framework enables policy acquisition from planners trained on cross-embodiment video data, demonstrating its potential for scalable and transferable robot learning."

To this end we employ a rigorous formalism of probability measures on spacetime and quantify the probability of a successful superluminal bit transfer via the single-particle Schrödinger-Newton equation. We demonstrate that such a quantity decreases with the increasing size and mass of the system. Furthermore, we prove that the Einstein-Dirac system, which yields the Schrödinger-Newton equation in the non-relativistic limit, is perfectly compatible with the relativistic causal structure. Our study demonstrates that the Schrödinger-Newton equation, which is by construction non-relativistic, is in fact `more compatible' with the no-signalling principle than the ordinary free Schrödinger equation."

Interestingly, the proposed conditions depend only on graph topology and signed interactions and not on the edge weights of the network. Consequently, the proposed SFJ-based control law relaxes the in-degree balance and homogeneity of trust-distrust, frequently assumed in the literature. Finally, we add simulation results to demonstrate the proposed conditions for multiconsensus."

While MU has been extensively explored in classical deep learning, its behavior within variational quantum circuits (VQCs) and quantum-augmented architectures remains largely unexplored. First, we adapt a broad suite of unlearning methods to quantum settings, including gradient-based, distillation-based, regularization-based and certified techniques. Second, we introduce two new unlearning strategies tailored to hybrid models. Experiments across Iris, MNIST, and Fashion-MNIST, under both subset removal and full-class deletion, reveal that quantum models can support effective unlearning, but outcomes depend strongly on circuit depth, entanglement structure, and task complexity. Shallow VQCs display high intrinsic stability with minimal memorization, whereas deeper hybrid models exhibit stronger trade-offs between utility, forgetting strength, and alignment with retrain oracle. We find that certain methods, e.g. EU-k, LCA, and Certified Unlearning, consistently provide the best balance across metrics. These findings establish baseline empirical insights into quantum machine unlearning and highlight the need for quantum-aware algorithms and theoretical guarantees, as quantum machine learning systems continue to expand in scale and capability.

MetaSHAP operates over a vast benchmark of over 09 millions evaluated machine learning pipelines, allowing it to produce interpretable importance scores and actionable tuning insights that reveal how much each hyperparameter matters, how it interacts with others and in which value ranges its influence is concentrated. For a given algorithm and dataset, MetaSHAP learns a surrogate performance model from historical configurations, computes hyperparameters interactions using SHAP-based analysis, and derives interpretable tuning ranges from the most influential hyperparameters. This allows practitioners not only to prioritize which hyperparameters to tune, but also to understand their directionality and interactions. We empirically validate MetaSHAP on a diverse benchmark of 164 classification datasets and 14 classifiers, demonstrating that it produces reliable importance rankings and competitive performance when used to guide Bayesian optimization."

To address this, we present VisionDirector, a training-free vision-language supervisor that (i) extracts structured goals from long instructions, (ii) dynamically decides between one-shot generation and staged edits, (iii) runs micro-grid sampling with semantic verification and rollback after every edit, and (iv) logs goal-level rewards. We further fine-tune the planner with Group Relative Policy Optimization, yielding shorter edit trajectories (3.1 versus 4.2 steps) and stronger alignment.

    "abstract": "Soft sensing infers hard-to-measure data through a large number of easily obtainable variables. However, in complex industrial scenarios, the issue of insufficient data volume persists, which diminishes the reliability of soft sensing. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are one of the effective solutions for addressing insufficient samples. Nevertheless, traditional GAN fail to account for the mapping relationship between labels and features, which limits further performance improvement. Although some studies have proposed solutions, none have considered both performance and efficiency simultaneously. To address these problems, this paper proposes the multi-task learning-based regression GAN framework that integrates regression information into both the discriminator and generator, and implements a shallow sharing mechanism between the discriminator and regressor. This approach significantly enhances the quality of generated samples while improving the algorithm's operational efficiency. Moreover, considering the importance of training samples and generated samples, a dual data evaluation strategy is designed to make GAN generate more diverse samples, thereby increasing the generalization of subsequent modeling. The superiority of method is validated through four classic industrial soft sensing cases: wastewater treatment plants, surface water, $CO_2$ absorption towers, and industrial gas turbines."

As a running example, we focus on Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS), which, despite its apparent simplicity, requires sequential reasoning, adaptation, and strategy recognition. Our system positions the LLM as an Observer whose task is to identify which strategies are being played and to articulate the reasoning behind this judgment. The purpose is not to test knowledge of Rock-Paper-Scissors itself, but to probe whether the model can exhibit mind-like reasoning about sequential behavior. To support systematic evaluation, we provide a benchmark consisting of both static strategies and lightweight dynamic strategies specified by well-prompted rules. We quantify alignment between the Observer's predictions and the ground-truth distributions induced by actual strategy pairs using three complementary signals: Cross-Entropy, Brier score, and Expected Value (EV) discrepancy. These metrics are further integrated into a unified score, the Union Loss, which balances calibration, sensitivity, and payoff alignment. Together with a Strategy Identification Rate (SIR) metric, our framework captures not only predictive accuracy but also whether the model can stably identify the latent strategies in play. The demo emphasizes interactivity, transparency, and reproducibility. Users can adjust LLM distributions in real time, visualize losses as they evolve, and directly inspect reasoning snippets to identify where and why failures occur. In doing so, our system provides a practical and interpretable proxy for mind-like inference in sequential games, offering insights into both the strengths and limitations of current LLM reasoning."

Whenever the critical percolation threshold is positive, we show that the critical window has width of order $(\\log n)^{-2}$ and a secondary phase transition at its finite upper boundary. Inside this window the largest component has size of order $\\sqrt{n}/\\log n$, and the susceptibility remains finite and independent of the position in the window.

We systematically investigate the interplay between quantization precision (FP16, INT8, INT4) and replay buffer strategies in large language models, revealing unexpected dynamics. While FP16 achieves superior initial task performance (74.44% on NLU), we observe a striking inversion on subsequent tasks: quantized models outperform FP16 by 8-15% on final task forward accuracy, with INT4 achieving nearly double FP16's performance on Code generation (40% vs 20%). Critically, even minimal replay buffers (0.1%) dramatically improve retention - increasing NLU retention after Math training from 45% to 65% across all precision levels - with INT8 consistently achieving the optimal balance between learning plasticity and knowledge retention. We hypothesize that quantization-induced noise acts as implicit regularization, preventing the overfitting to new task gradients that plagues high-precision models. These findings challenge the conventional wisdom that higher precision is always preferable, suggesting instead that INT8 quantization offers both computational efficiency and superior continual learning dynamics. Our results provide practical guidelines for deploying compressed models in continual learning scenarios: small replay buffers (1-2%) suffice for NLU tasks, while Math and Code benefit from moderate buffers (5-10%), with quantized models requiring less replay than FP16 to achieve comparable retention.

    "abstract": "Thiol-based self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on gold surfaces are one of the fundamental building blocks of molecular electronics. The strong chemical affinity of the gold and sulfur (Au-S) enables the formation of close-packed SAMs, but it also has recently been found to create a dynamic interface where surface reconstruction can occur under illumination, even with ambient light. This reconstruction may facilitate migration of gold atoms, potentially leading to in-situ formation of gold clusters. However, research on this mechanism often centers on Au(111) crystalline surfaces and flicker-noise measurements. Electron transport in ensembles of molecules in lithographically defined junctions has remained largely unexplored at cryogenic temperatures. In this study, we observe single-electron phenomena characterized by reproducible Coulomb staircases across various long-chain alkanethiol SAMs, which fit the Coulomb-blockade theory of nm-sized metallic nanoparticles. We find no such current steps in samples with amine, rather than thiol, anchors. Additionally, we find that by adding a bipyridyl functional group, these phenomena can be harnessed for memristive switching and negative differential resistance. These findings indicate that the generally observed lack of reliability and reproducibility of molecular devices may be alleviated by using amine anchors instead of thiols to avoid nanoparticle effects. Conversely, the spontaneous formation of the nanoparticles could potentially be controlled and used to achieve useful functionalities, offering new pathways for designing multifunctional nanoelectronic components."

    "abstract": "Artistic style transfer in generative models remains a significant challenge, as existing methods often introduce style only via model fine-tuning, additional adapters, or prompt engineering, all of which can be computationally expensive and may still entangle style with subject matter. In this paper, we introduce a training- and inference-light, interpretable method for representing and transferring artistic style. Our approach leverages an art-specific Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) on top of latent embeddings of generative image models. Trained on artistic data, our SAE learns an emergent, largely disentangled set of stylistic and compositional concepts, corresponding to style-related elements pertaining brushwork, texture, and color palette, as well as semantic and structural concepts. We call it LouvreSAE and use it to construct style profiles: compact, decomposable steering vectors that enable style transfer without any model updates or optimization. Unlike prior concept-based style transfer methods, our method requires no fine-tuning, no LoRA training, and no additional inference passes, enabling direct steering of artistic styles from only a few reference images. We validate our method on ArtBench10, achieving or surpassing existing methods on style evaluations (VGG Style Loss and CLIP Score Style) while being 1.7-20x faster and, critically, interpretable."

The proposed filter finds marriage of the standard prediction procedure and the diffusion generative modeling for the analysis procedure to realize one filtering step. The designed approach finds no structural model error, and it is derivative free, training free and highly parallizable. Experimental results show that the designed algorithm performs well given highly nonlinear dynamics in (mildly) high dimension up to 40 or above under a chaotic environment. It also shows better performance than classical methods such as the ensemble Kalman filter and the Particle filter in numerous tests given different level of nonlinearity. Future work will focus on extending the proposed approach to practical meteorological applications and establishing a rigorous convergence analysis."

    "abstract": "We evaluate using programmable superconducting flux qubit D-Wave quantum annealers to approximate the partition function of Ising models. We propose the use of two distinct quantum annealer sampling methods: chains of Monte Carlo-like reverse quantum anneals, and standard linear-ramp quantum annealing. The control parameters used to attenuate the quality of the simulations are the effective analog energy scale of the J coupling, the total annealing time, and for the case of reverse annealing the anneal-pause. The core estimation technique is to sample across the energy spectrum of the classical Hamiltonian of interest, and therefore obtain a density of states estimate for each energy level, which in turn can be used to compute an estimate of the partition function with some sampling error. This estimation technique is powerful because once the distribution is sampled it allows thermodynamic quantity computation at arbitrary temperatures. On a $25$ spin $\\pm J$ hardware graph native Ising model we find parameter regimes of the D-Wave processors that provide comparable result quality to two standard classical Monte Carlo methods, Multiple Histogram Reweighting and Wang-Landau. Remarkably, we find that fast quench-like anneals can quickly generate ensemble distributions that are very good estimates of the true partition function of the classical Ising model; on a Pegasus graph-structured QPU we report a logarithmic relative error of $7.6 \\times 10^{-6}$, from $171,000$ samples generated using $0.2$ seconds of QPU time with an anneal time of $8$ nanoseconds per sample which is interestingly within the closed system dynamics timescale of the superconducting qubits."

In our method, we first use data-driven foundation models to initialize the core components, including the object mesh and poses, the scene point cloud, and the hand poses. We then apply a two-stage optimization that recovers a complete hand-object motion from grasping to interaction, which remains consistent with the scene information observed in the input video."

This study uses Gaussian graphical modeling to examine the symptom network of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, and somatic distress among Eritrean refugees in the Greater Washington, DC area. Given the small sample size (n) and high-dimensional symptom space (p), we propose a novel extension of the standard graphical LASSO by incorporating adaptive penalization, which improves sparsity selection and network estimation stability under n < p conditions. To evaluate the reliability of the network, we apply bootstrap resampling and use centrality measures to identify the most influential symptoms. Our analysis identifies six distinct symptom clusters, with somatic-anxiety symptoms forming the most interconnected group. Notably, symptoms such as nausea and reliving past experiences emerge as central symptoms linking PTSD, anxiety, depression, and somatic distress. Additionally, we identify symptoms like feeling fearful, sleep problems, and loss of interest in activities as key symptoms, either being closely positioned to many others or acting as important bridges that help maintain the overall network connectivity, thereby highlighting their potential importance as possible intervention targets."

    "abstract": "Autoregressive (AR) visual generation relies on tokenizers to map images to and from discrete sequences. However, tokenizers are trained to reconstruct clean images from ground-truth tokens, while AR generators are optimized only for token likelihood. This misalignment leads to generated token sequences that may decode into low-quality images, without direct supervision from the pixel space. We propose VA-$π$, a lightweight post-training framework that directly optimizes AR models with a principled pixel-space objective. VA-$π$ formulates the generator-tokenizer alignment as a variational optimization, deriving an evidence lower bound (ELBO) that unifies pixel reconstruction and autoregressive modeling. To optimize under the discrete token space, VA-$π$ introduces a reinforcement-based alignment strategy that treats the AR generator as a policy, uses pixel-space reconstruction quality as its intrinsic reward. The reward is measured by how well the predicted token sequences can reconstruct the original image under teacher forcing, giving the model direct pixel-level guidance without expensive free-running sampling. The regularization term of the ELBO serves as a natural regularizer, maintaining distributional consistency of tokens. VA-$π$ enables rapid adaptation of existing AR generators, without neither tokenizer retraining nor external reward models. With only 1% ImageNet-1K data and 25 minutes of tuning, it reduces FID from 14.36 to 7.65 and improves IS from 86.55 to 116.70 on LlamaGen-XXL, while also yielding notable gains in the text-to-image task on GenEval for both visual generation model (LlamaGen: from 0.306 to 0.339) and unified multi-modal model (Janus-Pro: from 0.725 to 0.744).

QuSquare consists of four benchmark tests that evaluate quantum hardware performance at both the system and application levels: Partial Clifford Randomized, Multipartite Entanglement, Transverse Field Ising Model (TFIM) Hamiltonian Simulation, and Data Re-Uploading Quantum Neural Network (QNN). Together, these benchmarks offer an integral, hardware-agnostic, and impartial methodology to quantify the quality and capabilities of current quantum computers, supporting fair cross-platform comparisons and fostering the development of future performance standards."

    "abstract": "In Si quantum dot systems, large magnetic field gradients are needed to implement spin rotations via electric dipole spin resonance (EDSR). By increasing the effective electron dipole, flopping mode qubits can provide faster gates with smaller field gradients. Moreover, operating in the strong-driving limit can reduce their sensitivity to charge noise. However, alloy disorder in Si/SiGe heterostructures randomizes the valley energy splitting and the valley phase difference between dots, enhancing the probably of valley excitations while tunneling between the dots, and opening a leakage channel. In this work, we analyze the performance of flopping mode spin qubits in the presence of charge noise and alloy disorder, and we optimize these qubits for a variety of valley configurations, in both weak and strong charge-noise regimes. When the charge noise is weak, high fidelity qubits can be implemented across a wide range of valley parameters, provided the electronic pulse is fine-tuned for a given valley configuration. When the charge noise is strong, high-fidelity pulses can still be engineered, provided the valley splittings in each dot are relatively large and the valley phase difference is relatively small. We analyze how charge noise-induced fluctuations of the inter-dot detuning, as well as small shifts in other qubit parameters, impact qubit fidelities. We find that strongly driven pulses are less sensitive to detuning fluctuations but more sensitive to small shifts in the valley parameters, which can actually dominate the qubit infidelities in some regimes. Finally, we discuss schemes to tune devices away from poor-performing configurations, enhancing the scalability of flopping-mode-based qubit architectures."

    "abstract": "Magic states are essential resources enabling universal, fault-tolerant quantum computation within the stabilizer framework. Their non-stabilizerness provides the additional resource required to overcome the constraints of stabilizer codes, as formalized by the Eastin-Knill theorem, while still permitting fault-tolerant distillation. Although numerous measures of magic have been introduced, not every state with nonzero magic has been shown to be distillable by a stabilizer code, and all currently known distillable states arise as special cases of Clifford-stabilizer states, defined as pure states uniquely stabilized by finite subgroups of the Clifford group. In this work, we develop a general framework for group-covariant functionals on the real manifold of Hermitian operators. We formalize the notions of $G$-stabilizer spaces, states, and codes for arbitrary finite subgroups $G \\subset \\mathrm{U}(\\mathcal{H})$, and introduce analytic families of $G$-covariant functionals. Our main theorem shows that any $G$-invariant pure state is an extremal point of a broad class of derived functionals, including symmetric, max-type, and Rényi-type functionals, provided the underlying family is $G$-covariant. This extremality holds for variations restricted to directions orthogonal to the stabilized subspace while preserving purity. Specializing to the Pauli and Clifford groups, our framework unifies the extremality structure of several canonical magic measures, including mana, stabilizer Rényi entropies, and stabilizer fidelity. In particular, Clifford-stabilizer states extremize these measures. We classify such states for qubits, qutrits, ququints, and two-qubit systems, identifying new candidates for magic distillation protocols. We further propose an inefficient distillation protocol for a two-qubit magic state with stabilizer fidelity exceeding that of standard benchmark states."

This unlocks capabilities absent in deformation-based approaches:(1) sample-efficient learning from sparse temporal supervision by modeling the underlying motion law; (2) temporal extrapolation enabling forward and backward prediction beyond observed time ranges; and (3) compositional dynamics that allow localized dynamics injection for controllable scene synthesis. Experiments on dynamic scene benchmarks show that EvoGS achieves better motion coherence and temporal consistency compared to deformation-field baselines while maintaining real-time rendering"

Firstly, we show that if $H_1$ and $H_2$ are 3-free products of cyclics of rank $\\ge 3$ then $G$ is also a 3-free product of cyclics. Secondly, we prove that if $H_1$ and $H_2$ are 4-free products of cyclics of rank $\\ge 4$ then every 4-generated subgroup of $G$ is a free product of $\\le 4$ cyclics or a 1-relator quotient of a free product of four cyclic groups. Here a group is called an $n$-free product of cyclics if every $n$-generated subgroup is a free product of $\\le n$ cyclic groups. These results are based on ubiquitous applications of the Nielsen method for amalgamated free products which we recall carefully. Lastly, given an infinite, finitely presented group which is not free, but all of its infinite index subgroups are free, a well-known conjecture says that it is isomorphic to a surface group. We revisit and elaborate on predominantly group theoretic proofs of this conjecture for cyclically amalgamated products as above, as well as for certain HNN extensions."

    "abstract": "Mechanical metamaterials exhibit size-effects when a few unit-cells are subjected to static loading because no clear micro-macro scale separation holds and the characteristic length of the deformation becomes comparable to the unit-cell size. These size-effects typically manifest themselves as a strengthening of the response in a form summarized as \"smaller is stiffer\". Moreover, the dynamical behavior of mechanical metamaterials is very remarkable, featuring unique phenomena such as dispersive behavior and band-gaps where elastic waves cannot propagate over specific frequency ranges. In these frequency ranges, the wavelength becomes gradually comparable to the unit-cell size, giving rise to microstructure related phenomena which become particularly visible in the reflection/transmission patterns where an incident wave hits the metamaterial's interfaces. This raises the question of whether the static size-effects and dynamic reflection/transmission patterns are correlated. In this work, we investigate the interaction of the static size-effects and the dynamic scattering response of mechanical metamaterials by employing the relaxed micromorphic model. We introduce a two-stage optimization procedure to identify the material parameters. In the first stage, the static material parameters are identified by exploiting the static size-effects through a least squares fitting procedure based on the total energy. The dynamic parameters are determined in the second stage by fitting the dispersion curves of the relaxed micromorphic model to those of the fully discretized microstructure. At this second stage, we assess the results obtained by fitting the dispersion curves in one and in two propagation directions, for both the relaxed micromorphic model (RMM) with curvature and its reduced counterpart (RRMM) without curvature.

While both molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and sputter deposited Sc0.3Al0.7N films show Sc clustering, the degree of clustering is significantly stronger for the MBE-grown film, offering an explanation for some of the discrepancies between MBE-grown and sputtered films reported in the literature. Moreover, the MBE-grown Sc0.3Al0.7N film exhibits a dispersive and anomalously large dielectric permittivity, roughly double that of sputtered Sc0.3Al0.7N. We attribute this result to the Sc-rich clusters locally reaching x ~ 0.5 and approaching the predicted ferroelectric-to-paraelectric phase transition, resulting in a giant (local) enhancement in permittivity. The Sc-rich clusters should similarly affect the piezoelectric, optical, and ferroelectric responses, suggesting cluster-engineering as a means to tailor ScAlNs functional properties."

For the strong solution, a new higher-order convergence rate estimate in the penalization parameter is obtained. The introduced framework allows us to apply a pointwise divergence free finite element method as a discretization technique, leading to strongly mass conservative discrete fictitious domain method. A numerical example illustrates the performance of the method."

    "abstract": "We present an optimal uncertainty quantification (OUQ) framework for systems whose uncertain inputs are characterized by truncated moment constraints defined over subdomains. Based on this partial information, rigorous optimal upper and lower bounds on the probability of failure (PoF) are derived over the admissible set of probability measures, providing a principled basis for system safety certification. We formulate the OUQ problem under general subdomain moment constraints and develop a high-performance computational framework to compute the optimal bounds. This approach transforms the original infinite-dimensional optimization problems into finite-dimensional unconstrained ones parameterized solely by free canonical moments. To address the prohibitive cost of PoF evaluation in high-dimensional settings, we incorporate inverse transform sampling (ITS), enabling efficient and accurate PoF estimation within the OUQ optimization. We also demonstrate that constraining inputs only by zeroth-order moments over subdomains yields a formulation equivalent to evidence theory. Three groups of numerical examples demonstrate the framework's effectiveness and scalability. Results show that increasing the number of subdomains or the moment order systematically tightens the bound interval. For high-dimensional problems, the ITS strategy reduces computational costs by up to two orders of magnitude while maintaining relative error below 1%. Furthermore, we identify regimes where optimal bounds are sensitive to subdomain partitioning or higher-order moments, guiding uncertainty reduction efforts for safety certification."

    "abstract": "We examine epistemological threats posed by human and LLM interaction. We develop collective epistemology as a theory of epistemic warrant distributed across human collectives, using bounded rationality and dual process theory as background. We distinguish internalist justification, defined as reflective understanding of why a proposition is true, from externalist justification, defined as reliable transmission of truths. Both are necessary for collective rationality, but only internalist justification produces reflective knowledge. We specify reflective knowledge as follows: agents understand the evaluative basis of a claim, when that basis is unavailable agents consistently assess the reliability of truth sources, and agents have a duty to apply these standards within their domains of competence. We argue that LLMs approximate externalist reliabilism because they can reliably transmit information whose justificatory basis is established elsewhere, but they do not themselves possess reflective justification. Widespread outsourcing of reflective work to reliable LLM outputs can weaken reflective standards of justification, disincentivize comprehension, and reduce agents' capacity to meet professional and civic epistemic duties. To mitigate these risks, we propose a three tier norm program that includes an epistemic interaction model for individual use, institutional and organizational frameworks that seed and enforce norms for epistemically optimal outcomes, and deontic constraints at organizational and or legislative levels that instantiate discursive norms and curb epistemic vices."

    "abstract": "In this work, two models of metric $f(R)$ gravity in the Jordan frame are investigated as a dynamical description of the late-time cosmic expansion using binned Type~Ia Supernovae data. The aim is to provide an explanation for the effective running of the Hubble constant observed in both the binned Pantheon Sample and the Master Sample. To this end, the effective running Hubble constant $\\mathcal{H}(z)$ is defined as the ratio between the modified Hubble parameter and that of the standard cosmological model ($Λ$CDM), multiplied by $H_0$. $\\mathcal{H}(z)$ serves as a diagnostic tool to capture deviations from the $Λ$CDM model. The first model used is a general representation of metric $f(R)$ gravity in which the gravitational Lagrangian is encoded in an effective redshift-dependent function that mimics the evolution of the Hubble parameter. Due to the limited redshift range covered by the available Supernovae Data, this function can be reliably approximated by a second-order Taylor expansion. While this more general formulation yields a phenomenological fit that is compatible with that of the $Λ$CDM for the binned Pantheon Sample, the model is not physically viable, as it generically leads to the emergence of an unphysical mass of the scalar field. This issue originates from an implicit restriction imposed on the Cauchy problem for the non-minimally coupled scalar field. To address this limitation, following previous studies, an additional condition on the modified Friedmann equation is introduced, enabling a fully consistent reformulation of the dynamics. The resulting framework not only preserves the agreement with Supernova~Ia data, but also provides a physical justification for the additional condition adopted in earlier analyses of late-time cosmological dynamics."

Inspired by this, this paper proposes a new LLM-Centric Lifelong Empathic Motion Generation (L^2-EMG) task, which aims to equip LLMs with the capability to continually acquire emotional motion generation knowledge across different unseen scenarios, potentially contributing to building a closed-loop and self-evolving embodied agent equipped with both empathy and intelligence. Further, this paper poses two key challenges in the L^2-EMG task, i.e., the emotion decoupling challenge and the scenario adapting challenge. To this end, this paper proposes an Emotion-Transferable and Scenario-Adapted Mixture of Experts (ES-MoE) approach which designs a causal-guided emotion decoupling block and a scenario-adapted expert constructing block to address the two challenges, respectively. Especially, this paper constructs multiple L^2-EMG datasets to validate the effectiveness of the ES-MoE approach. Extensive evaluations show that ES-MoE outperforms advanced baselines."

As an application, we determine the range of branch degrees for which Ulrich line bundles could exist, and we show that every even bidouble plane carries a special rank-two Ulrich bundle.

To this end, our solution integrates three distinct input modalities (player trajectories, player types and image crops of individual players) into a unified framework that processes spatial and temporal dynamics using a cascade of sociotemporal transformer blocks. Unlike prior methods, which rely heavily on accurate ball tracking or handcrafted heuristics, our approach infers the ball trajectory without direct access to its past or future positions, and robustly identifies the ball state and ball possessor under noisy or occluded conditions from real top league matches. We also introduce CropDrop, a modality-specific masking pre-training strategy that prevents over-reliance on image features and encourages the model to rely on cross-modal patterns during pre-training. We show the effectiveness of our approach on a large-scale dataset providing substantial improvements over state-of-the-art baselines in all tasks. Our results highlight the benefits of combining structured and visual cues in a transformer-based architecture, and the importance of realistic masking strategies in multi-modal learning."

Traditional methods often struggle to generalize effectively, particularly in large and complex state-action spaces. To address these limitations, we introduce the Latent Causal Diffusion Model (LacaDM), a novel approach designed to enhance the adaptability of MORL in discrete and continuous environments. Unlike existing methods that primarily address conflicts between objectives, LacaDM learns latent temporal causal relationships between environmental states and policies, enabling efficient knowledge transfer across diverse MORL scenarios. By embedding these causal structures within a diffusion model-based framework, LacaDM achieves a balance between conflicting objectives while maintaining strong generalization capabilities in previously unseen environments. Empirical evaluations on various tasks from the MOGymnasium framework demonstrate that LacaDM consistently outperforms the state-of-art baselines in terms of hypervolume, sparsity, and expected utility maximization, showcasing its effectiveness in complex multiobjective tasks."

Existing CI tests often rely on restrictive structural conditions, limiting their validity on real-world data. Kernel methods using the partial covariance operator offer a more principled approach but suffer from limited adaptivity, slow convergence, and poor scalability. In this work, we explore whether representation learning can help address these limitations. Specifically, we focus on representations derived from the singular value decomposition of the partial covariance operator and use them to construct a simple test statistic, reminiscent of the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). We also introduce a practical bi-level contrastive algorithm to learn these representations. Our theory links representation learning error to test performance and establishes asymptotic validity and power guarantees. Preliminary experiments suggest that this approach offers a practical and statistically grounded path toward scalable CI testing, bridging kernel-based theory with modern representation learning."

We propose an embedding-based framework to uncover the latent families of PLs. Our approach begins by defining 21 primary linguistic features of programming languages, such as variable definition, control structures, and method declarations, and then employs LLMs to generate feature-aligned code samples across multiple languages. By embedding these semantically parallel code snippets from 19 languages, we construct a similarity matrix and perform hierarchical clustering to uncover inherent language relationships. Our analysis reveals clear hierarchical structures among programming languages. Closely related languages form well-defined clusters (e.g., C, C++, Java, and Swift group together), while Go exhibits as a central language with the highest cross-language similarity. Building on the uncovered language families, we propose three strategies to enhance multilingual LLM training: transfer learning across linguistically related languages, linguistic proximity-guided curriculum learning, and centroid-based intermediary code translation. Experiments on 4 code intelligence tasks demonstrate that our methods significantly improve multilingual LLM performance. This work offers a universal perspective on programming languages and advances more effective strategies for multilingual code LLM training."

The system addresses beam losses in a high-current electron storage ring with superconducting (SC) final-focus magnets and sensitive detectors, where uncontrolled losses can generate heat loads, radiation, and detector backgrounds and damage. The proposed collimation insertion localizes halo particle losses through reducing interaction region beam losses from beam-gas and Touschek scattering by several orders of magnitude while keeping detector backgrounds and cryostat heat loads within acceptable limits. Multi-turn particle tracking simulations show that the collimators do not significantly impact machine acceptance or beam lifetime, and their positions and apertures can be re-optimized for future lattice configurations. Ongoing work includes incorporating crab cavities and solenoid fields into simulations, refining vacuum conditions, and optimizing collimator geometry and materials. This design establishes a robust baseline for the EIC electron ring collimation system and supports continued lattice optimization for machine operations."

As the coefficients are allowed to be non-coercive, our framework encompasses a much broader scope than variational settings. To replace coercivity, we require only well-posedness of the stochastic evolution equation and two concrete, verifiable a priori estimates. Furthermore, we accommodate drift nonlinearities satisfying a modified criticality condition, and we allow for vanishing drift perturbations. The latter permits the inclusion of Itô--Stratonovich correction terms, enabling the treatment of both noise interpretations. In another paper, our results have been applied to the 3D primitive equations with full transport noise. In the current paper, we give an application to a reaction-diffusion system which lacks coercivity, further demonstrating the versatility of the framework. Finally, we show that even in the coercive case, we obtain new LDP results for equations with critical nonlinearities that rely on our modified criticality condition, including the stochastic 2D Allen--Cahn equation in the weak setting."

We find that current observational constraints exclude all but two classes of twin stars. The first is characterized by a first-order transition occurring at a very low density, where the material properties of the system either stay largely intact or move away from the conformal limit. In the second, more interesting class, the discontinuity in the mass-radius curve emerges after a rapid crossover transition at a significantly higher density, with the speed of sound exhibiting two sharp peaks at distinct densities. Since neither class shows clear conformalization upon entering the second branch, the standard twin-star scenario linking the mass-radius discontinuity to deconfinement can be firmly ruled out, while even the remaining solutions -- disfavored by per-mille Bayes factors and in tension with theoretical bounds -- are likely to be excluded in the future."

This was the first time this technique was used for a galaxy cluster, especially for such deep observations. uGMRT and VLA data have been calibrated and imaged to produce spectral index maps and to apply further techniques to extract additional information, such as the radiative ages of the filaments or their equipartition magnetic field. Polarization information was also obtained using VLA through the rotation measure synthesis technique. Thanks to the LOFAR-VLBI wide-field image at 144 MHz, we revealed additional, very steep ($α> 2$) filaments beyond those attached to the radio galaxy, extending for around 250 kpc and previously known as the Trail. Combining LOFAR-VLBI with uGMRT and VLA, we found integrated spectral values between 1.1-1.7 for the filaments. Spectral analysis revealed also that the Original TRG has a complex structure, showing overlapping features with distinct spectral indices that extend throughout its tail. Polarized emission emerges only from the tail and the brightest part of the filaments, with values up to $22\\%$.

Tracing the historical shift from symbolic AI and information filtering systems to large-scale generative transformers, we argue that LLMs are not epistemic agents but stochastic pattern-completion systems, formally describable as walks on high-dimensional graphs of linguistic transitions rather than as systems that form beliefs or models of the world. By systematically mapping human and artificial epistemic pipelines, we identify seven epistemic fault lines, divergences in grounding, parsing, experience, motivation, causal reasoning, metacognition, and value. We call the resulting condition Epistemia: a structural situation in which linguistic plausibility substitutes for epistemic evaluation, producing the feeling of knowing without the labor of judgment. We conclude by outlining consequences for evaluation, governance, and epistemic literacy in societies increasingly organized around generative AI."

    "abstract": "We consider the gravitational Euler-Poisson system with a linear equation of state on an expanding cosmological model of the Universe. The expansion of the spatial sections introduces an additional dissipating effect in the Euler equation. We prescribe the expansion rate of space by a scale factor $a(t)=t^α$ with $α\\in(0,1)$, which describes the growth of length scales over time. This model is regularly applied in cosmology to study classical fluids in an expanding Universe. We study the behaviour of solutions to this system arising from small, near-homogeneous initial data and discover a \\emph{critical} change of behaviour near the expansion rate $α=2/3$, which corresponds to the matter-dominated regime in cosmology. In particular, we prove that for $α>2/3$ the fluid variables are global in time and remain small provided they are sufficiently small in a suitable norm initially. In the complementary regime $α\\leq2/3$, we present numerical evidence for shock formation of solutions to the Euler equation for arbitrarily small initial data. In combination, this establishes the existence of a critical stability threshold for barotropic fluids in expanding domains. In contrast to our previous work on the corresponding relativistic system, the threshold in the classical system considered here is independent of the speed of sound of the fluid. This establishes that fluids in cosmology behave fundamentally different in the non-relativistic regime than in the relativistic one."

The design simultaneously provides a method for microwave optomechanical implementation by coupling the membrane position to the electromagnetic mode of a 3D cavity. The cavity quality factor is not significantly compromised by electromagnetic leakage to the actuation electrode, allowing DC and kilohertz AC voltages to be introduced in the region where electric fields are strongly concentrated. We measure over 700 nm of driven oscillation amplitude and more than ten percent tunability in the mechanical resonance frequency of the loaded membrane, giving the potential to match the oscillations to the frequency range of a detector in future experiments. An optomechanical readout is demonstrated by measuring the cavity resonance at cryogenic temperatures, while room temperature measurements provide complimentary understanding of the mechanisms which influence the mechanical response, including repulsive contact due to collisions within the device."

    "abstract": "The growing integration of distributed integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) with closed-loop control in intelligent networks demands efficient information transmission under stringent bandwidth constraints. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a unified framework for goal-oriented semantic communication in distributed SCC systems. Building upon Weaver's three-level model, we establish a hierarchical semantic formulation with three error levels (L1: observation reconstruction, L2: state estimation, and L3: control) to jointly optimize their corresponding objectives. Based on this formulation, we propose a unified goal-oriented semantic compression and rate adaptation framework that is applicable to different semantic error levels and optimization goals across the SCC loop. A rate-limited multi-sensor LQR system is used as a case study to validate the proposed framework. We employ a GRU-based AE for semantic compression and a PPO-based rate adaptation algorithm that dynamically allocates transmission rates across sensors. Results show that the proposed framework effectively captures task-relevant semantics and adapts its resource allocation strategies across different semantic levels, thereby achieving level-specific performance gains under bandwidth constraints."

    "abstract": "Nowadays, industrial hybrid modeling which integrates both mechanistic modeling and machine learning-based modeling techniques has attracted increasing interest from scholars due to its high accuracy, low computational cost, and satisfactory interpretability. Nevertheless, the existing industrial hybrid modeling methods still face two main limitations. First, current research has mainly focused on applying a single machine learning method to one specific task, failing to develop a comprehensive machine learning architecture suitable for modeling tasks, which limits their ability to effectively represent complex industrial scenarios. Second, industrial datasets often contain underlying associations (e.g., monotonicity or periodicity) that are not adequately exploited by current research, which can degrade model's predictive performance. To address these limitations, this paper proposes the Recurrent Perceptron-based Channel Attention Transformer Encoder (RP-CATE), with three distinctive characteristics: 1: We developed a novel architecture by replacing the self-attention mechanism with channel attention and incorporating our proposed Recurrent Perceptron (RP) Module into Transformer, achieving enhanced effectiveness for industrial modeling tasks compared to the original Transformer. 2: We proposed a new data type called Pseudo-Image Data (PID) tailored for channel attention requirements and developed a cyclic sliding window method for generating PID. 3: We introduced the concept of Pseudo-Sequential Data (PSD) and a method for converting industrial datasets into PSD, which enables the RP Module to capture the underlying associations within industrial dataset more effectively. An experiment aimed at hybrid modeling in chemical engineering was conducted by using RP-CATE and the experimental results demonstrate that RP-CATE achieves the best performance compared to other baseline models."

Through numerical simulations of two-particle dynamics and the symmetry analysis, we reveal the asymmetric transport with broken inversion symmetry and two dynamical symmetries in the expansion dynamics. The expansion of two-component anyons is dynamically symmetric under spatial inversion and component flip, when the sign of anyonic statistics phase or the signs of gauge flux and interaction are changed. In the non-interacting case, we show the dynamical suppression induced by both the statistics phase and gauge flux. In the interacting case, we demonstrate that both chiral and antichiral dynamics can be exhibited and tuned by the statistics phase and gauge flux. The dynamical phase regimes with respect to the chiral-antichiral dynamics are obtained. These findings highlight the rich dynamical phenomena arising from the interplay of anyonic exchange statistics, synthetic gauge fields, and interactions in multi-component anyons."

Existing methods often suffer from computational inefficiency or suboptimal performance due to joint modeling of temporal and speaker interactions. We propose D$^{2}$Stream, a decoupled dual-stream framework that separates cross-frame temporal modeling from within-frame speaker discrimination. Audio and visual features are first aligned via cross-modal attention, then fed into two lightweight streams: a Temporal Interaction Stream captures long-range temporal dependencies, while a Speaker Interaction Stream models per-frame inter-person relationships. The temporal and relational features extracted by the two streams interact via cross-attention to enrich representations. A lightweight Voice Gate module further mitigates false positives from non-speech facial movements. On AVA-ActiveSpeaker, D$^{2}$Stream achieves a new state-of-the-art at 95.6% mAP, with 80% reduction in computation compared to GNN-based models and 30% fewer parameters than attention-based alternatives, while also generalizing well on Columbia ASD.

LDMs, operating on the product of these three instances (the document), model the discursive projection of a portion of human experience reified by the learning corpus. The proposed program aims to replace the ''fascination/fear'' dichotomy with public trials and procedures that make the place, uses, and limits of artificial discursive agents in contemporary social space decipherable, situating this approach within a perspective of governance and co-regulation involving the State, industry, civil society, and academia."

    "abstract": "Non-invasive microwave field imaging--accurately mapping field distributions without perturbing them--is essential in areas such as aerospace engineering, biomedical imaging and integrated-circuit diagnostics. Conventional metal probes, however, inevitably perturb reactive near fields: they act as strong scatterers that drive induced currents and secondary radiation, remap evanescent components and thereby degrade both accuracy and spatial resolution, particularly in the reactive near-field regime that is most relevant to these applications. Here we demonstrate, to our knowledge for the first time, reactive near-field subwavelength imaging of microwave fields using the quantum non-demolition properties of Rydberg atoms, realized with a compact, non-invasive single-ended fibre-integrated Rydberg probe engineered to minimize field disturbance. The probe achieves an imaging resolution of {\\unboldmath$λ/56$}, and the measured field distributions agree with full-wave simulations with structural similarity approaching unity, confirming both its subwavelength spatial resolution and its genuinely non-invasive character compared with conventional metal-based probes. Because the atomic sensor is intrinsically isotropic, the same device can faithfully image multi-dimensional field structures without orientation-dependent calibration. Our results therefore establish a general, non-invasive route to high-accuracy, subwavelength reactive near-field microwave imaging, with particular promise for applications such as chip-defect detection and integrated-circuit diagnostics, where even small perturbations by the probe can mask the underlying physics of interest."

While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at video understanding tasks, their real-time mobile deployment is constrained by heavy computational costs and inefficient redundant frame processing. To address these issues, we propose the FC-MIR framework: leveraging keyframe sampling and adaptive concatenation, it cuts visual redundancy to boost inference efficiency, while integrating state-of-the-art closed-source MLLMs or fine-tuned models (e.g., Qwen3-VL) for trajectory summarization and intent prediction. We further expand task scope to explore generating post-prediction operations and search suggestions, and introduce a fine-grained metric to evaluate the practical utility of summaries, predictions, and suggestions. For rigorous assessment, we construct a UI trajectory dataset covering scenarios from UI-Agents (Agent-I) and real user interactions (Person-I). Experimental results show our compression method retains performance at 50%-60% compression rates; both closed-source and fine-tuned MLLMs demonstrate strong intent summarization, supporting potential lightweight on-device deployment. However, MLLMs still struggle with useful and \"surprising\" suggestions, leaving room for improvement. Finally, we deploy the framework in a real-world setting, integrating UI perception and UI-Agent proxies to lay a foundation for future progress in this field."

    "abstract": "Incorporating over-the-air computations (OAC) into the model training process of federated learning (FL) is an effective approach to alleviating the communication bottleneck in FL systems. Under OAC-FL, every client modulates its intermediate parameters, such as gradient, onto the same set of orthogonal waveforms and simultaneously transmits the radio signal to the edge server. By exploiting the superposition property of multiple-access channels, the edge server can obtain an automatically aggregated global gradient from the received signal. However, the limited number of orthogonal waveforms available in practical systems is fundamentally mismatched with the high dimensionality of modern deep learning models. To address this issue, we propose Freshness Freshness-mAgnItude awaRe top-k (FAIR-k), an algorithm that selects, in each communication round, the most impactful subset of gradients to be updated over the air. In essence, FAIR-k combines the complementary strengths of the Round-Robin and Top-k algorithms, striking a delicate balance between timeliness (freshness of parameter updates) and importance (gradient magnitude). Leveraging tools from Markov analysis, we characterize the distribution of parameter staleness under FAIR-k. Building on this, we establish the convergence rate of OAC-FL with FAIR-k, which discloses the joint effect of data heterogeneity, channel noise, and parameter staleness on the training efficiency. Notably, as opposed to conventional analyses that assume a universal Lipschitz constant across all the clients, our framework adopts a finer-grained model of the data heterogeneity. The analysis demonstrates that since FAIR-k promotes fresh (and fair) parameter updates, it not only accelerates convergence but also enhances communication efficiency by enabling an extended period of local training without significantly affecting overall training efficiency."

Using the Si layer of $13M_\\odot$ zero-metal progenitor as the initial composition, we calculate the nucleosynthesis by adopting the temperature, density, neutrino flux, and duration of nucleosynthesis as arbitrary parameters and compare the results with the observed abundances ratio of Sc, Ti, and V in very metal-poor (VMP) stars taken from the Stellar Abundances for Galactic Archaeology (SAGA) database. As a result, for the first time, we identify the quantitative requirements on local physical conditions. To reproduce the abundances ratios in the VMP stars, the explosive nucleosynthesis should take place under the neutrino exposure, which is time integration of neutrino flux, of $σ_ν\\sim 10^{35}\\,\\mathrm{erg~cm^{-2}}$ and temperature of $2.0\\,\\mathrm{GK}\\leq T \\leq 3.2\\,\\mathrm{GK}$. The dependence on the density and each value of the neutrino flux and the duration of nucleosynthesis is weak. We also discuss whether the quantitative requirements are realized during the explosion. Although the requirements are difficult to be realized in the one-dimensional simulations, the non-monotonic thermal evolution shown in recent three-dimensional simulations may satisfy them. Because the evolution is likely caused by turbulent motion stemming from the initial asphericity of the progenitor, it is important to calculate the long-term three-dimensional supernova explosion of multi-dimensional metal-free progenitor models and follow the nucleosynthesis self-consistently."

In the normal state, magnetic susceptibility $χ(T) = M/H$ exhibits a logarithmic temperature dependence over a wide temperature range (1-20 K). However, with increasing field, this non-Fermi-liquid (NFL) behavior of $χ(T) $ at low temperatures is suppressed. Moreover, a susceptibility maximum occurs below 4 T, whereas Fermi-liquid coherence is recovered above 8 T. In addition, thermodynamic anomalies ($T_{\\rm A}$ and $H_{\\rm A}$) occur in both magnetic susceptibility and specific heat at intermediate fields (6--10 T) along the [111] direction. Furthermore, a nontrivial fifth-order nonlinear susceptibility is observed in the normal-state magnetization of UBe$_{13}$.

In this way one may establish a bridge between vectorized Machine Learning and Knowledge Graph representations without relying on language models implicitly. Our expectations for knowledge presume a degree of statistical stability, i.e. average invariance under repeated observation, or `trust' in the data. Both learning networks and knowledge graph representations can meaningfully coexist to preserve different aspects of data. While vectorized data are useful for probabilistic estimation, graphs preserve the intentionality of the source even under data fractionation. Using a Semantic Spacetime $γ(3,4)$ graph, one avoids complex ontologies in favour of classification of features by their roles in semantic processes. The latter favours an approach to reasoning under conditions of uncertainty. Appropriate attention to causal boundary conditions may lead to orders of magnitude compression of data required for such context determination, as required in the contexts of autonomous robotics, defence deployments, and ad hoc emergency services."

A key component of CoDrone is a Deep Reinforcement Learning-based neural scheduler that seamlessly integrates depth estimation with autonomous navigation decisions, enabling real-time adaptation to dynamic environments. Furthermore, the framework introduces a UAV-specific vision language interaction module incorporating domain-tailored low-level flight primitives to enable effective interaction between the cloud foundation model and the UAV. The introduction of VLM enhances open-set reasoning capabilities in complex unseen scenarios.

    "abstract": "The high mobility and flexible deployment capability of UAVs make them an impressive option for charging nodes in Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks (WRSNs) using Directional Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) technology. However, existing studies largely focus on 2D-WRSNs, lacking designs catering to real 3D-WRSNs. The spatial distribution characteristics of nodes in a 3D-WRSN further increase the complexity of the charging scheduling task, thus requiring a systematic framework to solve this problem. In this paper, we investigated the Directional UAV Charging Scheduling problem for 3D-WRSNs (DCS-3D) and established its NP-hard property, and then proposed a three-step framework named as directional charging scheduling algorithm using Functional Equivalent (FuncEqv) direction set and Lin-Kernighan heuristic (LKH) for 3D-WRSNs (FELKH-3D) to solve it. In FELKH-3D, the challenge of infinite charging direction space is solved by designing an algorithm generating a minimum-size direction set guaranteed to be FuncEqv to the infinite set of whole sphere surface, and the optimaility of the method was proved.To determine the optimal charging tour for the UAV, the LKH algorithm is employed.Simulation experiments demonstrated the superiority of FELKH-3D over other classical algorithms."

Targets were selected using Blanco DECam Bulge Survey (BDBS) photometry and Gaia DR3 astrometry, spanning 7-30 arcmin (~1-5 rt, where rt is the King-model tidal radius) from the cluster center. Orbit-based modeling predicts a strongly time-variable Jacobi radius, with rJ ~ 8-11 arcmin near pericenter and ~18-22 arcmin near apocenter, so stars just outside rt can be unbound and feeding leading and lagging tidal tails. We identify 40 stars with kinematics and abundances consistent with previous, or borderline, cluster membership. The seven highest-quality candidates (S/N > 30) have mean [Fe/H] = -0.83 +/- 0.14 and [alpha/Fe] = +0.38 +/- 0.06 dex, matching the bound population. Interpreting these stars as recently stripped debris implies a present-day mass-loss rate of 1.0-1.6 solar masses per Myr, or 5.6 +/- 1.3% of the current cluster mass per Gyr. These results indicate ongoing tidal stripping of NGC 6569 and quantify its contribution to the bulge field.

Jets are identified using the anti-$k_{t}$ algorithm with a radius parameter of $R = 0.4$.

Here, we break this enantiosensitive-and-dichroic paradigm by measuring a new type of chiroptical signal which is enantiosensitive but not dichroic. We photoionize chiral molecules using a strong laser field and detect the three-dimensional photoelectron momentum distribution. The non-dichroic, enantiosensitive asymmetry is encoded in octupolar and higher multipolar terms in the photoelectron angular distribution, which appear in multiphoton ionization with elliptically polarized fields or cross polarized two-color fields. The robustness of the enantiosensitivity with respect to the relative phase between the vectorial components of the ionizing field represents an example of symmetry protection, and opens unexplored opportunities for imaging ultrafast dynamics in chiral molecules, such as enantiosensitive photoelectron spectroscopy with bright squeezed vacuum states."

    "abstract": "The field of landscape genomics aims to infer how landscape features affect gene flow across space. Most landscape genomic frameworks assume the isolation-by-distance and isolation-by-resistance hypotheses, which propose that genetic dissimilarity increases as a function of distance and as a function of cumulative landscape resistance, respectively. While these hypotheses are valid in certain settings, other mechanisms may affect gene flow. For example, the gene flow of invasive species may depend on founder effects and multiple introductions. Such mechanisms are not considered in modern landscape genomic models. We extend dyadic models to allow for mechanisms that range-shifting and/or invasive species may experience by introducing dyadic spatially-varying coefficients (DSVCs) defined on source-destination pairs. The DSVCs allow the effects of landscape on gene flow to vary across space, capturing nonstationary and asymmetric connectivity. Additionally, we incorporate explicit landscape features as connectivity covariates, which are localized to specific regions of the spatial domain and may function as barriers or corridors to gene flow. Such covariates are central to colonization and invasion, where spread accelerates along corridors and slows across landscape barriers. The proposed framework accommodates colonization-specific processes while retaining the ability to assess landscape influences on gene flow. Our case study of the highly invasive cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) demonstrates the necessity of accounting for nonstationarity gene flow in range-shifting species."

Although most existing work has focused on ground-based robots or outdoor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), indoor UAV-based VLN remains underexplored, despite its relevance to real-world applications such as inspection, delivery, and search-and-rescue in confined spaces. To bridge this gap, we introduce \\textbf{IndoorUAV}, a novel benchmark and method specifically tailored for VLN with indoor UAVs. We begin by curating over 1,000 diverse and structurally rich 3D indoor scenes from the Habitat simulator. Within these environments, we simulate realistic UAV flight dynamics to collect diverse 3D navigation trajectories manually, further enriched through data augmentation techniques. Furthermore, we design an automated annotation pipeline to generate natural language instructions of varying granularity for each trajectory. This process yields over 16,000 high-quality trajectories, comprising the \\textbf{IndoorUAV-VLN} subset, which focuses on long-horizon VLN. To support short-horizon planning, we segment long trajectories into sub-trajectories by selecting semantically salient keyframes and regenerating concise instructions, forming the \\textbf{IndoorUAV-VLA} subset. Finally, we introduce \\textbf{IndoorUAV-Agent}, a novel navigation model designed for our benchmark, leveraging task decomposition and multimodal reasoning.

We introduce CETCAM, a camera-controllable video generation framework that eliminates the need for camera annotations through a consistent and extensible tokenization scheme. CETCAM leverages recent advances in geometry foundation models, such as VGGT, to estimate depth and camera parameters and converts them into unified, geometry-aware tokens. These tokens are seamlessly integrated into a pretrained video diffusion backbone via lightweight context blocks. Trained in two progressive stages, CETCAM first learns robust camera controllability from diverse raw video data and then refines fine-grained visual quality using curated high-fidelity datasets. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art geometric consistency, temporal stability, and visual realism. Moreover, CETCAM exhibits strong adaptability to additional control modalities, including inpainting and layout control, highlighting its flexibility beyond camera control.

Also, the samples' in vitro apatite-forming ability in a simulated body fluid was comparatively evaluated by electron microscopy, inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. According to the results, the material's sinterability was improved by fluoride doping, as realized from the further development of sintering necks. It was also found that compared to the undoped bioceramic, a higher amount of apatite was deposited on the surface of the doped sample. It is concluded that fluoride can be considered as a doping agent in magnesium-containing silicates to improve biological, particularly bioactivity, behaviors."

The sketching has a regularization effect that leads to better conditioned least-squares problems and at the same time reduces the number of unknowns that need to be solved for at each time step. Numerical experiments with benchmark examples demonstrate that randomized time stepping via sketching achieves competitive accuracy and outperforms standard regularization in terms of runtime efficiency."

Experimental results show that while the end-to-end approach frequently fails on lengthy and complex forms, our modular method-built on task decomposition, semantic clustering, and flow management-substantially improves dialog stability and extraction accuracy. Moreover, it reduces the number of dialogue turns by 46.73% and lowers token consumption by 80% to 87.5%.

By representing each anatomically parcellated brain region as a visual token and encoding SNP profiles as structured text, the framework enables cross-modal attention that links regional atrophy patterns to underlying genetic factors. Applied to the ADNI cohort, R-GenIMA achieves state-of-the-art performance in four-way classification across normal cognition (NC), subjective memory concerns (SMC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD. Beyond predictive accuracy, the model yields biologically meaningful explanations by identifying stage-specific brain regions and gene signatures, as well as coherent ROI-Gene association patterns across the disease continuum. Attention-based attribution revealed genes consistently enriched for established GWAS-supported AD risk loci, including APOE, BIN1, CLU, and RBFOX1. Stage-resolved neuroanatomical signatures identified shared vulnerability hubs across disease stages alongside stage-specific patterns: striatal involvement in subjective decline, frontotemporal engagement during prodromal impairment, and consolidated multimodal network disruption in AD. These results demonstrate that interpretable multimodal AI can synthesize imaging and genetics to reveal mechanistic insights, providing a foundation for clinically deployable tools that enable earlier risk stratification and inform precision therapeutic strategies in Alzheimer's disease."

The upper-level (UL) problem generates a nominal trajectory assuming full control authority, while each lower-level (LL) problem computes the optimal recovery maneuver following a missed-thrust-event along the nominal solution. Under suitable regularity conditions ensuring uniqueness and smoothness of the LL response, the hierarchy admits a single-level reformulation by embedding the LL first-order optimality conditions within the UL constraints. We further establish a robustness certificate, which provides an upper bound on the maximum admissible missed-thrust-duration for which the structural assumptions remain valid for the LL problem. The bound depends explicitly on precomputable dynamical quantities along the nominal solution, enabling rapid evaluation over large ensembles without iterative solves. Numerical experiments show that while the certificate identifies when modeling assumptions are valid, it does not fully characterize recoverability after missed-thrust-events. A finite-horizon controllability-energy analysis is therefore used to interpret recovery beyond the theoretical bounds. Collectively, these results provide a deterministic, certifiable approach for incorporating robustness directly into trajectory design, replacing post-hoc margin allocation techniques with formal guarantees."

    "abstract": "Bayesian optimization is an effective method for solving expensive black-box optimization problems. Most existing methods use Gaussian processes (GP) as the surrogate model for approximating the black-box objective function, it is well-known that it can fail in high-dimensional space (e.g., dimension over 500). We argue that the reliance of GP on precise numerical fitting is fundamentally ill-suited in high-dimensional space, where it leads to prohibitive computational complexity. In order to address this, we propose a simple order-preserving Bayesian optimization (OPBO) method, where the surrogate model preserves the order, instead of the value, of the black-box objective function. Then we can use a simple but effective OP neural network (NN) to replace GP as the surrogate model. Moreover, instead of searching for the best solution from the acquisition model, we select good-enough solutions in the ordinal set to reduce computational cost. The experimental results show that for high-dimensional (over 500) black-box optimization problems, the proposed OPBO significantly outperforms traditional BO methods based on regression NN and GP.

Semi-supervised methods improve detection performance by leveraging partially labeled data but typically overlook the uncertainty and heterogeneity of real-world mixed-attribute data. This paper introduces a semi-supervised outlier detection method, namely fuzzy rough sets-based outlier detection (FROD), to effectively handle these challenges. Specifically, we first utilize a small subset of labeled data to construct fuzzy decision systems, through which we introduce the attribute classification accuracy based on fuzzy approximations to evaluate the contribution of attribute sets in outlier detection. Unlabeled data is then used to compute fuzzy relative entropy, which provides a characterization of outliers from the perspective of uncertainty. Finally, we develop the detection algorithm by combining attribute classification accuracy with fuzzy relative entropy. Experimental results on 16 public datasets show that FROD is comparable with or better than leading detection algorithms.

To satisfy Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) requirements, we introduce a dimension-5 magnetic dipole operator that enable the decay of the excited state ($χ_2 \\rightarrow χ_1 γ$). This operator also provides a unique, low-threshold signal for direct detection experiments, characterized by a distinct $1/E_R$ recoil spectrum. We identify a benchmark parameter space around ($m_χ\\approx 40$ GeV, $m_φ\\approx 20$ MeV) where non-perturbative coupled-channel dynamics successfully reconcile astrophysical observations with cosmological bounds, including CMB constraints on annihilation."

    "abstract": "The deployment of reinforcement learning (RL) agents in real-world applications is often hindered by performance degradation caused by mismatches between training and deployment environments. Distributionally robust RL (DR-RL) addresses this issue by optimizing worst-case performance over an uncertainty set of transition dynamics. However, existing work typically relies on substantial prior knowledge-such as access to a generative model or a large offline dataset-and largely focuses on tabular methods that do not scale to complex domains. We overcome these limitations by proposing an online DR-RL algorithm with general function approximation that learns an optimal robust policy purely through interaction with the environment, without requiring prior models or offline data, enabling deployment in high-dimensional tasks. We further provide a theoretical analysis establishing a near-optimal sublinear regret bound under a total variation uncertainty set, demonstrating the sample efficiency and effectiveness of our method."

Prior work explores Childs View for Contrastive Learning (CVCL), a CLIP style model trained on infant egocentric video as a computational model of early infant learning, but it focuses only on class level recognition. This leaves it unclear whether infant scale learning also supports attribute discrimination. To address this, we introduce a benchmark that systematically varies color, size, and texture, allowing controlled tests of within class attribute recognition. Comparing CVCL with CLIP shows clear differences. CVCL is better at size discrimination, while CLIP achieves higher accuracy on color discrimination. Both models represent texture in image embeddings but fail to ground texture linguistically, suggesting a gap between visual and language spaces."

    "abstract": "Misinformation is pervasive in natural, biological, social, and engineered systems, yet its quantitative characterization remains challenging.We develop a general mathematical framework for quantifying information distortion in distributed systems by modeling how local transmission errors accumulate along network geodesics and reshape each agent's perceived global state. Through a drift-fluctuation decomposition of pathwise binomial noise, we derive closed-form expressions for node-level perception distributions and show that directional bias induces only a uniform shift in the mean, preserving the fluctuation structure. Applying the framework to canonical graph ensembles, we uncover strong topological signatures of misinformation: Erdős--Rényi random graphs exhibit a double-peaked distortion profile driven by connectivity transitions and geodesic-length fluctuations, scale-free networks suppress misinformation through hub-mediated integration, and optimally rewired small-world networks achieve comparable suppression by balancing clustering with short paths. A direct comparison across regular lattices, Erdős--Rényi random graphs, Watts--Strogatz small-world networks, and Barabási--Albert scale-free networks reveals a connectivity-dependent crossover. In the extremely sparse regime, scale-free and Erdős--Rényi networks behave similarly. At intermediate sparsity, Watts--Strogatz small-world networks exhibit the lowest misinformation. In contrast, Barabási--Albert scale-free networks maintain low misinformation in sparse and dense regimes, while regular lattices produce the highest distortion across connectivities. We additionally show how sparsity constraints, structural organization, and connection costs delineate regimes of minimal misinformation."

    "abstract": "Galaxy mergers are expected to have a profound influence on the star formation histories of galaxies. It is generally expected that mergers are the main drivers of galaxy mass growth through the accretion of mass and the triggering of new star formation episodes, while the shocks and torques induced by the merger may drive gas and dust to central supermassive black holes and fuel active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity and producing both positive and negative feedback. We test whether a merger-AGN-star formation connection exists by selecting samples of galaxy pairs of stellar masses log(M/Msun) approximately 10.2 and 11.4 within the redshift of 0.25 at various projected separation and velocity differences in an increasing order, and therefore having a decreasing probability of being truly bound and interacting. We identify galaxies in close pairs and then measure their star formation rates (SFRs) (via their NUV - r colours) and the degree of AGN activity (from X-rays, radio emission at 20cm, WISE infrared colours, and emission line ratios) as a function of their projected separation and velocity difference. We find only weak evidence that galaxies in pairs have higher SFRs as galaxies become closer in projected and velocity separation, except possibly for pairs at closest separation of less than 20 kpc and velocity difference less than 500 km/s. Similarly, we see no strong evidence that AGN are more common for galaxies in closer pairs, irrespective of the method used to detect AGN. For this sample, we do not find any clear evidence that mergers and interactions may play a significant role in triggering star formation and AGN activity, opposite to expectations from theoretical models invoking feedback episodes. Secular processes may be more important, although this may depend on the selection of galaxies and indicators for star formation and AGN activity."

We summarize the numerical results for the binary system before employing linear stability analysis on the coarse-grained system. We find good agreement between theoretical predictions and particle simulations, and our kinetic theory is able to capture the correct lengthscale in the emergent coexistence phases through a Turing-Hopf instability. Extending the kinetic framework to multi-species systems with cyclic alignment interactions, we recover precisely the same emergent ordering as corresponding simulations of the microscopic model. More generally, our kinetic theory provides an extensible framework for analyzing pattern formation and collective order in multi-species active matter systems."

In contrast to energy-based arguments in the literature, a novel approach in the analysis considers the discrete dual norm of the residual as a computable measure for the linearization error. As a consequence, this paper provides the first convergence analysis with optimal rates of an adaptive iteratively linearized FEM beyond energy-minimization problems. The presented theory applies to strongly monotone operators with locally Lipschitz continuous Fréchet derivative.

We introduce four core benchmarks addressing complementary aspects of quantum computing capability: large multi-qubit circuit execution via a Clifford Volume benchmark, scalable multipartite entanglement generation through GHZ-state preparation, a benchmark based on the application of Shor's period-finding subroutine to simple functions, and a protocol quantifying the benefit of quantum error correction using Bell states. Each benchmark is accompanied by clearly specified protocols, reporting standards, and scalable evaluation methods.

These two groups of unitaries possess a combination of properties that make them ideal for benchmarking: (i) each is individually efficient to simulate classically, enabling verification at scale; (ii) together they form a universal gate set; (iii) they serve as essential algorithmic primitives in practical applications (including shadow tomography and quantum chemistry); and (iv) their definitions are formulated abstractly, without explicit reference to hardware-specific features such as qubit connectivity or native gate sets. This framework thus enables scalable and fair cross-platform comparisons and tracks meaningful computational advancement.

Motivated by the operational needs of the regional operator Silesian Railways in Poland, we formulate an acyclic mixed-integer linear program on a one-day horizon that incorporates depot balance constraints, demand-driven seat and bicycle capacity limits (which is a new aspect requested by the regional operator and local society of passengers), and simple crew availability constraints. The model is designed to support both baseline planning and disruption management under increased passenger demand. Using a graph-hypergraph representation of trips and single or coupled EMU movements, we first solve the problem with a classical ILP solver. We then derive a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) reformulation - which is frequently used as the input for quantum optimization - and evaluate its solution by quantum annealing on D-Wave Advantage systems and by the classical quantum-inspired VeloxQ solver. Computational experiments on real-world instances from the Silesian network, with up to 404 train trips and 11 EMU types, show that the ILP approach can obtain high-quality daily circulation plans within at most about 40 minutes, whereas current quantum and quantum-inspired solvers are restricted to substantially smaller sub-instances (up to 51 and 78 train trips, respectively) due to embedding and QUBO size limitations. These results quantify the present frontier of QUBO-based methods for rolling stock circulation and point towards hybrid decision-support architectures in which quantum or quantum-inspired optimizers address only local subproblems within a broader classical planning framework."

The framework unifies sim-to-sim and sim-to-real transfer through ROS, re-implementing a policy trained in Isaac Gym, extending it to MuJoCo via a hardware abstraction layer, and deploying the same controller on physical hardware. Sim-to-sim experiments expose discrepancies between Isaac Gym and MuJoCo contact models that influence policy behavior, while real-world teleoperated object-picking trials show that coordinated whole-body control extends reach and improves manipulation over floating-base baselines. The pipeline provides a transparent, reproducible foundation for developing and analyzing RL-based loco-manipulation controllers and will be released open source to support future research."

Our treatment of systematic uncertainties includes a prescription for measuring and accounting for the weak lensing boost factor, consideration of a miscentering effect, as well as marginalization over uncertainties in the source galaxy photometric redshift distributions and shear calibration. The resultant constraints on the normalization of the mass-observable relation have a precision of approximately 7\\%, with the mean WL halo mass of $M_{\\rm 500c} = 5.4 \\times 10^{14} M_{\\odot}$. We measure the bias between the true cluster mass and the mass estimated from the SZ signal based on an X-ray--calibrated scaling relation assuming hydrostatic equilibrium, to be $1-b = 0.75^{+0.04}_{-0.06}$ over the full sample. When splitting the clusters into high ($z$=0.43-0.70) and low ($z$=0.15-0.43) redshift bins, we measure $1-b = 0.58^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$ and $0.82^{+0.07}_{-0.07}$, respectively. When introducing additional freedom in redshift and mass to the hydrostatic bias model, we find that $1-b$ decreases with redshift (with the power law of $-2.0^{+0.7}_{-0.4}$, 99.95\\% confidence), consistent with findings from other recent studies, while we do not find any significant trend in mass.

The current standard for evaluating this capability is MedCalc-Bench, a large-scale dataset constructed using LLM-based feature extraction and rule-based aggregation. However, treating such model-generated benchmarks as static oracles risks enshrining historical model errors as evaluation gold standards, a problem dangerously amplified when these datasets serve as reward signals for Reinforcement Learning (RL). In this work, we propose viewing benchmarks for complex tasks such as clinical score computation as ''in-progress living documents'' that should be periodically re-evaluated as the processes for creating them improve. We introduce a systematic, physician-in-the-loop pipeline that leverages advanced agentic verifiers to audit and relabel MedCalc-Bench, utilizing automated triage to reserve scarce clinician attention for the most contentious instances. Our audit reveals that a notable fraction of original labels diverge from medical ground truth due to extraction errors, calculator logic mismatches, and clinical ambiguity. To study whether this label noise meaningfully impacts downstream RL training, we fine-tune a Qwen3-8B model via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and demonstrate that training on corrected labels yields an 8.7% absolute improvement in accuracy over the original baseline -- validating that label noise materially affects model evaluation. These findings underscore that in safety-critical domains, rigorous benchmark maintenance is a prerequisite for genuine model alignment."

However, it is observed that the current thinking process during generation mainly focuses on the text consistency with the text prompt, ignoring the \\textbf{visual context consistency} with the visual reference images during the multi-modal generation, e.g., multi-reference generation. The lack of such consistency results in the failure in maintaining key visual features (like human ID, object attribute, style). To this end, we integrate the visual context consistency into the reasoning of unified models, explicitly motivating the model to sustain such consistency by 1) Adaptive Visual Planning: generating structured visual check list to figure out the visual element of needed consistency keeping, and 2) Iterative Visual Correction: performing self-reflection with the guidance of check lists and refining the generated result in an iterative manner. To achieve this, we use supervised finetuning to teach the model how to plan the visual checking, conduct self-reflection and self-refinement, and use flow-GRPO to further enhance the visual consistency through a customized visual checking reward. The experiments show that our method outperforms both zero-shot unified models and those with text CoTs in multi-modal generation, demonstrating higher visual context consistency."

Despite advances in isolating inauthentic and automated actors, the actions of individual accounts involved in influence campaigns may not stand out as anomalous if analyzed independently of the coordinated group. Given the collaborative nature of information operations, coordinated campaigns are better characterized by evidence of similar temporal behavioral patterns that extend beyond coincidental synchronicity across a group of accounts. We propose a framework to model complex coordination patterns across multiple online modalities. This framework utilizes multiplex networks to first decompose online activities into different interaction layers, and subsequently aggregate evidence of online coordination across the layers. In addition, we propose a time-aware collaboration model to capture patterns of online coordination for each modality. The proposed time-aware model builds upon the node-normalized collaboration model and accounts for repetitions of coordinated actions over different time intervals by employing an exponential decay temporal kernel. We validate our approach on multiple datasets featuring different coordinated activities. Our results demonstrate that a multiplex time-aware model excels in the identification of coordinating groups, outperforming previously proposed methods in coordinated activity detection."

    "abstract": "Uranium dioxide, UO$_2$, is a canonical example of a magnetic material with strong spin-orbit coupling. Here, we present a study of the magnetic diffuse scattering measured on a polycrystalline sample of UO$_2$, which we interpret in terms of its magnetic interactions between U$^{4+}$ magnetic moments. By refining values of the magnetic interaction parameters to magnetic diffuse-scattering data measured above the magnetic ordering transition temperature, we show that the dominant magnetic coupling in UO$_2$ is a bond-dependent interaction analogous to the Kitaev model of honeycomb magnets. We compare our experimental results with published theoretical predictions and experimental measurements of the magnetic excitation spectrum. Our results suggest that magnetic materials with $f$-electron magnetic ions, particularly actinides, may be promising candidates for realising Kitaev magnetism, and highlight the role that magnetic diffuse-scattering data can play in identifying such materials."

Although Lorentz violation is introduced only through the kinetic sector, the renormalization structure is nontrivial: interactions generate additional couplings, including masses and linear terms, so a consistent renormalization--group analysis cannot be formulated in terms of modified kinetic terms alone and requires an RG--complete operator basis compatible with the reduced symmetry. We perform a systematic one--loop renormalization and derive the complete set of beta functions for cubic and quartic couplings, masses, and linear terms. We identify and analyze the resulting fixed points and fixed manifolds, showing in particular how anisotropy restricts their existence and stability. In particular we obtain how anisotropy restricts existence of canonical Wilson-Fisher fixed point. Also we provide a transparent physical interpretation of the anisotropy--dependent coefficients appearing in the beta functions and clarify how kinetic mixing reshapes the interaction flow through the available ultraviolet phase space."

In this paper, we present a large class of examples of pivotal module categories of topological origin: For a unimodular finite ribbon category $\\mathcal{A}$, we prove that the factorization homology $\\int_Σ\\mathcal{A}$ of a compact oriented surface $Σ$ with $n$ marked boundary intervals, at least one per connected component, comes with the structure of a pivotal module category over $\\mathcal{A}^{\\boxtimes n}$. This endows the internal skein algebras of Ben-Zvi-Brochier-Jordan, in particular the elliptic double, with a symmetric Frobenius structure. As application, we obtain, for each choice of $\\mathcal{A}$, a family of full open conformal field theories, each of which comes with correlation functions for all surfaces with marked boundary intervals that are explicitly computable using factorization homology. As a further application, we explain how modified traces can be 'integrated' over surfaces: We show that the modified trace for $\\mathcal{A}$ extends in a canonical way to the factorization homology of $Σ$. The resulting traces have the remarkable property of being modular invariant, i.e. fixed by the mapping class group action."

However, the standarly adopted definition of fine-tuning has a clear drawback: the more the primordial black hole abundance is small and cosmologically harmless, the larger the parameter space is fine-tuned. A reliable measure of fine-tuning should deliver a large value when the primordial black hole abundance is fine-tuned and at the same time reduce to something close to unity when it encounters typical sensitivity. Motivated by such arguments, we use the (modified version of) Wilson's naturalness criterion for quantifying the fine-tuning and naturalness and we show that the primordial black hole models are not technically unnatural."

    "abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of preventable blindness worldwide, demanding accurate automated diagnostic systems. While general-domain vision-language models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) perform well on natural image tasks, they struggle in medical domain applications, particularly in cross-modal retrieval for ophthalmological images. We propose a novel knowledge-enhanced joint embedding framework that integrates retinal fundus images, clinical text, and structured patient data through a multimodal transformer architecture to address the critical gap in medical image-text alignment. Our approach employs separate encoders for each modality: a Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16) for retinal images, Bio-ClinicalBERT for clinical narratives, and a multilayer perceptron for structured demographic and clinical features. These modalities are fused through a joint transformer with modality-specific embeddings, trained using multiple objectives including contrastive losses between modality pairs, reconstruction losses for images and text, and classification losses for DR severity grading according to ICDR and SDRG schemes. Experimental results on the Brazilian Multilabel Ophthalmological Dataset (BRSET) demonstrate significant improvements over baseline models. Our framework achieves near-perfect text-to-image retrieval performance with Recall@1 of 99.94% compared to fine-tuned CLIP's 1.29%, while maintaining state-of-the-art classification accuracy of 97.05% for SDRG and 97.97% for ICDR. Furthermore, zero-shot evaluation on the unseen DeepEyeNet dataset validates strong generalizability with 93.95% Recall@1 versus 0.22% for fine-tuned CLIP. These results demonstrate that our multimodal training approach effectively captures cross-modal relationships in the medical domain, establishing both superior retrieval capabilities and robust diagnostic performance."

Observations were collected with STIS/E230M (2300-3000 $Å$, R$\\sim$ 30,000) and we de-correlate systematic effects from the telescope using jitter detrending. We show the clear presence of the Mg II doublet at 2800 $Å$ and Fe II at 2600 $Å$ in KELT-9b. The Mg II is measured above the planet's Roche transit radius, indicating it is escaping. We fit 1D NLTE atmospheric escape models to these features, demonstrating a significant loss of mass in KELT-9b's atmosphere ($\\dot{M} \\approx 10^{12} $ g/s); we also find a remarkably high line-broadening corresponding to a velocity of about $50-75$ km/s, and a net blueshift of the Mg II doublet greater than 30 km/s. Future 3D MHD modeling of the spectrum and gas kinematics is likely needed to explain these observations. We interpret these results in the context of the Mg II ``Cosmic Shoreline\" and show that the detection of escaping Mg II in KELT-9b and the non-detection in WASP-178b are consistent with the hypothesis that stars hotter than $T_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\sim$ 8250~K have relatively low levels of XUV radiation due to the lack of a chromosphere. Therefore planets around such early-type stars experience a different degree of atmospheric escape. This result highlights the importance of XUV irradiation in driving atmospheric escape inside and outside the Solar System."

The pattern of global symmetry breaking yields, as pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone (pNGB) bosons, both a Standard Model (SM)-like Higgs and the link field whose vacuum expectation value breaks the flavour non-universal gauge group down to the SM. Inevitably, a third pNGB appears, transforming as a second Higgs doublet coupled only to the light generations. This heavy Higgs naturally mediates suppressed light Yukawa couplings, providing a solution to the flavour puzzle. At the same time, new physics contributions to flavour violating observables are CKM- and chirally suppressed, while electric dipole moment bounds are evaded through an automatic mass alignment in the light fermion sector. The result is a natural framework for addressing the origin of both Higgs and flavour hierarchies, with reduced Higgs mass tuning and minimised impact in flavour observables, that is best tested by high-$p_T$ and precision electroweak measurements."

Generative AI tools capable of code generation may support scientific programmers, but user studies indicate risks of over-reliance, particularly among inexperienced users. We surveyed 868 scientists who program, examining adoption patterns, tool preferences, and factors associated with perceived productivity. Adoption is highest among students and less experienced programmers, with variation across fields. Scientific programmers overwhelmingly prefer general-purpose conversational interfaces like ChatGPT over developer-specific tools. Both inexperience and limited use of development practices (like testing, code review, and version control) are associated with greater perceived productivity-but these factors interact, suggesting formal practices may partially compensate for inexperience. The strongest predictor of perceived productivity is the number of lines of generated code typically accepted at once. These findings suggest scientific programmers using generative AI may gauge productivity by code generation rather than validation, raising concerns about research code integrity."

This paper investigates diffusion-based generative modeling to address these challenges through plant image synthesis, indoor-to-outdoor translation, and expert preference aligned fine tuning. First, a Stable Diffusion model is fine tuned on captioned indoor and outdoor plant imagery to generate realistic, text conditioned images of canola and soybean. Evaluation using Inception Score, Frechet Inception Distance, and downstream phenotype classification shows that synthetic images effectively augment training data and improve accuracy. Second, we bridge the gap between high resolution indoor datasets and limited outdoor imagery using DreamBooth-based text inversion and image guided diffusion, generating translated images that enhance weed detection and classification with YOLOv8. Finally, a preference guided fine tuning framework trains a reward model on expert scores and applies reward weighted updates to produce more stable and expert aligned outputs. Together, these components demonstrate a practical pathway toward data efficient generative pipelines for agricultural AI."

By imposing an additional separation condition, we establish almost sure positivity of the $κ_r$-dimensional lower quantization coefficient. Furthermore, without assuming any separation condition, we provide a sufficient condition that guarantees almost sure finiteness of the $κ_r$-dimensional upper quantization coefficient.

We show that there is compactly supported initial data such that the initial energy flux across the initial Cauchy hypersurface is negative and that the energy flux decreases with time.

Unlike humans, who can quickly learn to parse and navigate maps, current models often fail to respect fundamental path constraints, in part due to the prohibitive cost and difficulty of collecting large-scale, pixel-accurate path annotations. To address this, we introduce a scalable synthetic data generation pipeline that leverages synthetic map images and pixel-level parsing to automatically produce precise annotations for this challenging task. Using this pipeline, we construct a fine-tuning dataset of 23k path samples across 4k maps, enabling models to acquire more human-like spatial capabilities. Using this dataset, we fine-tune both open-source and proprietary MLLMs. Results on MapBench show that finetuning substantially improves robustness, raising success rates by up to 6.4 points, while also reducing path-tracing error (NDTW). These gains highlight that fine-grained spatial reasoning, absent in pretrained models, can be explicitly taught with synthetic supervision."

Here, we investigate nonequilibrium quantum thermometry using a single-qubit probe coupled to a bosonic bath through noncommuting interaction operators, which unify pure dephasing and dissipative dynamics within a spin-boson model. We show that the interference between these two coupling channels induces strong non-Markovian feedback between populations and coherences, leading to coherence trapping and enhanced thermal sensitivity. Remarkably, by tuning the coupling structure, the probe's temperature sensitivity exhibits a quadratic low-temperature scaling, even under weak coupling. Moreover, while coherence-based measurements are formally suboptimal, they become the most informative in the early nonequilibrium regime, where memory effects dominate. Our findings identify noncommutative system-bath couplings as a practical and tunable resource for achieving high-precision quantum thermometry in realistic open-system architectures."

We develop possibilistic inferential models for post-selection inference based on a regularized split possibilistic construction (RSPIM) that combines generic high-dimensional selectors with PIM validification through sample splitting. A first subsample is used to select a sparse model; ordinary least-squares refits on an independent inference subsample yield classical t/F pivots, which are then turned into consonant plausibility contours. In Gaussian linear models this leads to coor-dinatewise intervals with exact finite-sample strong validity conditional on the split and selected model, uniformly over all selectors that use only the selection data. We further analyze RSPIM in a sparse p >> n regime under high-level screening conditions, develop orthogonalized and bootstrap-based extensions for low-dimensional targets with high-dimensional nuisance, and study a maxitive multi-split aggregation that stabilizes inference across random splits while preserving strong validity. Simulations and a riboflavin gene-expression example show that calibrated RSPIM intervals are well behaved under both Gaussian and heteroskedastic errors and are competitive with state-of-the-art post-selection methods, while plausibility contours provide transparent diagnostics of post-selection uncertainty."

Starting from the general non-local-in-time expression for the galaxy overdensity, we explicitly compute the complete sixth-order basis of bias operators at leading order in spatial derivatives, finding 57 independent biases, compared to 46 in the corresponding local-in-time expansion. As previously found at fifth order, this difference implies that higher-order clustering statistics can distinguish between local- and non-local-in-time galaxy formation, and thus are sensitive, at a single redshift, to the formation time of galaxies.

    "abstract": "The search for primordial gravitational waves is a central goal of cosmic microwave background (CMB) surveys. Isolating the characteristic $B$-mode polarization signal sourced by primordial gravitational waves is challenging for several reasons: the amplitude of the signal is inherently small; astrophysical foregrounds produce $B$-mode polarization contaminating the signal; and secondary $B$-mode polarization fluctuations are produced via the conversion of $E$ modes. Current and future low-noise, multi-frequency observations enable sufficient precision to address the first two of these challenges such that secondary $B$ modes will become the bottleneck for improved constraints on the amplitude of primordial gravitational waves. The dominant source of secondary $B$-mode polarization is gravitational lensing by large scale structure. Various strategies have been developed to estimate the lensing deflection and to reverse its effects the CMB, thus reducing confusion from lensing $B$ modes in the search for primordial gravitational waves. However, a few complications remain. First, there may be additional sources of secondary $B$-mode polarization, for example from patchy reionization or from cosmic polarization rotation. Second, the statistics of delensed CMB maps can become complicated and non-Gaussian, especially when advanced lensing reconstruction techniques are applied. We previously demonstrated how a deep learning network, ResUNet-CMB, can provide nearly optimal simultaneous estimates of multiple sources of secondary $B$-mode polarization. In this paper, we show how deep learning can be applied to estimate and remove multiple sources of secondary $B$-mode polarization, and we further show how this technique can be used in a likelihood analysis to produce nearly optimal, unbiased estimates of the amplitude of primordial gravitational waves."

Using linked patent, firm, ownership, and citation data, we examine the geography, specialization, and international diffusion of AI innovation. We find a highly concentrated patent landscape: China leads in patent volumes, while the United States dominates in citation impact and technological influence. Europe accounts for a limited share of AI patents but exhibits signals of relatively high patent quality. Technological proximity reveals global convergence toward U.S. innovation trajectories, with Europe remaining fragmented rather than forming an autonomous pole. Gravity-model estimates show that cross-border AI knowledge flows are driven primarily by technological capability and specialization, while geographic and institutional factors play a secondary role. EU membership does not significantly enhance intra-European knowledge diffusion, suggesting that technological capacity, rather than political integration, underpins participation in global AI innovation networks."

When considering DESI, SN Ia and the acoustic scale $θ_\\star$ data, the preference for an open universe exceeds the $3σ$ level, reaching $5σ$ for the case of DESY5 Supernovae data. Therefore, low-redshift observations favor an open universe, and this preference persists even when alternative high-redshift priors are adopted. Our results point to the existence of an additional tension between high- and low-redshift observations, present also in non-flat models beyond the minimal $Λ$CDM scheme, thereby challenging the standard inflationary predictions."

    "abstract": "Semantic communication and edge-cloud collaborative intelligence are increasingly recognized as foundational enablers for next-generation intelligent services operating under stringent bandwidth, latency, and resource constraints. By shifting the communication objective from bit-perfect delivery toward the transmission of task-relevant semantic representations, semantic communication enables adaptive tradeoffs among communication overhead, inference accuracy, computational load, and end-to-end latency. This survey provides a comprehensive and system-level synthesis of recent advances in semantic communication at the edge-cloud interface, encompassing architectural models for collaborative intelligence, representation learning and semantic abstraction techniques, network-aware and resource-adaptive semantic encoding strategies, and learning-driven optimization and orchestration mechanisms. Beyond efficiency considerations, the survey situates semantic communication within practical operational contexts, including security, trust, resilience, and scalability, drawing connections to zero-trust networking, physical-layer security, and emerging edge-cloud control paradigms. Finally, open challenges and research directions are identified, highlighting the role of semantic communication as a key building block for AI-native networking and 6G-ready intelligent systems."

When all rollouts are wrong, gradients stall; when one happens to be correct, the update usually ignores why the others are close-but-wrong, and credit can be misassigned to spurious chains. We present CARE (Contrastive Anchored REflection), a failure-centric post-training framework for multimodal reasoning that turns errors into supervision. CARE combines: (i) an anchored-contrastive objective that forms a compact subgroup around the best rollout and a set of semantically proximate hard negatives, performs within-subgroup z-score normalization with negative-only scaling, and includes an all-negative rescue to prevent zero-signal batches; and (ii) Reflection-Guided Resampling (RGR), a one-shot structured self-repair that rewrites a representative failure and re-scores it with the same verifier, converting near-misses into usable positives without any test-time reflection. CARE improves accuracy and training smoothness while explicitly increasing the share of learning signal that comes from failures. On Qwen2.5-VL-7B, CARE lifts macro-averaged accuracy by 4.6 points over GRPO across six verifiable visual-reasoning benchmarks; with Qwen3-VL-8B it reaches competitive or state-of-the-art results on MathVista and MMMU-Pro under an identical evaluation protocol."

We present ActAvatar, a framework that achieves phase-level precision in action control through textual guidance by capturing both action semantics and temporal context. Our approach introduces three core innovations: (1) Phase-Aware Cross-Attention (PACA), which decomposes prompts into a global base block and temporally-anchored phase blocks, enabling the model to concentrate on phase-relevant tokens for precise temporal-semantic alignment; (2) Progressive Audio-Visual Alignment, which aligns modality influence with the hierarchical feature learning process-early layers prioritize text for establishing action structure while deeper layers emphasize audio for refining lip movements, preventing modality interference; (3) A two-stage training strategy that first establishes robust audio-visual correspondence on diverse data, then injects action control through fine-tuning on structured annotations, maintaining both audio-visual alignment and the model's text-following capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ActAvatar significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both action control and visual quality."

    "abstract": "Liouville's theorem -- the preservation of phase-space volume -- is often presented as a corollary of Hamilton's canonical equations. Here we adopt an ensemble-first viewpoint in which the starting point is local probability conservation on phase space. For a probability density $ρ$ on a $2N$-dimensional symplectic manifold $(\\mathcal{M},ω)$, probability transport is expressed intrinsically with respect to the Liouville volume form $Ω=ω^N/N!$ through a continuity equation defined by the $Ω$-divergence. For Hamiltonian evolution, specified by $ι_{X_H}ω=\\mathrm{d}H$, Cartan's identity implies $\\mathcal{L}_{X_H}ω=0$ and hence $\\mathcal{L}_{X_H}Ω=0$, so the Hamiltonian flow is incompressible in the Liouville sense and the continuity law reduces to Liouville's equation. In canonical coordinates this reproduces Hamilton's equations. In particular, the canonical Poisson-bracket relations $\\{q^i,p_j\\}=δ^i_{\\ j}$ provide the kinematic input that fixes the evolution of observables and underlies the canonical form of the continuity equation. The same organization clarifies the distinction between conservation of total probability and preservation of fine-grained information measures (Gibbs--Shannon entropy), which holds specifically for Liouville-measure-preserving dynamics."

To develop novel organic dyes, three acceptor/anchoring groups and five donating groups were introduced to strategic positions of the base porphyrin structure, resulting in a total of fifteen dyes. The singlet ground state geometries of the dyes were optimized utilizing density functional theory (DFT) with B3LYP and the excited state optical properties were explored through time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) using the PCM model with tetrahydrofuran (THF) as solvent. Both DFT and TD-DFT calculations were carried out using the 6-311G(d,p) basis set. The HOMO energy levels of almost all the modified dyes are lower than the redox potential of I$^-$/I$3^-$ and LUMO energy levels are higher than the conduction band of TiO$2$. The absorption maxima values ranged from 690.64 to 975.55 nm. The dye N1 using triphenylamine group as donor and p-ethynylbenzoic acid group as acceptor, showed optimum optoelectronic properties ($ΔG{reg}=-9.73$ eV, $ΔG{inj}=7.18$ eV, $V_{OC}=1.47$ V and $J_{SC}=15.03$ mA/cm$^2$) with highest PCE 14.37%, making it the best studied dye. This newly modified organic dye with enhanced PCE is remarkably effective for the dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) industry. Beyond materials discovery, this study highlights the role of high-performance computing in enabling predictive screening of dye candidates and generating performance indicators (HOMO-LUMO gaps, absorption spectra, charge transfer free energies, photovoltaic metrics).

    "abstract": "Deep learning has been effectively applied to many discrete optimization problems. However, learning-based scheduling on unrelated parallel machines remains particularly difficult to design. Not only do the numbers of jobs and machines vary, but each job-machine pair has a unique processing time, dynamically altering feature dimensions. We propose a novel approach with a neural network tailored for offline deterministic scheduling of arbitrary sizes on unrelated machines. The goal is to minimize a complex objective function that includes the makespan and the weighted tardiness of jobs and machines. Unlike existing online approaches, which process jobs sequentially, our method generates a complete schedule considering the entire input at once. The key contribution of this work lies in the sophisticated architecture of our model. By leveraging various NLP-inspired architectures, it effectively processes any number of jobs and machines with varying feature dimensions imposed by unrelated processing times. Our approach enables supervised training on small problem instances while demonstrating strong generalization to much larger scheduling environments. Trained and tested on instances with 8 jobs and 4 machines, costs were only 2.51% above optimal. Across all tested configurations of up to 100 jobs and 10 machines, our network consistently outperformed an advanced dispatching rule, which incurred 22.22% higher costs on average. As our method allows fast retraining with simulated data and adaptation to various scheduling conditions, we believe it has the potential to become a standard approach for learning-based scheduling on unrelated machines and similar problem environments."

Undershoot-driven baseline artifacts and pulse broadening are addressed by a time-domain co-design of the anode geometry and decoupling network. The design is validated through a staged workflow that combines full-wave electromagnetic simulations, vector network analyzer measurements, circuit-level transient models, and end-to-end mass spectra. The resulting planar circular patch anode with anode-proximal decoupling confines fields, preserves peak amplitude, and suppresses post-pulse energy, leading to fast settling and minimal baseline wander. We show that the effective high-pass corner set by the decoupling capacitance directly governs undershoot decay and baseline recovery. Measurements in a representative TOF-MS test setup demonstrate waveguide-level pulse fidelity at a fraction of the mass and volume of heritage waveguide-based detectors, with residual ripples in the measured response originating from downstream cable and digitizer terminations rather than the detector itself. By limiting detector-induced temporal broadening and inter-peak baseline coupling, the design supports high mass resolution and dynamic range in miniaturized TOF-MS architectures. Variants of this planar flight-ready architecture are being implemented in several next-generation spaceborne TOF-MS instruments currently under development at the University of Bern."

Accurate prediction of their arrival time at Earth is critical for impact mitigation. To this end, physics-informed artificial intelligence (AI) approaches have proven more effective than purely data-driven or physics-based methods, generally offering higher accuracy and better explainability than the former and lower computational cost than the latter. In this work, we propose a generalization of the physics-driven AI framework based on the classical drag-based model (DBM) by integrating the extended version of the drag-based model (EDBM). This enhancement allows us to include in the training process CME events whose interplanetary dynamics are incompatible with those assumed by the DBM. We achieve travel-time prediction accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods. We also perform a parametric robustness analysis, highlighting the stability of our approach under small variations in the drag coefficient. Furthermore, we propose a categorization of CMEs into speed regimes defined by the EDBM using a multiclass classification model based on logistic regression, which could be implemented in near-real-time operational space weather forecasting systems. The results show that the EDBM framework broadens the applicability of forecasting models while preserving good predictive accuracy."

To address this gap, we study the capabilities of GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini to predict the code entities impacted by given source code changes. We construct a dataset containing information about seed-changes, change pairs, and change types for each commit. Existing datasets lack crucial information about seed changes and impacted code entities.

We found that both LLMs perform poorly in the two experiments, whereas GPT-5 outperforms GPT-5-mini.

As generative models proliferate for specialized domains (wings, structures, engines), a key research gap is how to coordinate frozen, pre-trained submodels to generate full-system designs that are feasible, diverse, and high-performing. We introduce Generative Latent Unification of Expertise-Informed Engineering Models (GLUE), which orchestrates pre-trained, frozen subsystem generators while enforcing system-level feasibility, optimality, and diversity. We propose and benchmark (i) data-driven GLUE models trained on pre-generated system-level designs and (ii) a data-free GLUE model trained online on a differentiable geometry layer. On a UAV design problem with five coupling constraints, we find that data-driven approaches yield diverse, high-performing designs but require large datasets to satisfy constraints reliably. The data-free approach is competitive with Bayesian optimization and gradient-based optimization in performance and feasibility while training a full generative model in only 10 min on a RTX 4090 GPU, requiring more than two orders of magnitude fewer geometry evaluations and FLOPs than the data-driven method. Ablations focused on data-free training show that subsystem output continuity affects coordination, and equality constraints can trigger mode collapse unless mitigated. By integrating unmodified, domain-informed submodels into a modular generative workflow, this work provides a viable path for scaling generative design to complex, real-world engineering systems."

While token pruning offers a path to acceleration, we find that current methods, while adequate for general understanding, catastrophically fail on fine-grained localization tasks. We attribute this failure to the inherent flaws of the two prevailing strategies: importance-based methods suffer from a strong positional bias, an inherent model artifact that distracts from semantic content, while diversity-based methods exhibit structural blindness, disregarding the user's prompt and spatial redundancy. To address this, we introduce D2Pruner, a framework that rectifies these issues by uniquely combining debiased importance with a structural pruning mechanism. Our method first secures a core set of the most critical tokens as pivots based on a debiased attention score. It then performs a Maximal Independent Set (MIS) selection on the remaining tokens, which are modeled on a hybrid graph where edges signify spatial proximity and semantic similarity. This process iteratively preserves the most important and available token while removing its neighbors, ensuring that the supplementary tokens are chosen to maximize importance and diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that D2Pruner has exceptional efficiency and fidelity. Applied to LLaVA-1.5-7B for general understanding tasks, it reduces FLOPs by 74.2\\% while retaining 99.2\\% of its original performance.

Unlike other kernel methods such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), KLRs are generally not sparse. Previous attempts to deal with sparsity in KLR include a heuristic method referred to as the Import Vector Machine (IVM) and ad hoc regularizations such as the $\\ell_{1/2}$-based one. Achieving a good trade-off between prediction accuracy and sparsity is still a challenging issue with a potential significant impact from the application point of view. In this work, we revisit binary KLR and propose an extension of the training formulation proposed by Keerthi et al., which is able to induce sparsity in the trained model, while maintaining good testing accuracy. To efficiently solve the dual of this formulation, we devise a decomposition algorithm of Sequential Minimal Optimization type which exploits second-order information, and for which we establish global convergence. Numerical experiments conducted on 12 datasets from the literature show that the proposed binary KLR approach achieves a competitive trade-off between accuracy and sparsity with respect to IVM, $\\ell_{1/2}$-based regularization for KLR, and SVM while retaining the advantages of providing informative estimates of the class membership probabilities."

    "abstract": "Learning accurate and stable time-advancement operators for nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) remains challenging, particularly for chaotic, stiff, and long-horizon dynamical systems. While neural operator methods such as the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) and Koopman-inspired extensions achieve good short-term accuracy, their long-term stability is often limited by unconstrained latent representations and cumulative rollout errors. In this work, we introduce an inverse scattering inspired Fourier Neural Operator(IS-FNO), motivated by the reversibility and spectral evolution structure underlying the classical inverse scattering transform. The proposed architecture enforces a near-reversible pairing between lifting and projection maps through an explicitly invertible neural transformation, and models latent temporal evolution using exponential Fourier layers that naturally encode linear and nonlinear spectral dynamics. We systematically evaluate IS-FNO against baseline FNO and Koopman-based models on a range of benchmark PDEs, including the Michelson-Sivashinsky and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations (in one and two dimensions), as well as the integrable Korteweg-de Vries and Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equations. The results demonstrate that IS-FNO achieves lower short-term errors and substantially improved long-horizon stability in non-stiff regimes. For integrable systems, reduced IS-FNO variants that embed analytical scattering structure retain competitive long-term accuracy despite limited model capacity. Overall, this work shows that incorporating physical structure -- particularly reversibility and spectral evolution -- into neural operator design significantly enhances robustness and long-term predictive fidelity for nonlinear PDE dynamics."

    "abstract": "Community detection, which uncovers closely connected vertex groups in networks, is vital for applications in social networks, recommendation systems, and beyond. Real-world networks often have bipartite structures (vertices in two disjoint sets with inter-set connections), creating unique challenges on specialized community detection methods. Biclique percolation community (BCPC) is widely used to detect cohesive structures in bipartite graphs. A biclique is a complete bipartite subgraph, and a BCPC forms when maximal bicliques connect via adjacency (sharing an (alpha, beta)-biclique). Yet, existing methods for BCPC detection suffer from high time complexity due to the potentially massive maximal biclique adjacency graph (MBAG). To tackle this, we propose a novel partial-BCPC based solution, whose key idea is to use partial-BCPC to reduce the size of the MBAG. A partial-BCPC is a subset of BCPC. Maximal bicliques belonging to the same partial-BCPC must also belong to the same BCPC. Therefore, these maximal bicliques can be grouped as a single vertex in the MBAG, significantly reducing the size of the MBAG. Furthermore, we move beyond the limitations of MBAG and propose a novel BCPC detection approach based on (alpha, beta)-biclique enumeration. This approach detects BCPC by enumerating all (alpha, beta)-bicliques and connecting maximal bicliques sharing the same (alpha, beta)-biclique, which is the condition for maximal bicliques to be adjacent. It also leverages partial-BCPC to significantly prune the enumeration space of (alpha, beta)-biclique. Experiments show that our methods outperform existing methods by nearly three orders of magnitude."

    "abstract": "Interpretability methods for large language models (LLMs) typically derive directions from textual supervision, which can lack external grounding. We propose using human brain activity not as a training signal but as a coordinate system for reading and steering LLM states. Using the SMN4Lang MEG dataset, we construct a word-level brain atlas of phase-locking value (PLV) patterns and extract latent axes via ICA. We validate axes with independent lexica and NER-based labels (POS/log-frequency used as sanity checks), then train lightweight adapters that map LLM hidden states to these brain axes without fine-tuning the LLM. Steering along the resulting brain-derived directions yields a robust lexical (frequency-linked) axis in a mid TinyLlama layer, surviving perplexity-matched controls, and a brain-vs-text probe comparison shows larger log-frequency shifts (relative to the text probe) with lower perplexity for the brain axis. A function/content axis (axis 13) shows consistent steering in TinyLlama, Qwen2-0.5B, and GPT-2, with PPL-matched text-level corroboration. Layer-4 effects in TinyLlama are large but inconsistent, so we treat them as secondary (Appendix). Axis structure is stable when the atlas is rebuilt without GPT embedding-change features or with word2vec embeddings (|r|=0.64-0.95 across matched axes), reducing circularity concerns. Exploratory fMRI anchoring suggests potential alignment for embedding change and log frequency, but effects are sensitive to hemodynamic modeling assumptions and are treated as population-level evidence only. These results support a new interface: neurophysiology-grounded axes provide interpretable and controllable handles for LLM behavior."

Recently, a number of such computations have been performed by studying light probes of smooth horizonless supergravity solutions, including certain asymptotically $AdS_5\\times S^5$ solutions of Lin-Lunin-Maldacena (LLM) type. We construct a new closed-form perturbative LLM solution involving a pair of linearized supergravitons with different mode numbers and their quadratic backreaction. Using this solution, we compute two infinite sequences of four-point correlators. Depending on the scaling of certain parameters, the background supergravity solutions are dual to states of 4D $\\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory that are either heavy or light, whereupon the correlators in the dual field theory are either (perturbatively) heavy-heavy-light-light or all-light. In the all-light regime, the correlators we compute are related by superconformal Ward identities to correlators of four single-particle chiral primary operators (CPOs). We confirm a set of expressions in the literature for such correlators of CPOs, that were obtained via Mellin space bootstrap and/or Witten diagram methods. We also obtain a novel compact expression for one of the two infinite sequences of correlators of chiral primaries."

    "abstract": "Understanding intraventricular hemodynamics requires compact and physically interpretable representations of the underlying flow structures, as characteristic flow patterns are closely associated with cardiovascular conditions and can support early detection of cardiac deterioration. Conventional visualization of velocity or pressure fields, however, provides limited insight into the coherent mechanisms driving these dynamics. Reduced-order modeling techniques, like Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and Autoencoder (AE) architectures, offer powerful alternatives to extract dominant flow features from complex datasets. This study systematically compares POD with several AE variants (Linear, Nonlinear, Convolutional, and Variational) using left ventricular flow fields obtained from computational fluid dynamics simulations. We show that, for a suitably chosen latent dimension, AEs produce modes that become nearly orthogonal and qualitatively resemble POD modes that capture a given percentage of kinetic energy. As the number of latent modes increases, AE modes progressively lose orthogonality, leading to linear dependence, spatial redundancy, and the appearance of repeated modes with substantial high-frequency content. This degradation reduces interpretability and introduces noise-like components into AE-based reduced-order models, potentially complicating their integration with physics-based formulations or neural-network surrogates. The extent of interpretability loss varies across the AEs, with nonlinear, convolutional, and variational models exhibiting distinct behaviors in orthogonality preservation and feature localization. Overall, the results indicate that AEs can reproduce POD-like coherent structures under specific latent-space configurations, while highlighting the need for careful mode selection to ensure physically meaningful representations of cardiac flow dynamics."

We identify boundaries separating extended, multifractal (mixed), and localized regimes by constructing a phase diagram in the plane of modulation strength and dimerization ratio. As the quasiperiodic amplitude is increased, the system exhibits reentrant behavior, localizing, partially re-delocalizing into a multifractal regime, and re-localizing, verified via two-size crossings of band-averaged observables and finite-size scaling. We demonstrate that tuning the modulation strength, the SSH dimerization, or the incommensurability parameter provides control over the critical thresholds. Our results suggest a versatile, randomness-free platform for the deterministic control of transport, enabling switching between conducting, multifractal, and insulating states."

    "abstract": "While reinforcement learning methods have delivered remarkable results in a number of settings, generalization, i.e., the ability to produce policies that generalize in a reliable and systematic way, has remained a challenge. The problem of generalization has been addressed formally in classical planning where provable correct policies that generalize over all instances of a given domain have been learned using combinatorial methods. The aim of this work is to bring these two research threads together to illuminate the conditions under which (deep) reinforcement learning approaches, and in particular, policy optimization methods, can be used to learn policies that generalize like combinatorial methods do. We draw on lessons learned from previous combinatorial and deep learning approaches, and extend them in a convenient way. From the former, we model policies as state transition classifiers, as (ground) actions are not general and change from instance to instance. From the latter, we use graph neural networks (GNNs) adapted to deal with relational structures for representing value functions over planning states, and in our case, policies. With these ingredients in place, we find that actor-critic methods can be used to learn policies that generalize almost as well as those obtained using combinatorial approaches while avoiding the scalability bottleneck and the use of feature pools. Moreover, the limitations of the DRL methods on the benchmarks considered have little to do with deep learning or reinforcement learning algorithms, and result from the well-understood expressive limitations of GNNs, and the tradeoff between optimality and generalization (general policies cannot be optimal in some domains). Both of these limitations are addressed without changing the basic DRL methods by adding derived predicates and an alternative cost structure to optimize."

While prior studies have examined this behavior in text-only settings of large language models, existing research on visual or multimodal counterparts remains limited in scope and depth of analysis. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation benchmark, \\textit{PENDULUM}, comprising approximately 2,000 human-curated Visual Question Answering pairs specifically designed to elicit sycophantic responses. The benchmark spans six distinct image domains of varying complexity, enabling a systematic investigation of how image type and inherent challenges influence sycophantic tendencies. Through extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs. we observe substantial variability in model robustness and a pronounced susceptibility to sycophantic and hallucinatory behavior. Furthermore, we propose novel metrics to quantify sycophancy in visual reasoning, offering deeper insights into its manifestations across different multimodal contexts. Our findings highlight the urgent need for developing sycophancy-resilient architectures and training strategies to enhance factual consistency and reliability in future MLLMs. Our proposed dataset with MLLMs response are available at https://github.com/ashikiut/pendulum/."

We demonstrate an unusual acceleration scheme that achieves higher proton energies at lower laser energies by reducing the focal spot size. Through particle-in-cell simulations and theoretical modeling, we find that at small spot sizes (0.8 μm), the proton energy is enhanced by 83.5%, much higher than that under conventional spot sizes (3 μm). This is because the proton acceleration is dominated by electrons driven by an enhanced ponderomotive force at small spot sizes, generating stronger charge-separation fields that propagate faster. To further improve the proton energy, we analytically derive an optimal electron density profile, which enables phase-stable proton acceleration with an energy increased by 60%. These results are robust across parameter variations, suggesting that advanced focusing techniques and optimal plasma profiles could loose the requirement of laser energy, potentially reducing the dependence on large-scale laser facilities for medical and scientific applications."

    "abstract": "When analysing extreme values, two alternative statistical approaches have historically been held in contention: the seminal block maxima method (or annual maxima method, spurred by hydrological applications) and the peaks-over-threshold. Clamoured amongst statisticians as wasteful of potentially informative data, the block maxima method gradually fell into disfavour whilst peaks-over-threshold-based methodologies were ushered to the centre stage of extreme value statistics. This paper proposes a hybrid method which reconciles these two hitherto disconnected approaches. Appealing in its simplicity, our main result introduces a new universal limiting characterisation of extremes that eschews the customary requirement of a sufficiently large block size for the plausible block maxima-fit to an extreme value distribution. We advocate that inference should be drawn solely on larger block maxima, from which practice the mainstream peaks-over-threshold methodology coalesces. The asymptotic properties of the promised hybrid-Hill estimator herald more than its efficiency, but rather that a fully-fledged unified semi-parametric stream of statistics for extreme values is viable. A finite sample simulation study demonstrates that a reduced-bias off-shoot of the hybrid-Hill estimator fares exceptionally well against the incumbent maximum likelihood estimation that relies on a numerical fit to the entire sample of block maxima."

We recast the boundary wavefunctions into the quadratic self-energy-like terms in the functional integration formalism. The resulting generating functional in the modified in-in formalism leads to the propagators that resum infinite diagrams necessary to capture the vacuum-instability effects. The proper-time representations of the propagators reproduce the known expressions from the canonical operator formalism, but our derivation based on the generating functional along the closed-time path clarifies the origin of the addtional proper-time contour and provides a better physical understanding. Finally, as a concrete example of the application, we compute the in-in expectation value of the vector current in a constant electric field, and find that the one-loop calculation results in the expression consistent with the physical intuition."

Within this framework, we accommodate spectral initializations under minimal assumptions on the empirical noise spectrum. In the rectangular setting, where a single rank-one component typically generates multiple informative outliers, we further propose a procedure for combining these outliers under mild non-Gaussian signal assumptions.

Finally, we prove the first expressive separation between unbounded and bounded activations in the presence of linear layers: MPLang with ReLU is strictly more powerful for numerical queries than MPLang with eventually constant activation functions, e.g., truncated ReLU.

The core of stochastic assignment games is defined, with expected payoffs of sellers and buyers in stochastic assignment games as payoffs from a hypothetical \"ideal matching\" that represent sellers' and buyers' expectations under imperfect information. To apply stochastic assignment games to the urban mobility markets, we extend the general stochastic many-to-many assignment game into a stochastic Stackelberg game to model MaaS systems, where the platform is the leader, and users and operators are the followers. The platform sets fares to maximize revenue. Users and operator react to the fare settings to form a stochastic many-to-many assignment game considering both fixed-route services and Mobility-on-Demand (MOD). The Stackelberg game is formulated as a bilevel problem. The lower level is the stochastic many-to-many assignment game between users and operators, shown to yield a coalitional logit model. The upper-level problem is a fare adjustment problem maximizing revenue. An iterative balancing algorithm is proposed to solve the lower-level problem exactly. The bilevel problem is solved through an iterative fare adjusting heuristic, whose solution is shown to be equivalent to the bilevel problem with an additional condition when it converges. Two case studies are conducted. The model can be applied to design MaaS fares maximizing income of the platform while anticipating the selfish behavior and heterogeneity of users and operators. Public agencies can also use the model to manage multimodal transportation systems."

It is found that, at zero spin orbit coupling, ferromagnetism only dominates at small values of anisotropy and coupling constant. Larger values of these parameters favour the formation of altermagnetism. At finite spin-orbit coupling, a paramagnetic phase competes with the other two, and a quantum critical point appears. The phase transition from the paramagnetic to the magnetically ordered phases is of second order, while the phase transition between ferromagnet and altermagnet states is first order.

We aim to assess the feasibility and efficiency of an optical-NIR follow-up strategy for CCSNe discovered via neutrino bursts, by modelling the spatial distribution of events and simulating realistic observational campaigns taking into account the size of the localization error box generated by triangulating the neutrino burst. We modelled the Galactic distribution of CCSNe, including the effects of interstellar extinction, and considered three main progenitor types: Wolf-Rayet stars, red and blue supergiants. We included the shock breakout in the EM signatures that could be detected following the neutrino burst. A population of CCSNe was generated and detected by different networks of neutrino observatories, including IceCube, KM3NeT, Super-Kamiokande, Hyper-Kamiokande, and JUNO. The resulting skymaps were used as input for GWEMOPT to produce optimized follow-up plans with two optical facilities: LSST and the TAROT robotic telescopes. Both LSST and TAROT exhibit comparable detection efficiencies for the simulated CCSN population. However, the TAROT network achieves similar success rates while requiring fewer pointings to cover the CCSN skymap. Our simulations demonstrate that neutrino follow-up campaigns can effectively CCSN optical counterparts using both large and small facilities. Depending on the neutrino network, the median number of pointings for the two tested optical facilities is of the order of 20 to 100 to find the EM emission. The number of images is larger for LSST than for TAROT by a factor of 2 to 4."

    "abstract": "Rigid body dynamics simulators are important tools for the design, analysis and optimization of mechanical systems in a variety of technical and scientific applications. This study examines four different simulation environments (Adams, Simscape, OpenModelica, and VEROSIM), focusing in particular on the comparison of the modeling methods, the numerical solvers, and the treatment of numerical problems that arise especially in closed-loop kinematics (esp. redundant boundary conditions and static equilibrium problem). A novel and complex crane boom of a real forestry machine serves as a practical benchmark application example. The direct comparison of the different solution approaches in the examined simulation tools supports the user in selecting the most suitable tool for his application."

    "abstract": "Egocentric vision systems are becoming widely available, creating new opportunities for human-computer interaction. A core challenge is estimating the wearer's full-body motion from first-person videos, which is crucial for understanding human behavior. However, this task is difficult since most body parts are invisible from the egocentric view. Prior approaches mainly rely on head trajectories, leading to ambiguity, or assume continuously tracked hands, which is unrealistic for lightweight egocentric devices. In this work, we present HaMoS, the first hand-aware, sequence-level diffusion framework that directly conditions on both head trajectory and intermittently visible hand cues caused by field-of-view limitations and occlusions, as in real-world egocentric devices. To overcome the lack of datasets pairing diverse camera views with human motion, we introduce a novel augmentation method that models such real-world conditions. We also demonstrate that sequence-level contexts such as body shape and field-of-view are crucial for accurate motion reconstruction, and thus employ local attention to infer long sequences efficiently. Experiments on public benchmarks show that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and temporal smoothness, demonstrating a practical step toward reliable in-the-wild egocentric 3D motion understanding."

The phase diagram reveals several unconventional features, including a disordered and static absorbing configuration, where no particles overlap, separated by a second-order phase transition to a continuously evolving active hexagonal crystal with collective ring diffusion, which in turn undergoes a first-order phase transition to an active isotropic liquid. The only driving parameter is $ε$, the maximum size of the random repulsive kicks. Small $ε$ facilitates self-organization into an ordered state, but large $ε$ prevents this organization from occurring. This is very different from typical order-disorder transitions, where there are two competing influences, energy and entropy, that drive the transition."

    "abstract": "Collecting large-scale naturalistic driving data is essential for training robust autonomous driving planners. However, real-world datasets often contain a substantial amount of repetitive and low-value samples, which lead to excessive storage costs and bring limited benefits to policy learning. To address this issue, we propose an information-theoretic data pruning method that effectively reduces the training data volume without compromising model performance. Our approach evaluates the trajectory distribution information entropy of driving data and iteratively selects high-value samples that preserve the statistical characteristics of the original dataset in a model-agnostic manner. From a theoretical perspective, we show that maximizing trajectory entropy effectively constrains the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the pruned subset and the original data distribution, thereby maintaining generalization ability. Comprehensive experiments on the NuPlan benchmark with a large-scale imitation learning framework demonstrate that the proposed method can reduce the dataset size by up to 40% while maintaining closed-loop performance. This work provides a lightweight and theoretically grounded approach for scalable data management and efficient policy learning in autonomous driving systems."

Conventional algorithms normally cost enormous time to seek candidates by finding the correct dispersion measures, of which the process is so-called dedispersion. Here we present a novel scheme to identify FRB signals from raw data without dedispersion using Machine Learning (ML). Under the data environment for multibeam receivers, we train the EfficientNet model and achieve both exceeding 92% accuracy and precision in FRB recognition. We find that the searching efficiency can be significantly enhanced without the procedure of dedispersion compared with conventional softwares like TransientX and presto. Specifically, the impact of radio frequency interference (RFI) for single-beam and multibeam data has been investigated, and we find ML can naturally mitigate RFI under the multibeam environment. Finally, we validate the trained model on actual data from the current FRB surveys carried out by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope, which provides considerable potential for real implementation in the future."

In this paper, we introduce a variant of the Profit Maximization Problem where we consider that instead of nodes, benefits are assigned to some of the motifs of the graph, and these benefit values can be earned once a given threshold count of nodes from the motifs is influenced. The goal here is to choose a limited number of nodes for initial activation called seed nodes such that the motif-oriented profit gets maximized. Formally, we call our problem the Motif Oriented Profit Maximization Problem. We show that the problem is NP-hard to solve optimally. We propose a Reverse Reachable Set-based framework to solve our problem. The proposed methodology broadly divides into three steps: KPT Estimation and RR Set generation, Seed Set Selection, and Motif Oriented Profit Estimation. The proposed methodology has been analyzed to understand its time and space requirements. It has been implemented with real-world social network datasets, and the results are reported. We observe that the seed set selected by the proposed solution approaches leads to more profit compared to the seed sets selected by the existing methods.

To close this gap, we propose DeliveryBench, a city-scale embodied benchmark grounded in the real-world profession of food delivery. Food couriers naturally operate under long-horizon objectives (maximizing net profit over hours) while managing diverse constraints, e.g., delivery deadline, transportation expense, vehicle battery, and necessary interactions with other couriers and customers. DeliveryBench instantiates this setting in procedurally generated 3D cities with diverse road networks, buildings, functional locations, transportation modes, and realistic resource dynamics, enabling systematic evaluation of constraint-aware, long-horizon planning. We benchmark a range of VLM-based agents across nine cities and compare them with human players. Our results reveal a substantial performance gap to humans, and find that these agents are short-sighted and frequently break basic commonsense constraints. Additionally, we observe distinct personalities across models (e.g., adventurous GPT-5 vs. conservative Claude), highlighting both the brittleness and the diversity of current VLM-based embodied agents in realistic, constraint-dense environments.

By matching a singular thin shell source to the vacuum solutions, we relate the shell's energy density and pressure to the integration constants of the exterior geometry. We also examine a finite-thickness slab as another matter source supporting the vacuum solution. Through numerical analysis of a quadratic model $f(Q)=Q+αQ^2$ with isotropic matter, we show that the maximum pressure inside the slab generally does not coincide with the geometric center. Moreover, a negative $α$ with larger magnitude leads to higher internal pressure and a thicker slab, while models with positive $α$ are incompatible with a self-gravitating slab of positive pressure."

Our study introduces an innovative methodology leveraging cavity polygon modes within an X-cut thin-film lithium niobate microdisk to achieve highly efficient multi-chromatic Raman microlasers. Specifically, high-Q square modes characterized by two parallel sides oriented perpendicularly relative to the optical axis of lithium niobate crystal were excited. These modes offer distinct advantages, including enhancing both mode-field overlap and improved phase matching, achieved through the utilization of the largest second-order susceptibility component (d_33), which is critical for Raman-quadratic nonlinear interactions. The experimental results highlight significant advancements in multi-wavelength multi-wavelength laser generation, with forward stimulated Raman laser signals exhibiting a high conversion efficiency of up to 65.02% and an impressively narrow integral linewidth of only 5.2 kHz. Simultaneously, our system enables the generation of multi-wavelength Raman-quadratic laser signals across the ~800 nm and ~530 nm spectral bands. These findings are further underscored by an impressive absolute conversion efficiency of 1.33% for the 797.4-nm Raman laser, achieved at a remarkably low pump power of just 1.07 mW. This work not only extends the application scope of cavity polygon modes from single second/third-order nonlinear optical processes to cascaded processes but also establishes a foundation for realizing high-efficiency on-chip multi-chromatic laser sources with versatile functionalities."

    "abstract": "Rising AI electricity demand and persistent landfill methane emissions constitute coupled constraints on U.S. digital infrastructure and decarbonization. While China has achieved a rapid 'de-landfilling' transition through centralized coordination, the U.S. remains structurally 'locked in' to landfilling due to fragmented governance and carbon accounting incentives. This paper proposes a modular legacy landfill remediation framework to address these dual challenges within U.S. institutional constraints. By treating legacy sites as stock resources, the proposed system integrates excavation, screening, and behind-the-meter combined heat and power (CHP) to transform environmental liabilities into resilience assets. A system analysis of a representative AI corridor demonstrates that such modules can mitigate site-level methane by 60-70% and recover urban land, while supplying approximately 20 MW of firm, islandable power. Although contributing only approximately 5% of a hyperscale data center's bulk load, it provides critical microgrid resilience and black-start capability. We conclude that remediation-oriented waste-to-energy should be valued not as a substitute for bulk renewables, but as a strategic control volume for buffering critical loads against grid volatility while resolving long-term environmental liabilities."

In this paper, we introduce a parallelization construction for welded link diagrams and show that it is well defined: if two diagrams represent equivalent welded links, then the corresponding parallel diagrams obtained by our construction are also equivalent. When the two parallel strands are given parallel orientations, the resulting diagram admits a checkerboard coloring, whereas if they are assigned opposite orientations, the diagram is almost classical. Our construction further yields a decomposition in which one component is a copy of the original diagram and the other is a diagram representing a trivial welded link. We also investigate quandle colorings and the fundamental quandle of the parallel diagram, deriving a presentation from that of the original diagram. Finally, we examine conditions under which the parallel diagram is non-split."

The resulting metric function is asymptotically Schwarzschild but carries a characteristic Q^3/(9ξ^2 r^4) correction, where $Q$ is the magnetic charge and $ξ$ is the nonlinear electrodynamics parameter, with the conventional Reissner-Nordström term Q^2/r^2 absent. We analyze the horizon structure and construct three-dimensional embedding diagrams to visualize spatial geometry. Using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, we compute the weak-field deflection angle in vacuum, cold plasma, and axion-plasmon media, finding that the nonlinear electromagnetic corrections reduce the total bending compared to Schwarzschild at fixed Arnowitt-Deser-Misner mass. The gravitational redshift, Joule-Thomson expansion coefficient, and heat capacity are derived, revealing phase transitions and inversion curves that depend on the model parameters. We obtain closed-form expressions for the photon sphere radius, Lyapunov exponent, and shadow size, demonstrating their sensitivity to Q and $ξ$ along observable Intensities. Fully relativistic hydrodynamical simulations of Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion show that the confining geometry produces a $\\sim 40\\%$ enhancement in mass accretion rate relative to Schwarzschild and generates quasi-periodic oscillations with stable 3:2 and 2:1 frequency ratios matching observations from black hole X-ray binaries.

A key enabler of differentiable optimal control is the computation of derivatives of the optimal trajectory with respect to problem parameters, i.e., trajectory derivatives. Previous works compute trajectory derivatives by solving a differential Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) system, and achieve this efficiently by constructing an equivalent auxiliary system. However, we find that directly exploiting the matrix structures in the differential KKT system yields significant computation speed improvements. Motivated by this insight, we propose FastDOC, which applies a Gauss-Newton approximation of Hessian and takes advantage of the resulting block-sparsity and positive semidefinite properties of the matrices involved. These structural properties enable us to accelerate the computationally expensive matrix factorization steps, resulting in a factor-of-two speedup in theoretical computational complexity, and in a synthetic benchmark FastDOC achieves up to a 180% time reduction compared to the baseline method. Finally, we validate the method on an imitation learning task for human-like autonomous driving, where the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FastDOC in practical applications."

    "abstract": "Multiwavelength polarimetry is a powerful tool to probe magnetic field and flow geometries in the relativistic jets of blazars. In this respect, particularly interesting are the sources whose synchrotron emission covers a broad range of frequencies, from radio to X-rays, such as the BL Lac objects of the HSP type. Previous measurements including radio, optical and X-ray data show a clear trend, with the degree of polarization increasing with frequency. Here we report radio, optical and X-ray observations ($Swift$, $Nustar$ and $IXPE$) of 1ES 1101-232 and RGB J0710+591, two blazars belonging to the puzzling subclass of extreme BL Lacs (EHBL). For 1ES 1101-232 we found a strong frequency-dependency of the degree of polarization (with a ratio $Π_X/Π_O\\simeq 5.2$). For RGB J0710+591, IXPE derived a 1$σ$ upper limit $Π_X<11.6\\%$, comparable with the measured optical degree of polarization (average $Π_O\\sim 12\\%$). We discuss the results in the framework of current interpretations and, in particular, we report an improved version of the stratified shock model that is able to reproduce the observed data of both sources."

    "abstract": "Walking has always been a primary mode of transportation and is recognized as an essential activity for maintaining good health. Despite the need for safe walking conditions in urban environments, sidewalks are frequently obstructed by various obstacles that hinder free pedestrian movement. Any object obstructing a pedestrian's path can pose a safety hazard. The advancement of pervasive computing and egocentric vision techniques offers the potential to design systems that can automatically detect such obstacles in real time, thereby enhancing pedestrian safety. The development of effective and efficient identification algorithms relies on the availability of comprehensive and well-balanced datasets of egocentric data. In this work, we introduce the PEDESTRIAN dataset, comprising egocentric data for 29 different obstacles commonly found on urban sidewalks. A total of 340 videos were collected using mobile phone cameras, capturing a pedestrian's point of view. Additionally, we present the results of a series of experiments that involved training several state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms using the proposed dataset, which can be used as a benchmark for obstacle detection and recognition tasks. The dataset can be used for training pavement obstacle detectors to enhance the safety of pedestrians in urban areas."

    "abstract": "Laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) of semi-crystalline polymers such as polyamide-12 (PA12) has found increasing use in various industrial applications. However, achieving high dimensional accuracy remains a significant challenge. Despite the seemingly straightforward layer-by-layer manufacturing concept, the L-PBF process involves complex thermal histories and strongly coupled multiphysics, making the evolution of stress and deformation mechanisms still not fully understood. To address this, a comprehensive three-dimensional thermo-mechanical modeling framework is developed to simulate the L-PBF process of PA12. The model for the first time incorporates transient heat transfer, phase transformation induced volumetric shrinkage, thermoviscoelasticity, and a modified non-isothermal crystallization kinetics. To alleviate the computational burden of part-scale simulations, a dual-mesh strategy is employed to efficiently couple thermal and mechanical fields without compromising numerical accuracy, which also enables the framework to handle L-PBF simulations of arbitrarily complex three-dimensional geometries. Particular attention is paid to the role of mechanical and thermal boundary conditions. Specifically, the underlying powder bed is modeled as a fictitious viscous medium, providing support while permitting upward displacement. Additionally, a radiative heat loss boundary condition, which more closely approximates the actual physical process, is applied to the top powder surface. The incorporation of this radiation effect significantly enhances the crystallization rate and improves the agreement with experimentally measured warpage. The model is validated against experimental warpage data under various preheating temperatures. Furthermore, strain decoupling analysis for the first time reveals that displacement induced by phase transformation is approximately 10 times greater than that caused by thermal expansion, highlighting the dominant role of crystallizationinduced shrinkage in warpage formation. Numerical tests also indicate that warpage is highly sensitive to the preheating target temperature of the PA12 powder bed, while the temperature of the newly recoated powder within the tested range has a limited effect. This work provides a predictive modeling foundation for future optimization of polymer L-PBF processes at part-scale, particularly in controlling deformation and improving dimensional accuracy."

A total of 21 interviews were conducted between October and December 2022, during which 35 individuals were interviewed.

And various engineering fields were represented: civil, electrical, telecommunications, tracks, systems. These interviews were carried out by CentraleSup{é}lec | Universit{é} Paris-Saclay and by SNCF R{é}seau using a structured protocol designed to collect the specific needs of the interviewees for collaboration, as well as the guiding principles that shape both individual work practices and collaboration between professions. The resulting material was analyzed and then synthesized into a conceptual model of a collaborative digital platform for supporting the design and construction phases in a railway infrastructure project.

The system forms a virtual image using an amplitude-modulated LCoS spatial light modulator (AM-SLM), RGB LED illumination, and a high-speed varifocal lens. In the proposed architecture, the LED illumination and varifocal lens diopter changes are triggered in synchrony with the SLM RGB subframes, rendering three depth planes perceptually simultaneously via high-frequency time-multiplexing. Operating at 60 frames per second (fps), the system achieves an effective 180 Hz depth-coded cycle, enabling sharp, multi-depth rendering within a dynamically adjustable depth range from 0.2 m to optical infinity. The system's eyebox is configurable from 1 to 5 mm, while maintaining a fixed spatial location and preserving angular magnification regardless of changes in focus or eyebox size. The designed system features a 9.15-degree field of view. An integrated infrared pupil-tracking module detects non-cataractous regions of the cataractous crystalline lens, and the projected imagery is mechanically steered through those clear zones in real time. The proposed vision simulator supports both subjective simulation of post-surgical vision for patient-specific counseling and objective optical evaluation of IOLs, including resolution and contrast fidelity (e.g., modulation transfer function, contrast transfer function, and defocus curves). By decoupling depth modulation from eyebox position and size, the system offers a modular, portable platform that supports enhanced preoperative planning, personalized IOL selection, objective IOL characterization, and use as a novel research vision tool."

While recent approaches leverage historical temporal fusion to improve performance, we identify a critical safety flaw in this paradigm: it is inherently ``spatially backward-looking.\" These methods predominantly enhance map reconstruction in traversed areas, offering minimal improvement for the unseen road ahead. Crucially, our analysis of downstream planning tasks reveals a severe asymmetry: while rearward perception errors are often tolerable, inaccuracies in the forward region directly precipitate hazardous driving maneuvers. To bridge this safety gap, we propose AMap, a novel framework for Ahead-aware online HD Mapping. We pioneer a ``distill-from-future\" paradigm, where a teacher model with privileged access to future temporal contexts guides a lightweight student model restricted to the current frame. This process implicitly compresses prospective knowledge into the student model, endowing it with ``look-ahead\" capabilities at zero inference-time cost. Technically, we introduce a Multi-Level BEV Distillation strategy with spatial masking and an Asymmetric Query Adaptation module to effectively transfer future-aware representations to the student's static queries. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 benchmark demonstrate that AMap significantly enhances current-frame perception. Most notably, it outperforms state-of-the-art temporal models in critical forward regions while maintaining the efficiency of single current frame inference."

Dissipation functions in terms of the rod angular velocity are derived via a mean field approach for each form of friction, and from these, a Rayleighian for dense suspensions of rigid rods under shear constructed. Derivatives of this Rayleighian with respect to rod angular velocity and velocity gradient give a Smoluchowski equation and stress tensor, respectively. We show that these are representable as perturbations to Doi's model for a sheared liquid crystal. We also suggest a form for the average number of contacts between rods as a function of volume fraction, aspect ratio, and nematic order parameter, generalizing Philipse's random contact equation for disordered packings."

    "abstract": "In the standard model, magnetic reconnection at a vertical current sheet above the flare arcade is key to explaining many aspects of solar eruptions. The supra-arcade region is where the vertical current sheet is supposedly located, and X-ray/EUV emission therein reflects underlying energy release and transport processes, therefore providing valuable insight into the structure and evolution of the current sheet. Previous studies have focused primarily on the impulsive phase of flares, but phenomena in the decay phase are also crucial for understanding the complete flaring scenario. In this paper, we investigated an M6.7-class limb flare that occurred on August 28, 2022, combining observations from the Solar Orbiter (SolO) and Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Coronal X-ray sources are continually observed by the Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) onboard SolO for over two hours, revealing a multi-phase evolution with varying velocities and multiple substructures, with higher-energy components consistently appearing at higher altitudes. Such a height-energy relation is notably observed in a double coronal source during the decay-phase, which is dominated by thermal emission. The energy distribution of the double source distinguish itself from previous studies that showed a symmetric distribution, with the higher-energy components being closer to the center of the double source during the impulsive phase. Obtained from two opposite side-on perspectives on the supra-arcade region, these findings reveal the spatio-temporal complexity of the energy release process in the post-flare current sheet during the decay phase."

    "abstract": "Decentralized federated learning (DFL) enables collaborative model training across edge devices without centralized coordination, offering resilience against single points of failure. However, statistical heterogeneity arising from non-identically distributed local data creates a fundamental challenge: nodes must learn personalized models adapted to their local distributions while selectively collaborating with compatible peers. Existing approaches either enforce a single global model that fits no one well, or rely on heuristic peer selection mechanisms that cannot distinguish between peers with genuinely incompatible data distributions and those with valuable complementary knowledge. We present Murmura, a framework that leverages evidential deep learning to enable trust-aware model personalization in DFL. Our key insight is that epistemic uncertainty from Dirichlet-based evidential models directly indicates peer compatibility: high epistemic uncertainty when a peer's model evaluates local data reveals distributional mismatch, enabling nodes to exclude incompatible influence while maintaining personalized models through selective collaboration. Murmura introduces a trust-aware aggregation mechanism that computes peer compatibility scores through cross-evaluation on local validation samples and personalizes model aggregation based on evidential trust with adaptive thresholds. Evaluation on three wearable IoT datasets (UCI HAR, PAMAP2, PPG-DaLiA) demonstrates that Murmura reduces performance degradation from IID to non-IID conditions compared to baseline (0.9% vs. 19.3%), achieves 7.4$\\times$ faster convergence, and maintains stable accuracy across hyperparameter choices. These results establish evidential uncertainty as a principled foundation for compatibility-aware personalization in decentralized heterogeneous environments."

Traditional blocklisting technologies can block malicious users, but this comes at the expense of identity privacy. The anonymous blocklisting has emerged as an effective mechanism to restrict the abuse of freedom of speech while protecting user identity privacy. However, the state-of-the-art anonymous blocklisting schemes suffer from either poor dynamism or low efficiency. In this paper, we propose $\\mathsf{ShadowBlock}$, an efficient dynamic anonymous blocklisting scheme. Specifically, we utilize the pseudorandom function and cryptographic accumulator to construct the public blocklisting, enabling users to prove they are not on the blocklisting in an anonymous manner. To improve verification efficiency, we design an aggregation zero-knowledge proof mechanism that converts multiple verification operations into a single one. In addition, we leverage the accumulator's property to achieve efficient updates of the blocklisting, i.e., the original proof can be reused with minimal updates rather than regenerating the entire proof. Experiments show that $\\mathsf{ShadowBlock}$ has better dynamics and efficiency than the existing schemes. Finally, the discussion on applications indicates that $\\mathsf{ShadowBlock}$ also holds significant value and has broad prospects in emerging fields such as cross-chain identity management."

We clarify that this coefficient is directly calculable from the structure of the equation obeyed by the field perturbation, and requires no knowledge of the full solution. The derived formula allows us to establish some general results on the existence of logarithmic running. In particular, we show that any static and spherically symmetric spacetime that modifies the Schwarzschild or Reissner-Nordström solutions in a perturbative way must have non-zero logarithmic Love numbers. This applies for instance to all regular black hole metrics. On the other hand, our analysis highlights the importance of the perturbativity assumption: without it, we find explicit black hole solutions beyond general relativity with exactly zero running. We also illustrate the advantage of our method by recovering and extending the known results for the Hayward metric."

Using data from over 3,000 participants across 43 Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center database, PROGRESS substantially outperforms Cox proportional hazards, Random Survival Forests, and gradient boosting methods for survival prediction. Risk stratification identifies patient groups with seven-fold differences in conversion rates, enabling clinically meaningful treatment prioritization. Leave-one-center-out validation demonstrates robust generalizability, with survival discrimination remaining strong across held-out sites despite heterogeneous measurement conditions spanning four decades of assay technologies.

To overcome these challenges, we present MambaMDN, a dual-domain framework for multi-contrast MRI reconstruction. Our approach first employs fully-sampled reference K-space data to complete the undersampled target data, generating structurally aligned but modality-mixed inputs. Subsequently, we develop a Mamba-based modality disentanglement network to extract and remove reference-specific features from the mixed representation. Furthermore, we introduce an iterative refinement mechanism to progressively enhance reconstruction accuracy through repeated feature purification.

Most existing methods rely on embedding entities and relations into continuous geometric spaces and answer queries via differentiable set operations. While effective for simple query patterns, these approaches often struggle to generalize to complex queries involving multiple operators, deeper reasoning chains, or heterogeneous KG schemas. We propose ROG (Reasoning Over knowledge Graphs with large language models), an ensemble-style framework that combines query-aware KG neighborhood retrieval with large language model (LLM)-based chain-of-thought reasoning. ROG decomposes complex FOL queries into sequences of simpler sub-queries, retrieves compact, query-relevant subgraphs as contextual evidence, and performs step-by-step logical inference using an LLM, avoiding the need for task-specific embedding optimization. Experiments on standard KG reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ROG consistently outperforms strong embedding-based baselines in terms of mean reciprocal rank (MRR), with particularly notable gains on high-complexity query types. These results suggest that integrating structured KG retrieval with LLM-driven logical reasoning offers a robust and effective alternative for complex KG reasoning tasks."

Unlike conventional cascaded systems, JoyVoice employs a unified E2E-Transformer-DiT architecture that utilizes autoregressive hidden representations directly for diffusion inputs, enabling holistic end-to-end optimization. We further propose a MM-Tokenizer operating at a low bitrate of 12.5 Hz, which integrates multitask semantic and MMSE losses to effectively model both semantic and acoustic information. Additionally, the model incorporates robust text front-end processing via large-scale data perturbation. Experiments show that JoyVoice achieves state-of-the-art results in multilingual generation (Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean) and zero-shot voice cloning. JoyVoice achieves top-tier results on both the Seed-TTS-Eval Benchmark and multi-speaker long-form conversational voice cloning tasks, demonstrating superior audio quality and generalization. It achieves significant improvements in prosodic continuity for long-form speech, rhythm richness in multi-speaker conversations, paralinguistic naturalness, besides superior intelligibility.

    "abstract": "Locating and retrieving objects from scene-level point clouds is a challenging problem with broad applications in robotics and augmented reality. This task is commonly formulated as open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation. Although recent methods demonstrate strong performance, they depend heavily on SAM and CLIP to generate and classify 3D instance masks from images accompanying the point cloud, leading to substantial computational overhead and slow processing that limit their deployment in real-world settings. Open-YOLO 3D alleviates this issue by using a real-time 2D detector to classify class-agnostic masks produced directly from the point cloud by a pretrained 3D segmenter, eliminating the need for SAM and CLIP and significantly reducing inference time. However, Open-YOLO 3D often fails to generalize to object categories that appear infrequently in the 3D training data. In this paper, we propose a method that generates 3D instance masks for novel objects from RGB images guided by a 2D open-vocabulary detector. Our approach inherits the 2D detector's ability to recognize novel objects while maintaining efficient classification, enabling fast and accurate retrieval of rare instances from open-ended text queries.

Specializing further to cuboids that are required to have a side length of one we obtain more precise upper bounds. Such upper bounds are compared to examples of configurations having relatively large chromatic numbers, leading to a complete determination of some of these chromatic numbers, but in general, the gaps between our upper and lower bounds are rather wide. In particular, we know of no such configuration of any size leading to a chromatic number above 6."

However, despite significant progress, LVLMs still suffer from severe hallucination issues in object recognition tasks. These models often fail to accurately identify certain objects, leading to text generation that appears fluent but does not correspond to the visual content, which can have serious consequences in real-world applications. Recently, several methods have been proposed to alleviate LVLM hallucinations, but most focus solely on reducing hallucinations in the language modality. To mitigate hallucinations in both the language and visual modalities, we introduce Hallucination Disentangled Decoding (HDD) method that requires no training. HDD enhances the original image by segmenting it and selecting images that augment the original, while also utilizing a blank image to eliminate language prior hallucinations in both the original and segmented images. This design not only reduces the model's dependence on language priors but also enhances its visual performance. (Code: https://github.com/rickeyhhh/Hallucination-Disentangled-Decoding)"

We demonstrate through extensive experimentation that these concepts can be effectively transferred to smaller models, irrespective of their family (e.g., Phi, Llama, Qwen), leading to performance improvements across a wide range of tasks. Furthermore, we introduce inference-time scaling to enhance performance by dynamically adjusting the steering intensity which has resulted in a 7-15\\% of accuracy improvement for Qwen3-0.6B."

The frequency-dependent circular polarization of single pulses, with high signal-to-noise ratios, is recorded by the FAST, which shows great diversity, and we are trying an effort to understand such circular polarization based on the wave mode coupling in the limiting polarization region, and consequently to constrain the dynamical parameters. By quantitatively comparing models with data using Bayesian analysis, it is found that the plasma multiplicity is approximately between $10^0$ and $10^{2}$, while the Lorentz factor of the particles between $10^{0.5}$ and $10^{2}$. This study presents a systematic framework for integrating pulsar emission theories with observational data."

Deep learning-based watermarking has improved robustness to diffusion-based image editing, but a gap remains when a watermarked image is converted to video by image-to-video (I2V), in which per-frame watermark detection weakens. I2V has quickly advanced from short, jittery clips to multi-second, temporally coherent scenes, and it now serves not only content creation but also world-modeling and simulation workflows, making cross-modal watermark recovery crucial. We present WaTeRFlow, a framework tailored for robustness under I2V. It consists of (i) FUSE (Flow-guided Unified Synthesis Engine), which exposes the encoder-decoder to realistic distortions via instruction-driven edits and a fast video diffusion proxy during training, (ii) optical-flow warping with a Temporal Consistency Loss (TCL) that stabilizes per-frame predictions, and (iii) a semantic preservation loss that maintains the conditioning signal. Experiments across representative I2V models show accurate watermark recovery from frames, with higher first-frame and per-frame bit accuracy and resilience when various distortions are applied before or after video generation."

Recently, the observation of charge transfer and interfacial polarons in superconducting interface has aroused extensive research interest. However, experimental data to investigate charge transfer on the CuO2 plane and the presence of polarons are still missing. Here we conduct extensive research on the optical and electronic properties of two-dimensional material supported on copper-based superconductors. Unlike monolayer-WSe2 on other substrates, monolayer-WSe2 on La1.85Sr0.15CuO4 (WSe2/LSCO) produces a special band structure. Using high-resolution spectroscopic ellipsometry and density functional theory calculation methods, the special electronic structure can be attributed to the formation of the interfacial small polaron at the WSe2/LSCO interface which is driven by charge transfer between the CuO2 plane of the cuprate superconductor and WSe2. In addition, the structural phase transition of the LSCO substrate was observed to reduce the electron-hole (e-h) interaction of WSe2. These findings may spur future investigations on the effect of the interfacial polaron on the superconductivity of cuprates, and highlight the significant influence of interface effects on the electronic structure of WSe2 films. It provides an effective method to further explore the intrinsic relationship between interfacial polarons and superconductivity."

Automatic and precise detection of behaviorally relevant neuron activity from the recordings is critical to study the mapping of brain activity in organisms. However a perpetual bottleneck to this problem is the manual segmentation which is time and labor intensive and lacks generalizability. To this end, we present a Bayesian Deep Learning Framework to detect neuronal activities in 4D spatio-temporal data obtained by light sheet microscopy. Our approach accounts for the use of temporal information by calculating pixel wise correlation maps and combines it with spatial information given by the mean summary image. The Bayesian framework not only produces probability segmentation maps but also models the uncertainty pertaining to active neuron detection. To evaluate the accuracy of our framework we implemented the test of reproducibility to assert the generalization of the network to detect neuron activity. The network achieved a mean Dice Score of 0.81 relative to the synthetic Ground Truth obtained by Otsu's method and a mean Dice Score of 0.79 between the first and second run for test of reproducibility. Our method successfully deployed can be used for rapid detection of active neuronal activities for behavioural studies."

    "abstract": "Business growth is a goal of great importance for its both private and social benefits. Many firms view business growth as an imperative for their survival, stability, and long-term success. Business growth can be socially beneficial, too, as it enables businesses to expand into new territories where they can stimulate economic growth and development, creates more jobs, increase living standards, and better serve their communities by giving back more through Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives. Business growth must be planned reasonably and optimally so that it can effectively achieve its critical ambitions in business practice. The current common practices for planning the supply side of business growth are usually ad-hoc and lack well-established mathematical and economic foundations. The present paper argues that business growth planning can be pursued more structurally, reliably, and meaningfully within the framework of Growth Accounting (GA), which was first introduced by Economics Nobel Laureate Robert Solow to study economic growth. It is shown that, although GA was initially put forth as a procedure to explain \"economic growth\" ex-post, it can similarly be used to plan \"business growth\" ex-ante when a general backward approach is taken in its procedure-called Backward Growth Accounting (BGA) in this paper. Taking this well-established economic-mathematical approach to planning business growth will enhance the current practices conceptually and structurally, as it is built on the basis of economic logic and mathematical tools. BGA can help businesses identify and plan for key drivers of output growth and assess shortcomings in the growth process, such as poor productivity, inadequate labor utilization, or insufficient capital investment. The paper outlines an eight-step procedure for planning business growth using BGA and includes appendices with real-world examples."

We study the training dynamics of neural networks under DP by comparing Gradient Descent (GD), and Adam to their privacy-preserving variants. Prior work shows that these optimizers exhibit distinct stability dynamics: full-batch methods train at the Edge of Stability (EoS), while mini-batch and adaptive methods exhibit analogous edge-of-stability behavior. At these regimes, the training loss and the sharpness--the maximum eigenvalue of the training loss Hessian--exhibit certain characteristic behavior. In DP training, per-example gradient clipping and Gaussian noise modify the update rule, and it is unclear whether these stability patterns persist. We analyze how clipping and noise change sharpness and loss evolution and show that while DP generally reduces the sharpness and can prevent optimizers from fully reaching the classical stability thresholds, patterns from EoS and analogous adaptive methods stability regimes persist, with the largest learning rates and largest privacy budgets approaching, and sometimes exceeding, these thresholds. These findings highlight the unpredictability introduced by DP in neural network optimization."

We observe an enhanced diode effect when a top gate depletes the 2DEG in the region of the hole arrays, while preserving the overall supercurrent. Theoretical analysis shows that the physics behind this phenomenon is the increased difference of transparency between different bands in the junction. These results highlight a new pathway for engineering and controlling nonreciprocal superconducting transport in hybrid systems."

    "abstract": "Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) enable fully parallel token decoding but often remain impractical at inference time due to the many denoising iterations required to refine an information-free, fully masked initialization into coherent text. Most existing acceleration methods focus on traversing this generative trajectory more efficiently via improved solvers or sampling strategies. We advance a complementary perspective: shorten the trajectory itself by starting closer to the target distribution through context-aware initialization. We propose a training-free interface that injects prompt-conditioned priors from a lightweight auxiliary model into the diffusion initialization, and instantiate it with two mechanisms: discrete token injection and representation-level embedding interpolation. Because injected priors can be imperfect and unmask-only decoding can over-commit early, we also introduce a simple confidence-based remasking mechanism as a form of prior skepticism. Preliminary evidence on GSM8K suggests that context-aware initialization can substantially reduce denoising iterations (about 35\\% fewer function evaluations in our setting), while also exposing a key open challenge: naive warm-starting can degrade final accuracy relative to strong diffusion baselines. We use these findings to motivate a research agenda around calibration, revision mechanisms, and representation alignment for reliable warm-started diffusion decoding."

To address them, we propose TaxoNet, an embedding-based encoder with a dual-margin penalization loss that strengthens learning signals from rare underrepresented taxa while mitigating the dominance of overrepresented ones, directly confronting interrelated challenges. We evaluate our method on diverse ecological domains: Google Auto-Arborist (urban trees), iNat-Plantae (Plantae observations from various ecosystems in iNaturalist-2019), and NAFlora-Mini (a curated herbarium collection). Our model consistently outperforms baselines, particularly for rare taxa, establishing a strong foundation for open-world plant taxonomic monitoring.

This scenario can be formulated as an adversarial team game in AI literature, where a team of players play against an adversary. However, previous solution concepts for this game assume that team players have the same utility functions, which cannot cover the real-world case that countries do not always have the same utility function. This paper argues that studying adversarial team games should not ignore the difference in utility functions of team players. We show that ignoring the difference in utility functions of team players could cause the computed equilibrium to be unstable. To show the benefit of considering the difference in utility functions of team players, we introduce a novel solution concept called Co-opetition Equilibrium (CoE) for the adversarial team game. In this game, team players with different utility functions (i.e., cooperation between team players) correlate their actions to play against the adversary (i.e., competition between the team and the adversary). We further introduce the team-maximizing CoE, which is a CoE but maximizes the team's utility among all CoEs. Both equilibria can overcome the issue caused by ignoring the difference in utility functions of team players. We further show the opportunities for theoretical and algorithmic contributions based on our position of considering the difference in utility functions of team players."

Disengagement events on these routes are often geographically concentrated and typically arise from planner failures in highly interactive regions.

To address this issue, this paper presents a Disengagement-Triggered Contrastive Continual Learning (DTCCL) framework that enables autonomous buses to improve planning policies through real-world operation. Each disengagement triggers cloud-based data augmentation that generates positive and negative samples by perturbing surrounding agents while preserving route context. Contrastive learning refines policy representations to better distinguish safe and unsafe behaviors, and continual updates are applied in a cloud-edge loop without human supervision. Experiments on urban bus routes demonstrate that DTCCL improves overall planning performance by 48.6 percent compared with direct retraining, validating its effectiveness for scalable, closed-loop policy improvement in autonomous public transport."

This minimal model thus establishes a new paradigm for complex synchronization landscapes arising from higher-order interactions."

    "abstract": "Fluid antenna system (FAS) represents the concept of treating antenna as a reconfigurable physical-layer resource to broaden system design and network optimization and inspire next-generation reconfigurable antennas. FAS can unleash new degree of freedom (DoF) via antenna reconfigurations for novel spatial diversity. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) on the other hand can reshape wireless propagation environments but often face limitations from double path-loss and minimal signal processing capability when operating independently. This article envisions a transformative FAS-RIS integrated architecture for future smart city networks, uniting the adaptability of FAS with the environmental control of RIS. The proposed framework has five key applications: FAS-enabled base stations (BSs) for large-scale beamforming, FAS-equipped user devices with finest spatial diversity, and three novel RIS paradigms -- fluid RIS (FRIS) with reconfigurable elements, FAS-embedded RIS as active relays, and enormous FAS (E-FAS) exploiting surface waves on facades to re-establish line-of-sight (LoS) communication. A two-timescale control mechanism coordinates network-level beamforming with rapid, device-level adaptation. Applications spanning from simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) to integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), with challenges in co-design, channel modeling, and optimization, are discussed. This article concludes with simulation results demonstrating the robustness and effectiveness of the FAS-RIS system."

Despite the development of numerous mature super-resolution algorithms, the inherent end-fire effect problem in fixed antenna arrays remains inadequately addressed. This work proposed a novel array architecture composed of fluid antennas. By exploiting the spatial reconfigurability of their positions to equivalently modulate the array steering vector and integrating it with the classical MUSIC algorithm, this approach achieved high-precision DOA estimation. Simulation results demonstrated that the proposed method delivers outstanding estimation performance even in highly challenging end-fire regions."

    "abstract": "Object recognition has become prevalent across various industries. However, most existing applications are limited to identifying objects alone, without considering their associated states. The ability to recognize both the state and object simultaneously remains less common. One approach to address this is by treating state and object as a single category during training. However, this approach poses challenges in data collection and training since it requires comprehensive data for all possible combinations. Compositional Zero-shot Learning (CZSL) emerges as a viable solution by treating the state and object as distinct categories during training. CZSL facilitates the identification of novel compositions even in the absence of data for every conceivable combination. The current state-of-the-art method, KG-SP, addresses this issue by training distinct classifiers for states and objects, while leveraging a semantic model to evaluate the plausibility of composed compositions. However, KG-SP's accuracy in state and object recognition can be further improved, and it fails to consider the weighting of states and objects during composition. In this study, we propose SASOW, an enhancement of KG-SP that considers the weighting of states and objects while improving composition recognition accuracy. First, we introduce self-attention mechanisms into the classifiers for states and objects, leading to enhanced accuracy in recognizing both. Additionally, we incorporate the weighting of states and objects during composition to generate more reasonable and accurate compositions. Our validation process involves testing SASOW on three established benchmark datasets. Experimental outcomes affirm when compared against OW-CZSL approach, KG-SP, SASOW showcases improvements of 2.1%, 1.7%, and 0.4% in terms of accuracy for unseen compositions across the MIT-States, UT Zappos, and C-GQA datasets, respectively."

This approach, however, introduces additional complexity and latency due to the cascaded system design. In response to this challenge, there is a growing trend to develop end-to-end (E2E) ASR models capable of directly predicting punctuation and capitalization, though this area remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose an enhanced fully formatted E2E ASR model that leverages knowledge distillation (KD) through multi-codebook vector quantization (MVQ). Experimental results demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms previous works in word error rate (WER) both with and without punctuation and capitalization, and in punctuation error rate (PER). Evaluations on the LibriSpeech-PC test-clean and test-other subsets show that our model achieves state-of-the-art results."

However, their theoretical foundation relies on a complex, multi-stage process of continuous-time modeling and subsequent discretization, which can obscure intuition. We introduce a direct, first-principles framework for constructing discrete-time SSMs that is both flexible and modular. Our approach is based on a novel lag operator, which geometrically derives the discrete-time recurrence by measuring how the system's basis functions \"slide\" and change from one timestep to the next. The resulting state matrices are computed via a single inner product involving this operator, offering a modular design space for creating novel SSMs by flexibly combining different basis functions and time-warping schemes. To validate our approach, we demonstrate that a specific instance exactly recovers the recurrence of the influential HiPPO model. Numerical simulations confirm our derivation, providing new theoretical tools for designing flexible and robust sequence models."

In conventional thermodynamic trade-off relations, the quantities of interest are linear in the underlying probability distribution. Some important information-theoretic quantities, such as Rényi entropies, are nonlinear; however, such nonlinearities are generally more difficult to handle. Inspired by replica techniques used in quantum information and spin-glass theory, we construct Markovian dynamics of identical replicas and derive a lower bound on relative moments in terms of the dynamical activity. We apply our general result to two scenarios. First, for a random walker on a network, we derive an upper bound on the Rényi entropy of the position distribution of the walker, which quantifies the extent of diffusion on the network. Remarkably, the bound is expressed solely in terms of escape rate from the initial node, and thus depends only on local information. Second, we consider trajectory observables in Markov processes and obtain an upper bound on the Rényi entropy of the distribution of these observables, again in terms of the dynamical activity. This provides an entropic characterization of uncertainty that generalizes existing variance-based thermodynamic uncertainty relations."

By utilizing these expressions, we expect to make it easier to create programs that compute fast and highly precise for the quantum information quantities of subsystems within lattices."

We hypothesize that training a generative model exclusively on half-objects, obtained by reflecting one half of the shapes along the x=0 plane, enables the model to learn a rich distribution of partial geometries which, when reflected during generation, yield complete shapes that are both visually plausible and geometrically symmetric. To test this, we construct a new dataset of half-objects from three ShapeNet classes (Airplane, Car, and Chair) and train two generative models. Experiments demonstrate that the generated shapes are symmetrical and consistent, compared with the generated objects from the original model and the original dataset objects."

Across four benchmarks (ALFWorld, WebShop, TravelPlanner, InterCodeSQL), MACLA achieves 78.1 percent average performance, outperforming all baselines. On ALFWorld unseen tasks, MACLA reaches 90.3 percent with 3.1 percent positive generalization.

We extract conformal data, including the boundary entropies and the scaling dimensions of boundary primary operators, which characterize the boundary universality class.

    "abstract": "We propose a deterministic algorithm based on Coppersmith's method that employs a rank-3 lattice to address factoring-related problems. An interesting aspect of our approach is that we utilize the second vector in the LLL-reduced basis to avoid trivial collisions in the Baby-step Giant-step method, rather than the shortest vector as is commonly used in the literature. Our results are as follows: 1. Compared to the result by Harvey and Hittmeir (Math. Comp. 91 (2022), 1367 - 1379), who achieved a complexity of O( N^(1/5) log^(16/5) N / (log log N)^(3/5)) for factoring a semiprime N = pq, we demonstrate that in the balanced p and q case, the complexity can be improved to O( N^(1/5) log^(13/5) N / (log log N)^(3/5) ). 2. For factoring sums and differences of powers, that is, numbers of the form N = a^n plus or minus b^n, we improve Hittmeir's result (Math. Comp. 86 (2017), 2947 - 2954) from O( N^(1/4) log^(3/2) N ) to O( N^(1/5) log^(13/5) N ). 3. For the problem of finding r-power divisors, that is, finding all integers p such that p^r divides N, Harvey and Hittmeir (Proceedings of ANTS XV, Research in Number Theory 8 (2022), no. 4, Paper No. 94) recently directly applied Coppersmith's method and achieved a complexity of O( N^(1/(4r)) log^(10+epsilon) N / r^3 ). By using faster LLL-type algorithms and sieving on small primes, we improve their result to O( N^(1/(4r)) log^(7+3 epsilon) N / ((log log N minus log(4r)) r^(2+epsilon)) ). The worst-case running time for their algorithm occurs when N = p^r q with q on the order of N^(1/2). By focusing on this case and employing our rank-3 lattice approach, we achieve a complexity of O( r^(1/4) N^(1/(4r)) log^(5/2) N ). In conclusion, we offer a new perspective on these problems, which we hope will provide further insights."

Yet, a large fraction of reported KTaO3-based 2DEGs has been realized through chemically complex overlayers that both generate carriers and can obscure the native electronic structure, making spectroscopic access to the underlying 2DEG challenging. Here, we demonstrate a simple and direct method to generate a superconducting 2DEG on KTaO3(111) using Mg-induced surface reduction in molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE). Mg has an extremely low sticking coefficient at elevated temperatures, enabling the formation of an ultrathin (less than 1-2 monolayers) MgO layer that is transparent to soft x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). This allows direct measurement of the surface chemistry and low-energy electronic structure of the pristine reduced surface without the need for a several-nanometer-thick capping layer. XPS shows clear reduction of Ta5+ to lower oxidation states, while ARPES reveals a parabolic Ta 5d conduction band with an approximately 150 meV bandwidth and additional subband features arising from quantum confinement. Transport measurements confirm a superconducting transition below 0.6 K. Together, these results demonstrate a chemically straightforward and controllable pathway for fabricating spectroscopically accessible superconducting 2DEGs on KTaO3(111), and provide a powerful new platform for investigating the mechanisms underlying orientation-dependent superconductivity in KTaO3-based oxide interfaces."

Guided by phase-matching profiles, we propose design strategies to improve the phase coherence, particularly by introducing a high-index waveguide layer that confines the fundamental field in the nonlinear material to regions where the harmonic Green's function varies slowly. This configuration achieves a PMF exceeding 0.91, approaching the ideal value of unity, and yields a record SHG efficiency of 26.7% at a low pump intensity of 2 kW/$\\mathrm{cm}^2$.

These lines reveal that JADES-GS-z14-0 has low dust attenuation with a recent star-formation rate of $\\mathrm{SFR} \\approx 10 \\pm 2\\ M_{\\odot} / \\mathrm{yr}$, star-formation rate surface density of $Σ_{\\mathrm{SFR}} \\approx 23 \\pm 5\\ M_{\\odot}/\\mathrm{yr}/\\mathrm{kpc}^{2}$, and ionizing photon production efficiency of $ξ_{\\mathrm{ion}} \\approx 10^{25.3 \\pm 0.1}\\ \\mathrm{Hz/erg}$. Using standard strong-line diagnostics, we infer a gas-phase oxygen abundance of $[\\mathrm{O/H}] \\approx -1.1 \\pm 0.4$ ($\\approx 10\\%\\ Z_{\\odot}$), carbon-to-oxygen ratio of $[\\mathrm{C/O}] \\approx -0.4 \\pm 0.4$, ionization parameter of $\\mathrm{log}_{10}(U) \\gtrsim -2.4$, and density of $n_{\\mathrm{H}} \\approx 720 \\pm 210\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$. Using detailed photoionization modeling, we instead derive $[\\mathrm{O/H}] \\approx -0.3_{-0.4}^{+0.4}$ ($\\approx 50\\%\\ Z_{\\odot}$) and $\\mathrm{log}_{10}(U) \\approx -1.5_{-0.4}^{+0.3}$. The inferred properties of JADES-GS-z14-0 are similar to those measured for similarly luminous galaxies at $z > 10$ with previous MIRI/Spectroscopy, such as GHZ2/GLASSz12, GN-z11, and MACS0647-JD1. Existing simulations are unable to reproduce the empirical and inferred properties of JADES-GS-z14-0. This work demonstrates an important step toward understanding the formation of the first stars and heavy elements in the Universe. [Abridged]"

We address this by introducing GenEnv, a framework that establishes a difficulty-aligned co-evolutionary game between an agent and a scalable, generative environment simulator. Unlike traditional methods that evolve models on static datasets, GenEnv instantiates a dataevolving: the simulator acts as a dynamic curriculum policy, continuously generating tasks specifically tailored to the agent's ``zone of proximal development''. This process is guided by a simple but effective $α$-Curriculum Reward, which aligns task difficulty with the agent's current capabilities. We evaluate GenEnv on five benchmarks, including API-Bank, ALFWorld, BFCL, Bamboogle, and TravelPlanner. Across these tasks, GenEnv improves agent performance by up to \\textbf{+40.3\\%} over 7B baselines and matches or exceeds the average performance of larger models. Compared to Gemini 2.5 Pro-based offline data augmentation, GenEnv achieves better performance while using 3.3$\\times$ less data. By shifting from static supervision to adaptive simulation, GenEnv provides a data-efficient pathway for scaling agent capabilities."

    "abstract": "Existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches treat large language models (LLMs) as a single unified policy, overlooking their internal mechanisms. Understanding how policy evolves across layers and modules is therefore crucial for enabling more targeted optimization and raveling out complex reasoning mechanisms. In this paper, we decompose the language model policy by leveraging the intrinsic split of the Transformer residual stream and the equivalence between the composition of hidden states with the unembedding matrix and the resulting samplable policy. This decomposition reveals Internal Layer Policies, corresponding to contributions from individual layers, and Internal Modular Policies, which align with the self-attention and feed-forward network (FFN) components within each layer. By analyzing the entropy of internal policy, we find that: (a) Early layers keep high entropy for exploration, top layers converge to near-zero entropy for refinement, with convergence patterns varying across model series. (b) LLama's prediction space rapidly converges in the final layer, whereas Qwen-series models, especially Qwen3, exhibit a more human-like, progressively structured reasoning pattern. Motivated by these findings, we propose Bottom-up Policy Optimization (BuPO), a novel RL paradigm that directly optimizes the internal layer policy during early training. By aligning training objective at lower layer, BuPO reconstructs foundational reasoning capabilities and achieves superior performance. Extensive experiments on complex reasoning benchmarks demonstrates the effectiveness of our method. Our code is available at https://github.com/Trae1ounG/BuPO."

    "abstract": "Real-world wireless data are expensive to collect and often lack sufficient expert demonstrations, causing existing offline RL methods to overfit suboptimal behaviors and exhibit unstable performance. To address this issue, we propose CORE, an offline RL framework specifically designed for wireless environments. CORE identifies latent expert trajectories from noisy datasets via behavior embedding clustering, and trains a conditional variational autoencoder with a contrastive objective to separate expert and non-expert behaviors in latent space. Based on the learned representations, CORE constructs compensable rewards that reflect expert-likelihood, effectively guiding policy learning under limited or imperfect supervision. More broadly, this work represents one of the early systematic explorations of offline RL in wireless networking, where prior adoption remains limited. Beyond introducing offline RL techniques to this domain, we further examine intrinsic wireless data characteristics and develop a domain-aligned algorithm that explicitly accounts for their structural properties. While offline RL has not yet been fully established as a standard methodology in the wireless community, our study aims to provide foundational insights and empirical evidence to support its broader acceptance."

We present a compact laboratory setup for the characterization of photosensors under controlled, low-light conditions. Specifically, we demonstrate its use with photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) operated at the SPE-level, using picosecond laser pulses and waveform digitization to determine key PMT properties. Measurements as a function of supply voltage and temperature ($-50^\\circ$C to $+20^\\circ$C) are performed on ET Enterprises 9821(Q)B tubes and a Hamamatsu R9980 assembly, which show exponential gain-voltage behavior and device-to-device variation. Cooling increases the gain by $\\sim 0.1\\,\\%/^\\circ$C, while the transit time spread (TTS) and peak-to-valley ratio (P/V) exhibit no clear temperature dependence. TTS decreases with voltage. Late pulses remain at the percent level and prepulses at the sub-percent level. Cable length affects both apparent gain and TTS. A model-independent, data-driven self-convolution method is introduced to quantify double photoelectron contributions from pulse charge spectra. The procedures provide a reproducible, practice-oriented reference for SPE-level PMT characterization and can be extended to other photosensor types."

We introduce augmented compositing, a new task that synthesizes realistic, semi-transparent environmental effects conditioned on text prompts and input video layers, while preserving the original scene. To address this task, we present Over++, a video effect generation framework that makes no assumptions about camera pose, scene stationarity, or depth supervision. We construct a paired effect dataset tailored for this task and introduce an unpaired augmentation strategy that preserves text-driven editability. Our method also supports optional mask control and keyframe guidance without requiring dense annotations. Despite training on limited data, Over++ produces diverse and realistic environmental effects and outperforms existing baselines in both effect generation and scene preservation."

While supervised learning approaches dominate this field, the scarcity and high cost of annotated data for new domains present significant barriers. We argue that leveraging large language models (LLMs) in a zero-shot setting is a practical alternative where resources for data annotation are limited. In this work, we propose a novel Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting technique that utilises an intermediate Unified Meaning Representation (UMR) to structure the reasoning process for the ACSA task. We evaluate this UMR-based approach against a standard CoT baseline across three models (Qwen3-4B, Qwen3-8B, and Gemini-2.5-Pro) and four diverse datasets. Our findings suggest that UMR effectiveness may be model-dependent. Whilst preliminary results indicate comparable performance for mid-sized models such as Qwen3-8B, these observations warrant further investigation, particularly regarding the potential applicability to smaller model architectures. Further research is required to establish the generalisability of these findings across different model scales."

Using an implicit Fenchel formulation of convex conjugation, our approach facilitates an efficient gradient-based framework for the minimization of approximation errors and, as a byproduct, also provides a posteriori error estimates for the approximation quality. Numerical experiments demonstrate our method's ability to deliver accurate results across different high-dimensional examples. Moreover, by employing symbolic regression with Kolmogorov--Arnold networks, it is able to obtain the exact convex conjugates of specific convex functions."

    "abstract": "Two-photon interference in a Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interferometer can be used as a quantum sensing mechanism due to the sensitivity of the interference dip to perturbations of the photon indistinguishability. In particular, recent works have generalized this concept to microscopy setups, but the sensitivity to optical path differences constrains its application to samples with thickness variation typically below a few micrometers if tracking changes in the coincidences at a fixed delay. Extending the concept to polarization microscopy and circumventing this limitation, this manuscript explores the use of a narrowband photon pair source with coherence length >1 mm to broaden the HOM dip. Thus, realistic sample-thickness variations introduce negligible temporal distinguishability, and changes in coincidence rate at the dip centre are then dominated by sample-induced polarization effects. To compute the polarization rotation, we develop a statistical model for the interferometer, derive the Fisher information, and establish a maximum-likelihood estimator for the local fast-axis angle. Recording dip and baseline frames at each sample position via raster scanning, the experimental results validate the framework, agreeing with classical polarized-intensity images while demonstrating operation at a maximum-precision regime and insensitiveness to layer thickness. Overall, the approach enclosed provides a quantum-based quantitative imaging of birefringent structures, which can motivate further advantageous applications, including enhanced signal-to-noise ratio and lower damage imaging of photosensitive samples."

We find that fine-tuned, character-level LLMs perform best, likely due to their ability to decompose complex characters into their UTF-8 byte representations. In contrast, massively multilingual models perform less effectively given our data constraints. Across all models, reliable performance begins to emerge with data budgets of around 10,000 words. Zero-shot approaches perform poorly in all cases.

Traditional modular pipelines suffer from latency and cascading errors across perception, localization, mapping, and planning modules.

However, most prior end-to-end approaches still rely on separate localization modules that depend on accurate sensor extrinsic calibration for self-state estimation, thereby limiting generalization across embodiments and environments. We introduce LoGoPlanner, a localization-grounded, end-to-end navigation framework that addresses these limitations by: (1) finetuning a long-horizon visual-geometry backbone to ground predictions with absolute metric scale, thereby providing implicit state estimation for accurate localization; (2) reconstructing surrounding scene geometry from historical observations to supply dense, fine-grained environmental awareness for reliable obstacle avoidance; and (3) conditioning the policy on implicit geometry bootstrapped by the aforementioned auxiliary tasks, thereby reducing error propagation.We evaluate LoGoPlanner in both simulation and real-world settings, where its fully end-to-end design reduces cumulative error while metric-aware geometry memory enhances planning consistency and obstacle avoidance, leading to more than a 27.3\\% improvement over oracle-localization baselines and strong generalization across embodiments and environments.

Yet, most models implement such asymmetry phenomenologically. Here we show that non-reciprocity can emerge from internal topology alone. Agents evolve on an internal ``context manifold'' coupled to a Chern-Simons gauge field. Because the gauge field is first order in time, it relaxes rapidly; eliminating it yields an effective transverse, antisymmetric interaction kernel that generically produces chiral waves, persistent vorticity, and irreversible state transitions. Numerical simulations reveal clear signatures of broken reciprocity: long-lived vortex cores, finite circulation, asymmetric information flow, and a nonzero reciprocity residual. The dynamics further exhibit pronounced hysteresis under parameter sweeps, demonstrating memory effects that cannot occur in reciprocal or potential-driven systems. These results identify Chern-Simons gauge fields as a minimal and universal source of directional influence and robust non-reciprocal collective behavior."

Conversely, a negative $\\ell$ amplifies repulsive pressure and weakens gravitational binding, such that no static solutions exist beyond a critical negative value. These structural modifications imprint distinct features on EMRI dynamics, characterized by a monotonic decrease in both orbital eccentricity and radial range as $\\ell$ increases.

    "abstract": "Attitude control is essential for many satellite missions. Classical controllers, however, are time-consuming to design and sensitive to model uncertainties and variations in operational boundary conditions. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a promising alternative by learning adaptive control strategies through autonomous interaction with a simulation environment. Overcoming the Sim2Real gap, which involves deploying an agent trained in simulation onto the real physical satellite, remains a significant challenge. In this work, we present the first successful in-orbit demonstration of an AI-based attitude controller for inertial pointing maneuvers. The controller was trained entirely in simulation and deployed to the InnoCube 3U nanosatellite, which was developed by the Julius-Maximilians-Universität Würzburg in cooperation with the Technische Universität Berlin, and launched in January 2025. We present the AI agent design, the methodology of the training procedure, the discrepancies between the simulation and the observed behavior of the real satellite, and a comparison of the AI-based attitude controller with the classical PD controller of InnoCube. Steady-state metrics confirm the robust performance of the AI-based controller during repeated in-orbit maneuvers."

    "abstract": "We combine reinforcement learning with variational autoregressive networks (VANs) to perform data-free training and sampling for the discrete Ising model and the continuous $φ^4$ scalar field theory. We quantify the complexity of the target distribution via the KL divergence between the magnetization distribution and a reference Gaussian distribution, and observe that configurations with smaller KL divergence typically require fewer training steps. Motivated by this observation, we investigate transfer learning and show that fine-tuning models pretrained at a single value of $κ$ can reduce training time compared with training from a Gaussian field. In addition, inspired by single-site and cluster Monte Carlo updates, we introduce single-site and block Metropolis--Hastings (MH) updates on top of VAN proposals. These MH corrections systematically reduce the residual bias of pure VAN sampling in the parameter range we study, while maintaining high sampling efficiency in terms of the effective sample size (ESS). For both the Ising model and the $φ^4$ theory, our results agree with standard Monte Carlo benchmarks within errors, and no clear critical slowing down is observed in the explored parameter ranges."

We introduce BabyFlow, a generative AI model that disentangles facial identity and expression, enabling independent control over both. Using normalizing flows, BabyFlow learns flexible, probabilistic representations that capture the complex, non-linear variability of expressive infant faces without restrictive linear assumptions. To address scarce and uncontrolled expressive data, we perform cross-age expression transfer, adapting expressions from adult 3D scans to enrich infant datasets with realistic and systematic expressive variants. As a result, BabyFlow improves 3D reconstruction accuracy, particularly in highly expressive regions such as the mouth, eyes, and nose, and supports synthesis and modification of infant expressions while preserving identity. Additionally, by integrating with diffusion models, BabyFlow generates high-fidelity 2D infant images with consistent 3D geometry, providing powerful tools for data augmentation and early facial analysis."

This paper proposes a Hybrid LRR-TED framework that addresses this dilemma through a novel \"Asymmetry of Discovery.\" When applied to customer churn prediction, we demonstrate that automated rule learners (GLRM) excel at identifying broad \"Safety Nets\" (retention patterns) but struggle to capture specific \"Risk Traps\" (churn triggers)-a phenomenon we term the Anna Karenina Principle of Churn. By initialising the explanation matrix with automated safety rules and augmenting it with a Pareto-optimal set of just four human-defined risk rules, our approach achieves 94.00% predictive accuracy. This configuration outperforms the full 8-rule manual expert baseline while reducing human annotation effort by 50%, proposing a shift in the paradigm for Human-in-the-Loop AI: moving experts from the role of \"Rule Writers\" to \"Exception Handlers.\""

This is a weak supervision setting for ordinal regression compared to the full information setting, where the learner can access the labels. We propose an online algorithm for ordinal regression using directional feedback. The proposed algorithm uses an exploration-exploitation scheme to learn from directional feedback efficiently. Furthermore, we introduce its kernel-based variant to learn non-linear ordinal regression models in an online setting. We use a truncation trick to make the kernel implementation more memory efficient. The proposed algorithm maintains the ordering of the thresholds in the expected sense. Moreover, it achieves the expected regret of $\\mathcal{O}(\\log T)$. We compare our approach with a full information and a weakly supervised algorithm for ordinal regression on synthetic and real-world datasets. The proposed approach, which learns using directional feedback, performs comparably (sometimes better) to its full information counterpart."

    "abstract": "The mechanism that forms dynamic type II spicules has remained elusive for many years. Their dynamical behaviour has long been linked to magnetic reconnection, yet no conclusive evidence has been provided. However, one recent observational study found signs of reconnection, as traced by Ellerman bombs (EBs), at the footpoints of many spicules. The triggering of EBs is generally linked to reconnection due to flux emergence and convective motions in the photosphere. We aim to explore whether we can connect EBs to type II spicules, and to what extent we can use EBs as an observational proxy to probe reconnection in this dynamic. We also aim to provide further insight into the mechanisms that trigger EBs. We used a simulation run with the radiative magnetohydrodynamics code Bifrost to track spicules and study the physical processes behind their formation. To detect EBs and classify the spicules, we synthesised the H-alpha line using the multilevel radiative transfer code RH1.5D. We also traced shocks and current sheets to decipher the origin of EBs and spicules. We selected one type II spicule with a strong EB near its footpoint and studied their formation in detail. A magnetoacoustic shock advects the magnetic field lines towards an oppositely directed ambient field, creating a current sheet. The current sheet accelerates dense plasma via a whiplash effect generated by reconnection into the inclined ambient field, launching the spicule. Several EB profiles trace shock- and magnetic-reconnection-induced dynamics during this process at the spicule footpoint. We present a new EB triggering mechanism in which a shock-induced current sheet reconnects, triggering an EB in the lower solar atmosphere. The shock-induced current sheet generates the launch of a type II spicule via reconnection outflows. These results provide a physical origin for the observed connection between EBs and spicules."

This system to a large extent mimics -- outside of the Rydberg-blockade regime -- a circular array of neutral atoms interacting through van-der-Waals type interaction. We investigate the preparation of $W$ and Dicke states in this system starting from the default initial state $|00\\ldots 0\\rangle$ using two different optimal-control approaches: (i) NMR-like pulse sequence, which consists of instantaneous (delta-shaped) control- and Ising-interaction pulses, and (ii) time-dependent control scheme, which entails shaped control pulses in the presence of always-on Ising interaction between adjacent qubits. By making use of the underlying dihedral symmetry of this system -- which allows one to use a symmetry-adapted computational basis with $\\mathcal{O}(2^N / N)$ states in an $N$-qubit system -- and utilizing advanced global-optimization methods, we find optimal sequences of pulses for realizing $W$ and Dicke states within both approaches. In addition, we demonstrate robustness of these sequences against unavoidable control errors. Finally, using typical values of parameters in realistic Rydberg-atom systems, we show that our control schemes enable the preparation of the desired multiqubit states on time scales much shorter than the relevant coherence times of those systems."

To a large extent, progress has been restricted to the spherically symmetric sector, with the exception of the Kerr-de Sitter and Thakhurta solutions. In this work, we present two new results that advance the description of axisymmetric compact objects embedded in a cosmological background. We first introduce a new solution-generating technique allowing one to construct non-stationary and axisymmetric solutions of the self-interacting Einstein-Scalar system. Using this method, we present the first exact solution which describes a dynamical axisymmetric black (or white) hole embedded in an expanding or contracting cosmology. We provide a detailed investigation of its properties, and in particular its dynamical trapping (or anti-trapping) horizons. To that end, we use the mean curvature vector (MCV) which stands as a natural generalization of the Kodama vector beyond spherical symmetry. The norm of this vector provides a foliation-independent quantity to locate the trapped/anti-trapped and untrapped regions and characterize the causal nature of a given geometry without specific symmetry requirement. The solution-generating method and the techniques to analyze the new solutions provide new powerful tools to further explore the description and the phenomenology of dynamical compact objects embedded in cosmology, in particular those of primordial black holes."

Yet LLM based pipelines face deployment gaps, including hallucinations under weak constraints, fragile temporal and causal linking over long contexts and across documents, and limited long horizon knowledge management within a bounded context window. We argue that EE should be viewed as a system component that provides a cognitive scaffold for LLM centered solutions. Event schemas and slot constraints create interfaces for grounding and verification; event centric structures act as controlled intermediate representations for stepwise reasoning; event links support relation aware retrieval with graph based RAG; and event stores offer updatable episodic and agent memory beyond the context window. This survey covers EE in text and multimodal settings, organizing tasks and taxonomy, tracing method evolution from rule based and neural models to instruction driven and generative frameworks, and summarizing formulations, decoding strategies, architectures, representations, datasets, and evaluation. We also review cross lingual, low resource, and domain specific settings, and highlight open challenges and future directions for reliable event centric systems. Finally, we outline open challenges and future directions that are central to the LLM era, aiming to evolve EE from static extraction into a structurally reliable, agent ready perception and memory layer for open world systems."

VLMs leveraging cross-attention are an efficient alternative to token insertion but exhibit a clear performance gap, in particular on tasks involving fine-grained visual details. We find that a key to improving such models is to also enable local text-to-text interaction in the dedicated cross-attention layers. Building on this, we propose CASA, Cross-Attention via Self-Attention, a simple and efficient paradigm which substantially reduces the gap with full token insertion on common image understanding benchmarks, while enjoying the same scalability as cross-attention models when applied to long-context multimodal tasks such as streaming video captioning.

However, it remains unclear whether state-of-the-art vision perception models (e.g., large VLMs) can reason physical properties quantitatively. Existing evaluations are predominantly VQA-based and qualitative, offering limited insight into whether these models can infer the kinematic quantities of moving objects from video observations. To address this, we present QuantiPhy, the first benchmark designed to quantitatively measure a VLM's physical reasoning ability. Comprising more than 3.3K video-text instances with numerical ground truth, QuantiPhy evaluates a VLM's performance on estimating an object's size, velocity, and acceleration at a given timestamp, using one of these properties as an input prior. The benchmark standardizes prompts and scoring to assess numerical accuracy, enabling fair comparisons across models. Our experiments on state-of-the-art VLMs reveal a consistent gap between their qualitative plausibility and actual numerical correctness. We further provide an in-depth analysis of key factors like background noise, counterfactual priors, and strategic prompting and find that state-of-the-art VLMs lean heavily on pre-trained world knowledge rather than faithfully using the provided visual and textual inputs as references when reasoning kinematic properties quantitatively. QuantiPhy offers the first rigorous, scalable testbed to move VLMs beyond mere verbal plausibility toward a numerically grounded physical understanding."

However, significant challenges still remain the dense connections in MLPs result in a large number of parameters, which requires high computation resources, complicating the training, and reducing performance during rendering. Data driven approaches require large amounts of training data for generalization; unbalanced data might bias the model to ignore the unusual illumination conditions, e.g. dark scenes. This paper introduces pbnds+: a novel physics-based neural deferred shading pipeline utilizing convolution neural networks to decrease the parameters and improve the performance in shading and relighting tasks; Energy regularization is also proposed to restrict the model reflection during dark illumination.

A seminal result of Kapralov and Krachun [STOC 2019] shows that it is impossible to beat $1/2$-approximation for Max-DICUT in sublinear space in the single-pass streaming setting, even on bounded-degree graphs. In a recent work, Saxena, Singer, Sudan, and Velusamy [SODA 2025] prove that the above lower bound is tight by giving a single-pass algorithm for bounded-degree graphs that achieves $(1/2-ε)$-approximation in sublinear space, for every constant $ε>0$. For arbitrary graphs of unbounded degree, they give an $O(1/ε)$-pass $O(\\log n)$ space algorithm. Their work left open the question of obtaining $1/2$-approximation for arbitrary graphs in the single-pass setting in sublinear space.

Compared to the high-pressure bulk system, the ratio of inter-layer $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ hopping to intra-layer $d_{x^2-y^2}$ hopping is suppressed in the 1UC thin film, and the crystal-field splitting of the $e_g$ orbitals is increased. Our calculation indicates that spin-fluctuation-driven pairing correlations are weak for the stoichiometric case at ambient pressure, but increase significantly under hole doping. The leading pairing symmetry is also found to change by hole doping. Specifically, we obtain a leading $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing state at moderate hole doping, followed by a $d_{xy}$ state at higher doping. These states are driven by intra-band spin-fluctuation scattering {\\it within} the $γ$ hole pocket centered around the M point, and arise primarily from states in the Ni layer {\\it farther} from the substrate. These results strongly suggest that the thin-film superconducting samples are hole-doped and that pairing in this system predominantly arises in the layer, as opposed to the inter-layer pairing in the pressurized bulk system."

Our analysis reveals the presence of a tidal gap between black holes, characterized by vanishing tidal deformability, and physically motivated ECOs. Prompted by this finding, we investigate the possibility that a population of maximally compact exotic objects, described by a linear equation of state (EoS), may simultaneously inhabit the lower mass gap and the sub-solar region, thus qualifying as (primordial) black hole mimickers while distinguishing themselves from the latter by their non-zero tidal deformability. Finally, considering the case of solitonic boson stars as proxies for ECOs described by a linear EoS, we discuss how it is possible to further reduce the lower limit on $Λ$, provided that the strong energy condition is violated (but not the dominant energy condition, and therefore causality)."

    "abstract": "Modern deep learning models operating on multi-modal visual signals often rely on inductive biases that are poorly aligned with the physical processes governing signal formation, leading to brittle performance under cross-spectral and real-world conditions. In particular, approaches that prioritise direct thermal cues struggle to capture indirect yet persistent environmental alterations induced by sustained heat emissions. This work introduces a physics-aware representation learning framework that leverages multi-spectral information to model stable signatures of long-term physical processes. Specifically, a geological Short Wave Infrared (SWIR) ratio sensitive to soil property changes is integrated with Thermal Infrared (TIR) data through an intermediate fusion architecture, instantiated as FusionNet. The proposed backbone embeds trainable differential signal-processing priors within convolutional layers, combines mixed pooling strategies, and employs wider receptive fields to enhance robustness across spectral modalities. Systematic ablations show that each architectural component contributes to performance gains, with DGCNN achieving 88.7% accuracy on the SWIR ratio and FusionNet reaching 90.6%, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines across five spectral configurations. Transfer learning experiments further show that ImageNet pretraining degrades TIR performance, highlighting the importance of modality-aware training for cross-spectral learning. Evaluated on real-world data, the results demonstrate that combining physics-aware feature selection with principled deep learning architectures yields robust and generalisable representations, illustrating how first-principles signal modelling can improve multi-spectral learning under challenging conditions."

The model is valid for a large class of semilinear elliptic differential operators. It also provides a fruitful context for numerical analysis. For a function $F: X \\to Y$ between real Banach spaces, continuation methods to solve $F(x) = y$ may improve from considerations about the global geometry of $F$. We consider three classes of examples. First we handle functions from the Euclidean plane to itself, for which the reasoning behind the techniques is visualizable. The second, between spaces of dimension 15, is obtained by discretizing a nonlinear Sturm-Liouville problem for which special right hand sides admit abundant solutions.

This is especially relevant in a dimensional reduction on such a manifold, which can then be compensated by using fermions that are appropriately charged under some Maxwell or Yang-Mills field defined on the internal manifold. A well known example in the physics literature is $\\mathbb{CP}^2$, which has four real dimensions and is the coset $SU(3)/U(2)$. In this paper we focus on a five-dimensional coset space, namely the Wu manifold $SU(3)/SO(3)_{\\rm max}$, where $SO(3)_{\\rm max}$ is maximal in $SU(3)$. Intriguingly, the Wu manifold does not admit a spin structure or spin$^c$ structure, it does admit a spin$^h$ structure. We provide a physical interpretation of the spin$^h$ structure by considering spinors that are coupled to an $SO(3)$ Yang-Mills field defined on the Wu manifold, but which carry half-integer \"isospin,\" thereby canceling the minus sign in the holonomy for uncharged spinors that provides the original obstruction to an ordinary spin structure. We also construct a gauge-covariantly constant spinor in the Wu manifold, and we show how this can be employed in order to construct spin$^h$ spinor harmonics from scalar harmonics. We provide a very explicit construction of all the scalar and spin$^h$ harmonics. In a follow-up paper, we shall employ the results we obtain here in order to discuss dimensional reductions and consistent reductions on the Wu manifold."

These models were widely tested on the graph datasets consisting of organic molecules; however, those studies disregarded the inorganic nanomaterials datasets. In this work, we close this gap by applying Kolmogorov-Arnold Graph Neural Networks (KAGNNs) to a recently published large inorganic nanomaterials dataset called CHILI. For this, we adapt and test KAGNNs appropriate for this dataset. Our experiments reveal that on the CHILI datasets, particularly on the CHILI-3K, KAGNNs substantially surpass conventional GNNs in classification, achieving state-of-the-art results."

    "abstract": "Evolutionary therapy (ET) aims to steer tumor evolution by adjusting treatment timing and dosing to control rather than eradicate tumor burden. Clinical use requires reliable monitoring of tumor dynamics to inform mathematical models that guide therapy. In cancers such as metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer and relapsed platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer, ET models are informed by serial serum biomarkers. For cancers lacking reliable biomarkers, such as metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), radiographic imaging remains the primary method for treatment response assessment, typically using RECIST 1.1 criteria. RECIST, which tracks a few lesions with one-dimensional (1D) measurements and defines progression relative to the nadir, the smallest tumor burden recorded after treatment, was not designed to support ET. It may miss early regrowth, underrepresent tumor burden, and obscure disease trends. Using a virtual NSCLC patient model, we demonstrate that lesion selection and measurement dimensionality strongly affect progression detection. Two-dimensional metrics provide modest improvement, but only 3D volumetric measurements accurately capture both tumor burden and its dynamics, which are key requirements for ET. To support ET in cancers lacking biomarkers, response assessment must evolve beyond RECIST by integrating volumetric imaging, automated segmentation, and potentially liquid biopsies, alongside redefining progression criteria to enable adaptive, patient-centered treatments."

These efforts aim to understand and enhance the spin spin interactions in 2D. An emergent class of such magnets is the layered FeNGeTe2 (N = 3, 4, and 5). Here, we investigate the magnetic states over a wide field temperature phase space in the high-Tc ferromagnet Fe5GeTe2 using magnetization, ferromagnetic resonance (FMR), and magneto-transport measurements. Our findings reveal a magnetic phase transition from a collinear to a complex non-collinear magnetic order near the temperature T* = 160 K, below which magnetic susceptibility is reduced, FMR linewidth broadened, and anomalous Hall resistivity suppressed. Such non-collinearity results from the competition between magnetocrystalline anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii Moriya interaction arising from the unusual Fe1 ordering in two possible split sites. Our study focuses on the strategy to quench the non-collinear spin order. Substituting 40% Ni in Fe5GeTe2 is found to be one such quenching strategy. This provides deeper insights into the magnetism of a high-Tc layered-ferromagnet, offering opportunities to develop 2D magnet-based devices."

However, these methods scale poorly with the number of devices and stages. This paper presents a novel approach to overcome this curse of dimensionality. Building prior work that characterises the aggregate flexibility sets of populations of EVs as a permutahdron, we reformulate the original problem in terms of aggregated quantities. The geometric structure of permutahedra lets us (i) construct an optimal disaggregation policy, (ii) derive an exact, lower-dimensional MSLP, and (iii) characterise the expected recourse function as piecewise affine with a finite, explicit partition. In particular, we provide closed-form expressions for the slopes and intercepts of each affine region via truncated expectations of future prices, yielding an exact form for the recourse function and first-stage policy. Comprehensive numerical studies validate our claims and demonstrate the practical utility of this work."

On the other hand, post-hoc methods, which evaluate pre-trained models, focus on solving problems related to improving the confidence in the model's predictions, and detecting Out-Of-Distribution or Adversarial Attacks samples as independent applications. To tackle the limited applicability of already existing methods, we introduce Multi-Layer Analysis for Confidence Scoring (MACS), a unified post-hoc framework that analyzes intermediate activations to produce classification-maps. From the classification-maps, we derive a score applicable for confidence estimation, detecting distributional shifts and adversarial attacks, unifying the three problems in a common framework, and achieving performances that surpass the state-of-the-art approaches in our experiments with the VGG16 and ViTb16 models with a fraction of their computational overhead."

Multiple coherent optical passes through the electro-optic medium accumulate this phase shift, enabling interferometric readout using mature optical techniques. We present the basic operating principle, discuss material requirements, and estimate the achievable sensitivity. For representative parameters, the projected reach extends into the parameter space of well-motivated QCD axion models."

    "abstract": "Linear phase-contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) techniques compatible with high-throughput 4D-STEM acquisition are widely used to enhance phase contrast in weakly scattering and beam-sensitive materials. In these modalities, contrast transfer is often suppressed at low spatial frequencies, resulting in a characteristic contrast gap that limits quantitative imaging. Approaches that retain low-frequency phase contrast exist but typically require substantially increased experimental complexity, restricting routine use. Dark-field STEM imaging captures this missing low-frequency information through electrons scattered outside the bright-field disk, but discards a large fraction of the scattered signal and is therefore dose-inefficient. Fused Full-field STEM (FF-STEM) is introduced as a 4D-STEM imaging modality that overcomes this limitation by combining ptychographic phase reconstruction with tilt-corrected dark-field imaging within a single acquisition. Bright-field data are used to estimate probe aberrations and reconstruct a high-resolution phase image, while dark-field data provide complementary low-frequency contrast. The two channels are optimally fused in Fourier space using minimum-variance weighting based on the spectral signal-to-noise ratio, yielding transfer-gap-free images with high contrast and quantitative fidelity. FF-STEM preserves the upsampling and depth-sectioning capabilities of ptychography, adds robust low-frequency contrast characteristic of dark-field imaging, and enables dose-efficient, near-real-time reconstruction."

    "abstract": "Embodied robotic AI systems designed to manage complex daily tasks rely on a task planner to understand and decompose high-level tasks. While most research focuses on enhancing the task-understanding abilities of LLMs/VLMs through fine-tuning or chain-of-thought prompting, this paper argues that defining the planned skill set is equally crucial. To handle the complexity of daily environments, the skill set should possess a high degree of generalization ability. Empirically, more abstract expressions tend to be more generalizable. Therefore, we propose to abstract the planned result as a set of meta-actions. Each meta-action comprises three components: {move/rotate, end-effector status change, relationship with the environment}. This abstraction replaces human-centric concepts, such as grasping or pushing, with the robot's intrinsic functionalities. As a result, the planned outcomes align seamlessly with the complete range of actions that the robot is capable of performing. Furthermore, to ensure that the LLM/VLM accurately produces the desired meta-action format, we employ the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique, which leverages a database of human-annotated planning demonstrations to facilitate in-context learning. As the system successfully completes more tasks, the database will self-augment to continue supporting diversity. The meta-action set and its integration with RAG are two novel contributions of our planner, denoted as MaP-AVR, the meta-action planner for agents composed of VLM and RAG. To validate its efficacy, we design experiments using GPT-4o as the pre-trained LLM/VLM model and OmniGibson as our robotic platform.

While separator design is crucial for optimizing battery performance, its potential remains underexplored. The commonly used glass fiber (GF) filters were not originally designed as battery separators. To address their limitations, nanochitin derived from waste shrimp shells was used to fabricate separators with varying concentrations of amine and carboxylic functional groups. This study investigates how the type and concentration of these groups influence the separator's properties and performance. In a mild acidic electrolyte that protonates the amine groups, the results showed that the density of both ammonium and carboxylic groups in the separators significantly affected water structure and ionic conductivity. Quasi-Elastic Neutron Scattering (QENS) revealed that low-functionalized chitin, particularly with only ammonium groups, promotes strongly bound water with restricted mobility, thereby enhancing Zn plating and stripping kinetics. These separators exhibit exceptional Zn stability over 2000 hours at low current densities (0.5 mA/cm2), maintaining low overpotentials and stable polarization. Additionally, the full cell consisting of Zn||NaV3O8.1.5H2O showed a cycle life of over 2000 cycles at 2 A/g, demonstrating the compatibility of the nanochitin-based separators with low concentrations of functional surface groups. These results demonstrate the importance of a simple separator design for improving the overall performance of AZBs."

Previous studies have identified their lower density, higher temperature, and flux rope structures. However, spectroscopic observations are still relatively scarce. In this study, we utilize the newly developed Spectral Imaging Coronagraph (SICG), Chinese H$α$ Solar Explorer (CHASE), and AIA/SDO to analyze the morphology, temperature, Doppler shift, and non-thermal velocity of two coronal cavities observed on November 13, 2024. We find that coronal cavities are distinctly visible in SICG \\ion{Fe}{14} 5303~Å and AIA 193~Å, whereas they are nearly absent in SICG \\ion{Fe}{10} 6374~Å and AIA 171~Å. The spectroscopic measurements show that the two coronal cavities display asymmetric, ring-like structures in the \\ion{Fe}{14} 5303~Å Doppler shift maps. The non-thermal velocities inside coronal cavities are significantly higher than those of the surrounding streamer areas. In addition, the core regions of coronal cavities, located directly above the prominences, exhibit the highest non-thermal velocities and Doppler velocities. Our results suggest the presence of waves and turbulence in coronal cavities, which are likely more intense than those in the adjacent streamer regions. We suggest that the interaction and exchange between the cold, dense prominence materials and the hot, low-density coronal materials are the main drivers of the waves and turbulence inside coronal cavities."

The resulting diagrams reveal three regimes: a completely extended phase, a completely localized phase, and a mixed domain where localized and extended states coexist. In the diagrams, we investigate the behaviors of tightly and loosely wound helices and examine a special case where the number of sites per turn is a Fibonacci number. For moderate numbers of sites per helical turn, the mixed region is broad and also shifts with the long-range coupling. When the turn size is a Fibonacci number, the phase boundary becomes nearly horizontal and the mixed region fades out, effectively recovering the standard Aubry-André model behavior."

The signal of each anchor is generated by transmitting a sequence of known symbols, allowing for amplitude and duration (number of symbols) to be different from anchor to anchor. The problem is the minimization of the sum of the energies of the transmitted signals imposing a constraint on the performance of the tracking procedure. Specifically, the constraint is the Posterior Cramer-Rao Bound, below the mean square error achieved by any unbiased estimator. The main improvement over the previous literature is the derivation of a formula that, at each step of the tracking, allows to calculate in closed form the first-order variation of the Posterior Cramer-Rao Bound as a function of the variation of the total energy. To concretely show the application of our approach, we present also two numerical algorithms that implement the constrained optimization in the case of signals of fixed amplitude and variable duration transmitted from the anchors in a time division multiplexing scheme."

The capabilities of this framework are demonstrated through three representative examples corresponding to typical stages of a surface hopping study. First, we focus on methods providing energy, energy gradients and nonadiabatic couplings. We show that the flexibility of user-defined custom models can save computational time and that it is useful for benchmarking machine learning models. Next, we compare curvature-driven surface hopping schemes and show that Landau--Zener approach outperforms the time-dependent Baeck--An scheme.

    "abstract": "This article develops a unified variational framework for configurational (or material) forces in both Classical (3D, non-relativistic) and Relativistic (4D) Continuum Mechanics. Configurational forces describe the evolution of material defects-such as cracks, dislocations, and interfaces-which move relative to the material rather than through physical space. In the classical setting of hyperelasticity, the authors revisit the balance of configurational forces using an intrinsic Lagrangian formulation, where the material body is modeled as an abstract three-dimensional manifold. By treating the reference configuration as a variable and performing a Lagrangian variation with respect to it, they show that the configurational forces balance naturally emerges. Importantly, this balance equation is not independent: it is equivalent to the standard balance of linear momentum combined with constitutive relations, and it is expressed through the Eshelby stress tensor on the reference configuration. The framework is then extended to Relativistic Hyperelasticity within General Relativity. Matter is described by a matter field, a vector valued function, defined on the four-dimensional Universe, and the Lagrangian (i.e., Action) includes both matter and gravitational contributions. Two stress-energy tensors arise: the Noether stress-energy tensor (from variations with respect to the matter field) and the Hilbert stress-energy tensor (from variations with respect to the Universe metric). Assuming General Covariance, the authors prove that these tensors and their associated balance laws are equivalent. By introducing the notion of an observer and specializing to static spacetimes, the authors define a relativistic generalization of the deformation and derive a four-dimensional Eshelby tensor. They show that in Special Relativity, as in Classical Continuum Mechanics, the relativistic configurational forces balance is not a new equation but follows from the conservation laws of the Noether stress-energy tensor. Finally, they recover the classical configurational forces balance as the non-relativistic limit of the relativistic theory. Overall, the paper provides a rigorous geometric and variational interpretation of configurational forces, unifying classical and relativistic formulations and clarifying their deep connection with standard equilibrium equations."

Using a state-of-the-art determination of the short-distance coefficient, including NLO QCD and electroweak effects, and implementing a consistent treatment of heavy-quark masses and power corrections within the kinetic scheme, we compute the total decay rate and the neutrino invariant mass spectrum. We incorporate all known perturbative contributions in the heavy quark limit up to $\\mathcal{O}(α_s^3)$, evaluate non-perturbative corrections through the Heavy Quark Expansion up to $1/m_b^3$, and include estimates of four-quark operator matrix elements from HQET sum rules. We obtain the Standard Model branching ratios $\\text{Br}(B^0 \\to X_sν\\barν) = (3.35 \\pm 0.10)\\times 10^{-5} $ and $ \\text{Br}(B^+ \\to X_sν\\barν) = (3.62 \\pm 0.11)\\times 10^{-5}, $ representing a significant improvement in both central value and precision compared to previous determinations. We also provide predictions for partial rates with kinematic cuts relevant to Belle II. Our results are timely in view of recent measurements of $B \\to Kν\\barν$ and the first upper limits on inclusive $B \\to X_sν\\barν$, and they offer a robust baseline for future searches for physics beyond the Standard Model in $b\\to sν\\barν$ transitions."

    "abstract": "Dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Generation adaptively determines when to retrieve during generation to mitigate hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods rely on model-internal signals (e.g., logits, entropy), which are fundamentally unreliable because LLMs are typically ill-calibrated and often exhibit high confidence in erroneous outputs. We propose QuCo-RAG, which shifts from subjective confidence to objective statistics computed from pre-training data. Our method quantifies uncertainty through two stages: (1) before generation, we identify low-frequency entities indicating long-tail knowledge gaps; (2) during generation, we verify entity co-occurrence in the pre-training corpus, where zero co-occurrence often signals hallucination risk. Both stages leverage Infini-gram for millisecond-latency queries over 4 trillion tokens, triggering retrieval when uncertainty is high. Experiments on multi-hop QA benchmarks show QuCo-RAG achieves EM gains of 5--12 points over state-of-the-art baselines with OLMo-2 models, and transfers effectively to models with undisclosed pre-training data (Llama, Qwen, GPT), improving EM by up to 14 points. Domain generalization on biomedical QA further validates the robustness of our paradigm. These results establish corpus-grounded verification as a principled, practically model-agnostic paradigm for dynamic RAG. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/ZhishanQ/QuCo-RAG."

    "source": "arXiv",
    "abstract": "Objective: We develop a channel-adaptive (CA) architecture that seamlessly processes multi-variate time-series with an arbitrary number of channels, and in particular intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings. Methods: Our CA architecture first processes the iEEG signal using state-of-the-art models applied to each single channel independently. The resulting features are then fused using a vector-symbolic algorithm which reconstructs the spatial relationship using a trainable scalar per channel. Finally, the fused features are accumulated in a long-term memory of up to 2 minutes to perform the classification. Each CA-model can then be pre-trained on a large corpus of iEEG recordings from multiple heterogeneous subjects. The pre-trained model is personalized to each subject via a quick fine-tuning routine, which uses equal or lower amounts of data compared to existing state-of-the-art models, but requiring only 1/5 of the time. Results: We evaluate our CA-models on a seizure detection task both on a short-term (~20 hours) and a long-term (~2500 hours) dataset. In particular, our CA-EEGWaveNet is trained on a single seizure of the tested subject, while the baseline EEGWaveNet is trained on all but one. Even in this challenging scenario, our CA-EEGWaveNet surpasses the baseline in median F1-score (0.78 vs 0.76). Similarly, CA-EEGNet based on EEGNet, also surpasses its baseline in median F1-score (0.79 vs 0.74). Conclusion and significance: Our CA-model addresses two issues: first, it is channel-adaptive and can therefore be trained across heterogeneous subjects without loss of performance; second, it increases the effective temporal context size to a clinically-relevant length. Therefore, our model is a drop-in replacement for existing models, bringing better characteristics and performance across the board."

Defect-etching experiments demonstrate that a sharp increase of threading dislocation density (TDD) from $3 \\times 10^{5}$\\,cm$^{-2}$ to $1.2 \\times 10^{6}$\\,cm$^{-2}$ takes place when the final growth temperature exceeds a critical value T$_c\\approx 530^\\circ$C. VT-HRXRD measurements show that in low TDD samples extra relaxation takes place for annealing temperatures larger than T$_c$, thanks to the nucleation of new dislocations. These results indicate that, below T$_c$, strain relaxation is driven by the gliding of existing dislocations while above T$_c$ new dislocations are nucleated, suggesting a link with our results and the brittle-to-ductile transition in Si$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$ alloys."

To improve operational robustness, a resistive anode has been implemented using a DLC layer deposited on a Kapton substrate. While this design enhances detector stability, the resistive layer may influence rate capability, signal formation, and detector capacitance, altering timing performance. This work presents a comprehensive study of a resistive design, including an analytical model and finite-element simulations to quantify rate-dependent gain reduction due to ohmic voltage drop on the resistive layer. An analytical solution for the voltage across a finite-size resistive layer is derived, and a numerical model is developed to evaluate gain suppression under intense particle fluxes. The impact of the resistive layer on signal formation is investigated using time-dependent weighting fields and the Garfield++ simulation framework. The contribution of signal components induced by the resistive layer is quantified, and preservation of the signal leading edge is found for surface resistivities above 100 kohm per square. Single-channel resistive-anode prototypes were designed, constructed, and experimentally characterized. Laboratory measurements using single photoelectrons and power spectral density analysis show the predicted reduction in signal amplitude while preserving the leading edge. Muon beam tests with CsI and DLC photocathodes demonstrate a time resolution of 11.5 ps for CsI, comparable to 11.9 ps for the metallic-anode device, showing the suitability of the resistive design for precision timing applications."

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of artificial intelligence is exponentially escalating computational demand, inflating data center energy use and carbon emissions, and spurring rapid deployment of green data centers to relieve resource and environmental stress. Achieving sub-minute orchestration of renewables, storage, and loads, while minimizing PUE and lifecycle carbon intensity, hinges on accurate load forecasting. However, existing methods struggle to address small-sample scenarios caused by cold start, load distortion, multi-source data fragmentation, and distribution shifts in green data centers. We introduce HyperLoad, a cross-modality framework that exploits pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to overcome data scarcity. In the Cross-Modality Knowledge Alignment phase, textual priors and time-series data are mapped to a common latent space, maximizing the utility of prior knowledge. In the Multi-Scale Feature Modeling phase, domain-aligned priors are injected through adaptive prefix-tuning, enabling rapid scenario adaptation, while an Enhanced Global Interaction Attention mechanism captures cross-device temporal dependencies. The public DCData dataset is released for benchmarking. Under both data sufficient and data scarce settings, HyperLoad consistently surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines, demonstrating its practicality for sustainable green data center management."

    "abstract": "Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization with ordinal feedback has emerged as a fundamental problem in modern machine learning systems, particularly in human-in-the-loop settings such as reinforcement learning from human feedback, preference learning, and evolutionary strategies. While rank-based ZO algorithms enjoy strong empirical success and robustness properties, their theoretical understanding, especially under stochastic objectives and standard smoothness assumptions, remains limited. In this paper, we study rank-based zeroth-order optimization for stochastic functions where only ordinal feedback of the stochastic function is available. We propose a simple and computationally efficient rank-based ZO algorithm. Under standard assumptions including smoothness, strong convexity, and bounded second moments of stochastic gradients, we establish explicit non-asymptotic query complexity bounds for both convex and nonconvex objectives. Notably, our results match the best-known query complexities of value-based ZO algorithms, demonstrating that ordinal information alone is sufficient for optimal query efficiency in stochastic settings. Our analysis departs from existing drift-based and information-geometric techniques, offering new tools for the study of rank-based optimization under noise. These findings narrow the gap between theory and practice and provide a principled foundation for optimization driven by human preferences."

This paper presents HERALD (Hybrid Ensemble Reasoning with Adaptive Learning and Distillation), a framework that joins reasoning and calculation using NuminaMath-7B-TIR, GPT-4o, and Mistral-7B. HERALD uses adaptive routing, tool-based reinforcement learning, and knowledge distillation to connect different reasoning paths. Confidence calibration keeps weighting stable, and dual-path checking keeps results correct. Reinforcement learning controls tool use to cut redundancy, and distillation lowers delay without hurting accuracy. The system shows that combining symbolic checking, adaptive ensembles, and bilingual fine-tuning helps achieve both fluent reasoning and precise calculation. HERALD offers a practical solution for multilingual mathematical reasoning with better accuracy, stability, and clarity."

We introduce RankInsight, an open-source toolkit that seeks to address these limitations. RankInsight (1) computes pair-wise significance maps that show the nnU-Net family outperforms Vision-Language and MONAI submissions with high statistical certainty; (2) recomputes leaderboards with organ-appropriate metrics, reversing the order of the top four models when Dice is replaced by NSD for tubular structures; and (3) audits intersectional fairness, revealing that more than half of the MONAI-based entries have the largest gender-race discrepancy on our proprietary Johns Hopkins Hospital dataset. The RankInsight toolkit is publicly released and can be directly applied to past, ongoing, and future challenges. It enables organizers and participants to publish rankings that are statistically sound, clinically meaningful, and demographically fair."

The system records bipolar EMG from one agonist and one antagonist muscle of the dominant leg (vastus lateralis and semitendinosus) while simultaneously estimating knee joint angle, angular velocity, and angular acceleration using two MPU6050 IMUs. A custom dual-channel EMG front end with differential instrumentation preamplification, analog filtering (5-500 Hz band-pass and 60 Hz notch), high final gain, and rectified-integrated output was implemented on a compact 10 cm x 12 cm PCB. Data are digitized by an ESP32 microcontroller and transmitted wirelessly via ESP-NOW to a second ESP32 connected to a PC. A Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) displays EMG and kinematic signals in real time, manages subject metadata, and exports a summary of each session to Excel. The complete system is battery-powered to reduce electrical risk during human use. The resulting prototype demonstrates the feasibility of low-cost, portable EMG-IMU instrumentation for integrated analysis of muscle activation and squat kinematics and provides a platform for future biomechanical applications in sports performance and rehabilitation."

This reduction reveals a dynamically fixed threshold for sustained reflective activity and enables a complete renormalization-group (RG) analysis of the reentry-homeostasis interaction. We derive a closed RG system for the parameters governing structural gain, homeostatic stiffness, and reentrant amplification, and show that all trajectories are attracted to a critical surface defined by $γρ=1$, where intrinsic leak and reentrant drive exactly balance. The resulting phase structure comprises quenched, reactive, and reflective regimes and exhibits a mean-field critical onset with universal scaling. Our results provide an RG-theoretic characterization of reflective computation and demonstrate how homeostatic fields stabilize deep reentrant transformations through scale-dependent self-regulation."

The DM may abort an in-progress action, yielding no sample, by truncating its realized cost at a smaller, tunable deterministic limit, which we term a per-action deadline. We analyze how this cancellation option can be exploited under two cost-revelation models: ex-post, where the cost is revealed only after the sample is obtained, and ex-ante, where the cost accrues before sample acquisition. In the ex-post model, per-action deadlines do not affect the expected total cost, and the cost-error tradeoffs coincide with the baseline obtained by replacing deterministic costs with cost means. In the ex-ante model, we show how per-action deadlines inflate the expected number of times actions are applied, and that the resulting expected total cost can be reduced to the constant-cost setting by introducing an effective per-action cost. We characterize when deadlines are beneficial and study several families in detail."

We formulate the problem of preference query selection as the one that maximizes the information about the underlying latent preference model. We show that this problem has a convex optimization formulation, and introduce a statistically and computationally efficient algorithm ED-PBRL that is supported by theoretical guarantees and can efficiently construct structured queries such as images or text.

The scaffolds were initially characterized for their structural integrity, biodegradability, swelling behavior, impact on physiological pH, and cytocompatibility with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The silicate incorporation effectiveness in promoting vascularity was then assessed through HUVEC attachment, capillary tube formation, and ex-ovo chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane assays. The findings revealed significant improvements in both in-vitro and ex-ovo vascularity of the gelatin scaffolds upon the addition of Cu-doped akermanite. The most effective concentrations were determined to be 10 and 20%, which led to notable HUVEC metabolic activity, a well-spread morphology with extensive peripheral filopodia and lamellipodia at 10% and a cobblestone phenotype indicative of in-vivo endothelium at 20% during cell attachment, the formation of complex networks of tubular structures, and robust vascularization in chick embryo development. Moving forward, the incorporation of Cu-doped akermanite into tissue-engineering scaffolds shows great potential for addressing the limitations of vascularization, especially for critical-sized bone defects, by facilitating the controlled release of pro-angiogenic and pro-osteogenic ions."

Here, we reveal two intertwined phenomena in AlO_x/KTaO_3 heterostructures: a gate-history memory in which progressive electrostatic cycling enhances the superconducting transition temperature, and its complete erasure by light illumination at cryogenic temperatures. These phenomena arise from a previously unrecognized interplay between the superconducting interface and emergent lattice excitations - including polar-nanoregion reorientation and oxygen-vacancy ionization. These results demonstrate reconfigurable and non-volatile superconductivity at correlated oxide interfaces, opening a pathway to combine dissipationless transport with non-volatility for superconducting neuromorphic elements."

    "abstract": "A graph is locally chordal if each of its small-radius balls is chordal. In an earlier work [AKK25], the authors and Kobler proved that locally chordal graphs can be characterized by having chordal local covers, by forbidding short cycles and wheels as induced subgraphs, and by the property that each of their minimal local separators is a clique. In this paper, we address the global structure of locally chordal graphs. The global structure of chordal graphs is given by the following characterizations: a graph is chordal if and only if it is the intersection graph of subtrees of a tree, if and only if it admits a tree-decomposition into cliques. We prove a local analog of this characterization, which essentially says that a graph is locally chordal if and only if it is the intersection graph of special subtrees of a high-girth graph, if and only if it admits a special graph-decomposition over a high-girth graph into cliques. We also prove that these global representations of locally chordal graphs can be efficiently computed. This paper has two major contributions. The first is to exhibit for locally chordal graphs an ideal \"local to global\" analysis: given a graph class defined by restricted local structure, we fully describe the global structure of graphs in the class. The second is to develop the theory of graph-decompositions. Much of the work in this paper is devoted to properties of graph-decompositions that represent the global structure of graphs. This theory will be useful to find global decompositions for graph classes beyond locally chordal graphs."

Conventional approaches are not only inefficient in data utilization and training processes but also exhibit limited performance when tracking highly dynamic motions. To address these challenges, we propose EGM, a framework that enables efficient learning of a general motion tracking policy. EGM integrates four core designs. Firstly, we introduce a Bin-based Cross-motion Curriculum Adaptive Sampling strategy to dynamically orchestrate the sampling probabilities based on tracking error of each motion bin, eficiently balancing the training process across motions with varying dificulty and durations. The sampled data is then processed by our proposed Composite Decoupled Mixture-of-Experts (CDMoE) architecture, which efficiently enhances the ability to track motions from different distributions by grouping experts separately for upper and lower body and decoupling orthogonal experts from shared experts to separately handle dedicated features and general features. Central to our approach is a key insight we identified: for training a general motion tracking policy, data quality and diversity are paramount. Building on these designs, we develop a three-stage curriculum training flow to progressively enhance the policy's robustness against disturbances. Despite training on only 4.08 hours of data, EGM generalized robustly across 49.25 hours of test motions, outperforming baselines on both routine and highly dynamic tasks."

    "abstract": "Few-shot action recognition aims to enable models to quickly learn new action categories from limited labeled samples, addressing the challenge of data scarcity in real-world applications. Current research primarily addresses three core challenges: (1) temporal modeling, where models are prone to interference from irrelevant static background information and struggle to capture the essence of dynamic action features; (2) visual similarity, where categories with subtle visual differences are difficult to distinguish; and (3) the modality gap between visual-textual support prototypes and visual-only queries, which complicates alignment within a shared embedding space. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a CLIP-SPM framework, which includes three components: (1) the Hierarchical Synergistic Motion Refinement (HSMR) module, which aligns deep and shallow motion features to improve temporal modeling by reducing static background interference; (2) the Semantic Prototype Modulation (SPM) strategy, which generates query-relevant text prompts to bridge the modality gap and integrates them with visual features, enhancing the discriminability between similar actions; and (3) the Prototype-Anchor Dual Modulation (PADM) method, which refines support prototypes and aligns query features with a global semantic anchor, improving consistency across support and query samples. Comprehensive experiments across standard benchmarks, including Kinetics, SSv2-Full, SSv2-Small, UCF101, and HMDB51, demonstrate that our CLIP-SPM achieves competitive performance under 1-shot, 3-shot, and 5-shot settings. Extensive ablation studies and visual analyses further validate the effectiveness of each component and its contributions to addressing the core challenges. The source code and models are publicly available at GitHub."

As a framework for studying synchronization in motions, the Vicsek model is simple and efficient, assuming isotropic interactions with a complete field of view. Drawing inspiration from natural swarms, we incorporate realistic constraints into the model. By analysing the interaction structures from the complex network perspective, we demonstrate that models with the homogeneous interaction rules naturally form Erdos-Renyi networks, whereas the introduction of heterogeneity leads to Barabasi-Albert networks. Furthermore, we discover that the model's synchronization is fundamentally governed by the average degree of the interaction network. Through a comparative analysis across these topologies, we identify a stretched-exponential relationship between the average degree and the synchronization metrics."

Privacy regulations, however, forbid retaining past data, necessitating rehearsal-free IL (RF-IL). Vision-Language Pre-trained (VLP) models, with their prompt-tunable cross-modal representations, enable efficient adaptation to new spoofing styles and domains. Capitalizing on this strength, we propose \\textbf{SVLP-IL}, a VLP-based RF-IL framework that balances stability and plasticity via \\textit{Multi-Aspect Prompting} (MAP) and \\textit{Selective Elastic Weight Consolidation} (SEWC). MAP isolates domain dependencies, enhances distribution-shift sensitivity, and mitigates forgetting by jointly exploiting universal and domain-specific cues. SEWC selectively preserves critical weights from previous tasks, retaining essential knowledge while allowing flexibility for new adaptations. Comprehensive experiments across multiple PAD benchmarks show that SVLP-IL significantly reduces catastrophic forgetting and enhances performance on unseen domains. SVLP-IL offers a privacy-compliant, practical solution for robust lifelong PAD deployment in RF-IL settings."

To overcome these limitations, we introduce VLNVerse: a new large-scale, extensible benchmark designed for Versatile, Embodied, Realistic Simulation, and Evaluation. VLNVerse redefines VLN as a scalable, full-stack embodied AI problem. Its Versatile nature unifies previously fragmented tasks into a single framework and provides an extensible toolkit for researchers. Its Embodied design moves beyond intangible and teleporting \"ghost\" agents that support full-kinematics in a Realistic Simulation powered by a robust physics engine. We leverage the scale and diversity of VLNVerse to conduct a comprehensive Evaluation of existing methods, from classic models to MLLM-based agents. We also propose a novel unified multi-task model capable of addressing all tasks within the benchmark. VLNVerse aims to narrow the gap between simulated navigation and real-world generalization, providing the community with a vital tool to boost research towards scalable, general-purpose embodied locomotion agents."

Using sensing mutual information as the sensing metric, we formulate a nonconvex weighted objective that jointly captures secure communication (via secrecy rate) and sensing performance. A high-SNR analysis based on subspace decomposition characterizes the maximum achievable weighted degrees of freedom and reveals that a quasi-optimal precoder must span a \"useful subspace,\" highlighting why straightforward extensions of classical wiretap/ISAC precoders can be suboptimal in this tripartite setting. Motivated by these insights, we develop a practical two-stage iterative algorithm that alternates between sequential basis construction and power allocation via a difference-of-convex program. Numerical results show that the proposed approach captures the desirable precoding structure predicted by the analysis and yields substantial gains in the MIMO-ME-MS channel."

Sensors proposed to overcome this sensory desert are often bulky, complex, and incompatible with the surgical workflow. We present PalpAid, a multimodal pneumatic tactile sensor equipped with a microphone and pressure sensor, converting contact force into an internal pressure differential. The pressure sensor acts as an event detector, while the auditory signature captured by the microphone assists in tissue delineation. We show the design, fabrication, and assembly of sensory units with characterization tests to show robustness to use, inflation-deflation cycles, and integration with a robotic system. Finally, we show the sensor's ability to classify 3D-printed hard objects with varying infills and soft ex vivo tissues. Overall, PalpAid aims to fill the sensory gap intelligently and allow improved clinical decision-making."

The current paper presents the state of the art in designing, realizing, and testing the security of robust quantum-resistant algorithms, paying attention to lattice-based, code-based, multivariate polynomial and hash-based cryptography. We discuss their resistance to classical and quantum attackers, distributed system scalability properties, and their deployment in practice (secure communications, blockchain, cloud computing infrastructures). Also, we study a hybrid cryptographic model that integrates the classical efficient cryptography scheme and a quantum-resilient cryptographic scheme to achieve a backward-compatible solution and simultaneously improving the forward security properties.

However, these approaches perform redundant point processing and consequently become computationally expensive, yet still overlook the rich geometric priors inherently provided by raw point clouds. To this end, we introduce ICP-4D, a simple yet effective training-free framework that unifies spatial and temporal reasoning through geometric relations among instance-level point sets. Specifically, we apply the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm to directly associate temporally consistent instances by aligning the source and target point sets through the estimated transformation. To stabilize association under noisy instance predictions, we introduce a Sinkhorn-based soft matching. This exploits the underlying instance distribution to obtain accurate point-wise correspondences, resulting in robust geometric alignment. Furthermore, our carefully designed pipeline, which considers three instance types-static, dynamic, and missing-offers computational efficiency and occlusion-aware matching. Our extensive experiments across both SemanticKITTI and panoptic nuScenes demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, even without additional training or extra point cloud inputs."

For empirical analysis, we selected sample data including research articles published in Science and Nature, top 1% highly cited papers, and zero-cited papers for the year 2005, 2010, 2015, 2020, and 2025. We calculated the knowledge eccentricity scores for these papers and examined their potential influencing factors. The results indicate that team size exerts a significant negative effect on paper novelty, meaning larger team size is less conductive to enhancing the novelty of research outputs. Conversely, the number of references shows a signifcant positive correlation with paper novelty, which means that a greater number of references is associated with a moderate imporovement in a paper's novelty. The proposed indicator offers strong timeliness and operability, allowing for the evaluation of a paper's novelty immediately upon its publication."

Semi-supervised detection methods can utilize the supervision of partial labels, thus reducing false positive rates. However, most of the current semi-supervised methods focus on numerical data and neglect the heterogeneity of data information. In this paper, we propose a consistency-guided outlier detection algorithm (COD) for heterogeneous data with the fuzzy rough set theory in a semi-supervised manner. First, a few labeled outliers are leveraged to construct label-informed fuzzy similarity relations. Next, the consistency of the fuzzy decision system is introduced to evaluate attributes' contributions to knowledge classification. Subsequently, we define the outlier factor based on the fuzzy similarity class and predict outliers by integrating the classification consistency and the outlier factor. The proposed algorithm is extensively evaluated on 15 freshly proposed datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that COD is better than or comparable with the leading outlier detectors.

Time discretization is achieved through operator splitting, where each subproblem at the fractional steps either has a closed-form solution or can be efficiently solved using advanced algorithms. Our method circumvents the need for complex parameter tuning and demonstrates robustness to parameter choices.

The exceptional energy resolution of the Mossbauer resonance enables testing nuclear energy shifts arising from the local dark matter field. In principle, a stationary measurement allows faster data acquisition and becomes advantageous at higher dark matter masses in the range 10^{-15} - 10^{-8} eV. We present the projected sensitivity to the dark matter parameter space for three candidate Mossbauer isotopes, Ag-109, Sc-45, and Zn-67. Among them, Ag-109 provides the highest sensitivity, followed by Zn-67. For Ag-109, the scalar dark matter photon coupling f_gamma^{-1} can be constrained down to the level of 10^{-18} GeV^{-1}}, exceeding the sensitivity of several existing experiments. The scalar dark matter gluon coupling f_g^{-1} can be probed down to 10^{-21} GeV^{-1}, while the scalar dark matter quark coupling y_d can reach approximately 10^{-22} GeV^{-1}.

However, existing dynamic multiobjective evolutionary algorithms often neglect solution modality, whereas static multimodal multiobjective evolutionary algorithms lack adaptability to dynamic changes. To address above challenge, this paper makes two primary contributions. First, we introduce a new benchmark suite of dynamic multimodal multiobjective test functions constructed by fusing the properties of both dynamic and multimodal optimization to establish a rigorous evaluation platform. Second, we propose a novel algorithm centered on a Clustering-based Autoencoder prediction dynamic response mechanism, which utilizes an autoencoder model to process matched clusters to generate a highly diverse initial population. Furthermore, to balance the algorithm's convergence and diversity, we integrate an adaptive niching strategy into the static optimizer. Empirical analysis on 12 instances of dynamic multimodal multiobjective test functions reveals that, compared with several state-of-the-art dynamic multiobjective evolutionary algorithms and multimodal multiobjective evolutionary algorithms, our algorithm not only preserves population diversity more effectively in the decision space but also achieves superior convergence in the objective space."

Alternatively, the Win Ratio (WR) and other Win Statistics (WS) analyses rely on a strict hierarchical ordering of endpoints, assigning higher priority to clinically important endpoints. However, determining a definitive endpoint hierarchy can be challenging and may not adequately reflect situations where endpoints have comparable importance. In this study, we discuss the challenges of endpoint prioritization, underscore its critical role in WS analyses, and propose Rotation WR (RWR), a hybrid prioritization framework that integrates both prioritized and non-prioritized structures. By permitting blocks of equally-prioritized endpoints, RWR accommodates endpoints of equal or near equal clinical importance, recurrent events, and contexts requiring individualized shared decision making. Statistical inference for RWR is developed using U-statistics theory, including the hypothesis testing procedure and confidence interval construction. Extensions to two additional WS measures, Rotation Net Benefit and Rotation Win Odds, are also provided. Through extensive simulation studies involving multiple time-to-event endpoints, including recurrent events, we demonstrate that RWR achieves valid type I error control, desirable statistical power, and accurate confidence interval coverage. We illustrate both the methodological and practical insights of our work in a case study on endpoint prioritization with the SPRINT clinical trial, highlighting its implications for real-world clinical trial studies."

    "abstract": "Existing deep image watermarking methods follow a fixed embedding-distortion-extraction pipeline, where the embedder and extractor are weakly coupled through a final loss and optimized in isolation. This design lacks explicit collaboration, leaving no structured mechanism for the embedder to incorporate decoding-aware cues or for the extractor to guide embedding during training. To address this architectural limitation, we rethink deep image watermarking by reformulating embedding and extraction as explicitly collaborative components. To realize this reformulation, we introduce a Collaborative Interaction Mechanism (CIM) that establishes direct, bidirectional communication between the embedder and extractor, enabling a mutual-teacher training paradigm and coordinated optimization. Built upon this explicitly collaborative architecture, we further propose an Adaptive Feature Modulation Module (AFMM) to support effective interaction. AFMM enables content-aware feature regulation by decoupling modulation structure and strength, guiding watermark embedding toward stable image features while suppressing host interference during extraction. Under CIM, the AFMMs on both sides form a closed-loop collaboration that aligns embedding behavior with extraction objectives. This architecture-level redesign changes how robustness is learned in watermarking systems. Rather than relying on exhaustive distortion simulation, robustness emerges from coordinated representation learning between embedding and extraction. Experiments on real-world and AI-generated datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in watermark extraction accuracy while maintaining high perceptual quality, showing strong robustness and generalization."

    "abstract": "Among existing online mobile-use benchmarks, AndroidWorld has emerged as the dominant benchmark due to its reproducible environment and deterministic evaluation; however, recent agents achieving over 90% success rates indicate its saturation and motivate the need for a more challenging benchmark. In addition, its environment lacks key application categories, such as e-commerce and enterprise communication, and does not reflect realistic mobile-use scenarios characterized by vague user instructions and hybrid tool usage. To bridge this gap, we introduce MobileWorld, a substantially more challenging benchmark designed to better reflect real-world mobile usage, comprising 201 tasks across 20 applications, while maintaining the same level of reproducible evaluation as AndroidWorld. The difficulty of MobileWorld is twofold. First, it emphasizes long-horizon tasks with cross-application interactions: MobileWorld requires nearly twice as many task-completion steps on average (27.8 vs. 14.3) and includes far more multi-application tasks (62.2% vs. 9.5%) compared to AndroidWorld. Second, MobileWorld extends beyond standard GUI manipulation by introducing novel task categories, including agent-user interaction and MCP-augmented tasks. To ensure robust evaluation, we provide snapshot-based container environment and precise functional verifications, including backend database inspection and task callback APIs. We further develop a planner-executor agentic framework with extended action spaces to support user interactions and MCP calls. Our results reveal a sharp performance drop compared to AndroidWorld, with the best agentic framework and end-to-end model achieving 51.7% and 20.9% success rates, respectively. Our analysis shows that current models struggle significantly with user interaction and MCP calls, offering a strategic roadmap toward more robust, next-generation mobile intelligence."

    "abstract": "We revisit a basic question in sequence modeling: is explicit self-attention actually necessary for strong performance and reasoning? We argue that standard multi-head attention is best seen as a form of tensor lifting: hidden vectors are mapped into a high-dimensional space of pairwise interactions, and learning proceeds by constraining this lifted tensor through gradient descent. This mechanism is extremely expressive but mathematically opaque, because after many layers it becomes very hard to describe the model with a small family of explicit invariants. To explore an alternative, we propose an attention-free architecture based on Grassmann flows. Instead of forming an L by L attention matrix, our Causal Grassmann layer (i) linearly reduces token states, (ii) encodes local token pairs as two-dimensional subspaces on a Grassmann manifold via Plucker coordinates, and (iii) fuses these geometric features back into the hidden states through gated mixing. Information therefore propagates by controlled deformations of low-rank subspaces over multi-scale local windows, so the core computation lives on a finite-dimensional manifold rather than in an unstructured tensor space. On the Wikitext-2 language modeling benchmark, purely Grassmann-based models with 13 to 18 million parameters achieve validation perplexities within about 10 to 15 percent of size-matched Transformers. On the SNLI natural language inference task, a Grassmann-Plucker head on top of DistilBERT slightly outperforms a Transformer head, with best validation and test accuracies of 0.8550 and 0.8538 compared to 0.8545 and 0.8511. We analyze the complexity of Grassmann mixing, show linear scaling in sequence length for fixed rank, and argue that such manifold-based designs offer a more structured route toward geometric and invariant-based interpretations of neural reasoning."

    "abstract": "Measurement of the Hall effect is a ubiquitous probe for materials discovery, characterization, and metrology. Inherent to the Hall measurement geometry, the measured signal is often contaminated by unwanted contributions, so the data must be processed to isolate the Hall response. The standard approach invokes Onsager-Casimir reciprocity and antisymmetrizes the raw signal about zero applied magnetic field. In hysteretic materials this becomes nontrivial, since Onsager-Casimir relations apply only to microscopically reversible states. Incorrect antisymmetrization can lead to artifacts that mimic anomalous or topological Hall signatures. The situation is especially subtle when hysteresis loops are not centered at zero applied field, as in exchange-biased systems. A practical reference for generically extracting the Hall response in hysteretic materials is lacking. Here, using Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ as a bulk single-crystal model that can be prepared with or without exchange-biased hysteresis, we demonstrate two procedures that can be used to extract the Hall effect: (1) reverse-magnetic-field reciprocity and (2) antisymmetrization with respect to applied field. We then measure the Hall effect on CeCoGe$_3$, a noncentrosymmetric antiferromagnet which can be prepared to have asymmetric magnetization and magnetoresistance, and demonstrate how improper processing can generate artificial anomalous Hall signals.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides in code generation, achieving impressive capabilities in synthesizing code snippets from natural language instructions. However, a critical challenge remains in ensuring LLMs generate factually accurate responses about programming concepts, technical implementations, etc. Most previous code-related benchmarks focus on code execution correctness, overlooking the factual accuracy of programming knowledge. To address this gap, we present CodeSimpleQA, a comprehensive bilingual benchmark designed to evaluate the factual accuracy of code LLMs in answering code-related questions, which contains carefully curated question-answer pairs in both English and Chinese, covering diverse programming languages and major computer science domains. Further, we create CodeSimpleQA-Instruct, a large-scale instruction corpus with 66M samples, and develop a post-training framework combining supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. Our comprehensive evaluation of diverse LLMs reveals that even frontier LLMs struggle with code factuality. Our proposed framework demonstrates substantial improvements over the base model, underscoring the critical importance of factuality-aware alignment in developing reliable code LLMs."

    "abstract": "Confocal and multi-photon microscopy are widely used for in-vivo fluorescence imaging of biological tissues such as the brain, offering non-invasive access up to ~1 mm depth without major loss in performance. A recently-developed alternative is holographic endoscopy, which exploits controlled light transport through hair-thin optical fibres. With minimal invasiveness, it provides observations at comparable spatial resolution, while extending its applicability to unprecedented depths. It has been used to resolve details of sub-cellular structural connectivity, record neuronal signalling, and monitor blood flow from the deepest locations of the living brain. Yet, its use, particularly in densely labelled brain regions, has so far been constrained by significant contrast loss, primarily due to the absence of a practical mechanism for rejecting out-of-focus fluorescence light -- a capability inherently provided by confocal and multi-photon microscopy. Exploring opportunities in the structure of light modes of different MMF types we identify the possibility of achieving an analogue to confocal fluorescence microscopy through MMF-based endoscopes. Using a novel composite fibre probe that combines graded-index and step-index MMFs, we enable spatially resolved signal collection and selective rejection of out-of-focus light. This confocal filtering significantly enhances image contrast and resolution by suppressing background and off-plane signals. We demonstrate improved imaging performance on fine structural connectivity and intracellular calcium signalling in living mouse brain."

Yet, they partly realized their promises so far, and whether they give fresh perspectives on long-standing predictions in statistical physics is still an open question. Undoubtedly, they are uniquely amenable to electric-field effect, susceptible to mechanical deformation, and sensitive to moirés, for example. They represent interesting platforms for exploring, challenging, or simply revisiting a wide range of phenomena in condensed matter magnetism.

We present Multi-Organ-COhesion Network++ (MOON++), a novel multimodal framework that enhances EV assessment through comprehensive analysis of NCCT scans. Inspired by clinical evidence correlating organ volumetric relationships with liver disease severity, MOON++ synthesizes imaging characteristics of the esophagus, liver, and spleen through multimodal learning. We evaluated our approach using 1,631 patients, those with endoscopically confirmed EV were classified into four severity grades. Validation in 239 patient cases and independent testing in 289 cases demonstrate superior performance compared to conventional single organ methods, achieving an AUC of 0.894 versus 0.803 for the severe grade EV classification (G3 versus <G3) and 0.921 versus 0.793 for the differentiation of moderate to severe grades (>=G2 versus <G2). We conducted a reader study involving experienced radiologists to further validate the performance of MOON++. To our knowledge, MOON++ represents the first comprehensive multi-organ NCCT analysis framework incorporating clinical knowledge priors for EV assessment, potentially offering a promising non-invasive diagnostic alternative."

    "abstract": "Modern learning systems increasingly interact with data that evolve over time and depend on hidden internal state. We ask a basic question: when is such a dynamical system learnable from observations alone? This paper proposes a research program for understanding learnability in dynamical systems through the lens of next-token prediction. We argue that learnability in dynamical systems should be studied as a finite-sample question, and be based on the properties of the underlying dynamics rather than the statistical properties of the resulting sequence. To this end, we give a formulation of learnability for stochastic processes induced by dynamical systems, focusing on guarantees that hold uniformly at every time step after a finite burn-in period. This leads to a notion of dynamic learnability which captures how the structure of a system, such as stability, mixing, observability, and spectral properties, governs the number of observations required before reliable prediction becomes possible. We illustrate the framework in the case of linear dynamical systems, showing that accurate prediction can be achieved after finite observation without system identification, by leveraging improper methods based on spectral filtering. We survey the relationship between learning in dynamical systems and classical PAC, online, and universal prediction theories, and suggest directions for studying nonlinear and controlled systems."

However, identifying the presence and exact location of a photon sphere observationally remains challenging. Motivated by this, we investigate shadow formation in spacetimes that lack a photon sphere by applying the Simpson-Visser (SV) regularization technique (originally designed to smooth black hole singularities) to null singularity and charged null singularity metrics. Remarkably, these regularized null and charged null singularity spacetimes can produce a shadow without a photon sphere. We analyze how the SV regularization parameter influences their geometry and shadow size, and show that the regularized null and charged null singularity spacetimes can correspond either to two-way traversable wormholes or retain singularities. Our results reveal that shadows arising from these regularized 'null singularity spacetimes' closely mimic those of Schwarzschild and charged black-bounce spacetimes, despite the absence of a photon sphere. We also constrain parameters in these geometries using observational data of Sgr A* and M87."

    "abstract": "Defects in atomically thin van der Waals materials have recently been investigated as sources of spin-photon entanglement with sensitivity to strain tuning. Unlike many two-dimensional materials, quasi-one-dimensional materials such as transition metal trichalcogenides exhibit in-plane anisotropy resulting in axis-dependent responses to compressive and tensile strains. Herein, we characterize the tunable spin and optical properties of intrinsic vacancy defects in titanium trisulfide (TiS3) and niobium trisulfide (NbS3) nanowires. Within our ab initio approach, we show that sulfur vacancies and divacancies (VS and VD , respectively) in TiS3 and NbS3 adopt strain-dependent defect geometries between in-plane strains of -3 % and 3 %. The calculated electronic structures indicate that both VS and VD possess in-gap defect states with optically bright electronic transitions whose position relative to the conduction and valence bands varies with in-plane strain. Further, our calculations predict that VS in TiS3 and VD in NbS3 exhibit transitions in their ground state spins; specifically, a compressive strain of 0.4 % along the direction of nanowire growth causes a shift from a triplet state to a singlet state for the VS defect in TiS3, whereas a tensile strain of 2.9 % along the same direction in NbS3 induces a triplet ground state with a zero-phonon line of 0.83 eV in the VD defect. Our work shows that the anisotropic geometry of TiS3 and NbS3 nanowires offers exceptional tunability of optically active spin defects that can be used in quantum applications."

The visual alignment module achieves pixel-level alignment through SDF reconstruction and editable 3DGS rendering, while the dynamic alignment module ensures dynamic consistency by identifying rigid physics from robot-object interaction. TwinAligner improves robot learning by providing scalable data collection and establishing a trustworthy iterative cycle, accelerating algorithm development. Quantitative evaluations highlight TwinAligner's strong capabilities in visual and dynamic real-to-sim alignment. This system enables policies trained in simulation to achieve strong zero-shot generalization to the real world.

    "abstract": "More than a century after discovery, the theory of conventional superconductivity remains incomplete. While the importance of electron-phonon coupling is understood, a controlled first-principles treatment of Coulomb interaction is lacking. Current ab initio calculations of superconductivity rely on a phenomenological downfolding approximation, replacing Coulomb interaction with a repulsive pseudopotential μ*, and leaving ambiguities in electron-phonon coupling with dynamical Coulomb interactions unresolved. We address this via an effective field theory approach, integrating out high-energy electronic degrees of freedom using variational Diagrammatic Monte Carlo. Applied to the uniform electron gas, this establishes a microscopic procedure to implement downfolding, define the pseudopotential, and express dynamical Coulomb effects on electron-phonon coupling via the electron vertex function. We find the bare pseudopotential significantly larger than conventional values. This yields improved pseudopotential estimates in simple metals and tests density functional perturbation theory accuracy for effective electron-phonon coupling. We present an ab initio workflow computing superconducting Tc from the anomalous vertex's precursory Cooper flow. This infers Tc from normal state calculations, enabling reliable estimates of very low Tc (including near quantum phase transitions) beyond conventional reach. Validating our approach on simple metals without empirical tuning, we resolve long-standing discrepancies and predict a pressure-induced transition in Al from superconducting to non-superconducting above ~60GPa. We propose ambient-pressure Mg and Na are proximal to a similar critical point. Our work establishes a controlled ab initio framework for electron-phonon superconductivity beyond the weak-correlation limit, paving the way for reliable Tc calculations and novel material design."

    "abstract": "Speech intelligibility assessment is essential for many speech-related applications. However, most objective intelligibility metrics are intrusive, as they require clean reference speech in addition to the degraded or processed signal for evaluation. Furthermore, existing metrics such as STOI are primarily designed for normal hearing listeners, and their predictive accuracy for hearing impaired speech intelligibility remains limited. On the other hand, the GESI (Gammachirp Envelope Similarity Index) can be used to estimate intelligibility for hearing-impaired listeners, but it is also intrusive, as it depends on reference signals. This requirement limits its applicability in real-world scenarios. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes DeepGESI, a non-intrusive deep learning-based model capable of accurately and efficiently predicting the speech intelligibility of hearing-impaired listeners without requiring any clean reference speech. Experimental results demonstrate that, under the test conditions of the 2nd Clarity Prediction Challenge(CPC2) dataset, the GESI scores predicted by DeepGESI exhibit a strong correlation with the actual GESI scores. In addition, the proposed model achieves a substantially faster prediction speed compared to conventional methods."

This work introduces a mixture of generalized additive models (GAMs) in which random Fourier feature (RFF) representations are leveraged to uncover locally adaptive structure in the data. In the proposed method, an RFF-based embedding is first learned and then compressed via principal component analysis. The resulting low-dimensional representations are used to perform soft clustering of the data through a Gaussian mixture model. These cluster assignments are then applied to construct a mixture-of-GAMs framework, where each local GAM captures nonlinear effects through interpretable univariate smooth functions. Numerical experiments on real-world regression benchmarks, including the California Housing, NASA Airfoil Self-Noise, and Bike Sharing datasets, demonstrate improved predictive performance relative to classical interpretable models. Overall, this construction provides a principled approach for integrating representation learning with transparent statistical modeling."

    "abstract": "Traditional drone-view geo-localization (DVGL) methods based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) have achieved remarkable performance. However, ANNs rely on dense computation, which results in high power consumption. In contrast, spiking neural networks (SNNs), which benefit from spike-driven computation, inherently provide low power consumption. Regrettably, the potential of SNNs for DVGL has yet to be thoroughly investigated. Meanwhile, the inherent sparsity of spike-driven computation for representation learning scenarios also results in loss of critical information and difficulties in learning long-range dependencies when aligning heterogeneous visual data sources. To address these, we propose SpikeViMFormer, the first SNN framework designed for DVGL. In this framework, a lightweight spike-driven transformer backbone is adopted to extract coarse-grained features. To mitigate the loss of critical information, the spike-driven selective attention (SSA) block is designed, which uses a spike-driven gating mechanism to achieve selective feature enhancement and highlight discriminative regions. Furthermore, a spike-driven hybrid state space (SHS) block is introduced to learn long-range dependencies using a hybrid state space. Moreover, only the backbone is utilized during the inference stage to reduce computational cost. To ensure backbone effectiveness, a novel hierarchical re-ranking alignment learning (HRAL) strategy is proposed. It refines features via neighborhood re-ranking and maintains cross-batch consistency to directly optimize the backbone. Experimental results demonstrate that SpikeViMFormer outperforms state-of-the-art SNNs. Compared with advanced ANNs, it also achieves competitive performance.Our code is available at https://github.com/ISChenawei/SpikeViMFormer"

HCDV collapses the factorial burden to O(T sum_{l} K_{l}) = O(T K_max log n), rewards examples that sharpen decision boundaries, and regularizes outliers through curvature-based smoothness. We prove that HCDV approximately satisfies the four Shapley axioms with surplus loss O(eta log n), enjoys sub-Gaussian coalition deviation tilde O(1/sqrt{T}), and incurs at most k epsilon_infty regret for top-k selection. Experiments on four benchmarks--tabular, vision, streaming, and a 45M-sample CTR task--plus the OpenDataVal suite show that HCDV lifts accuracy by up to +5 pp, slashes valuation time by up to 100x, and directly supports tasks such as augmentation filtering, low-latency streaming updates, and fair marketplace payouts."

In this work, an alternative set of periodic functions is proposed for positional encoding. These functions preserve some key properties of sinusoidal ones, while they depart from them in fundamental ways. Some tentative experiments are reported, where the original sinusoidal version is substantially outperformed. This strongly suggests that the alternative functions may have a wider use in other transformer architectures."

In this study, we formulate urban cable routing as a connectivity-path co-optimization problem and propose a learning-assisted multi-operator variable neighborhood search (L-MVNS) algorithm. The framework first introduces an auxiliary task to generate high-quality feasible initial solutions. A hybrid genetic search (HGS) and A* serve as the connectivity optimizer and the route-planning optimizer, respectively. Building on these, a multi-operator variable neighborhood search (MVNS) iteratively co-optimizes inter-substation connectivity and detailed routes via three complementary destruction operators, a modified A* repair operator, and an adaptive neighborhood-sizing mechanism. A multi-agent deep reinforcement learning module is further embedded to prioritize promising neighborhoods. We also construct a standardized and scalable benchmark suite for evaluation. Across these cases, comprehensive experiments demonstrate effectiveness and stability: relative to representative approaches, MVNS and L-MVNS reduce total construction cost by approximately 30-50%, with L-MVNS delivering additional gains on larger instances and consistently higher stability."

    "abstract": "The proliferation of pre-trained models has given rise to a wide array of specialised, fine-tuned models. Model merging aims to merge the distinct capabilities of these specialised models into a unified model, requiring minimal or even no additional training. A core objective of model merging is to ensure the merged model retains the behavioural characteristics of the specialised models, typically achieved through feature alignment. We identify that features consist of two critical components: direction and magnitude. Prior research has predominantly focused on directional alignment, while the influence of magnitude remains largely neglected, despite its pronounced vulnerability to perturbations introduced by common merging operations (e.g., parameter fusion and sparsification). Such perturbations to magnitude inevitably lead to feature deviations in the merged model from the specialised models, resulting in subsequent performance degradation. To address this, we propose MAGnItude Calibration (MAGIC), a plug-and-play framework that rectifies layer-wise magnitudes in feature and weight spaces, with three variants. Specifically, our Feature Space Calibration (FSC) realigns the merged model's features using a small set of unlabelled data, while Weight Space Calibration (WSC) extends this calibration to the weight space without requiring additional data. Combining these yields Dual Space Calibration (DSC). Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MAGIC consistently boosts performance across diverse Computer Vision tasks (+4.3% on eight datasets) and NLP tasks (+8.0% on Llama) without additional training.

Standard adversarial training, while effective for simpler tasks, often degrades both generalization performance and the quality of generated clinical reasoning. We introduce SafeMed-R1, a hybrid defense framework that ensures robust performance while preserving high-quality, interpretable medical reasoning. SafeMed-R1 employs a two-stage approach: at training time, we integrate Adversarial Training with Group Relative Policy Optimization (AT-GRPO) to explicitly robustify the reasoning process against worst-case perturbations; at inference time, we augment the model with Randomized Smoothing to provide certified $L_2$-norm robustness guarantees. We evaluate SafeMed-R1 on the OmniMedVQA benchmark across eight medical imaging modalities comprising over 88,000 samples. Our experiments reveal that standard fine-tuned VLMs, despite achieving 95\\% accuracy on clean inputs, collapse to approximately 25\\% under PGD attacks. In contrast, SafeMed-R1 maintains 84.45\\% accuracy under the same adversarial conditions, representing a 59 percentage point improvement in robustness. Furthermore, we demonstrate that models trained with explicit chain-of-thought reasoning exhibit superior adversarial robustness compared to instruction-only variants, suggesting a synergy between interpretability and security in medical AI systems."

Starting from the Palatini formulation of General Relativity, we recall how an equivalent Eddington-type purely affine action arises at the classical level under mild assumptions. A key feature for the non-perturbative program is that, in the pure gravity case, for a positive cosmological constant, the action is bounded below, allowing one to define a well-posed statistical ensemble of connections. We discretize this theory on a fixed hypercubic lattice and construct the corresponding partition function, including torsionful and torsionless ensembles. We provide an open C++ Monte Carlo implementation that can simulate these ensembles in arbitrary dimension, and we present proof-of-principle results in two dimensions."

We determine the number of even-even partitions of Paley graphs, showing it is exponential if $q\\equiv 1\\Mod{8}$ and is trivial if $q\\equiv 5\\Mod{8}$, while proving the non-existence of even-even partition for Paley tournaments. Furthermore, we derive asymptotic formulas for the numbers of even induced sub(di)graphs of order $r=o(q^{1/4})$ in Paley graphs and Paley tournaments, demonstrating their concentration around the expected values in the corresponding random (di)graph models. In the context of coding theory, we establish a correspondence between even/odd induced sub(di)graphs of Paley graphs (tournaments) and maximum distance separable (MDS) self-dual codes that can be constructed via (extended) generalized Reed-Solomon codes from subsets of finite fields.

During training, the input of a prediction network at one training timestep is the corresponding ground-truth noisy data that is an interpolation of the noise and the data, and during testing, the input is the generated noisy data. We present a novel training approach, named MixFlow, for improving the performance. Our approach is motivated by the Slow Flow phenomenon: the ground-truth interpolation that is the nearest to the generated noisy data at a given sampling timestep is observed to correspond to a higher-noise timestep (termed slowed timestep), i.e., the corresponding ground-truth timestep is slower than the sampling timestep. MixFlow leverages the interpolations at the slowed timesteps, named slowed interpolation mixture, for post-training the prediction network for each training timestep. Experiments over class-conditional image generation (including SiT, REPA, and RAE) and text-to-image generation validate the effectiveness of our approach. Our approach MixFlow over the RAE models achieve strong generation results on ImageNet: 1.43 FID (without guidance) and 1.10 (with guidance) at 256 x 256, and 1.55 FID (without guidance) and 1.10 (with guidance) at 512 x 512."

However, generating truly realistic human animation remains a formidable challenge, where even minor inconsistencies can make a subject appear unnatural. This limitation is particularly critical when AI-generated videos are evaluated for behavioral biometrics, where subtle motion cues that define identity are easily lost or distorted. The present study investigates whether state-of-the-art GenAI human animation models can preserve the subtle spatio-temporal details needed for person identification through gait biometrics. Specifically, we evaluate four different GenAI models across two primary evaluation tasks to assess their ability to i) restore gait patterns from reference videos under varying conditions of complexity, and ii) transfer these gait patterns to different visual identities. Our results show that while visual quality is mostly high, biometric fidelity remains low in tasks focusing on identification, suggesting that current GenAI models struggle to disentangle identity from motion. Furthermore, through an identity transfer task, we expose a fundamental flaw in appearance-based gait recognition: when texture is disentangled from motion, identification collapses, proving current GenAI models rely on visual attributes rather than temporal dynamics."

The fundamental idea is that the smoothing action of turbulent stresses can be described as a temporal filtering operator implicitly applied to the solution. Contrary to the average and spatial filtering operators, the temporal filter is an unifying operator smoothly varying within the statistical and scale-resolving realms. The potential of the temporal filtering paradigm is here highlighted by unveiling relevant algebraic properties and by deriving a new class of turbulence closures. A dynamic procedure is derived and shown to provide an unifying closure for both scale-resolving and statistical approaches. Results show that an improved physics is captured. Challenging phenomena such as the laminar to turbulence transition and the dependence of separation and reattachment on free-stream turbulence applied through boundary conditions are captured."

To further enforce interpretability, we introduce Scaled Hard Thresholding (SHT) for invariant variable selection. A two-step estimation procedure, built upon robust initialization and SRGD--SHT iterative updates, is proposed for canonical matrix problems, such as trace regression, matrix GLMs, and bilinear models. The convergence rates are established for heavy-tailed predictors and noise, identifying a phase transition where optimal convergence rates recover under finite noise variance and degrade optimally for heavier tails. Experiments on simulated data and two real-world applications confirm superior robustness and efficiency of the proposed procedure."

In-out matrix elements in pair creating fields are readily handled using first-quantized methods, and the approach we develop serves to facilitate the evaluation of in-in observables in pair creating backgrounds. We find that in-in augmentations to the in-out partition function and or propagator amount to the insertion of a non-local interaction term that sandwiches a function that serves to enclose singularities in complex Schwinger propertime.

Central to our approach is an LLM-based prompt optimizer agent that iteratively refines the prompts using retrieved examples, performance feedback, and internal self-evaluation. Our framework is evaluated on a real-world logistics text annotation task, where reasoning accuracy and labeling efficiency are critical. Experimental results show that the optimized prompts - particularly those enhanced via Auto-CoT and RAG - improve real-world inference accuracy by up to 15% compared to baseline zero-shot or static prompts. The system demonstrates consistent improvements across multiple LLMs, including GPT-4o, Qwen 2.5 (72B), and LLaMA 3.1 (70B), validating its generalizability and practical value. These findings suggest that structured prompt optimization is a viable alternative to full fine-tuning, offering scalable solutions for deploying LLMs in domain-specific NLP applications such as logistics."

In such cases two-soliton solutions, breather solutions, two-breather solutions, and soliton-breather solutions are obtained. We numerically simulate and visually illustrate the spatiotemporal evolution of these solutions.

One approach involves the use of plausibility checks, rule-based procedures that assess the correctness and internal consistency of data, to detect anomalies or signs of manipulation. Although these verification procedures are essential for ensuring data integrity, existing plausibility checks are manually implemented by software engineers, which is time-consuming. Recent advances in code generation with large language models (LLMs) offer new potential for automating and scaling the generation of these checks. However, adapting LLMs to the specific requirements of an unknown domain remains a significant challenge. This work investigates the extent to which LLMs, adapted on domain-specific code and data through different fine-tuning strategies, can generate rule-based plausibility checks for forgery detection on constrained hardware resources. We fine-tune open-source LLMs, Llama 3.1 8B and OpenCoder 8B, on structured datasets derived from real-world application scenarios and evaluate the generated plausibility checks on previously unseen forgery patterns. The results demonstrate that the models are capable of generating executable and effective verification procedures.

We employed the No New Net (nnU-Net) framework with a selective training strategy that systematically analyzed the impact of image quality and center-specific variability on segmentation performance. Controlled experiments on the DUKE, NACT, ISPY1, and ISPY2 datasets revealed that including ISPY scans with motion artifacts and reduced contrast impaired segmentation performance, even with advanced preprocessing, such as contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE). In contrast, training on DUKE and NACT data, which exhibited clearer contrast and fewer motion artifacts despite varying resolutions, with early phase images (0000-0002) provided more stable training conditions.

For instance, membership in these spaces is typically required for transport maps in optimal transport theory and for stochastic processes in probability theory. Nonlinear Lebesgue spaces also arise naturally in applications such as medical imaging, where the physical signals at play often exhibit little regularity and take their values in nonlinear spaces. Yet, these spaces remain little studied in the literature, likely due to their lack of differential structure outside the case where mappings are valued in a linear space. This paper is the first in a series by the authors devoted to the study of geometric and analytic properties of nonlinear Lebesgue spaces. The present article exposes a systematic treatment of their measure-theoretic properties, unifying and refining scattered results from the literature while also extending classical results from the linear setting to this broader nonlinear framework -- including the characterizations of their completeness and their separability as well as the density of some of their subspaces: the spaces of simple, continuous and smooth mappings."

    "abstract": "In this work, we derive a new class of charged black holes by introducing Dunkl derivatives in the four dimensional spacetime. To construct such solutions, we first compute the Ricci tensor and the Ricci scalar using the Christoffel symbols. Substituting them into the modified Einstein field equations via extended Dunkl derivations, we obtain the metric function of charged Dunkl black holes. Next, we investigate the charge effect on the corresponding thermodynamical properties by computing the associated quantities. To study the thermal stability, we calculate the heat capacity. After that, we approach the P-v criticality behaviors by determining the critical pressure Pc, the critical temperature Tc and the critical specific volume vc in terms of Q and two parameters A and B carrying data on the Dunkl reflections. Precisely, we show that the ratio Pcvc Tc is a universal number with respect to the charge Q and B parameters. Taking a zero limit of A, we recover the Van der Waals fluid behaviors. For Joule-Thomson expansion effects for such charged black holes, we reveal certain similarities and the differences with Van der Waals fluids. Finally, we discuss the phase transitions via the Gibbs free energy computations."

The complex refractive indices of amorphous and crystalline GST-467 were experimentally extracted and used to propose a segmented silicon-on-insulator photonic switch optimized at 1550 nm. Three-dimensional FDTD simulations reveal that segmentation significantly enhances the extinction ratio while maintaining low insertion loss, resulting in a more than seven times higher design figure of merit than an unsegmented design. Laser-induced thermo-optical simulations further establish efficient, reversible switching with sub-nJ energy requirements for crystallization and amorphization. Compared with established GST, GSST, and GSS compositions, GST-467 provides the largest transmission contrast and supports up to 48 resolvable optical states. When deployed as multi-level weights in photonic DNN architectures, the GST-467 switch achieves superior classification accuracy on EMNIST and Fashion-MNIST benchmarks. These results position GST-467 as a highly promising PCM for scalable, low-energy photonic computing and neuromorphic hardware."

    "abstract": "The recently discovered gravitational wave (GW) event, GW231123, is the highest mass binary black hole (BBH) merger detected to date by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. The inferred source masses of GW231123 lie in a mass range where stellar-progenitor black holes are rare to exist due to the pair instability supernovae mass gap, and hence alternative scenarios of origin of this inferred heavy mass black hole become important. One of such hypotheses of its origin is gravitational lensing that introduces modulations to the amplitude and phase of GWs and can make the inferred mass higher from the true value. In this work, we search for the lensing signatures from GW231123 and all other events in a model-independent approach using the technique \\texttt{$μ$-GLANCE} which carries out tests on its residual strain to look for common features across the detector network through cross-correlation and infers the lensing signal in a Bayesian framework. Our analysis tests yield no strong evidence in support for lensing, though it detects presence of potential residual in the data, which can be a micro-lensing signature with a modulation amplitude less than 0.8 at 95\\% C.I. However, our study finds that current waveform systematics for such heavy mass binary systems are large enough to shadow the detection of lensing from such short-duration GWs such as GW231123, and hence no concluding claim of lensing could be made at this stage. We conclude that if this event is lensed, then in near future, detection of similar lensed events will take place with current detector sensitivity and hence can open a potential discovery space of lensed GW signal with the aid of more accurate waveform models."

We provide a new perspective by developing a unified semiparametric efficiency framework for policy learning, allowing for general treatments that are discrete, continuous, or mixed. We provide a characterization of the failure of pathwise differentiability for parameters arising from deterministic policies. We then establish efficiency bounds for pathwise differentiable parameters in randomized policies, both when the propensity score is known and when it must be estimated. Building on the convolution theorem, we introduce a notion of efficiency for the asymptotic distribution of welfare regret, showing that inefficient policy estimators not only inflate the variance of the asymptotic regret but also shift its mean upward. We derive the asymptotic theory of several common policy estimators, with a key contribution being a policy-learning analogue of the Hirano-Imbens-Ridder (HIR) phenomenon: the inverse propensity weighting estimator with an estimated propensity is efficient, whereas the same estimator using the true propensity is not. We illustrate the theoretical results with an empirically calibrated simulation study based on data from a job training program and an empirical application to a commitment savings program."

We prove that any non-degenerate singly-periodic point vortex configuration can be ``desingularized'' to create a global curve of solutions to the steady hollow vortex street problem, and we further characterize the types of singular behavior that can develop as one transverses the curve to its extreme. As specific examples, we study von Kármán vortex streets, translating vortex arrays, and a two-pair (2P) configuration.

However, existing continuous-variable gate constructions rely predominantly on polynomial functions of canonical quadratures. In this work, we introduce a complementary universality paradigm based on trigonometric continuous-variable gates, which enable a Fourier-like representation of bosonic operators and are particularly well suited for periodic and non-perturbative interactions. We present a deterministic ancilla-based method for implementing unitary and non-unitary trigonometric gates whose arguments are arbitrary Hermitian functions of qumode quadratures. As a concrete application, we develop a hybrid qubit-qumode quantum simulation of the lattice sine-Gordon model. Using these gates, we prepare ground states via quantum imaginary-time evolution, simulate real-time dynamics, compute time-dependent vertex two-point correlation functions, and extract quantum kink profiles under topological boundary conditions. Our results demonstrate that trigonometric continuous-variable gates provide a physically natural framework for simulating interacting field theories on near-term hybrid quantum hardware, while establishing a parallel route to universality beyond polynomial gate constructions. We expect that the trigonometric gates introduced here to find broader applications, including quantum simulations of condensed matter systems, quantum chemistry, and biological models."

    "abstract": "An alternative to the fully implicit or monolithic methods used for the solution of the coupling of fluid flow and deformation in porous media is a sequential approach in which the fully coupled system is broken into subproblems (flow and mechanics problems) that are solved one after the other. This fully explicit coupling approach is a very simple scheme which allows much flexibility in the implementation and has a lower computational cost, making it quite attractive in practice since smaller linear systems need to be solved in order to obtain the solution for the whole coupled poroelastic system. Due to the appealing advantages of these methods, intensive research is currently being carried out in this direction, as in the present work. Although the application of this type of method is very common in practice, there exist only a few works devoted to their theoretical analysis. In this work, we consider the so-called explicit fixed-stress split scheme, which consists of solving the flow problem first with time-lagging the displacement term, followed by the solution of the mechanics problem. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first convergence analysis of the explicit fixed-stress split scheme for Biot's equations. In particular, we prove that this algorithm is optimally convergent if the considered finite element discretization satisfies an inf-sup condition. In addition, with the aim of designing the simplest scheme for solving Biot's model, we also propose a similar decoupled algorithm for piecewise linear finite elements for both variables which arises from the novel stabilization recently proposed in \\cite{Pe2025}, and is demonstrated to be optimally convergent."

Under the lens of algorithmic stability, we then derive probabilistic bounds on the distance between a true zero and the FB output without making specific assumptions about the underlying data distribution. We show that under weaker conditions ensuring the convergence of FB schemes, stability bounds grow proportionally to the number of iterations. Conversely, stronger assumptions yield stability guarantees that are independent of the iteration count. We then specialize our results to a popular FB stochastic Nash equilibrium seeking algorithm and validate our theoretical bounds on a control problem for smart grids, where the energy price uncertainty is approximated by means of historical data."

Meanwhile, stochastic thermal heating is essential for driving a hot, metal-enriched gaseous halo, thereby creating a multiphase circumgalactic medium that is absent in the predecessor code.

The critical role of multi-harmonic ECW in enhancing the driven current has been experimentally verified for the first time. To explain the related experimental observations, a physical mechanism involving multi-harmonic heating, multiple reflections, and multi-pass absorption - leading to the generation of high-energy electrons via X-mode wave or electron Bernstein wave has been proposed.

Unlike symbolic specification languages requiring parsers and compilers, FASTRIC leverages LLMs as unified infrastructure-simultaneously parser, interpreter, runtime environment, and development assistant. FASTRIC guides designers to articulate seven FSM elements (Final States, Agents, States, Triggers, Roles, Initial State, Constraints) structuring multi-turn interactions. Specification formality-ranging from implicit descriptions that frontier models infer to explicit step-by-step instructions for weaker models-serves as a design parameter.

DeepSeek-V3.2 (685B) achieves perfect conformance (1.00) at L2-L4; ChatGPT-5 (~1T) peaks at L3 (0.90) before collapsing at L4 (0.39); Phi4 (14.7B) shows no stable optimum with high variance (SD=0.16-0.36).

We introduce DPSR (Differentially Private Sparse Reconstruction), a novel three-stage denoising framework that fundamentally addresses this limitation by exploiting the inherent structure of rating matrices -- sparsity, low-rank properties, and collaborative patterns. DPSR consists of three synergistic stages: (1) \\textit{information-theoretic noise calibration} that adaptively reduces noise for high-information ratings, (2) \\textit{collaborative filtering-based denoising} that leverages item-item similarities to remove privacy noise, and (3) \\textit{low-rank matrix completion} that exploits latent structure for signal recovery. Critically, all denoising operations occur \\textit{after} noise injection, preserving differential privacy through the post-processing immunity theorem while removing both privacy-induced and inherent data noise. Through extensive experiments on synthetic datasets with controlled ground truth, we demonstrate that DPSR achieves 5.57\\% to 9.23\\% RMSE improvement over state-of-the-art Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms across privacy budgets ranging from $\\varepsilon=0.1$ to $\\varepsilon=10.0$ (all improvements statistically significant with $p < 0.05$, most $p < 0.001$).

Intermediate small-scale prototypes can achieve competitive sensitivity to the effective neutrino mass, even with reduced energy resolution. To reach an energy resolution better than \\SI{500}{meV} at the tritium $β$-spectrum endpoint of \\SI{18.6}{keV}, and accounting for all uncertainties in the filtering chain, the electrode voltage must be controlled at the level of a few parts per million and monitored in real time.

    "abstract": "Diffusion Multi-modal Large Language Models (dMLLMs) have recently emerged as a novel architecture unifying image generation and understanding. However, developing effective and efficient Test-Time Scaling (TTS) methods to unlock their full generative potential remains an underexplored challenge. To address this, we propose dMLLM-TTS, a novel framework operating on two complementary scaling axes: (1) trajectory exploration scaling to enhance the diversity of generated hypotheses, and (2) iterative refinement scaling for stable generation. Conventional TTS approaches typically perform linear search across these two dimensions, incurring substantial computational costs of O(NT) and requiring an external verifier for best-of-N selection. To overcome these limitations, we propose two innovations. First, we design an efficient hierarchical search algorithm with O(N+T) complexity that adaptively expands and prunes sampling trajectories. Second, we introduce a self-verified feedback mechanism that leverages the dMLLMs' intrinsic image understanding capabilities to assess text-image alignment, eliminating the need for external verifier. Extensive experiments on the GenEval benchmark across three representative dMLLMs (e.g., Lumina-DiMOO, MMaDA, Muddit) show that our framework substantially improves generation quality while achieving up to 6x greater efficiency than linear search.

    "abstract": "The automation of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) relies heavily on Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract critical entities from unstructured text. Currently, Large Language Models (LLMs) primarily address this task through retrieval-based In-Context Learning (ICL). This paper analyzes this mainstream paradigm, revealing a fundamental flaw: its success stems not from global semantic similarity but largely from the incidental overlap of entity types within retrieved examples. This exposes the limitations of relying on unreliable implicit induction. To address this, we propose TTPrompt, a framework shifting from implicit induction to explicit instruction. TTPrompt maps the core concepts of CTI's Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) into an instruction hierarchy: formulating task definitions as Tactics, guiding strategies as Techniques, and annotation guidelines as Procedures. Furthermore, to handle the adaptability challenge of static guidelines, we introduce Feedback-driven Instruction Refinement (FIR). FIR enables LLMs to self-refine guidelines by learning from errors on minimal labeled data, adapting to distinct annotation dialects. Experiments on five CTI NER benchmarks demonstrate that TTPrompt consistently surpasses retrieval-based baselines. Notably, with refinement on just 1% of training data, it rivals models fine-tuned on the full dataset. For instance, on LADDER, its Micro F1 of 71.96% approaches the fine-tuned baseline, and on the complex CTINexus, its Macro F1 exceeds the fine-tuned ACLM model by 10.91%."

    "abstract": "The ability to sculpt light in space, time, and polarization has revolutionized studies of light-matter interaction and enabled breakthroughs in optical communication, imaging, and ultrafast science. Among the many degrees of freedom of light, orbital angular momentum (OAM) further expands these capabilities by unlocking new regimes of control in information encoding, particle manipulation, and symmetry-driven selection rules. However, exploiting OAM to drive nonlinear, non-perturbative effects in solids remains challenging, especially in the mid-infrared (MIR) spectral regime, a key region for accessing these effects in ambient air, where spatial light modulators do not operate. Here, we circumvent this limitation by generating femtosecond, few-cycle MIR Bessel-Gauss vortex (BGV) and Perfect optical vortices (POVs), using a robust, static spatial-shaping strategy. Using those beams to drive the high-harmonic generation (HHG) process in solids, we show that the resulting harmonic beams faithfully inherit the structural properties of the drivers: the constant-intensity ring of the POV is preserved across harmonic orders, while the harmonic BGVs retain their intrinsic TC-dependent profiles. Furthermore, by verifying the OAM up-scaling law, we confirm OAM conservation during HHG in solids. These results establish strong-field HHG in solids as a robust platform for synthesizing ultrafast structured harmonic light with controllable, high-value OAM."

The mixed formulation features independent displacement, velocity and stress variables and is further objective and locking-free. Finite rotations are represented using a director formulation that avoids singularities and yields a constant mass matrix. This results in an infinite-dimensional nonlinear port-Hamiltonian (PH) system governed by partial differential-algebraic equations with a quadratic energy functional. Using a time-differentiated compliance form of the stress-strain relations allows for the imposition of kinematic constraints, such as inextensibility or shear-rigidity. A structure-preserving finite element discretization leads to a finite-dimensional system with PH structure, thus facilitating the design of an energy-momentum consistent integration scheme. Dissipative material behavior (via the generalized-Maxwell model) and non-standard actuation approaches (via pneumatic chambers or tendons) integrate naturally into the framework. As illustrated by selected numerical examples, the present framework establishes a new approach to energy-momentum consistent formulations in computational mechanics involving finite rotations."

    "abstract": "We present a Cartesian cut-cell finite-volume method for sharp-interface two-phase diffusion problems in static geometries. The formulation follows a two-fluid approach: independent diffusion equations are discretized in each phase on a fixed staggered Cartesian grid, while the phases are coupled through embedded interface conditions enforcing continuity of normal flux and a general jump law. Cut cells are treated by integrating the governing equations over phase-restricted control volumes and faces, yielding discrete divergence and gradient operators that are locally conservative within each phase. Interface coupling is achieved by introducing a small set of interfacial unknowns per cut cell on the embedded boundary; the resulting algebraic system involves only bulk and interfacial averages. A key feature of the method is the use of a reduced set of geometric information based solely on low-order moments (trimmed volumes, apertures and interface measures/centroids), allowing robust implementation without constructing explicitly cut-cell polytopes. The method supports steady (Poisson) and unsteady (diffusion) regimes and incorporates Dirichlet, Neumann, Robin boundary conditions and general jumps. We validate the scheme on one-, two- and three-dimensional mono- and diphasic benchmarks, including curved embedded boundaries, Robin conditions and strong property/jump contrasts. The results demonstrate the expected convergence behavior, sharp enforcement of interfacial laws and excellent conservation properties. Extensions to moving interfaces and Stefan-type free-boundary problems are natural perspectives of this framework."

The absence of TeV gamma-rays from NGC~1068 indicates neutrino production in compact gamma-ray-opaque region. The vicinity of the supermassive black hole, such as disk-corona, is an ideal region, where the high radiation density leads to efficient neutrino production as well as the gamma-ray attenuation. Disk-corona models predict that the neutrino emission from AGNs correlates with X-ray emission, which traces the coronal activity. In this paper, we assess whether the X-ray AGN population origin for TeV neutrinos can be tested by using the spatial correlation between the neutrino population and X-ray AGN population with future neutrino telescopes. By performing simulations, we find that, the AGN origin of the neutrino background above 100\\,TeV can be tested at a confidence level of $\\sim2.4σ$ with five-year observations of IceCube-Gen2, which has an angular resolution of $\\sim0.2$ degree.

Distinct from Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with fixed node activations and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) featuring learnable edge activations, SNs utilize shared, learnable splines (monotonic and general) within structured blocks incorporating explicit shift parameters and mixing weights. Our approach directly realizes Sprecher's specific 1965 sum of shifted splines formula in its single-layer variant and extends it to deeper, multi-layer compositions. We further enhance the architecture with optional lateral mixing connections that enable intra-block communication between output dimensions, providing a parameter-efficient alternative to full attention mechanisms. Beyond parameter efficiency with $O(LN + LG)$ scaling (where $G$ is the knot count of the shared splines) versus MLPs' $O(LN^2)$, SNs admit a sequential evaluation strategy that reduces peak forward-intermediate memory from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N)$ (treating batch size as constant), making much wider architectures feasible under memory constraints. We demonstrate empirically that composing these blocks into deep networks leads to highly parameter and memory-efficient models, discuss theoretical motivations, and compare SNs with related architectures (MLPs, KANs, and networks with learnable node activations)."

Despite the development of various approaches, the accuracy of forensic speed estimation from real-world footage remains highly dependent on several factors, including camera specifications, acquisition methods, spatial and temporal resolution, compression methods, and scene perspective, which can significantly influence performance. In this paper, we introduce ForeSpeed, a comprehensive dataset designed to support the evaluation of speed estimation techniques in real-world scenarios using CCTV footage. The dataset includes recordings of a vehicle traveling at known speeds, captured by three digital and three analog cameras from two distinct perspectives. Real-world road metrics are provided to enable the restoration of the scene geometry. Videos were stored with multiple compression factors and settings, to simulate real world scenarios in which export procedures are not always performed according to forensic standards. Overall, ForeSpeed, includes a collection of 322 videos. As a case study, we employed the ForeSpeed dataset to benchmark a speed estimation algorithm available in a commercial product (Amped FIVE). Results demonstrate that while the method reliably estimates average speed across various conditions, its uncertainty range significantly increases when the scene involves strong perspective distortion. The ForeSpeed dataset is publicly available to the forensic community, with the aim of facilitating the evaluation of current methodologies and inspiring the development of new, robust solutions tailored to collision investigation and forensic incident analysis."

In the massless case, the limiting dynamics propagate ballistically with constant speed, while in the massive case the velocity is relativistic. Our analysis justifies the emergence of relativistic Vlasov equations from Dirac--Hartree dynamics in the semiclassical regime. As a corollary, we recover the relativistic Vlasov--Poisson equation from the Dirac equation with a regularized Coulomb interaction when the regularization vanishes together with the semiclassical parameter."

In this work, we instead consider the use of first-order languages in goal-conditioned RL and generalized planning. The question is how to learn goal-conditioned and general policies when the training instances are large and the goal cannot be reached by random exploration alone. The technique of Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) provides an answer to this question: it relabels unsuccessful trajectories as successful ones by replacing the original goal with one that was actually achieved. If the target policy must generalize across states and goals, trajectories that do not reach the original goal states can enable more data- and time-efficient learning. In this work, we show that further performance gains can be achieved when states and goals are represented by sets of atoms. We consider three versions: goals as full states, goals as subsets of the original goals, and goals as lifted versions of these subgoals. The result is that the latter two successfully learn general policies on large planning instances with sparse rewards by automatically creating a curriculum of easier goals of increasing complexity. The experiments illustrate the computational gains of these versions, their limitations, and opportunities for addressing them."

In the first part of this paper, we attempt to partially bridge this gap by generalizing to any characteristic important properties known in characteristic 2 concerning the Walsh transform of derivatives of bent functions. Some of these properties generalize to all bent functions, while others appear to apply only to weakly regular bent functions. We deduce a method to obtain a bent function by adding a quadratic function to a weakly regular bent function. We also identify a particular class of bent functions possessing the property that every first-order derivative in a nonzero direction has a derivative (which is then a second-order derivative of the function) equal to a nonzero constant. We show that this property implies bentness and is shared in particular by all cubic bent functions. It generalizes the notion of cubic-like bent function, that was introduced and studied for binary functions by Irene Villa and the first author. In the second part of the paper, we provide (for the first time) a primary construction leading to an infinite class of cubic bent functions that are not weakly regular. We show the bentness of the functions by two approaches: by calculating the Walsh transform directly and by considering the second-order derivatives (and applying the results from the first part of the paper)."

Nearby massive stars in the late stages of stellar evolution provide a promising environment for enhanced ALP production due to their high core temperatures and densities. We search for a combined signal of ALP-induced hard X-ray and soft $γ$-ray emission from 18 nearby pre-supernova stars using the full public 22-year INTEGRAL/SPI dataset, construct individual stellar spectra and link them in a coherent analysis. A maximum-likelihood approach is used to extract fluxes in the 20--2000 keV energy range. Stellar evolution models are employed to obtain the expected spectral shapes of ALP production processes peaking between 50--500 keV, depending on stellar mass and evolutionary stage. We construct a joint likelihood that incorporates uncertainties in stellar parameters to derive combined constraints on the coupling constants $g_{aγ}$ and $g_{ae}$ as a function of the ALP mass $m_a$. The hard X-ray and soft $γ$-ray fluxes of all selected stars are consistent with zero within uncertainties. We provide upper limits on the continuum emission and on the 511 keV and 1809 keV line fluxes. The combined upper limit on $g_{aγ} \\times g_{ae}$ is $(0.008 - 2) x 10^{-24}$ GeV$^{-1}$ (95% C.I.) while the ALP-photon coupling is constrained to $g_{aγ} = (0.13 - 1.26) x 10^{-11}$ GeV$^{-1}$ (95% C.I.) for $m_a\\leqq10^{-11}$ eV, depending on the time to core collapse and magnetic field assumptions. Conservative limits of $(0.27 - 1.25) x 10^{-24}$ GeV$^{-1}$ (95% C.I.) are obtained assuming all but one star are in the early He-burning phase.

Despite these risks, backdoor attacks targeting LoRA-based fine-tuning remain relatively underexplored. Existing backdoor attack strategies are ill-suited to this setting, as they often rely on inaccessible training data, fail to account for the structural properties unique to LoRA, or suffer from high false trigger rates (FTR), thereby compromising their stealth. To address these challenges, we propose Causal-Guided Detoxify Backdoor Attack (CBA), a novel backdoor attack framework specifically designed for open-weight LoRA models. CBA operates without access to original training data and achieves high stealth through two key innovations: (1) a coverage-guided data generation pipeline that synthesizes task-aligned inputs via behavioral exploration, and (2) a causal-guided detoxification strategy that merges poisoned and clean adapters by preserving task-critical neurons. Unlike prior approaches, CBA enables post-training control over attack intensity through causal influence-based weight allocation, eliminating the need for repeated retraining. Evaluated across six LoRA models, CBA achieves high attack success rates while reducing FTR by 50-70\\% compared to baseline methods. Furthermore, it demonstrates enhanced resistance to state-of-the-art backdoor defenses, highlighting its stealth and robustness."

We assume that the transitions are allowed only to the two adjacent levels of the same phase and are characterized by linear rates. The crucial element lies in the phase switching mechanism at the origin, which is governed by an irreducible stochastic matrix. The process evolution is interrupted by catastrophic events, whose occurrences are controlled by a Poisson process. Each catastrophe resets the system state to zero, initiating a new cycle of evolution until the next resetting event. We conduct a comprehensive analysis, addressing both the transient and long-term behavior of this process. Furthermore, we derive a diffusive approximation, by proving its convergence to a reflected Ornstein-Uhlenbeck jump diffusion process."

Our key insight is that frontier AI models already possess the knowledge required to solve challenging problems -- they simply do not know how, what, or when to apply it. Vibe Reasoning transforms AI's latent potential into manifested capability through generic meta-prompts, agentic grounding, and model orchestration. We demonstrate this paradigm through IMO 2025 Problem 6, a combinatorial optimization problem where autonomous AI systems publicly reported failures. Our solution combined GPT-5's exploratory capabilities with Gemini 3 Pro's proof strengths, leveraging agentic workflows with Python code execution and file-based memory, to derive both the correct answer (2112) and a rigorous mathematical proof. Through iterative refinement across multiple attempts, we discovered the necessity of agentic grounding and model orchestration, while human prompts evolved from problem-specific hints to generic, transferable meta-prompts. We analyze why capable AI fails autonomously, how each component addresses specific failure modes, and extract principles for effective vibe reasoning. Our findings suggest that lightweight human guidance can unlock frontier models' mathematical reasoning potential. This is ongoing work; we are developing automated frameworks and conducting broader evaluations to further validate Vibe Reasoning's generality and effectiveness."

Traditional data-driven methods require extensive labeled fault data, which is often impractical to obtain, while model-based approaches suffer from parameter uncertainties. This paper proposes a digital twin (DT)-driven zero-shot fault diagnosis framework utilizing fluid-borne noise (FBN) signals. The framework calibrates a high-fidelity DT model using only healthy-state data, generates synthetic fault signals for training deep learning classifiers, and employs a physics-informed neural network (PINN) as a virtual sensor for flow ripple estimation. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) is integrated to visualize the decision-making process of neural networks, revealing that large kernels matching the subsequence length in time-domain inputs and small kernels in time-frequency domain inputs enable higher diagnostic accuracy by focusing on physically meaningful features. Experimental validations demonstrate that training on signals from the calibrated DT model yields diagnostic accuracies exceeding 95\\% on real-world benchmarks, while uncalibrated models result in significantly lower performance, highlighting the framework's effectiveness in data-scarce scenarios."

Many such performance measures rely on the Laplacian spectrum; notable examples include total effective resistance, the number of spanning trees, and algebraic connectivity. This paper advances the study of Laplacian-based network optimization by drawing on ideas from experimental design in statistics. We present a theoretical framework for analyzing performance measures by introducing the notion of information functions, which captures a set of their desirable properties. Then, we formulate a new parametric family of information functions, Kiefer's measures, which encompasses the three most common spectral objectives. We provide a regular reformulation of the Laplacian optimization problem, and we use this reformulation to compute directional derivatives of Kiefer's measures. The directional derivatives provide a unified treatment of quantities recurring in Laplacian optimization, such as gradients and subgradients, and we show that they are connected to Laplacian-based measures of node distance, which we call node dissimilarities. We apply the node dissimilarities to derive efficient rank-one update formulas for Kiefer's criteria, and to devise a new edge-exchange method for network optimization. These update formulas enable greedy and exchange algorithms with reduced asymptotic time complexity."

Such gamma-ray sources have long been anticipated by the scientific community, as they promise new powerful tools for the study of high-energy physical phenomena and the development of novel nuclear technologies. In such devices, a piezoelectric transducer induces tens of MHz harmonic waves inside a silicon monocrystal. Ultra-relativistic charged particles traversing the crystal get trapped within the channels formed by the extremely strong electric fields of the acoustically modulated lattice planes, undergoing undulation and emitting gamma radiation. Precise characterization of the acoustic field in the crystal is crucial for the determination of the expected characteristics of the secondarily generated gamma rays. For this purpose, fast laser refraction imaging is used here to image the acoustic waves by exploiting the spatial redistribution of a laser beam optical intensity caused by the acoustic field. A dedicated computational model is developed for the estimation of the spatial distribution of the pressure and lattice deformation inside the crystal. This methodology provides a framework for future novel gamma-ray sources in high-energy facilities."

    "abstract": "Nanocellular polyetherimide exhibits significant improvements in mechanical properties like toughness and impact resistance, commonly associated with the presence of nanoporosity. However, this work demonstrates these enhancements, often measured directly after processing, cannot be fully explained solely by the cellular structure but also originate from a modification of the polymer matrix induced by the CO2-saturation process. Through a systematic study involving thermal treatments and saturation-desorption processes without foaming, it is shown that CO2 exposure, even in the absence of pore formation, induces an apparent rejuvenation of the polymer, as evidenced by a reduction in the yield stress, which persists after complete CO2 desorption and in the absence of residual gas during mechanical testing. Therefore, the observed ductile response is not associated with the presence of CO2 during deformation, but with a permanent modification of the polymer matrix induced by prior gas exposure. This structural state can be thermally reversed by activating the beta relaxation of the polymer. For nanocellular polymers, the presence of residual gas within the matrix during foaming restricts thermal relaxation and helps preserve the CO2-modified state. As a result, the mechanical response of the solid phase reflects the intrinsic properties of the saturated polymer and the architecture imposed by the cellular structure. This work demonstrates for the first time that CO2 saturation can permanently alter the mechanical state of a high-Tg amorphous polymer, providing a new framework to interpret the brittle-to-ductile transition in nanocellular PEI."

In this realm, the emergence of malicious ISAC systems has amplified the need for authorized parties to legitimately monitor suspicious communication links and protect legitimate targets from potential detection or exploitation by malicious foes. In this paper, we propose a new wireless proactive monitoring paradigm, where a legitimate monitor intercepts a suspicious communication link while performing cognitive jamming to enhance the monitoring success probability (MSP) and simultaneously safeguard the target. To this end, we derive closed-form expressions of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) at the user (UE), sensing access points (S-APs), and an approximating expression of the SINR at the proactive monitor. Moreover, we propose an optimization technique under which the legitimate monitor minimizes the success detection probability (SDP) of the legitimate target, by optimizing the jamming power allocation over both communication and sensing channels subject to total power constraints and monitoring performance requirement. To enhance the monitor's longevity and reduce the risk of detection by malicious ISAC systems, we further propose an adaptive power allocation scheme aimed at minimizing the total transmit power at the monitor while meeting a pre-selected sensing SINR threshold and ensuring successful monitoring. Our numerical results show that the proposed algorithm significantly compromises the sensing and communication performance of malicious ISAC."

    "abstract": "Optical parametric processes underpin quantum photonics, while free-electron--photon interactions offer agile pathways to generate nontrivial quantum photonic states. These threads have so far largely progressed independently, whereas placing free electrons in a driven nonlinear system can potentially activate coherent parametric interaction channels for joint state engineering of both types of particles. Here we unify these paradigms by developing a general theoretical framework for parametric free-electron--photon interactions in a nonlinear optical system driven by degenerate parametric down-conversion. Unlike free electrons in a linear bath, here they can couple to Bogoliubov quasiparticles through two detuned phase-matching channels, where the parametric process and free-electron interactions can quantum amplify each other. Seeding the interaction with squeezed vacuum yields gain-only or loss-only electron energy spectra, and enables electron-heralded squeezed Fock states; with bare vacuum, postselecting electron energy sidebands generates high-fidelity Schrödinger cat states. Our results show how optical parametric interactions can quantum shape free electrons and photons, potentially enabling a quantum parametric dielectric laser accelerator that mitigates the need for temporal phase synchronization, thereby allowing acceleration probabilities to approach unity even for phase-random electrons."

The different deformation and coupling effects, such as triaxial $γ$, reflection-asymmetric $β_{3}$ and high-order $β_{6}$ deformations, are discussed for both ground state and isomeric state based on the corresponding potential-energy curves along the fission valley. In particular, it is pointed out for the first time that possible multipath decay, e.g., from the high-$K$ isomeric state to those states formed between potential energy surfaces of this isomeric state and the ground state during the fission process, may reduce the nuclear lifetime and balance the fission stability. These results elucidate not only the enhanced stability of the high-$K$ isomeric state, including the inversion of stability between it and the ground state, but also the limitation of the stability increase of such an isomeric state."

In contrast, centralized finance (CeFi) offers a more stable environment with institutional safeguards.

This study investigates whether HyFi-like cryptocurrencies, those backed by institutions, exhibit lower price risk than fully decentralized counterparts. Using daily data for 18 major cryptocurrencies from January 2020 to November 2024, we estimate panel EGLS models with fixed, random, and dynamic specifications. Results show that HyFi-like assets consistently experience lower price risk, with this effect intensifying during periods of elevated market volatility. The negative interaction between HyFi status and market-wide volatility confirms their stabilizing role. Conversely, greater decentralization is strongly associated with increased volatility, particularly during periods of market stress. Robustness checks using quantile regressions and pre-/post-Terra Luna subsamples reinforce these findings, with stronger effects observed in high-volatility quantiles and post-crisis conditions. These results highlight the importance of institutional architecture in enhancing the resilience of digital asset markets."

    "abstract": "We report the mechanism for the formation of external particle jets on a spherical particle bed subjected to strong explosive loading, revealing a critical dependence on particle size. Under strong explosive loading, the formation of external particle jets is primarily driven by a drag-coupled mechanism. We conducted Eulerian-Lagrangian simulations, with up to $2048^3$ effective cells and $1.8$ million tracked parcels on an adaptive mesh, for both small- and large-particle cases. Pronounced jets are observed only with small particles, alongside accelerated bed thickening. By defining characteristic inner and outer radii, the particle bed thickness evolution is quantified, showing an initial linear growth followed by a nonlinear deceleration. Particle dynamics analysis indicates that drag force dominates particle motion and jet formation during the nonlinear stage. The initial angular non-uniformity of the particle bed induces a non-uniform gas radial velocity. Through drag coupling, this flow asymmetry generates a radial velocity difference in small particles, thereby promoting pronounced jet formation, whereas large particles resist this drag-induced effect. The greater drag-induced deceleration on smaller particles leads to an increased velocity difference across the particle bed, explaining the accelerated thickening. A characteristic radius model that integrates the Gurney model for the linear stage with a drag-dominated deceleration model for the nonlinear stage is established and shows good agreement with numerical results across different particle sizes."

Current solutions face a fundamental dilemma. Training-based methods inject priors into parameters, but this static coupling hinders rapid knowledge updates and often compromises the model's general reasoning capabilities. Conversely, existing training-free methods avoid these issues but rely on surface-level prompting, failing to provide the fine-grained atom-level priors essential for precise chemical reasoning. To address this issue, we introduce ChemATP, a framework that decouples chemical knowledge from the reasoning engine. By constructing the first atom-level textual knowledge base, ChemATP enables frozen LLMs to explicitly retrieve and reason over this information dynamically. This architecture ensures interpretability and adaptability while preserving the LLM's intrinsic general intelligence. Experiments show that ChemATP significantly outperforms training-free baselines and rivals state-of-the-art training-based models, demonstrating that explicit prior injection is a competitive alternative to implicit parameter updates."

Furthermore, what social features of stigmas are associated with bias in LLM outputs is unknown. From psychology literature, it has been shown that stigmas contain six shared social features: aesthetics, concealability, course, disruptiveness, origin, and peril. In this study, we investigate if human and LLM ratings of the features of stigmas, along with prompt style and type of stigma, have effect on bias towards stigmatized groups in LLM outputs. We measure bias against 93 stigmatized groups across three widely used LLMs (Granite 3.0-8B, Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-7B) using SocialStigmaQA, a benchmark that includes 37 social scenarios about stigmatized identities; for example deciding wether to recommend them for an internship. We find that stigmas rated by humans to be highly perilous (e.g., being a gang member or having HIV) have the most biased outputs from SocialStigmaQA prompts (60% of outputs from all models) while sociodemographic stigmas (e.g. Asian-American or old age) have the least amount of biased outputs (11%). We test if the amount of biased outputs could be decreased by using guardrail models, models meant to identify harmful input, using each LLM's respective guardrail model (Granite Guardian 3.0, Llama Guard 3.0, Mistral Moderation API). We find that bias decreases significantly by 10.4%, 1.4%, and 7.8%, respectively. However, we show that features with significant effect on bias remain unchanged post-mitigation and that guardrail models often fail to recognize the intent of bias in prompts. This work has implications for using LLMs in scenarios involving stigmatized groups and we suggest future work towards improving guardrail models for bias mitigation."

    "abstract": "Continual self-supervised learning (CSSL) in medical imaging trains a foundation model sequentially, alleviating the need for collecting multi-modal images for joint training and offering promising improvements in downstream performance while preserving data privacy. However, most existing methods still rely on replaying data from previous stages to prevent catastrophic forgetting, which compromises privacy and limits their applicability in real-world scenarios where data transfer across sites is often restricted. In this work, we propose InvCoSS, an inversion-driven continual self-supervised learning framework for medical multi-modal image pre-training. Specifically, after training on a previous task, InvCoSS inverts the pre-trained self-supervised model to generate synthetic images that approximate the original training distribution. These synthetic images are then combined with data from the new task for joint optimization, which effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting while strictly adhering to the constraint of no access to previous real data. Furthermore, to improve the fidelity of synthetic images, we introduce a novel InvUNet with a multi-scale fusion architecture to restore both high- and low-frequency components of the inverted images. To enhance diversity and prevent mode collapse, we design a repulsive representation-learning mechanism that encourages a diverse feature space for synthetic images without class guidance. Extensive experiments across nine downstream tasks validate the effectiveness of InvCoSS, achieving performance comparable to or even superior to prior data-replay methods while significantly reducing storage requirements and eliminating data privacy constraints."

    "abstract": "Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly advanced the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), but this progress is accompanied by substantial memory and latency overhead from the extensive Key-Value (KV) cache. Although KV cache quantization is a promising compression technique, existing low-bit quantization methods often exhibit severe performance degradation on complex reasoning tasks. Fixed-precision quantization struggles to handle outlier channels in the key cache, while current mixed-precision strategies fail to accurately identify components requiring high-precision representation. We find that an effective low-bit KV cache quantization strategy must consider two factors: a key channel's intrinsic quantization difficulty and its relevance to the query. Based on this insight, we propose MixKVQ, a novel plug-and-play method that introduces a lightweight, query-aware algorithm to identify and preserve critical key channels that need higher precision, while applying per-token quantization for value cache. Experiments on complex reasoning datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing low-bit methods, achieving performance comparable to a full-precision baseline at a substantially reduced memory footprint."

    "abstract": "Solving high-dimensional Fokker-Planck (FP) equations is a challenge in computational physics and stochastic dynamics, due to the curse of dimensionality (CoD) and the bottleneck of evaluating second-order diffusion terms. Existing deep learning approaches, such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), face computational challenges as dimensionality increases, driven by the $O(D^2)$ complexity of automatic differentiation for second-order derivatives. While recent probability flow approaches bypass this by learning score functions or matching velocity fields, they often involve serial computational operations or depend on sampling efficiency in complex distributions. To address these issues, we propose the Self-Consistent Probability Flow (SCPF) method. We reformulate the second-order FP equation into an equivalent first-order deterministic Probability Flow ODE (PF-ODE) constraint. Unlike score matching or velocity matching, SCPF solves this problem by minimizing the residual of the PF-ODE continuity equation, which avoids explicit Hessian computation. We leverage Continuous Normalizing Flows (CNF) combined with the Hutchinson Trace Estimator (HTE) to reduce the training complexity to linear scale $O(D)$, achieving an effective $O(1)$ wall-clock time on GPUs. To address data sparsity in high dimensions, we apply a generative adaptive sampling strategy and theoretically prove that dynamically aligning collocation points with the evolving probability mass is a necessary condition to bound the approximation error. Experiments on diverse benchmarks -- ranging from anisotropic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes and high-dimensional Brownian motions with time-varying diffusion terms, to Geometric OU processes featuring non-Gaussian solutions -- demonstrate that SCPF effectively mitigates the CoD, maintaining high accuracy and constant computational cost for problems up to 100 dimensions."

    "abstract": "This article examines what it means to use Large Language Models in everyday work. Drawing on a seven-month longitudinal qualitative study, we argue that LLMs do not straightforwardly automate or augment tasks. We propose the concept of configuration work to describe the labor through which workers make a generic system usable for a specific professional task. Configuration work materializes in four intertwined consequences. First, workers must discretize their activity, breaking it into units that the system can process. Second, operating the system generates cluttering, as prompting, evaluating, and correcting responses add scattered layers of work that get in the way of existing routines. Third, users gradually attune their practices and expectations to the machine's generic rigidity, making sense of the system's limits and finding space for it within their practices. Fourth, as LLMs absorb repetitive tasks, they desaturate the texture of work, shifting activity toward logistical manipulation of outputs and away from forms of engagement that sustain a sense of accomplishment. Taken together, these consequences suggest that LLMs reshape work through the individualized labor required to configure a universal, task-agnostic system within situated professional ecologies."

    "abstract": "This paper develops and analyzes three families of estimators that continuously interpolate between classical quantiles and the sample mean. The construction begins with a smoothed version of the $L_{1}$ loss, indexed by a location parameter $z$ and a smoothing parameter $h \\ge 0$, whose minimizer $\\hat q(z,h)$ yields a unified M-estimation framework. Depending on how $(z, h)$ is specified, this framework generates three distinct classes of estimators: fixed-parameter smoothed quantile estimators, plug-in estimators of fixed quantiles, and a new continuum of mean-estimating procedures. For all three families we establish consistency and asymptotic normality via a uniform asymptotic equicontinuity argument. The limiting variances admit closed forms, allowing a transparent comparison of efficiency across families and smoothing levels. A geometric decomposition of the parameter space shows that, for fixed quantile level $τ$, admissible pairs $(z, h)$ lie on straight lines along which the estimator targets the same population quantile while its asymptotic variance evolves. The theoretical analysis reveals two efficiency regimes. Under light-tailed distributions (e.g., Gaussian), smoothing yields a monotone variance reduction. Under heavy-tailed distributions (e.g., Laplace), a finite smoothing parameter $h^{*}(τ) > 0$ strictly improves efficiency for quantile estimation. Numerical experiments -- based on simulated data and real financial returns -- validate these conclusions and show that, both asymptotically and in finite samples, the mean-estimating family does not improve upon the sample mean."

The continuum emission has a sharp peak around the SSC candidate but is also widely distributed. We identify two continuum sources at the northern (N79S-1) and northwestern (N79S-2) positions of the SSC continuum peak, associated with CH$_3$OH emission. In addition to CH$_3$OH, we also detect H$_2$CO, H$_2$CS, CS, SO, CO, CN, and CCH at the positions of N79S-1 and N79S-2. The rotation diagram analysis of CH$_3$OH and SO lines yields an average gas temperature of 13 $\\pm$ 0.4 K for N79S-1 and 15 $\\pm$ 0.9 K for N79S-2. Most emission lines exhibit line widths of less than 2.8 km s$^{-1}$, consistent with emissions from cold, dense molecular cloud cores. The abundance of cold CH$_3$OH gas is estimated to be (2.1 $\\pm$ 1.1)$\\times$ 10$^{-9}$ at N79S-1 and (4.5 $\\pm$2.5)$\\times$ 10$^{-10}$ at N79S-2. Despite the lower metallicity in the LMC, the CH$_3$OH abundance at N79S-1 is comparable to that of similar cold sources in our Galaxy. However, the formation of organic molecules is inhibited throughout the N79 regions, as can be seen in the non-detection of CH$_3$OH in most of the regions. The two positions N79S-1 and N79S-2 would be exceptional positions, where CH$_3$OH production is efficient. The possible origins of cold CH$_3$OH gas in these dense cores are discussed, along with a possible explanation for the non-detection of CH$_3$OH in the SSC candidate."

    "abstract": "Saturn's ice-covered moon Enceladus may host a subsurface ocean with biologically relevant chemistry. Plumes released from this ocean preserve information on its chemical state, and previous analyses suggest weakly to strongly alkaline pH (approximately pH 8--12). Constraining the pH requires identification of pH-sensitive minerals in plume deposits. Several analytical techniques could provide such mineralogical information, but few are practical for deployment on planetary missions. Raman spectrometers, which have recently advanced for \\textit{in situ} exploration and have been incorporated into flight instruments, offer a feasible approach for mineral identification on icy moons. However, their applicability to pH estimation from plume-derived minerals has not been investigated. In this study, we evaluate whether Raman measurements of plume particles deposited on the surface of Enceladus can be used to distinguish between weakly and strongly alkaline subsurface ocean models. Fluids with pH values of 9 and 11 were frozen under vacuum conditions analogous to those on Enceladus. The resulting salt deposits were then analyzed using a flight-like Raman spectrometer. The Raman spectra show pH-dependent carbonate precipitation: NaHCO$_3$ and Na$_2$CO$_3$ peaks were detected at pH 9, whereas only Na$_2$CO$_3$ peaks were detected at pH 11. These findings demonstrate that Raman spectroscopy can distinguish pH-dependent carbonate phases. This capability allows us to constrain whether the pH of the subsurface ocean is weakly alkaline or strongly alkaline, which is a key parameter for assessing its chemical evolution and potential habitability."

Existing photonic computing research has mainly focused on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and fully connected neural networks (FCNNs), which are well suited for tasks such as image classification and object detection but face limitations in handling graph-structured data. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are specifically designed to model complex relational structures. In this work, we propose a photonic spiking graph neural network (PSGNN) architecture that integrates the structural modeling capability of GNNs, the temporal dynamics of spiking neurons, and the parallel computing advantages of photonic hardware. Through hardware-software co-optimization, a bias-term simulation method tailored for photonic chips is implemented using feature-dimension expansion, enabling effective network training. Experiments on the KarateClub and PubMed datasets achieve training accuracies of 100 percent (92 +/- 2 percent) and test accuracies of 97 percent (90 +/- 1 percent). A silicon photonics 4 x 4 Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) array is further constructed for hardware validation, achieving a test accuracy of 93 percent. The system demonstrates an inference latency of 97 ps, with an energy efficiency of 280 GOPS/W and a computational density of 52 GOPS/mm^2.

For structured datasets generated by an underlying function, oracle access can be avoided by expressing the Hamiltonian in the Walsh basis and retaining only a polynomial number of significant terms. In this regime, quantum state preparation is achieved in $\\text{poly}(n)$ time using $\\text{poly}(n)$ parameters, reaching infidelities on the order of $10^{-5}$.

This neglects that the quantum and classical branches constitute distinct computational modalities and limits reliable performance on complex, high dimensional tabular and semi structured data, including remote sensing, environmental monitoring, and medical diagnostics. We present a multimodal formulation of hybrid learning and propose a cross attention mid fusion architecture in which a classical representation queries quantum derived feature tokens through an attention block with residual connectivity. The quantum branch is kept within practical NISQ budgets and uses up to nine qubits. We evaluate on Wine, Breast Cancer, Forest CoverType, FashionMNIST, and SteelPlatesFaults, comparing a quantum only model, a classical baseline, residual hybrid models, and the proposed mid fusion model under a consistent protocol. Pure quantum and standard hybrid designs underperform due to measurement induced information loss, while cross attention mid fusion is consistently competitive and improves performance on the more complex datasets in most cases. These findings suggest that quantum derived information becomes most valuable when integrated through principled multimodal fusion rather than used in isolation or loosely appended to classical features."

However, current inference engine schedulers overlook the attention backend's sensitivity to request-length heterogeneity within a batch. As state-of-the-art models now support context windows exceeding 128K tokens, this once-tolerable inefficiency has escalated into a primary system bottleneck, causing severe performance degradation through GPU underutilization and increased latency. We present L4, a runtime system that dynamically reschedules requests across multiple instances serving the same LLM to mitigate per-instance length heterogeneity. L4 partitions these instances into length-specialized groups, each handling requests within a designated length range, naturally forming a pipeline as requests flow through them. L4 devises a dynamic programming algorithm to efficiently find the stage partition with the best QoE, employs runtime range refinement together with decentralized load (re)balance both across and within groups, achieving a balanced and efficient multi-instance service. Our evaluation shows that, under the same configuration, L4 reduces end-to-end latency by up to 67% and tail latency by up to 69%, while improving overall system throughput by up to 2.89 times compared to the state-of-the-art multi-instance scheduling systems."

    "abstract": "Bridging the gap between natural language commands and autonomous execution in unstructured environments remains an open challenge for robotics. This requires robots to perceive and reason over the current task scene through multiple modalities, and to plan their behaviors to achieve their intended goals. Traditional robotic task-planning approaches often struggle to bridge low-level execution with high-level task reasoning, and cannot dynamically update task strategies when instructions change during execution, which ultimately limits their versatility and adaptability to new tasks. In this work, we propose a novel language model-based framework for dynamic robot task planning. Our Vision-Language-Policy (VLP) model, based on a vision-language model fine-tuned on real-world data, can interpret semantic instructions and integrate reasoning over the current task scene to generate behavior policies that control the robot to accomplish the task. Moreover, it can dynamically adjust the task strategy in response to changes in the task, enabling flexible adaptation to evolving task requirements. Experiments conducted with different robots and a variety of real-world tasks show that the trained model can efficiently adapt to novel scenarios and dynamically update its policy, demonstrating strong planning autonomy and cross-embodiment generalization.

We identify boundaries separating extended, mixed, and localized regimes by constructing a diagram incorporating potential strength and inter-ring coupling. In the metallic regime, persistent currents flowing around both the toroidal and poloidal directions show oscillations whose amplitude decays as disorder grows and vanishes past the localization threshold; in the localized regime, currents become flux-insensitive. We demonstrate that tuning magnetic fluxes, hopping strengths, or quasiperiodic potential amplitudes provides control over the critical disorder threshold.

The stochastic analytic continuation method is used to determine the dynamic structure factor from correlation functions in imaginary time obtained by QMC. In contrast to the \"roton minimum\" of the square lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet, we find that magnons on the honeycomb lattice completely decay in the corner of the Brillouin zone ($K$-point); the entire weight is shifted into the continuum. These findings are fully supported by SE and CST in momentum space. The extrapolated one-magnon dispersion obtained from SE about the Ising limit quantitatively agrees with the extracted QMC excitation energies except around the $K$-point, where large uncertainties in the extrapolation indicate the magnon decay. This quantum decay is further confirmed and understood by the CST, which yields a divergent flow when enforcing a magnon quasi-particle picture. The divergence originates from strong attractive magnon-magnon interactions leading to a bound state and thereby to a three-magnon continuum overlapping with the one-magnon state. This has the magnon quasi-particle picture break down at high energies on the honeycomb lattice."

We adopt a synthetic neuro-phenomenology approach: constructing artificial agents that embody these mechanisms to test their functional consequences through precise architectural ablations impossible in biological systems. Across three experiments, we report dissociations suggesting these theories describe complementary functional layers rather than competing accounts. In Experiment 1, a no-rewire Self-Model lesion abolishes metacognitive calibration while preserving first-order task performance, yielding a synthetic blindsight analogue consistent with HOT predictions. In Experiment 2, workspace capacity proves causally necessary for information access: a complete workspace lesion produces qualitative collapse in access-related markers, while partial reductions show graded degradation, consistent with GWT's ignition framework. In Experiment 3, we uncover a broadcast-amplification effect: GWT-style broadcasting amplifies internal noise, creating extreme fragility. The B2 agent family is robust to the same latent perturbation; this robustness persists in a Self-Model-off / workspace-read control, cautioning against attributing the effect solely to $z_{\\text{self}}$ compression. We also report an explicit negative result: raw perturbational complexity (PCI-A) decreases under the workspace bottleneck, cautioning against naive transfer of IIT-adjacent proxies to engineered agents. These results suggest a hierarchical design principle: GWT provides broadcast capacity, while HOT provides quality control. We emphasize that our agents are not conscious; they are reference implementations for testing functional predictions of consciousness theories."

    "abstract": "Recent success in developing increasingly general purpose agents based on sequence models has led to increased focus on the problem of deploying computationally limited agents within the vastly more complex real-world. A key challenge experienced in these more realistic domains is highly non-Markovian dependencies with respect to the agent's observations, which are less common in small controlled domains. The predominant approach for dealing with this in the literature is to stack together a window of the most recent observations (Frame Stacking), but this window size must grow with the degree of non-Markovian dependencies, which results in prohibitive computational and memory requirements for both action inference and learning. In this paper, we are motivated by the insight that in many environments that are highly non-Markovian with respect to time, the environment only causally depends on a relatively small number of observations over that time-scale. A natural direction would then be to consider meta-algorithms that maintain relatively small adaptive stacks of memories such that it is possible to express highly non-Markovian dependencies with respect to time while considering fewer observations at each step and thus experience substantial savings in both compute and memory requirements. Hence, we propose a meta-algorithm (Adaptive Stacking) for achieving exactly that with convergence guarantees and quantify the reduced computation and memory constraints for MLP, LSTM, and Transformer-based agents. Our experiments utilize popular memory tasks, which give us control over the degree of non-Markovian dependencies. This allows us to demonstrate that an appropriate meta-algorithm can learn the removal of memories not predictive of future rewards without excessive removal of important experiences.

This loss function allows optimal trade-offs between conditional probabilistic coverage and the ''size'' of the set, measured by a non-decreasing submodular function. We also propose several extensions that mimic loss functions and criteria for binary classification with asymmetric losses, and show how to naturally obtain sets with optimized conditional coverage.

    "abstract": "With the development of large language models (LLMs), particularly with the introduction of the long reasoning chain technique, the reasoning ability of LLMs in complex problem-solving has been significantly enhanced. While acknowledging the power of long reasoning chains, we cannot help but wonder: Why do different reasoning chains perform differently in reasoning? What components of the reasoning chains play a key role? Existing studies mainly focus on evaluating reasoning chains from a functional perspective, with little attention paid to their structural mechanisms. To address this gap, this work is the first to analyze and evaluate the quality of the reasoning chain from a structural perspective. We apply persistent homology from Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to map reasoning steps into semantic space, extract topological features, and analyze structural changes. These changes reveal semantic coherence, logical redundancy, and identify logical breaks and gaps. By calculating homology groups, we assess connectivity and redundancy at various scales, using barcode and persistence diagrams to quantify stability and consistency. Our results show that the topological structural complexity of reasoning chains correlates positively with accuracy. More complex chains identify correct answers sooner, while successful reasoning exhibits simpler topologies, reducing redundancy and cycles, enhancing efficiency and interpretability. This work provides a new perspective on reasoning chain quality assessment and offers guidance for future optimization."

To address this challenge, we propose WorldRFT, a planning-oriented latent world model framework that aligns scene representation learning with planning via a hierarchical planning decomposition and local-aware interactive refinement mechanism, augmented by reinforcement learning fine-tuning (RFT) to enhance safety-critical policy performance. Specifically, WorldRFT integrates a vision-geometry foundation model to improve 3D spatial awareness, employs hierarchical planning task decomposition to guide representation optimization, and utilizes local-aware iterative refinement to derive a planning-oriented driving policy. Furthermore, we introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which applies trajectory Gaussianization and collision-aware rewards to fine-tune the driving policy, yielding systematic improvements in safety. WorldRFT achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both open-loop nuScenes and closed-loop NavSim benchmarks. On nuScenes, it reduces collision rates by 83% (0.30% -> 0.05%). On NavSim, using camera-only sensors input, it attains competitive performance with the LiDAR-based SOTA method DiffusionDrive (87.8 vs. 88.1 PDMS)."

However, conventional SEI techniques are primarily designed for single-emitter scenarios. This poses a fundamental limitation in distributed wireless networks, where simultaneous transmissions from multiple emitters result in overlapping signals that conventional single-emitter identification methods cannot effectively handle. To overcome this limitation, we present a specific multi-emitter identification (SMEI) framework via multi-label learning, treating identification as a problem of directly decoding emitter states from overlapping signals. Theoretically, we establish performance bounds using Fano's inequality. Methodologically, the multi-label formulation reduces output dimensionality from exponential to linear scale, thereby substantially decreasing computational complexity. Additionally, we propose an improved SMEI (I-SMEI), which incorporates multi-head attention to effectively capture features in correlated signal combinations. Experimental results demonstrate that SMEI achieves high identification accuracy with a linear computational complexity. Furthermore, the proposed I-SMEI scheme significantly improves identification accuracy across various overlapping scenarios compared to the proposed SMEI and other advanced methods."

To address this, we propose advantage-weighted policy optimization (AWPO) -- a principled RL framework that effectively integrates explicit reasoning rewards to enhance tool-use capability. AWPO incorporates variance-aware gating and difficulty-aware weighting to adaptively modulate advantages from reasoning signals based on group-relative statistics, alongside a tailored clipping mechanism for stable optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AWPO achieves state-of-the-art performance across standard tool-use benchmarks, significantly outperforming strong baselines and leading closed-source models in challenging multi-turn scenarios. Notably, with exceptional parameter efficiency, our 4B model surpasses Grok-4 by 16.0 percent in multi-turn accuracy while preserving generalization capability on the out-of-distribution MMLU-Pro benchmark."

To further improve robustness, we propose Candidate Filtering (CF), a mechanism that prioritizes heads based on their contribution to model performance, mitigating degradation during pruning. Experimental results indicate that SAP effectively preserves critical heads of a high density of strong attention values, outperforming existing head pruning strategies in retrain-free settings. These findings position SAP as a promising foundation for a new direction in model compression research, offering high flexibility for pruning across all transformer-based language models."

We introduce a new conditioning rule for our Accept-Desirability models, based on the idea that observing an event introduces new indifferences between options.

We investigate two interesting special cases where all of these axioms are shown to still hold: classical propositional logic and full conditional probabilities."

    "abstract": "Mendelian Randomization is a widely used instrumental variable method for assessing causal effects of lifelong exposures on health outcomes. Many exposures, however, have causal effects that vary across the life course and often influence outcomes jointly with other exposures or indirectly through mediating pathways. Existing approaches to multivariable Mendelian Randomization assume constant effects over time and therefore fail to capture these dynamic relationships. We introduce Multivariable Functional Mendelian Randomization (MV-FMR), a new framework that extends functional Mendelian Randomization to simultaneously model multiple time-varying exposures. The method combines functional principal component analysis with a data-driven cross-validation strategy for basis selection and accounts for overlapping instruments and mediation effects. Through extensive simulations, we assessed MV-FMR's ability to recover time-varying causal effects under a range of data-generating scenarios and compared the performance of joint versus separate exposure effect estimation strategies. Across scenarios involving nonlinear effects, horizontal pleiotropy, mediation, and sparse data, MV-FMR consistently recovered the true causal functions and outperformed univariable approaches. To demonstrate its practical value, we applied MV-FMR to UK Biobank data to investigate the time-varying causal effects of systolic blood pressure and body mass index on coronary artery disease. MV-FMR provides a flexible and interpretable framework for disentangling complex time-dependent causal processes and offers new opportunities for identifying life-course critical periods and actionable drivers relevant to disease prevention."

While AI-enabled CSI feedback has achieved significant advances, especially in precoding matrix index feedback, AI-based CQI feedback remains underexplored. Conventional subband-based CQI approaches, due to coarse granularity, often fail to capture fine frequency-selective variations and thus lead to suboptimal resource allocation. In this paper, we propose an AI-driven subcarrier-level CQI feedback framework tailored for 6G and NextG systems. First, we introduce CQInet, an autoencoder-based scheme that compresses per-subcarrier CQI at the user equipment and reconstructs it at the base station, significantly reducing feedback overhead without compromising CQI accuracy. Simulation results show that CQInet increases the effective data rate by 7.6% relative to traditional subband CQI under equivalent feedback overhead. Building on this, we develop SR-CQInet, which leverages super-resolution to infer fine-grained subcarrier CQI from sparsely reported CSI reference signals (CSI-RS). SR-CQInet reduces CSI-RS overhead to 3.5% of CQInet's requirements while maintaining comparable throughput. These results demonstrate that AI-driven subcarrier-level CQI feedback can substantially enhance spectral efficiency and reliability in future wireless networks."

To address these issues, we propose Decoupled Generative Modeling for Human-Object Interaction Synthesis (DecHOI), which separates path planning and action synthesis. A trajectory generator first produces human and object trajectories without prescribed waypoints, and an action generator conditions on these paths to synthesize detailed motions. To further improve contact realism, we employ adversarial training with a discriminator that focuses on the dynamics of distal joints. The framework also models a moving counterpart and supports responsive, long-sequence planning in dynamic scenes, while preserving plan consistency.

Therefore, galactic dark matter may be in a form of a self-gravitating condensate, in the presence of self-interactions. We consider the possibility that the self-interacting potential of the condensate dark matter is of the logarithmic form. In order to describe the condensate dark matter we use the Gross-Pitaevskii equation with a logarithmic nonlinearity, and the Thomas-Fermi approximation. With the use of the hydrodynamic representation of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation we obtain the equation of state of the condensate, which has the form of the ideal gas equation of state, with the pressure proportional to the dark matter density. The basic equation describing the density distribution of the static condensate is derived, and its solution is obtained in the form of a series solution, constructed with the help of the Adomian Decomposition Method. To test the model we consider the properties of the galactic rotation curves in the logarithmic Bose-Einstein Condensate dark matter scenario, by using a sample from the Spitzer Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves (SPARC) data. The fit of the theoretical predictions of the rotation curves with the observational data indicate that the logarithmic Bose-Einstein Condensate dark matter model gives an acceptable description of the SPARC data, and thus it may be considered as a possible candidate for the in depth understanding of the dark matter properties."

In the original framework, each ML-generated candidate model is embedded in a CFD solver and evaluated against reference data, requiring hundreds to thousands of high-fidelity simulations and resulting in prohibitive computational cost for complex flows. To overcome this limitation, we propose an extended framework that integrates surrogate modeling into symbolic CFD-driven training in real time to reduce training cost. The surrogate model learns to approximate the errors of ML-generated models based on previous CFD evaluations and is continuously refined during training. Newly generated models are first assessed using the surrogate, and only those predicted to yield small errors or high uncertainty are subsequently evaluated with full CFD simulations. Discrete expressions generated by symbolic regression are mapped into a continuous space using averaged input-symbol values as inputs to a probabilistic surrogate model. To support multi-objective model training, particularly when fixed weighting of competing quantities is challenging, the surrogate is extended to a multi-output formulation by generalizing the kernel to a matrix form, providing one mean and variance prediction per training objective. Selection metrics based on these probabilistic outputs are used to identify an optimal training setup. The proposed surrogate-augmented CFD-driven training framework is demonstrated across a range of statistically one- and two-dimensional flows, including both single- and multi-expression model optimization. In all cases, the framework substantially reduces training cost while maintaining predictive accuracy comparable to that of the original CFD-driven approach."

Given a reference image (e.g., one's pet), we expect the generated image to retain precise details attached to the subject's identity. However, current generative evaluation metrics emphasize the overall semantic similarity between the reference and the output, and overlook these fine-grained discriminative details. We introduce Finer-Personalization Rank, an evaluation protocol tailored to identity preservation. Instead of pairwise similarity, Finer-Personalization Rank adopts a ranking view: it treats each generated image as a query against an identity-labeled gallery consisting of visually similar real images. Retrieval metrics (e.g., mean average precision) measure performance, where higher scores indicate that identity-specific details (e.g., a distinctive head spot) are preserved. We assess identity at multiple granularities -- from fine-grained categories (e.g., bird species, car models) to individual instances (e.g., re-identification). Across CUB, Stanford Cars, and animal Re-ID benchmarks, Finer-Personalization Rank more faithfully reflects identity retention than semantic-only metrics and reveals substantial identity drift in several popular personalization methods. These results position the gallery-based protocol as a principled and practical evaluation for personalized generation."

Current unlearning metrics typically measure success by monitoring the model's performance degradation on the specific unlearning dataset ($D_u$). We argue that for Large Language Models (LLMs), this evaluation paradigm is insufficient and potentially misleading. Many real-world uses of unlearning--motivated by copyright or safety--implicitly target not only verbatim content in $D_u$, but also behaviors influenced by the broader generalizations the model derived from it. We demonstrate that LLMs can pass standard unlearning evaluation and appear to have ``forgotten'' the target knowledge, while simultaneously retaining strong capabilities on content that is semantically adjacent to $D_u$. This phenomenon indicates that erasing exact sentences does not necessarily equate to removing the underlying knowledge. To address this gap, we propose \\name, an automated stress-testing framework that generates a surrogate dataset, $\\tilde{D}_u$. This surrogate set is constructed to be semantically derived from $D_u$ yet sufficiently distinct in embedding space. By comparing unlearning metric scores between $D_u$ and $\\tilde{D}_u$, we can stress-test the reliability of the metric itself. Our extensive evaluation across three LLM families (Llama-3-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, and Zephyr-7B-$β$), three distinct datasets, and seven standard metrics reveals widespread inconsistencies. We find that current metrics frequently overestimate unlearning success, failing to detect retained knowledge exposed by our stress-test datasets."

In this paper, we introduce operator tail densities for copulas and show that an operator-regularly-varying density can be characterized through the operator tail density of its copula together with the marginal regular variation. As an example, we demonstrate that although a Liouville copula is not available in closed form, it nevertheless admits an explicit operator tail-dependence function."

    "abstract": "Advancements in large language models (LLMs) are showing promising impact in software development and programming assistance. However, these models struggle when operating on low-level backend code. This challenge is exacerbated in the domain of GPU kernels, where performance-critical details are coupled to rapidly evolving hardware characteristics and available code examples are sparse. In this work, we introduce PEAK, a Performance Engineering AI-Assistant for GPU Kernels powered by natural language transformations. PEAK utilizes the key insight that iterative code transformations (optimizations) can straightforwardly be written in natural language, and then carried out by LLMs. Thus, these transformations can be rapidly developed, encoding general portable optimizations, but also easily specialized to specific GPU devices and even kernels. These natural transformations are supported by a modular and extensible infrastructure that additionally performs validation and performance evaluation. We demonstrate the flexibility of PEAK by instantiating it for three backends, CUDA, HIP, and HLSL, and create 16 natural transformations for optimizing matrix multiplication kernels. We show that our resulting implementations are competitive with vendor libraries when available, and for HLSL (without a library) our implementations match the hardware documented FLOPS. PEAK allows the fine-grained exploration of several research questions around how LLMs behave in this domain, including characterizing transformations and their errors; and how performance evolves along optimization sequences. PEAK provides an interface that can either be utilized by performance engineers to improve productivity, or driven completely autonomously (e.g., by an AI agent), providing a forward-compatible design that can continue to improve with advances in AI capabilities."

To bridge this gap, we propose a novel OR-Guided \"Pretrain-then-Reinforce\" framework. To provide structured guidance, we propose a simulation-augmented OR model that generates high-quality reference decisions, implicitly capturing complex business constraints and managerial preferences. Leveraging these OR-derived decisions as foundational training labels, we design a domain-informed deep learning foundation model to establish foundational decision-making capabilities, followed by a reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning stage. Uniquely, we position RL as a deep alignment mechanism that enables the AI agent to internalize the optimality principles of OR, while simultaneously leveraging exploration for general policy refinement and allowing expert guidance for scenario-specific adaptation (e.g., promotional events). Validated through extensive numerical experiments and a field deployment at JD.com augmented by a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) analysis, our model significantly outperforms incumbent industrial practices, delivering real-world gains of a 5.27-day reduction in turnover and a 2.29% increase in in-stock rates, alongside a 29.95% decrease in holding costs. Contrary to the prevailing trend of brute-force model scaling, our study demonstrates that a lightweight, domain-informed model can deliver state-of-the-art performance and robust transferability when guided by structured OR logic. This approach offers a scalable and cost-effective paradigm for intelligent supply chain management, highlighting the value of deeply aligning AI with OR."

    "abstract": "Matching is one of the most widely used causal inference frameworks in observational studies. However, all the existing matching-based causal inference methods are designed for either a single treatment with general treatment types (e.g., binary, ordinal, or continuous) or factorial (multiple) treatments with binary treatments only. To our knowledge, no existing matching-based causal methods can handle factorial treatments with general treatment types. This critical gap substantially hinders the applicability of matching in many real-world problems, in which there are often multiple, potentially non-binary (e.g., continuous) treatment components. To address this critical gap, this work develops a universal framework for the design and analysis of factorial matched observational studies with general treatment types (e.g., binary, ordinal, or continuous). We first propose a two-stage non-bipartite matching algorithm that constructs matched sets of units with similar covariates but distinct combinations of treatment doses, thereby enabling valid estimation of both main and interaction effects. We then introduce a new class of generalized factorial Neyman-type estimands that provide model-free, finite-population-valid definitions of marginal and interaction causal effects under factorial treatments with general treatment types. Randomization-based Fisher-type and Neyman-type inference procedures are developed, including unbiased estimators, asymptotically valid variance estimators, and variance adjustments incorporating covariate information for improved efficiency. Finally, we illustrate the proposed framework through a county-level application that evaluates the causal impacts of work- and non-work-trip reductions (social distancing practices) on COVID-19-related and drug-related outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States."

    "abstract": "In 1995, Kazhikhov and Vaigant introduced a particular class of isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations with variable viscosity coefficients and, for the first time, established the existence of global smooth solutions for arbitrarily large initial data in bounded two-dimensional domains. This result was subsequently extended and refined to accommodate more general constraints on the viscosity coefficients. However, because the proofs in this line of work [17,14,15,8] rely heavily on the structure of the isentropic equations, they could not be generalized to the broader setting of multidimensional compressible heat-conductive Navier-Stokes-Fourier systems. In this paper, we consider a special class of non-isentropic compressible fluids governed by the two-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes equations with variable entropy. In this system, the pressure depends nonlinearly on both density and entropy, and the entropy evolves solely through a transport equation-a feature that distinguishes it from the standard Navier-Stokes-Fourier model. We establish, for the first time, the global existence of strong solutions for arbitrarily large initial data on both two-dimensional periodic domains and bounded domains endowed with Navier-slip boundary conditions. For the bounded-domain case, a key step in our analysis is the derivation of new commutator estimates compatible with the slip condition. Our results hold even when the initial density may contain vacuum and require no smallness assumption on the initial data, provided the shear viscosity is constant and the bulk viscosity follows a power-law form $λ(ρ)=ρ^β$ with $β> 4/3$. Moreover, we demonstrate that the density remains uniformly bounded for all time. Consequently, the solution converges to an equilibrium state as time tends to infinity."

Most existing methods lack theoretical guarantees of exhaustiveness in identifying lower dimensional structures, either at the population level or at the sample level. We tackle this issue by proposing a new method, generative sufficient dimension reduction (GenSDR), which leverages modern generative models. We show that GenSDR is able to fully recover the information contained in the central $σ$-field at both the population and sample levels. In particular, at the sample level, we establish a consistency property for the GenSDR estimator from the perspective of conditional distributions, capitalizing on the distributional learning capabilities of deep generative models. Moreover, by incorporating an ensemble technique, we extend GenSDR to accommodate scenarios with non-Euclidean responses, thereby substantially broadening its applicability. Extensive numerical results demonstrate the outstanding empirical performance of GenSDR and highlight its strong potential for addressing a wide range of complex, real-world tasks."

Therefore, we explore the conditions for the competition and/or coexistence between both types of superconducting phases, and we identify the presence of the so-called \"topological repulsion\" mechanism, which was previously reported in the context of simple Weyl semimetals. We identified the critical temperatures corresponding to the monopole and conventional superconducting phases, and calculated the specific heat as a function of temperature, thus showing that this thermodynamical parameter may provide an experimental probe to determine the chirality index $ν$ in the material."

    "abstract": "Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks through long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Extending these successes to multimodal reasoning remains challenging due to the increased complexity of integrating diverse input modalities and the scarcity of high-quality long CoT training data. Existing multimodal datasets and CoT synthesis methods still suffer from limited reasoning depth, modality conversion errors, and rigid generation pipelines, hindering model performance and stability. To this end, in this paper, we propose SynSelect, a novel three-stage Synthesis-Selection framework for generating high-quality long CoT data tailored to multimodal reasoning tasks. Specifically, SynSelect first leverages multiple heterogeneous multimodal LRMs to produce diverse candidate CoTs, and then applies both instance and batch level selection to filter high-quality CoTs that can effectively enhance the model's reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on multiple multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that models supervised fine-tuned on SynSelect-generated data significantly outperform baselines and achieve further improvements after reinforcement learning post-training. Our results validate SynSelect as an effective approach for advancing multimodal LRMs reasoning capabilities."

    "abstract": "Camera-based 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) is a critical task for autonomous driving and robotic scene understanding. It aims to infer a complete 3D volumetric representation of both semantics and geometry from a single image. Existing methods typically focus on end-to-end 2D-to-3D feature lifting and voxel completion. However, they often overlook the interference between high-confidence visible-region perception and low-confidence occluded-region reasoning caused by single-image input, which can lead to feature dilution and error propagation. To address these challenges, we introduce an offline Visible Region Label Extraction (VRLE) strategy that explicitly separates and extracts voxel-level supervision for visible regions from dense 3D ground truth. This strategy purifies the supervisory space for two complementary sub-tasks: visible-region perception and occluded-region reasoning. Building on this idea, we propose the Visible-Occluded Interactive Completion Network (VOIC), a novel dual-decoder framework that explicitly decouples SSC into visible-region semantic perception and occluded-region scene completion. VOIC first constructs a base 3D voxel representation by fusing image features with depth-derived occupancy. The visible decoder focuses on generating high-fidelity geometric and semantic priors, while the occlusion decoder leverages these priors together with cross-modal interaction to perform coherent global scene reasoning. Extensive experiments on the SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI360 benchmarks demonstrate that VOIC outperforms existing monocular SSC methods in both geometric completion and semantic segmentation accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art performance."

This heuristic finding offers a unifying perspective that ties encoder behavior to its underlying spectral structure. We define it as the Prism Hypothesis, where each data modality can be viewed as a projection of the natural world onto a shared feature spectrum, just like the prism. Building on this insight, we propose Unified Autoencoding (UAE), a model that harmonizes semantic structure and pixel details via an innovative frequency-band modulator, enabling their seamless coexistence. Extensive experiments on ImageNet and MS-COCO benchmarks validate that our UAE effectively unifies semantic abstraction and pixel-level fidelity into a single latent space with state-of-the-art performance."

To bridge this gap, we introduce a large-scale benchmark built from pedestrian-perspective videos captured with synchronized stereo cameras, LiDAR, and IMU/GPS sensors. This dataset provides metrically precise 3D information, enabling the automatic generation of spatial reasoning questions that span a hierarchical spectrum--from qualitative relational reasoning to quantitative metric and kinematic understanding. Evaluations reveal that the performance gains observed in structured indoor benchmarks vanish in open-world settings. Further analysis using synthetic abnormal scenes and blinding tests confirms that current MLLMs depend heavily on linguistic priors instead of grounded visual reasoning. Our benchmark thus provides a principled platform for diagnosing these limitations and advancing physically grounded spatial intelligence."

Super-resolution (SR) can enhance resolution post-scan, yet existing deep learning methods face fidelity-efficiency trade-offs. Purpose: To develop a computationally efficient and accurate deep learning framework for MRI SR that preserves anatomical detail for clinical integration. Materials and Methods: We propose a novel SR framework combining multi-head selective state-space models (MHSSM) with a lightweight channel MLP. The model uses 2D patch extraction with hybrid scanning to capture long-range dependencies. Each MambaFormer block integrates MHSSM, depthwise convolutions, and gated channel mixing. Evaluation used 7T brain T1 MP2RAGE maps (n=142) and 1.5T prostate T2w MRI (n=334). Comparisons included Bicubic interpolation, GANs (CycleGAN, Pix2pix, SPSR), transformers (SwinIR), Mamba (MambaIR), and diffusion models (I2SB, Res-SRDiff). Results: Our model achieved superior performance with exceptional efficiency. For 7T brain data: SSIM=0.951+-0.021, PSNR=26.90+-1.41 dB, LPIPS=0.076+-0.022, GMSD=0.083+-0.017, significantly outperforming all baselines (p<0.001). For prostate data: SSIM=0.770+-0.049, PSNR=27.15+-2.19 dB, LPIPS=0.190+-0.095, GMSD=0.087+-0.013. The framework used only 0.9M parameters and 57 GFLOPs, reducing parameters by 99.8% and computation by 97.5% versus Res-SRDiff, while outperforming SwinIR and MambaIR in accuracy and efficiency. Conclusion: The proposed framework provides an efficient, accurate MRI SR solution, delivering enhanced anatomical detail across datasets. Its low computational demand and state-of-the-art performance show strong potential for clinical translation."

These objects challenge standard models of early galaxy formation and may represent an extreme class of early BH hosts. In this paper, we investigate whether these BHs could have a primordial origin. We first show that the direct formation of these BH masses in the early Universe is excluded by stringent CMB $μ$-distortion limits. We then investigate the assembly of massive BHs from lighter, observationally allowed primordial black holes (PBHs) via hierarchical mergers, finding that, although this channel can operate depending on the merger history, it faces challenges in explaining the observations due to the rarity of the required high-redshift dark matter halos. Finally, we estimate gas accretion onto intermediate-mass PBHs, while jointly tracking metallicity evolution, and identify regions of parameter space in which such growth could reproduce the observed properties of LRDs. As a special case, we focus on the strongly lensed source QSO1, whose extremely low metallicity and large mass provide a stringent test of these formation channels."

In this paper, we introduce a technique to measure differential RVs of wide binary stars using high resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra. We apply this method to measure differential RVs of 100 wide-binaries from the C3PO survey and achieved precisions of $8-15$ m/s per binary pair, a $\\sim 10-100 \\times$ improvement (median $\\sim 24 \\times$) over Gaia DR3.

We test two commonly used interpolating functions in MOND formulation: the simple form ($b=1, μ= x/(1+x)$) and the standard form ($b=2, μ= x/\\sqrt{1+x^2}$). Our results indicate tension with MOND at the presently accepted $a_0$ value: for $b=1$, the canonical value is excluded at $3.1σ$, while for $b=2$, the exclusion is at $1.9σ$."

Here we analytically determine the mean escape time and splitting probabilities for an arbitrary heterogeneous diffusion in an arbitrary three-dimensional domain with small targets that can be perfectly or imperfectly absorbing. Our analysis reveals general principles for how search depends on heterogeneous diffusion and its interpretation (e.g. Itô, Stratonovich, or kinetic). An intricate picture emerges in which, for instance, increasing the diffusivity can decrease, not affect, or even increase the escape time. Our results could be used to determine the appropriate interpretation for specific physical systems."

In our calculations, we first study the normal-state density of states (DOS) in the single- and double-Mn-layer heterostructures, and calculate the induced magnetic moments in the Nb layers. Next, we compute the momentum-resolved spectral functions in the superconducting state for the heterostructure with a single Mn layer, and find bands crossing the Fermi level within the superconducting (SC) gap. We also study the SC state DOS in the single- and double-Mn-layer heterostructures and compare some of our results with experimental findings, revealing secondary gaps, plateau-like regions, and central V-shaped in-gap states within the bulk SC Nb gap that are magnetic-order-dependent. Finally, we compute the singlet and internally antisymmetric triplet (IAT) order parameters for each layer for both heterostructures, and find an order of magnitude difference in the induced singlet part of the SC order parameter in the Mn layer/s between the FM and AFM cases in favor of the AFM pairing with the maximum still being only 4.44% of the bulk Nb singlet order parameter value.

    "abstract": "In this work we assess the implications of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope DR6 measurements for two interacting dark radiation scenarios previously shown to mitigate the Hubble tension. The first model, Wess-Zumino dark radiation (WZDR), features a mass threshold in the dark sector that induces a step-like reduction in the dark radiation abundance as the dark temperature evolves. The second model, new atomic dark matter (nuADaM), introduces dark radiation that remains coupled to a subcomponent of dark matter until shortly before matter-radiation equality. Earlier analyses using Planck data demonstrated that these interactions significantly relax constraints on the dark radiation density and allow values of $H_0$ consistent with local distance-ladder determinations. Incorporating ACT DR6, which extends CMB measurements deep into the high-$\\ell$ damping tail, we find that constraints on the additional radiation component tighten substantially in both scenarios, closing most of the parameter space that previously enabled higher values of $H_0$. We further analyze a generalized model including both free-streaming and self-interacting dark radiation, and show that the resulting constraints are consistent with ACT's findings for the limiting cases of purely free-streaming or purely self-interacting radiation. Overall, ACT DR6 significantly restricts interacting dark radiation as a solution to the Hubble tension."

    "abstract": "The hypothetical global delivery schedule of Santa Claus must follow strict rolling night-time windows that vary with the Earth's rotation and obey an energy budget that depends on payload size and cruising speed. To design this schedule, the Travelling-Santa Ant-Colony Optimisation framework (TSaP-ACO) was developed. This heuristic framework constructs potential routes via a population of artificial ants that iteratively extend partial paths. Ants make their decisions much like they do in nature, following pheromones left by other ants, but with a degree of permitted exploration. This approach: (i) embeds local darkness feasibility directly into the pheromone heuristic, (ii) seeks to minimise aerodynamic work via a shrinking sleigh cross sectional area, (iii) uses a low-cost \"rogue-ant\" reversal to capture direction-sensitive time-zones, and (iv) tunes leg-specific cruise speeds on the fly. On benchmark sets of 15 and 30 capital cities, the TSaP-ACO eliminates all daylight violations and reduces total work by up to 10% compared to a distance-only ACO. In a 40-capital-city stress test, it cuts energy use by 88%, and shortens tour length by around 67%. Population-first routing emerges naturally from work minimisation (50% served by leg 11 of 40). These results demonstrate that rolling-window, energy-aware ACO has potential applications more realistic global delivery scenarios."

We continue HuBERT pre-training with supervision based on a phonetic-to-articulatory feature mapping in 55 languages. Our models learn from multilingual data to predict articulatory features or phones, resulting in language-independent representations that capture multilingual phonetic properties. Through comprehensive ABX discriminability testing, we show MauBERT models produce more context-invariant representations than state-of-the-art multilingual self-supervised learning models. Additionally, the models effectively adapt to unseen languages and casual speech with minimal self-supervised fine-tuning (10 hours of speech). This establishes an effective approach for instilling linguistic inductive biases in self-supervised speech models."

    "abstract": "The {\\em Prym} of a cyclic covering of smooth projective curves is the ``new'' part of the Jacobian: the quotient of the Jacobian of the covering curve by the Jacobians of the intermediate covers. Given a family of such coverings, the fundamental group of the base of the family acts on the Tate modules of the Pryms, and the image of this representation is a key ingredient in answering arithmetic statistics questions about the distribution of the group structure of the $L$-torsion of a random Prym in the family. (Over ${\\mathbb{F}}_q$, the action of Frobenius is roughly uniformly distributed over the {\\em arithmetic} monodromy, a coset of the image of the fundamental group of the base change to $\\bar{\\mathbb{F}}_q$ (the {\\em geometric} monodromy).) In the present note, we show for a number of natural families that (with limited exceptions) the geometric monodromy is sandwiched between a certain unitary group and its derived subgroup. In particular, this holds for the one-parameter families obtained by starting with any fixed cover and varying one (tame) ramification point. As an application, we deduce analogous largeness results for the monodromy of the Selmer groups of elliptic surfaces with $j=0$ or $j=1728$, by relating them to cyclic covers of degree 6 or 4 respectively, implying that their Selmer groups do not satisfy the standard heuristics. For instance, for eliptic surfaces with $j=0$ of sufficiently large height over ${\\mathbb{P}}^1_{\\mathbb{F}_q}$, the average size of the $l$-Selmer group is $l+3+o_q(1)$ when $l$ (fixed) and $q$ (large) are both 1 mod 3, compared to $l+1+o_q(1)$ for general elliptic surfaces."

    "abstract": "Galaxy clusters represent some of the most extreme environments in the Universe. They are ideal locations to study the impact of an extreme environment on the evolution of the Stellar Mass Function (SMF), which describes the statistical distribution of galaxies as a function of their stellar masses. In this work, we examine how the SMF of galaxies depends on factors such as the surrounding environments, whether they reside in isolated fields or clusters. We use the 9-band photometric galaxy data of the G9 patch from the Kilo Degree Survey (optical) and the VISTA Kilo-Degree Infrared Galaxy Survey (infrared), containing around 3.7 million galaxies, overlapping with the cluster catalog provided by the eROSITA Final Equatorial Depth Surveys (eFEDS). After applying appropriate selection criteria, we have 105 eFEDS clusters within the redshift range 0.385-0.8, covering $\\sim 46$ square degrees. The large, continuous overlap of the surveys allows us to examine the SMF of the cluster galaxies within the cluster-centric radial bins up to $5R_{500}$. We find a clear detection of the cluster galaxy SMF up to $2R_{500}$ beyond which it's consistent with the background. We divide the cluster sample into redshift, mass, and X-ray luminosity bins to examine their impact on the SMF. The SMF of cluster galaxies for the high-mass clusters shows a decline at low stellar masses ($M_*\\lesssim 2\\times 10^{10}M_\\odot$) within $0-0.5R_{500}$, as compared to a flat SMF for the low-mass clusters, suggesting the low-mass galaxies grow over time before reaching the cluster center. Additionally, we find a flatter SMF for the low redshift bin within $0.5R_{500}$ at stellar masses $M_*< 10^{10}M_\\odot$. We also examined the effect of cluster ellipticity on the cluster galaxy SMF; however do not find statistically significant differences between the high and the low ellipticity clusters."

In this paper, we consider arbitrary spiralization tensors for the DMI interaction and arbitrary directions for the external magnetic field, and study the nature of the ground states in this parameter space, using a combination of analytical and numerical methods. Classifying ground states by their symmetry into ferromagnetic (invariant under under arbitrary translations in the plane), spiral (invariant under arbitrary translations in one direction) and skyrmion lattice ground states (invariant under a two dimensional lattice group), we give a complete description of the phase diagram of this class of theories."

In higher dimensions, PH preservation forces $Φ$ to be a conformal map; for $n \\ge 3$, Liouville's theorem then implies that any local diffeomorphism with this property is (anti-)Möbius. These results subsume the previously known ``(scaled) PH-preserving'' constructions of mappings $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}^3$ and align with Ueda's conformal viewpoint on isothermal and spherical geometries.

    "abstract": "Dynamic PET enables the quantitative estimation of physiology-related parameters and is widely utilized in research and increasingly adopted in clinical settings. Parametric imaging in dynamic PET requires kinetic modeling to estimate voxel-wise physiological parameters based on specific kinetic models. However, parametric images estimated through kinetic model fitting often suffer from low image quality due to the inherently ill-posed nature of the fitting process and the limited counts resulting from non-continuous data acquisition across multiple bed positions in whole-body PET. In this work, we proposed a diffusion model-based kinetic modeling framework for parametric image estimation, using the Patlak model as an example. The score function of the diffusion model was pre-trained on static total-body PET images and served as a prior for both Patlak slope and intercept images by leveraging their patch-wise similarity. During inference, the kinetic model was incorporated as a data-consistency constraint to guide the parametric image estimation. The proposed framework was evaluated on total-body dynamic PET datasets with different dose levels, demonstrating the feasibility and promising performance of the proposed framework in improving parametric image quality."

    "abstract": "We present a geometric extension of the Bogomolny-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) construction for scalar kinks in (1+1) dimensions embedded in static curved spacetimes. By introducing a nonminimal coupling between the scalar prepotential and the extrinsic curvature of the static foliation, the flat-space first-order Bogomolny equation remains exactly valid for arbitrary static backgrounds. As a consequence, the kink profile is unchanged, while the effective potential and vacuum structure acquire a controlled geometric dependence. We show that these curved-space BPS kinks are always linearly stable. However, the existence of the translational zero mode is not guaranteed: its normalizability depends on the competition between the intrinsic length scale of the kink and the asymptotic curvature scale of the geometry. When the geometric scale dominates, the zero mode is removed and the soliton becomes geometrically pinned, despite remaining an exact BPS solution. Explicit realizations in AdS2 demonstrate how different static slicings of the same spacetime lead to qualitatively distinct physical outcomes, ranging from preserved translational invariance to its complete removal by horizons. These results establish geometry as a precise mechanism for controlling solitonic moduli without compromising linear stability."

We establish a compactness theory modular three types of bubbles. As applications, we get some quantization results for several important topological number associated with the vector bundles, for instance, the first Pontrjagin numbers $p_1(E)$ of vector bundles over Einstein 4-manifolds and the Euler numbers $χ(M;E)$ of holomorphic vector bundles over Kähler-Einstein surfaces. Furthermore, we get some quantization results about the volume $v(L_j)$ and certain cohomological numbers (e.g. $dim H^0(M_j;L_j)$) of holomorphic line bundles $L_j$ over non-collapsed degenerating Kähler-Einstein surfaces $(M_j,J_j,g_j)$ with the aid of the classical vanishing theorems, the classical Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch type theorems, and the profound convergence theory of Kähler-Einstein manifolds. In particular, we obtain some interesting identities involving non-collapsed degenerating compact Kähler-Einstein surfaces with non-zero scalar curvature, which indicate that we can know the Euler number of $M_j$ for large $j$ provided some topological information of the limit orbifold $M_\\infty$. For Kähler-Einstein Del Pezzo surfaces, an interesting implication is that we can provide some preliminary estimates for the number of singularities of various types in $M_\\infty$ in an effective way. As an unexpected surprise, we find an identity which connects Milnor numbers for singularities in $M_\\infty$ and the correction terms in the Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch theorem for orbifolds.

Recent advances in adaptive optics, wavefront shaping, and machine learning, driven by synergistic progress in fundamental theories, optoelectronic hardware, and computational algorithms, have demonstrated substantial potential in mitigating turbulence-induced distortions. Recently, active convolved illumination (ACI) was proposed as a versatile and physics-driven technique for transmitting structured light beams with minimal distortion through highly challenging turbulent regimes. While distinct in its formulation, ACI shares conceptual similarities with other physics-driven distortion correction approaches and stands to benefit from complementary integration with data-driven deep learning (DL) models. Inspired by recent work coupling deep learning with traditional turbulence mitigation strategies, the present work investigates the feasibility of integrating ACI with neural network-based methods. We outline a conceptual framework for coupling ACI with data-driven models and identify conditions under which learned representations can meaningfully support ACI's correlation-injection mechanism. As a representative example, we employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) together with a transfer-learning approach to examine how a learned model may operate in tandem with ACI. This exploratory study demonstrates feasible implementation pathways and establishes an early foundation for assessing the potential of future ACI-DL hybrid architectures, representing a step toward evaluating broader synergistic interactions between ACI and modern DL models."

While residential structure survivability - the percent of structures within a wildfire perimeter that survive the fire - remained stable in the Eastern US in the past two decades, it declined by 10% in the West. Survivability was explained by structural age, surrounding fuels, and fire weather. Survivability was 87% for homes built pre-1990 compared to 92% for post-1990 homes in the West. Survivability was lowest in forests compared to grasslands and shrublands. Finally, survivability was markedly lower for fires coincident with extreme fire weather. Our results suggest that modern building codes, fuel management, and proactive planning can strengthen wildfire resilience."

    "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive progress in natural image reasoning, yet their potential in medical imaging remains underexplored, especially in clinical anatomical surgical images. Anatomy understanding tasks demand precise understanding and clinically coherent answers, which are difficult to achieve due to the complexity of medical data and the scarcity of high-quality expert annotations. These challenges limit the effectiveness of conventional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) strategies. While recent work has demonstrated that Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) can enhance reasoning in MLLMs without relying on large amounts of data, we find two weaknesses that hinder GRPO's reasoning performance in anatomy recognition: 1) knowledge cannot be effectively shared between different anatomical structures, resulting in uneven information gain and preventing the model from converging, and 2) the model quickly converges to a single reasoning path, suppressing the exploration of diverse strategies. To overcome these challenges, we propose two novel methods. First, we implement a progressive learning strategy called Anatomical Similarity Curriculum Learning by controlling question difficulty via the similarity of answer choices, enabling the model to master complex problems incrementally. Second, we utilize question augmentation referred to as Group Diversity Question Augmentation to expand the model's search space for difficult queries, mitigating the tendency to produce uniform responses. Comprehensive experiments on the SGG-VQA and OmniMedVQA benchmarks show our method achieves a significant improvement across the two benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the medical reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. The code can be found in https://github.com/tomato996/Anatomy-R1"

Going beyond conventional Hermitian physics, we analyze the impact of non-Hermiticity in the quantum state transmission by employing a non-Hermitian spin chain that functions as a quantum data bus. By deriving a general expression for the fidelity of quantum state transfer for a U(1)-symmetric non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, we analyze PT-symmetric XX and SSH models, complemented by a numerical study of the RT-symmetric iXY model. We demonstrate that, in several parameter regimes, the transfer fidelity in the non-Hermitian setting exceeds the classical threshold and can even exceed the performance of the corresponding Hermitian models. In particular, for the SSH model with dominant inter-cell coupling, the broken phase supports near-unit-fidelity quantum state transfer, a level of performance that the corresponding Hermitian model fails to attain. Moreover, we establish a correspondence between the non-Hermitian and Hermitian descriptions by identifying related parameter regions in which the fidelity fails to surpass the classical bound."

    "abstract": "The widespread deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) devices requires intrusion detection systems (IDS) with high accuracy while operating under strict resource constraints. Conventional deep learning IDS are often too large and computationally intensive for edge deployment. We propose a lightweight IDS that combines SHAP-guided feature pruning with knowledge-distilled Kronecker networks. A high-capacity teacher model identifies the most relevant features through SHAP explanations, and a compressed student leverages Kronecker-structured layers to minimize parameters while preserving discriminative inputs. Knowledge distillation transfers softened decision boundaries from teacher to student, improving generalization under compression. Experiments on the TON\\_IoT dataset show that the student is nearly three orders of magnitude smaller than the teacher yet sustains macro-F1 above 0.986 with millisecond-level inference latency. The results demonstrate that explainability-driven pruning and structured compression can jointly enable scalable, low-latency, and energy-efficient IDS for heterogeneous IoT environments."

    "source": "arXiv",
    "abstract": "The geometric description of open quantum systems via the Quantum Geometric Tensor (QGT) traditionally relies on the assumption that the physical states form a differentiable vector bundle over the parameter manifold. This framework becomes ill-posed at spectral singularities, such as Exceptional Points, where the eigen-bundle admits no local trivialization due to dimension reduction. In this work, we resolve this obstruction by demonstrating that the family of Liouvillian superoperators $\\mathcal{L}(k)$ over a complex parameter manifold $X$ canonically defines a \\textbf{regular holonomic $\\mathcal{D}_X$-module} $\\mathcal{M}$. By identifying the physical coherence order with the Hodge filtration and the decay rate hierarchy with the \\textbf{Kashiwara filtration}, we show that the open quantum system underlies a \\textbf{Mixed Hodge Module (MHM)} structure in the sense of Saito. This identification allows us to apply the \\textbf{Grothendieck six-functor formalism} rigorously to dissipative dynamics. We prove that the divergence corresponds to a non-trivial cohomology class in $\\text{Ext}^1_{\\mathcal{D}_X}$, thereby regularizing the Quantum Geometric Tensor without ad-hoc cutoffs. Specifically, the ``singular component'' of the Complete QGT arises as the residue of the connection on the \\textbf{Brieskorn lattice} associated with the vanishing cycles functor."

    "abstract": "We present a combined experimental and theoretical study of nonlinear light-matter interactions in a three-dimensional gold-polymer hybrid metasurface. In contrast to conventional two-dimensional designs, which by symmetry may support either transverse electric (TE) or transverse magnetic (TM) polarization, our volumetric architecture accepts both TE and TM modes simultaneously, reflecting the dimensionality and versatility required by the photonic devices. The metasurface comprises a periodic lattice of gold nanostructures embedded in a dielectric polymer matrix, creating complex metal-dielectric interfaces that sustain tightly confined plasmonic resonances. When driven by ultrafast near-infrared pulses, these resonances concentrate optical energy at the nanoscale, enabling efficient third-harmonic generation and upconversion of visible light into the ultraviolet (UV) and deep-UV regimes with enhanced conversion efficiency. We perform spatial and temporal mapping of the nonlinear response under both TE and TM excitation. Our measurements reveal polarization-agnostic field enhancement and spectral tunability arising from the three-dimensional morphology-capabilities unattainable in planar metasurfaces, where two-dimensional symmetry inherently limits polarization flexibility and functional bandwidth. This 3D platform provides a flexible design toolbox for polarization-independent UV and deep-UV light sources. Potential applications include high-resolution UV spectroscopy, optical multiplexing, data storage, and emerging quantum photonic architectures. By establishing fundamental insights into three-dimensional nonlinear metasurface behavior, our work paves the way for next-generation reconfigurable, multi-polarization nanophotonic devices."

    "abstract": "Image generation based on diffusion models has demonstrated impressive capability, motivating exploration into diverse and specialized applications. Owing to the importance of emotion in advertising, emotion-oriented image generation has attracted increasing attention. However, current emotion-oriented methods suffer from an affective shortcut, where emotions are approximated to semantics. As evidenced by two decades of research, emotion is not equivalent to semantics. To this end, we propose Emotion-Director, a cross-modal collaboration framework consisting of two modules. First, we propose a cross-Modal Collaborative diffusion model, abbreviated as MC-Diffusion. MC-Diffusion integrates visual prompts with textual prompts for guidance, enabling the generation of emotion-oriented images beyond semantics. Further, we improve the DPO optimization by a negative visual prompt, enhancing the model's sensitivity to different emotions under the same semantics. Second, we propose MC-Agent, a cross-Modal Collaborative Agent system that rewrites textual prompts to express the intended emotions. To avoid template-like rewrites, MC-Agent employs multi-agents to simulate human subjectivity toward emotions, and adopts a chain-of-concept workflow that improves the visual expressiveness of the rewritten prompts. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the superiority of Emotion-Director in emotion-oriented image generation."

    "abstract": "Purpose: Conventional MRI is relying on the assumption of the magnetic field being homogeneous in direction and amplitude. However, with the growing interest in portable, affordable point-of-care MRI systems, these assumptions do not necessarily hold anymore due to compromises necessary to achieve a reduction in e.g. footprint, weight and portability. Simulation software may help by evaluating new encoding schemes which are optimized for non-ideal hardware but also with the design of new scanner designs. The goal of this work was to develop a MATLAB-based simulation software capable of dealing with deflected magnetic fields during signal simulation and reconstruction and enabling the evaluation of arbitrary magnetic field configurations for encoding in MRI. Methods: Conventional matrix-based Bloch simulation is limited in its applicability to arbitrary magnetic fields. We therefore adapted, evaluated, and validated a modified approach, achieving substantially shorter simulation time. Furthermore, it is used to predict image quality in 2D gradient echo experiments with deflected magnetic fields. Results: The comparison of numerical Bloch and matrix-based simulation revealed close agreement of both reconstructed images. Further, it was shown that compensation of the associated artifacts can be achieved by incorporating knowledge about the used magnetic fields into the reconstruction process. Conclusion: The presented and validated software package enables full consideration of angular inhomogeneities of magnetic vector fields used in MRI for signal simulation but also reconstruction removing the related artifacts. As such, the software might become a valuable tool for new low-field system designs and the investigation of new reconstruction algorithms."

For 1324, this graph is too large for direct computation, so we pass to a quotient graph with weighted edges. Conditional on a natural conjecture, this yields a lower bound of 10.418."

Deep learning based SLR models are commonly used but require extensive computational resources, making them unsuitable for deployment on edge devices. To address these limitations, we propose a lightweight SLR system that combines parallel bidirectional reservoir computing (PBRC) with MediaPipe. MediaPipe enables real-time hand tracking and precise extraction of hand joint coordinates, which serve as input features for the PBRC architecture. The proposed PBRC architecture consists of two echo state network (ESN) based bidirectional reservoir computing (BRC) modules arranged in parallel to capture temporal dependencies, thereby creating a rich feature representation for classification. We trained our PBRC-based SLR system on the Word-Level American Sign Language (WLASL) video dataset, achieving top-1, top-5, and top-10 accuracies of 60.85%, 85.86%, and 91.74%, respectively. Training time was significantly reduced to 18.67 seconds due to the intrinsic properties of reservoir computing, compared to over 55 minutes for deep learning based methods such as Bi-GRU. This approach offers a lightweight, cost-effective solution for real-time SLR on edge devices."

However, existing holographic tensor network models remain far from a complete theory of quantum gravity. A key obstacle is their discrete structure, which only approximates the semi-classical geometry of gravity in a qualitative sense. In \\cite{Lin:2024dho}, it was shown that a network of partial-entanglement-entropy (PEE) threads, which are bulk geodesics with a specific density distribution, generates a perfect tessellation of AdS space. Moreover, such PEE-network tessellations can be constructed for more general geometries using the Crofton formula. In this paper, we assign a quantum state to each vertex in the PEE network and develop two holographic tensor network models: the factorized PEE tensor network, which takes the form of a tensor product of EPR pairs, and the random PEE tensor network. In both models we reproduce the exact Ryu-Takayanagi formula by showing that the minimal number of cuts along a homologous surface in the network exactly computes the area of this surface."

To address these limitations, we propose JEPA-Reasoner, a novel JEPA model enhanced with generative ability that reasons in latent space. We augment it with a separate action-taker model, Talker, to produce human-readable sentences. Our approach demonstrates that decoupling latent space reasoning and token generation enables JEPA-Reasoner to produce mixed latent vectors that might lay the foundation for multi-threaded reasoning, while performing autoregressive generation with superior robustness to compounding error."

Inspired by human memory, we propose StoryMem, a paradigm that reformulates long-form video storytelling as iterative shot synthesis conditioned on explicit visual memory, transforming pre-trained single-shot video diffusion models into multi-shot storytellers. This is achieved by a novel Memory-to-Video (M2V) design, which maintains a compact and dynamically updated memory bank of keyframes from historical generated shots. The stored memory is then injected into single-shot video diffusion models via latent concatenation and negative RoPE shifts with only LoRA fine-tuning. A semantic keyframe selection strategy, together with aesthetic preference filtering, further ensures informative and stable memory throughout generation. Moreover, the proposed framework naturally accommodates smooth shot transitions and customized story generation applications. To facilitate evaluation, we introduce ST-Bench, a diverse benchmark for multi-shot video storytelling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that StoryMem achieves superior cross-shot consistency over previous methods while preserving high aesthetic quality and prompt adherence, marking a significant step toward coherent minute-long video storytelling."

The perspective of a non-ideal QRF deviates significantly from that of a more intuitive ideal frame with infinite resources: Firstly, systems described relative to the QRF appear superselected. Secondly, the structure of the QRF perspective attests that successive operations on a system relative to the QRF leads to back-reaction onto the QRF due to its non-ideality."

This assumption breaks down when parameters such as signal or coupling strengths are restricted to be non-negative and their values under the null hypothesis lie on the boundary of the parameter space. Based on a recent clarification concerning the correct asymptotic distribution of the likelihood ratio test statistic for cases where two of the parameters are on the boundary, we revisit the the question of significance estimation for two-peak signal-plus-background counting experiments. In the high-energy physics literature, such experiments are commonly analyzed using Wilks' chi-squared distribution or the one-parameter Chernoff limit. We demonstrate that these approaches can lead to strongly miscalibrated significances, and that the test statistic distribution is instead well described by a chi-squared mixture with weights determined by the Fisher information matrix. Our results highlight the need for boundary-aware asymptotics in the analysis of two-peak counting experiments."

    "abstract": "Image colorization is a fundamental task in computer vision that aims to predict the missing color channels from grayscale images. In recent years, fully automatic approaches based on deep learning have become the dominant paradigm. However, these methods often produce visually unnatural results, such as color bleeding or inconsistent colorization in homogeneous regions. On the other hand, user interactive methods, such as point interactive colorization, propagate colors based on user-provided hints and tend to produce more natural and spatially consistent results. Nevertheless, when no hints are provided, the generated images may suffer from low color saturation. In this study, we propose a novel fully automatic colorization framework that combines the strengths of both paradigms: a conventional fully automatic colorization model is used as a hint generator, and a conventional point interactive colorization model is employed as a hint propagator. By treating the interactive model as a propagator within an automatic pipeline, our method ensures that the inherent colorfulness in automatic models is preserved while achieving the spatial consistency characteristic of interactive methods. Importantly, the proposed framework is fully automatic, requires no manual input, and does not necessitate retraining, as it can directly leverage existing pretrained models. We evaluated the proposed method using various fully automatic colorization models and a representative point interactive model. The results demonstrate that our method effectively reduces color inconsistencies in continuous regions and improves visual realism."

    "abstract": "To address the challenges of detail loss, feature extraction difficulties, densely distributed small objects, and insufficient feature information in degraded remote sensing images, we introduce SWL-YOLO, a lightweight model built upon YOLOv11. SWL-YOLO incorporates Spatial Adaptive Feature Module (SAFM), Wavelet Downsampling (WDown), and a Large Selective Kernel (LSK) mechanism to adaptively enhance both spatial and contextual representations. Specifically, the SAFM improves sensitivity to fine-grained spatial features, thereby improving its ability to perceive small targets and edges. The wavelet downsampling module performs wavelet decomposition and subsampling, preserving high-frequency detail information while reducing computational complexity. The LSK mechanism dynamically adjusts receptive fields, enabling the model to better handle small objects, complex backgrounds, and multi-category targets through spatially adaptive feature enhancement and context-aware scale selection. While SAFM ensures enhanced local feature modulation, LSK complements it by providing global context awareness, together forming a synergistic spatial feature fusion mechanism. Furthermore, building upon the CIoU of YOLOv11, we develop an improved GeoCIoU loss, which employs a dual-penalty mechanism for loss calculation to achieve more accurate training feedback. Experiments on the VisDrone and NWPU VHR-10 datasets indicate that SWL-YOLO outperforms the baseline models, with mAP50 improvements of 5.1 % and 4.2 %, respectively, showcasing its superior performance in remote sensing target detection."

    "abstract": "Despite the progress in human–computer interaction technology, the interaction methods that visually impaired individuals possess are still rudimentary. The widely used Text-to-Speech technology has issues such as privacy leaks in practical applications, and most of the new interaction designs proposed in recent years have limited application scenarios. Geared toward enriching interaction methods for users with visual impairments, this article explores the potential for translating Braille into vibrotactile cues as a way of conveying universal information. We designed a set of schemes and implemented them based on the vibration motor of a mobile phone. These schemes convert a single Braille character into several highly distinguishable vibration combinations, thereby conveying any information that Braille can express. Experiments were conducted on both sighted and visually impaired participants to evaluate the accuracy and efficiency. With a brief learning period of just 10 minutes, individuals can attain an accuracy rate greater than 95%, and the accuracy degradation remains minimal when playback speeds increase. By employing vibration motors to deliver comprehensive information, this framework shows promise for application in a wider range of technological devices. "

Gathering such data is vital for enhancing telemedicine security through advanced techniques in colour medical imaging meddle detection and recovery. High-resolution images are collected from various clinical sources to enhance telemedicine security by improving tinker detection and salvage in colour medical imaging. This provides a complete demonstration of diverse scenarios. Normalizing pixel intensity levels reduces variability and boosts the efficiency of algorithms. The Gaussian-Adaptive Bilateral Filter (GABF) improves image quality by maintaining edges while lowering noise, which helps with precise tamper finding and salvage in colour medical imaging. The Adaptive Dynamic Inertia Weight and Acceleration Coefficient Optimization (ADIWACO) algorithm enhances telemedicine security by optimizing tamper detection, improving image recovery, refining feature extraction, and increasing accuracy in identifying unauthorized modifications in colour medical imaging.Findings show the hybrid approach (CNN + Recovery) outstrips others in recovery success (93%), regulatory compliance (100%), and user acceptance (90%) while maintaining fast processing times (2-3 seconds) and full healthcare regulation compliance. The prospects involve the creation of AI-based algorithms for immediate tamper detection, the advancement of encryption techniques, the incorporation of blockchain technology for secure data exchange, and the enhancement of recovery methods to guarantee strong and scalable security in telemedicine."

CG2H40010F, CGH40010F, and CGH35015F, produced by Wolfspeed with identical matching circuits, are measured under HPM-induced pulse injection at 3 GHz with the pulsewidth of 100 ns and a pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of 1kHz. At the threshold powers of 51, 52, and 56 dBm for CG2H40010F, CGH40010F, and CGH35015F, respectively, the peak temperature of three HEMTs is at the same level. Subsequently, the thermal-stress analysis for three HEMTs is investigated with different temperature distributions and various vulnerable regions. Moreover, the thermal accumulation effect is considered with an augment PRF to 5 MHz. Furthermore, electrical breakdown, especially at the rising edge is studied under single and multiple pulse injection. Eventually, crack areas across three GaN HEMTs are examined through experimental characterizations."

    "abstract": "As chiplet technologies such as 2.5D/3D rapidly advance, chiplet testing approaches are becoming increasingly challenging. Specifically, stacking multiple chips or high bandwidth memory (HBM) in a single package increases the I/O pin count, leading to longer test times and multi-site test performance degradation due to increased test complexity and resource constraints. In turn, this results in higher testing costs as additional time and equipment are required to maintain test efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel test interface integrating digital and analog compression modules to achieve high parallelism and precise fault detection. The proposed architecture incorporates a device under test (DUT) off masking sequence and a fault detection scheme, which enhances production efficiency while optimizing limited test resources by reusing analog test instruments that were not previously used in digital functional testing. This approach reduces overall test resource requirements and supports cost-effective parallel testing without additional equipment. Experimental results include an analysis of the architecture’s operational reliability under process variations and demonstrate a reduction in test resources and an average 82.2% decrease in test data volume on the ISCAS89 and OpenCores benchmarks compared to prior work."

However, compared to point-to-point ranging, it is more vulnerable to timestamp anomalies, since a single corrupted timestamp can influence multiple range estimates. In contrast to conventional distance-based approaches, this paper proposes a collaborative timestamp-based anomaly detection method that enhances security by sequentially identifying malicious nodes and spoofed timestamps. Furthermore, a timestamp-based maximum likelihood (ML) localization method with alternating optimization is proposed for robust localization and clock synchronization. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the robustness of network ranging."

    "abstract": "In complex urban environments, GNSS positioning systems are challenged by signal blockage, multipath propagation, and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) interference, which severely compromise positioning accuracy and robustness. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-source positioning fusion method that integrates Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), 5 G positioning reference signals (PRS), and 5 G angle-of-arrival (AOA) information. A hierarchical fusion model is constructed based on entropy regularization and elastic topology modeling, referred to as the ETP Fusion (Entropy-Topology aware Positioning Fusion) algorithm. During the fusion process, the algorithm comprehensively considers the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio of multi-source observations, historical error statistics, and environmental perception parameters. By leveraging information entropy and regularization, it models and constrains the uncertainty of observation sources. The elastic topology-aware mechanism is introduced to dynamically adjust the observation weights within the fusion structure, thereby enhancing system stability and accuracy in dynamic obstruction environments. In this study, multi-source error models and their covariance expressions were derived, and a unified observation framework was constructed. Extensive experiments were conducted on the real-world urban dataset UrbanNav-HK. The experimental results show that ETPFusion achieves significant improvements in root mean square error, standard deviation, and maximum error compared to traditional GNSS and three mainstream fusion algorithms."

    "abstract": "Data centers often deploy servers that exceed the capacity of the power infrastructure to increase power utilization, i.e., power over-subscription. To address potential power overloads, power capping mechanisms are implemented for protection. However, the power efficiency disparities among heterogeneous servers, along with the adjustment intervals required for power capping at the cluster level, pose challenges to capping decisions, especially for latency-sensitive applications with higher quality of service requirements. To tackle this challenge, we propose a prediction-based, power efficiency-aware dynamic power capping framework (PPE-DPC), comprising two stages. First, we design a lightweight online prediction to capture requests generated within the power adjustment time intervals. Then, leveraging prior knowledge of the power efficiency of heterogeneous servers, we design a greedy strategy to fine-tune the capping power for better capping decisions. Extensive simulations and conducted in Testbed using Alibaba traces demonstrate that PPE-DPC outperforms existing solutions, optimizing request latency, power utilization, and mitigating the negative impact of power adjustment intervals. Finally, we also explore the effect of prediction error on PPE-DPC and find that only 3x the true prediction error is weaker than the existing optimal capping algorithm."

Under the pure path loss channel gain model and the condition that the transmission power scales according to the communication distance, we fully characterize the optimal scaling law trade-off between throughput and sensing distance by proposing an achievable scheme and proving its converse. Our results can be interpreted as follows: by reducing the throughput by a factor of a function of <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</i>, the sensing range order improves according to the same function of <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</i>, raised to the power of the ratio between the path loss factors in communication and sensing. We prove that the same result also holds true for ISAC networks with random fading, despite the uncertainty on the connectivity and power level created by random fading. In addition, we show that the scaling law tradeoff cannot be improved by allowing the transmission power and communication distance to scale freely. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work formally formulating and characterizing the communication and sensing performance scaling law tradeoff of <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ad hoc</i> ISAC networks."

    "abstract": "Despite the widespread adoption of vision sensors in edge applications, such as surveillance, video transmission consumes substantial spectrum resources. Semantic communication (SC) offers a solution by extracting and compressing information at the semantic level, but traditional SC without sensing capabilities faces inefficiencies due to the repeated transmission of static frames in edge videos. To address this challenge, we propose an SC with computer vision sensing (SCCVS) framework for edge video transmission. The framework first introduces a compression ratio (CR) adaptive SC (CRSC) model, capable of adjusting CR based on whether the frames are static or dynamic, effectively conserving spectrum resources. Simultaneously, we present a knowledge distillation (KD)-based approach to ensure the efficient learning of the CRSC model. Additionally, we implement a computer vision (CV)-based sensing model (CVSM) scheme, which intelligently perceives the scene changes by detecting the movement of the sensing targets. Therefore, CVSM can assess the significance of each frame through in-context analysis and provide CR prompts to the CRSC model based on real-time sensing results. Moreover, both CRSC and CVSM are designed as lightweight models, ensuring compatibility with resource-constrained sensors commonly used in practical edge applications. Experimental results show that SCCVS improves transmission accuracy by approximately 70% and reduces transmission latency by about 89% compared with baselines. We also deploy this framework on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX Super, achieving an inference speed of 14 ms per frame with TensorRT acceleration and demonstrating its real-time capability and effectiveness in efficient semantic video transmission."

    "abstract": "Accurately online estimating the state of charge (SOC) of lithium-ion batteries is critical for the reliability, safe operation, and optimal performance of battery management systems. However, cross-domain battery capacity estimation is facing challenges like: limited adaptability to diverse degradation patterns across operating conditions, imbalanced convergence during model training, and the inability to provide real-time feedback on battery health. To tackle these problems, this paper introduces cosine similarity (CS) into the cross-domain prediction model UniTime, combining the strong generalization ability of large language models (LLM) with the online prediction advantages of Digital Twin (DT) technology. Specifically, we enhance cross-domain adaptability by introducing the CSUniTime model, which leverages domain instructions and a Language Transformer to achieve effective alignment between time-series data and textual modalities. To address convergence imbalance, we design a CS attention mechanism that efficiently extracts degradation features while maintaining lightweight complexity. Furthermore, a dynamic degradation simulator based on DT technology is developed to realize online estimation using only charging-phase data, thereby enabling real-time feedback of the battery’s health status. Extensive experiments on two public datasets show that DT-CSUniTime consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving the best mean squared error on 20 of 21 batteries and delivering superior accuracy and generalization."

This paper analyzes the current state of reserve capacity configuration methods and delves into the limitations of the traditional fixed-proportion method in addressing the strong fluctuations and uncertainties of net load. Targeting the multi-scale fluctuation characteristics of net load, a refined configuration method based on Empirical Mode Decomposition and Kernel Density Estimation is proposed. This paper details the key aspects of the method, including the multi-scale decomposition of the net load signal, the probabilistic modeling of prediction errors for each component, and the quantification of reserve demand. Through these steps, the paper demonstrates how a refined assessment of reserve requirements is achieved. Using actual net load data from a region in China, a case study validates the effectiveness and economic viability of the proposed method. The conclusions indicate that the proposed method shows good potential in effectively covering uncertainties and reducing reserve redundancy and deficiency. This approach helps to achieve a better balance between system security and economy and provides a more scientific basis for configuring reserve resources with different response characteristics, offering a new perspective on enhancing the operational efficiency and flexibility of the new power system in facing uncertainty challenges."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into intelligent enterprises to support critical services across healthcare, finance, and government domains. While their inference capabilities offer unprecedented utility, they also introduce significant privacy risks, as both user queries and model outputs are directly exposed during operation. Recent studies have demonstrated the vulnerability of LLMs to inference-time attacks, including Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) and Model Reconstruction Attacks (MRA), which can extract or reconstruct sensitive enterprise data. Although multiple defense mechanisms have been proposed, they often suffer from limited scope, high computational overhead, or reduced utility, making them unsuitable for enterprise-scale deployment. This survey provides a structured and comprehensive overview of privacy-preserving LLM inference. We first review the main threats in the inference stage and categorize existing defense mechanisms into input-level defenses, output-level defenses, and adaptive/feedback-based strategies. Each category is examined for its strengths, weaknesses, and applicability in real-world enterprise settings. We further analyze key research gaps, including the lack of dual-attack robustness, limited enterprise-grade evaluations, and the absence of standardized benchmarks. Building on these insights, we highlight open challenges and outline promising future directions. By consolidating the state of the art, this work serves as a reference for both academia and industry, guiding the development of secure, efficient, and compliant LLM deployment in intelligent enterprises."

    "abstract": "The traditional Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm frequently faces challenges related to convergence speed, a propensity for local optima entrapment, and restricted search efficiency in the context of complex combinatorial optimization problems. To address these challenges, several enhancement methods or Improved Ant Colony Optimization (IACO) have been formulated. This method incorporates adaptive pheromone update strategies, dynamic parameter adjustments, and the integration of ACO with other algorithms, including Genetic Algorithm (GA), Differential Evolution (DE), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Numerous studies have shown the efficacy of IACO across multiple real-world application domains, such as logistics scheduling, robot path planning, chlorophyll content estimation in agriculture, pipeline route design, and data collection in wireless sensor networks. The implementation of IACO has demonstrated substantial enhancements in accuracy, stability, and efficiency of solutions, while broadening its applicability to complex systems, including autonomous vehicles, avionics, adaptive teaching, and imbalanced data classification. IACO demonstrates significant potential as a basis for the development of advanced, intelligent, and adaptable metaheuristic approaches."

This article introduced the basic principles, latest research progress, and applications of microwave 3dB couplers, exploring their uses in communication systems, radar, and RFID fields. By analyzing new synthesis methods, broadband phase detectors, and LTCC microwave integrated circuits, the article demonstrates how these innovations enhance the performance and application range of couplers. Although significant progress has been made in miniaturization, broad-banding, and cost reduction of microwave 3dB couplers, challenges such as manufacturing complexity and high cost remain. Future research should focus on addressing these challenges to promote the application of microwave 3dB couplers in more scenarios."

A linearized disc surface and wire-frame cone structure improve impedance matching, reduce weight, and enhance deployment flexibility. Covering the 40–110 MHz range, simulations show S11 below –6 dB, omnidirectional H-plane radiation, and stable electric field intensity exceeding 200 V/m at 1 m under 2,500 W excitation, fully meeting RS103 standards. The proposed antenna offers a practical, high-performance alternative for space-constrained EMC test environments."

In this work, the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method is employed to solve the coupled electromagnetic and thermal fields, enabling an in-depth analysis of electromagnetic-thermal interactions. Specifically, the magneto-thermal coupling behavior of a radome modeled with the Debye dispersion model is studied.

    "abstract": "Traditional real estate markets are often dominated by institutional investors, which may limit access for small investors due to high entry costs and limited opportunities for fractional participation. Such market dynamics create slow, expensive, and inflexible transaction processes that limit liquidity and prevent broader participation in property ownership. To address these challenges, we propose a blockchain-based framework using fractional non-fungible tokens (F-NFTs) to digitally certify and manage shared real estate ownership. Our approach involves improvements to the ERC-721 token standard to support fractional ownership, development of smart contract algorithms for property registration and transfer, implementation of a prototype, and deployment on the Ethereum Sepolia testnet. The performance evaluation reveals that the complete certification process costs around $47.16 USD and can be completed in roughly 264 seconds, which reflects notable enhancements in transaction efficiency compared to traditional systems. By enabling costeffective and transparent property certification, this framework enhances transparency, democratizes property investment, and broadens market accessibility."

However, these models have been extensively trained using non-interactive, video-based datasets with predetermined camera trajectories, which do not necessarily provide task-specific data samples to achieve competent learning. One of the key questions for downstream task-aware data acquisition is: what motion planning strategy to use? In this work, we investigate how to achieve 3D image reprojection-driven autonomous path planning to further improve supervised and unsupervised depth completion model learning. Specifically, we (i) derive a method for robot navigation based on photometric reconstruction errors, as a proxy for visiting high depth uncertainty locations, and (ii) introduce a framework for integrating motion planning systems with depth completion models, along with a new benchmark. We evaluated 4 depth models, trained on data collected by our approach and by 8 existing navigation algorithms. Experiments spanning 861 training and 118 testing environments, derived from scanning a diverse set of residential, commercial, and civic spaces from the real-world, show that our approach outperforms conventional techniques on all 4 models by an average greater than 18%."

With the rapid advancement of technology, the classification of depression can now be conducted using data obtained from social media platforms.

This study reviews 38 research articles published between 2020 and April 2025 that explore the use of multimodal data for depression classification through social media. The review process involved systematically retrieving relevant studies from digital libraries followed by a structured selection and analysis process guided by predefined research questions. The findings show that Twitter is the most frequently used platform for data collection. Datasets were obtained through three main strategies, which include using benchmark datasets, modifying existing datasets, and collecting new data independently. For independently collected data, annotation methods included keyword-based labeling, human annotation, a combination of both, self-disclosure, and questionnaire-based labeling. Most studies employed a combination of textual data with other modalities in their multimodal approaches. Feature-level fusion or early fusion was the most commonly applied fusion technique. Regarding evaluation, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were the most widely used metrics."

Waste man- agement can be improved through the implementation of auto- mated sorting systems which separate organic materials from recyclables during the initial segregation stage. Such a system uses a classification model as its core component to analyze images of waste and trigger a mechanical sorter. For this purpose, we developed an image classification model that uses a Vision Transformer (ViT), which is a deep learning model with self- attention mechanisms. A Google-pretrained Vision Transformer model received fine-tuning through a specialized waste dataset before deployment. The PyTorch framework was used to deploy the model into a Flask web application which enables users to submit images for real-time classification results. The model shows excellent prediction capabilities through the evaluation of precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC metrics, which validates its suitability for real-world deployment. This study proves that Vision Transformers show immense potential for developing modern, environment-focused visual classification systems that can power automated sorting machinery."

This study analyzes the simultaneous influence of Creator Characteristics (CC), Content Characteristics (CTC), Environment (ENV), Audience Behavior (AB), Interactivity (INT), Engagement (ENG), and EWM on DCV. Data were collected from 533 active Indonesian social media users through an online survey (April–May 2025) and analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) with SmartPLS 4. Results show that EWM, CTC, and CC have the strongest effects, while AB, INT, ENG, and ENV also contribute significantly. These findings highlight that virality emerges from both internal content quality and external strategic amplification. The Superman or Iron Man metaphor is thus supported: viral success is shaped by the interplay of intrinsic resonance and engineered dissemination."

The top and bottom layers comprise identical radiating plates with dual exponentially tapered slot lines, while a T-junction power divider is placed in the middle layer to provide the same amplitude and phase currents for the dual slots. The coupling energy of the top and bottom layer is equal to reduce the transverse E-field, which lead to a low cross polarization. The simulated results show that the impedance bandwidth range of the antenna is 2-7.5 GHz with the voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) less than 1.5, the simulated peak gain of both probes is better than 11.4 dBi, and the cross-polarization ratio is less than -34 dB."

An MPDTC control method utilizes cost functions in its design for enhanced control performance and achieves smooth torque and flux generation alongside regular switching frequency operation. Real-time implementations in MATLAB Simulink become more efficient through the usage of Euler's forward approximation to simplify both flux and torque calculations. The proposed control technique i.e. MP-DTC, helps in the improvement in system stability while decrease in the electromagnetic interferences, optimisation of steady-state and as well as transient response."

To enhance text recognition accuracy, the Spatial Transformer Network (STN) is employed to perform spatial transformations on input images, effectively correcting irregularly shaped texts such as tilted and curved texts. Subsequently, the corrected images are fed into a CTC-based recognition model. To address the problems of increased model complexity and slower recognition speed resulting from the introduction of STN, the convolution layer feature extraction module in the CTC model is improved by utilizing ResNet_cnn for feature extraction, thereby enhancing both recognition speed and accuracy. Compared with models such as Convolution Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN), CRNN+CTC, and Transformer, the proposed CTC_STN model achieves improved industrial text recognition speed while maintaining recognition accuracy and parameter efficiency. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that the CTC_STN model exhibits higher accuracy compared to classical text recognition algorithms."

During the COVID-19 pandemic, digital transformation accelerated, particularly through the replacement of cash payments with contactless methods to reduce virus transmission. This also result in cyberattacks rise and often outpace protective measures. This paper investigates the level of cybersecurity awareness and practices among Saudi MSMEs using a behaviour-based survey. The survey is designed to assess cyber hygiene awareness and behaviour across five critical domains. The results show that awareness of cybersecurity measures does not always translate into consistent practice, particularly within MSMEs. Despite this vulnerability, MSMEs in Saudi Arabia remain understudied in terms of their cybersecurity awareness at the behavioural level. Hence, addressing this gap requires more than one-time training sessions or static guidelines. If Saudi Arabia intends to strengthen its digital security, particularly for MSMEs, it must focus on improving not just awareness but also actual day-to-day cybersecurity behaviours."

    "abstract": "Query rewriting, which aims to enhance query efficiency by modifying the structure of SQL queries without altering their results, stands as one of the pivotal research directions in the database domain. Traditional query rewriting approaches perform language-equivalent transformations based on manually predefined rewriting rules, thereby failing to fully harness the potential of Materialized Views (MVs) for query optimization. Furthermore, with the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), natural language interaction with LLMs can better unlock the potential of MVs in query rewriting. Nevertheless, the direct application of LLMs for query rewriting exhibits several limitations, including overreliance on predefined rules, inadequate accuracy in complex tasks, and insufficient utilization of MVs. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a prototype system called LLM-MVs, which leverages natural language processing with LLMs to generate and select MVs. To further enhance the reasoning capability of LLMs in recommending MVs, we introduce a MV management model that provides LLMs with more efficient MV options. Experimental findings demonstrate that our proposed approach substantially enhances query execution efficiency."

Heat generation during transmitter operation is an inherent phenomenon that negatively affects performance and often leads to significant degradation or safety hazards. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a thermal protection method. By integrating temperature sensors with a controller and implementing a temperature threshold detection mechanism, long-term thermal stability of the transmitter is achieved. Specifically, our research identifies a temperature observation point on the amplifier module that exhibits a linear coupling relationship with the amplifier tube's temperature. The controller continuously interacts in real-time with distributed temperature sensors via bus networks (such as SPI/I2C), processes the data using the thermal protection algorithm, and outputs a corresponding temperature feedback voltage to the power control board. This regulates the temperature of critical circuit modules within a safe operating range. In this way, the thermal protection measures utilizing the temperature detection and feedback algorithm solves the problem of overheating and shutdown of the transmitter, and greatly improves the reliability and stability of the transmitter."

To mitigate this challenge, this paper proposes a Conditional Semi-Supervised Adversarial Learning Framework (CSGAN) tailored specifically for haptic texture recognition tasks. In contrast to the existing Semi-supervised Generative Adversarial Network (SGAN), the proposed framework incorporates explicit class conditional information into the generation phase, thereby enhancing semantic consistency among samples generated within each categorical space. Furthermore, classification feedback derived from the generated samples is integrated into the optimization of the generator, empowering the discriminator to acquire enriched category-specific representations within the latent space through adversarial training. This mechanism significantly improves the discriminator's utilization efficiency of the generated data. Consequently, the adversarial learning framework facilitates the model in revealing a more comprehensive and structured latent distribution of texture categories, enhancing the model's generalization capabilities and recognition accuracy, particularly under conditions of limited labeled data. Additionally, a multi-head structure is introduced into the discriminator's architecture, effectively decoupling category prediction from the real/fake discrimination task, thereby mitigating task interference. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in comparison to existing advanced techniques."

To address this, a mainlobe interference suppression method based on maximum signal-to-noise ratio (MSNR) blind source separation with sum-and-difference four-channel processing is proposed. The MSNR blind source separation technique is applied to process the mixed signals received by the sum-and-difference four channels, enabling the separation of target signals and mainlobe interference signals. Subsequently, pulse compression and target signal detection are performed to obtain the target echo signals. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively extract target echo signals from the mixed signals containing target echoes and mainlobe interference, even at a jamming-to-noise ratio of 40dB, achieving effective anti-mainlobe jamming performance."

    "abstract": "Positioning technology plays a critical role in environmental perception and serves as the foundation for decision-making and motion control in autonomous vehicles. Existing positioning frameworks often face challenges such as limited accuracy, high costs, or poor adaptability to diverse environments. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Multi-Sensor Vehicle-Mounted Positioning (MVP) framework for autonomous driving, leveraging the complementary strengths of multiple sensors and advanced graph optimization techniques. The proposed MVP framework integrates data from inertial measurement units (IMUs), cameras, and global positioning systems (GPS) to achieve robust and precise positioning. Through nonlinear optimization, the system tightly integrates vision-based odometry with IMU data to enhance short-term motion estimation, even in challenging scenarios such as feature-sparse environments and abrupt maneuvers. Furthermore, the incorporation of a novel outlier rejection mechanism significantly boosts positioning accuracy and adaptability, ensuring robust performance in complex and dynamic conditions. To ensure global positioning consistency, the framework employs adaptive fusion of visual-inertial odometry and GPS data, enhanced by real-time kinematic processing, through global pose graph optimization. This approach effectively balances positioning accuracy and cost while enhancing the system’s adaptability to diverse operating environments. Experimental validation shows promising results with 0.7359m mean APE on KITTI dataset (79.60% improvement over ORB-SLAM) and 0.20m accuracy in real-world campus testing. Results demonstrate that the MVP framework outperforms existing approaches in terms of accuracy, stability, and cost-effectiveness, making it a promising solution for real-world autonomous driving applications such as campus shuttles, depot logistics, and low-speed urban operation domains."

While necessary conditions for optimality are easily obtained, their analytic solution may not be easy. But some problems are locally reducible to an Euclidean distance problem, but not necessarily globally due to the underlying topology. This insight leads to the additional realization that in some cases, optimality may require impulsive inputs. However, Dirac deltas cannot be compatible with nonlinear operations in Schwartz’s distribution theory. Thus, it seems that we may have a solution but not a theory. Since the solution is transparent in its geometric form, it suggests that another approach to generalized functions, as proposed by Colombeau, should be used. This is very valuable as it corroborates our earlier work. Generalizations are then sought for other problems reducible to Euclidean minimum distance problems, and even more general Riemannian spaces. We make some connections with the notion of persistence of behavior, where these results apply."

However, their practical application is hindered by high computational costs, as they require solving LP problems whose size grows quadratically with the number of pixels in the image. As a result, their actual effectiveness remains unclear. To address this issue, we propose an enhanced implementation of Hottopixx designed to reduce computational time and improve endmember extraction performance. We demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments. The results suggest that our implementation enables the application of Hottopixx for endmember extraction from real hyperspectral images and allows us to achieve reasonably high accuracy in estimating endmember signatures."

    "abstract": "Predictive models play a pivotal role in industrial control systems, particularly demonstrating extensive and significant applications in data processing and data mining. Currently, both the gated recurrent unit (GRU) and the Transformer play a crucial role in building predictive models. However, most of the research methods still face the problems of imperfect data processing and simple model construction. Regarding data processing, the lack of redundant feature removal inevitably complicates the model's learning process. In terms of model construction, existing methods simply combine the two without deeper exploration and combination. To address these challenges, we present TG-FCM, a new prediction model in this study. Specifically, this paper develops a feature selection method using AGglomerative NESting (AGNES) and fuzzy c-mean (FCM), and constructs a Transformer prediction framework with memory function with the help of GRU. In the feature selection stage, the data features are first clustered using AGNES to obtain clustering results, which are then used as initial cluster centers for FCM. This combination method effectively alleviates the problem of FCM's dependence on initial values. In the prediction framework part, GRU is utilized to have the ability of storing historical data to provide memory function for Transformer. The specific situation is to add GRU-based storage memory unit and extraction memory unit to the encoder and decoder of Transformer respectively, so as to store the memory in the encoding process and extract the memory in the decoding process, thus realizing the memory function of Transformer. The experimental analysis of TG-FCM and five comparative models on eight real datasets shows that TG-FCM has high prediction performance and better generalization ability."

However, the high computational cost of existing SA protocols is difficult to generalize to decentralized federated learning (DFL) with the large number of clients and fails to defend against model poisoning attacks launched by Byzantine adversaries. In this paper, we propose an efficient computational SA protocol compatible with DFL, referred to as PriDFL, and address the issue of Byzantine-robust aggregation. Specifically, we design an advanced secret-sharing protocol based on number-theoretic transformations to reduce the computational complexity from <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$O(n^{2})$</tex-math></inline-formula> to <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathcal {O}(n\\log n)$</tex-math></inline-formula> during data sharing. We employ a single-mask approach to provide lightweight gradient privacy protection for DFL. To mitigate the impact of poisoned gradients on model convergence, we develop a Byzantine resilience criterion grounded in model cross-updating. The proposed criterion efficiently detects poisoned gradients and non-independent identically distributed (non-IID) data with local computation. Security analysis shows that PriDFL satisfies the security requirements in an honest but curious setting. We evaluate PriDFL on typical datasets (e.g., MNIST and CIFAR-10) and the results show that PriDFL is computation-communication efficient and Byzantine resilient. In particular, PriDFL optimizes the computational efficiency by 6-10× compared to the well-utilized SA protocols while supporting Byzantine robustness."

    "abstract": "Detailed degradation information can help uncover the underlying mechanisms of system degradation and provide essential guidance for accurate prognostics. However, obtaining such information in practice is often costly and challenging, which has motivated the development of prognostics methods that integrate fault diagnosis. Most existing methods, however, primarily focus on degradation magnitude while neglecting trend information, and they also lack sufficient robustness to uncertainties. As a result, they often suffer from low prediction accuracy and limited prediction horizons. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a novel diagnosis-integrated prognostics framework in which the remaining useful life prediction task is formulated as an explicit parameter optimization problem. Specifically, the robustness of optimization algorithms contributes to reliable prediction accuracy even under imprecise prior knowledge and low-quality data, while the integration of degradation trend information enhances the ability to capture long-term dynamics, which in turn extends the prediction horizon. To better reflect realistic operating conditions, concurrent actuator and sensor faults are considered. The approach first extracts both magnitude and trend information via fault diagnosis, and then employs parameter optimization for RUL prediction. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulation studies of actuator and sensor degradation in a grain processing system."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in speech-driven facial animation have attracted significant interest across computer graphics, human–computer interaction systems, and immersive virtual reality applications. However, existing methods remain constrained by dependencies on specific reference videos or proprietary face mesh structures, limiting their applicability across diverse production pipelines and reducing compatibility with industry-standard animation workflows. To overcome these fundamental limitations in generalization and deployment flexibility, we propose Speech2Blend—an end-to-end hybrid convolutional-recurrent network that directly learns nonlinear speech-to-blendshape parameter mappings. This novel approach enables markerless speech-driven facial animation generation without restrictive inputs like video references or specialized facial rigs. Trained on the largest available digital human dataset (BEAT) and rigorously evaluated using three benchmark datasets with photorealistic visualization tools, Speech2Blend achieves state-of-the-art performance. It delivers superior audio-visual synchronization through learned temporal dynamics and reduces lip vertex error by 30% compared to existing baseline methods. These advances significantly lower production costs for virtual human speech animation while enabling cross-platform compatibility with common game engines and animation software."

    "abstract": "Microgrids (MGs) are continuously evolving with the advancement of distributed energy storage devices and renewable energy generation. However, limited bandwidth and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks are threatening the stable operation of MGs by impacting data availability. By characterizing DoS attacks with attack frequency and duration, this paper pays attention to the secondary voltage restoration issue of a discrete MG by utilizing proportional-integral observers (PIOs) and dynamic encoding-decoding mechanisms (DEDMs). First, a local PIO with a predefined forgetting coefficient in its accumulative term is employed to estimate the states of the discrete-time MG, thereby mitigating the impact of DoS attacks. Subsequently, a consensus-based secondary controller is developed for the addressed system, leveraging the feedback linearization and PIO. DEDMs are implemented in communication channels to ensure efficient and reliable data exchanges. By resorting to the Lyapunov stability theory, sufficient conditions for voltage restoration are derived, taking into account the average dwell time and the proportion of attack silence. Moreover, desired observer and controller gains are calculated by solving a couple of matrix inequalities. Finally, a series of simulations based on Simulink are conducted to verify the practicality of the proposed controller."

    "abstract": "We address the joint optimization of port selection and precoder design for a FAS to minimize power consumption under a minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraint. This formulation results in a challenging mixed-integer nonconvex problem. To solve it, we introduce a novel large language model (LLM)-based hyper-heuristic. Our approach leverages alternating optimization to decompose the problem into a convex precoder subproblem and a port selection subproblem. For the latter, we employ a genetic algorithm (GA) that is automatically enhanced by a dual-LLM architecture. This architecture uses one LLM to generate crossover operators and another to critique and refine them, eliminating manual tuning. Under the simulation conditions of 10 dB SINR, 10 users, and antenna sizes between 8×8 cm and 13×13 cm, the proposed LLM-enhanced GA outperforms the conventional GA by an average of 22.09%."

However, in real deployment, feature distribution changes may degrade the performance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models and lead to undesired behaviors. To counter for undetected model degradation, we propose ALERT; a method that can detect feature distribution changes and trigger model re-training that works well on two wireless network use cases: wireless fingerprinting and link anomaly detection. ALERT includes three components: representation learning, statistical testing and utility assessment. We rely on Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) for designing the representation learning component, on Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) and Population Stability Index (PSI) tests for designing the statistical testing and a new function for utility assessment. We show the superiority of the proposed method against ten standard drift detection methods available in the literature on two wireless network use cases."

    "abstract": "For fully automated heavy-duty truck platoons, the uncertain behavior of surrounding traffic participants makes platooning control and stability extremely complex. This may lead to a deterioration in fuel efficiency and could even result in collisions. To mitigate the impact of traffic participants’ uncertainty and enhance fuel economy, this paper proposes an energy-efficient speed planning method for automated truck platoons considering uncertainty-aware trajectory prediction. In trajectory prediction uncertainty modeling, perceptual uncertainty is incorporated into the loss function of the prediction module to reduce overconfidence in long-horizon predictions. To generate accurate long-horizon platoon speed trajectories that better align with vehicle dynamic characteristics, vehicle response delays are identified and and integrated into the planning process. With varying levels of prediction uncertainty and response delays, the platoon speed planning method adapts more safely and proactively to multi-vehicle interaction scenarios. Experimental results from two representative traffic flow conditions demonstrate that the proposed method effectively enhances both safety and energy efficiency in complex traffic conditions, particularly in cut-in events."

    "abstract": "Federated learning is an emerging machine learning paradigm that effectively alleviates the data silo problem by distributing the model training process to multiple data holders. However, data from real-world mobile applications often has multi-label and presents a long-tailed distribution, where labels are generally non-independent and non-identically distributed, thereby increasing the challenges caused by data heterogeneity. To address the above problems, we propose a Federated Chain Context Optimization (FedCCO) for long-tailed multi-label image classification. Inspired by the success of Chain of Though (CoT) in enhancing the semantic expressive ability of models, this method fine-tunes the CLIP model using semantic descriptive vectors generated by the Chain Context Optimization (ChCoOp) to establish semantic correlations between head and tail classes across clients, which improves the ability of the model to recognize tail classes. The experimental results show that the FedCCO achieves satisfactory performance in long-tailed multi-label image classification in federated learning on VOC-LT and COCO-LT datasets."

This research utilises autoencoder and support vector machine (SVM) techniques to develop a coffee bean quality classification model with four categories: ripe, unripe, non-coffee, and damaged beans. Additionally, this study aims to evaluate the model's performance using F1 score metrics, confusion matrix analysis, and k-fold cross-validation. A total of 1,000 image samples were used and evenly distributed into four classes. This was then further divided into a training subset of 70%, a validation subset of 20%, and a testing subset of 10%. The proposed model achieved a classification accuracy of 96%, demonstrating a high level of reliability. Additionally, the weighted average F1 score of 0.961 indicates a strong balance between precision and recall values across all classes. VAE + SVM outperformed the baseline CNN in classifying coffee bean quality, increasing accuracy by 3% from 93% to 96%. These results confirm the model's ability to effectively predict coffee bean quality and highlight its potential as a robust solution for automating the sorting process in real-world coffee."

The method first treats the cable in electronic information systems as an antenna for simulation to obtain its input impedance, radiation pattern, and other data. Subsequently, the waveform of the induced voltage, generated by high-power microwave irradiation on the cable and then transmitted to the cable-connected load, is calculated by using the reciprocity method. The advantage of this method is that when considering High-power microwave under different incident conditions, it can rapidly solve for the peak induced voltage on the cable load without requiring new full-wave simulations."

It does not require a net connection, which will make this product very applicable for those areas with limited internet access. First, an initial 10-cycle laboratory test intended to simulate a three-times-a-day medication regimen was conducted, followed by a prolonged 30-cycle stress test under the same conditions. A cycle would be considered successful if pills are released at the scheduled time without mechanical jams or servo malfunction. Tests performed did show that the system repeatedly dispensed pills at defined time intervals, with an average timing deviation of +1.75 seconds and a maximum deviation of +2 seconds, achieving an overall success rate of 80%—well within clinically permissible limits for non-critical medication."

Previous studies predominantly concentrate on the impact of IT agility drivers, specifically regarding IT flexibility, IT capability, and IT governance, on the facilitation of digital transformation, neglecting the correlation with AI-driven adoption. The research seeks to examine how AI-driven adoption mediates the influence of IT agility factors on enabling smooth digital transformation in MSMEs. The research methodology utilizes a convergent triangulation approach with an explanatory design supported by subsequent clarification. The research population consists of MSME companies that have been in existence for more than five years. Questionnaires were disseminated to 305 participants online through random sampling methods, yielding 262 responses, resulting in a return rate of 85.90%. Data processing utilizing the Likert scale and analytical tools employing SEM-PLS. The findings indicated that IT flexibility does not affect AI-driven adoption, and in this context, enhancing IT flexibility may impede AI-driven adoption. Furthermore, IT governance and IT flexibility do not significantly contribute to enabling a smooth and efficient digital transformation."

    "abstract": "Snoring is a common symptom of sleep apnea syndrome and can be alleviated by adjusting the posture of the head during sleep. This is the design principle behind existing Smart Anti-snoring Pillows (SAPs). The majority of SAPs modify head posture by adopting air pumps or mechanical structures to adjust the height, angle, or hardness of the pillow, thereby inducing a change in position. However, they possess certain imperfections including noise, comfort, cost or effect. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to SAP design, which considers the alteration of head pose as a two-degree-of-freedom rotation problem. We utilize a disc generated by a specialized algorithm to dynamically adjust the slope of the contact surface between the pillow and the user, thereby simulating the natural rotation of the head. Additionally, we modify the support height at the back of the head to achieve the flat or reclined position. Our solution mitigates noise and cost, enhances comfort and effect, and offers a novel concept for advancing the development of sleep-care robots, while also improving the method of altering head posture employed by existing pillows. This paper presents our design concept, theoretical foundation, algorithmic details, and experimental findings."

As the use of electric vehicles (EVs) increases, optimizing motor efficiency and battery health becomes crucial for both performance and sustainability.

The deformable convolution enables the model to adaptively focus on critical time points and variable dimensions, while the attention mechanism strengthens the capture of long-range dependencies. Experiments conducted on a real-world dataset collected from a steel plant show that Focus-TimesNet significantly outperforms the original TimesNet and its variants, achieving improvements in Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and AUC.

    "abstract": "Intelligent unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is crucial in applications such as port monitoring and water rescue. However, fog significantly reduces the perceptual capability of UAV in common water scenarios. Existing methods primarily address the limitations of visual perception by training on paired foggy data. Nevertheless, it is difficult to obtain highquality real-world paired UAV foggy datasets. Furthermore, existing fog generation methods synthesize fog frame by frame, leading to flicker that degrades the performance of defogging methods for UAVs. Additionally, existing metrics for evaluating fog authenticity are insufficient and overlook foggy video generation. To address these issues, this work proposes a novel deflicker-awared foggy video generation framework that reduces flicker in fog generation by leveraging temporal context information. Specifically, an innovative inter-frame depth-map deflicker is designed to refine distance information within sequences. A new long-term light consistency is introduced to achieve time-invariant atmospheric light values. A new benchmark comprising 84 high-quality video sequences with diverse scenes and challenging conditions captured by the UAV is established to address the scarcity of high-quality paired foggy sequence data in water scenes. A new evaluation metric is also presented to assess the authenticity of synthetic fog data. Extensive experiments and visual comparisons with real fog demonstrate the feasibility of our method. The code and demo video are available at https://github.com/vision4robotics/DFVG."

However, AI's reliance on large amounts of labeled data and expert annotations limits its scalability. This paper explores the use of eye movement data from non-professionals to improve segmentation accuracy. A novel gaze-enhanced image segmentation model (GISM) is proposed, consisting of two main components: a transformer-based gaze feature extraction block (TGFB) and a multi-head gazeattention block (MHGB). The MHGB fuses gaze and image data by using gaze features as queries within a transformer framework. The colon polyp dataset, is applied to assess the model's performance. The outcomes reveal that 1) gaze data from non-professionals enhances segmentation accuracy, 2) TGFB outperforms other methods in fusing gaze information, and 3) TGFB is highly adaptable to encoder/decoder-based segmentation frameworks."

    "abstract": "Electric vehicles (EVs) have emerged as a sustainable alternative to internal combustion (IC) engine vehicles, especially for urban use. One of the effective strategies for improving energy efficiency is regenerative braking, which allows kinetic energy to be recovered during deceleration and fed back into the battery. However, the extent to which regenerative braking benefits EV performance varies depending on driving conditions, motor control, and battery characteristics. This study presents a simulation-based analysis comparing regenerative and non-regenerative braking modes in an electric vehicle driven by a Permanent Magnet DC (PMDC) motor, using MATLAB/Simulink. The vehicle model is tested under a composite 1180-second Indian drive cycle, combining repeated Indian Urban Driving Cycle (IUDC) segments with an extra-urban phase to reflect typical stop-go and mid-speed driving patterns seen in Indian cities. The simulation incorporated two common battery chemistries, lithium-ion (Li-ion) and lead-acid. The primary objective was to investigate how braking mode affects state of charge (SOC), voltage, and responsiveness of current. Results indicate that regenerative braking significantly reduces SOC drop and enhances energy utilization, especially in high-braking-frequency segments of the drive cycle."

Floodwater often has very low visibility, which significantly affects the quality of images captured by the far-UAV range. This issue makes it challenging to notice where objects blend in due to their small size, busy backgrounds, poor lighting, and reflections in the water. This study focuses on aerial drone images, utilizing a robust image preprocessing pipeline to enhance the visuals before passing them to YOLOv8n for object detection and recognition. The model achieves 80% precision, 82% recall, and an mAP@50 of 81%. The 4,528 annotated images comprised survivors and cars that were either entirely visible, partially visible, or completely absent. The outcomes suggest that the system detects circumstances instantly and adapts to the environment, making it suitable for use where needed with minimal alteration."

An adaptive Genetic Algorithm (GA) is employed to optimize measurement point locations, thereby reducing the condition number of the coefficient matrix and mitigating the ill-posed nature of the electric field inversion problem. Simulations using PROGRAMMING SOFTWARE and Finite Element Simulation on a 72.25kV three-phase Alternating Current (AC) model demonstrate that this method accurately inverts voltage magnitude and phase even with 10% measurement error, providing support for non-contact voltage measurement in complex three-dimensional field environments."

    "abstract": "Silent Speech Recognition (SSR) technologies utilize assistive devices to facilitate specific human-computer interaction by decoding speech from non-acoustic biosignals generated during speech production. Current Ultrasound Tongue Images (UTIs)- based SSR technologies fail to address the domain-shift problem that arises from sensor displacement artifacts, articulatory patterns, and speaker deviations. Moreover, existing solutions seldom utilize cross-modal knowledge to enhance uni-modal generalization. This paper proposes a novel Domain Generalization (DG) method to learn domain-invariant representations from synchronized audio and lip video encoding, named the Cross-Modal Meta-Generalization (CMMG) framework. We proposed a multi-modal co-learning pipeline to randomly combine the tri-modal streams into a modality-agnostic feature space, constructing expanded domain-shift episodes from multi-modal source domains. Moreover, we designed several meta-tasks that involve classifying various speech attributes (e.g., tongue height) to implement cross-modal semantic regularization. Subsequently, the model is trained episodically, with each task or episode simulating a domain shift to seek optimal generalization in unseen uni-modal domains. Experimental results across various cross-domain sets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms both uni-modal baselines and existing domain-shift solutions. Additionally, we explore the coupling information of multi-modal heterogeneous features through both segmental and sub-segmental level meta-tasks, finding that the proposed CMMG effectively enhances the generalization and discriminative capability of uni-modal representations."

    "abstract": "The ability of innovation ecosystems to deliver desired economic output, particularly under conditions of uncertainty shaped by market shifts, competitive change, and regulatory pressure, concerns all ecosystem stakeholders. Understanding innovation ecosystem performance therefore emerges as an important topic for scholars, managers, and policymakers. The objective of this paper is to propose a conceptual framework of ecosystem performance that builds on the inherent connection between system-level outcomes and the performance of all components that constitute the ecosystem. To this end, we apply a socio-technical lens to identify performance-deficient social or technical components known as ‘reverse salients’ that influence the performance of the ecosystem as a whole. Our case study of a regional Australian food innovation ecosystem identifies numerous reverse salients that inhibit ecosystem performance as the system transitions from its current focus on high-quality produce to a future state characterized by increased output capacity and value-added offerings. We categorize these reverse salients as those associated with ‘actors’ in the ecosystem, ‘connections’ between actors, and ‘resources’ flowing among them. While these categories align with the ecosystem-as-structure perspective, our findings additionally underscore the moderating role of ecosystem ‘leadership’ and ‘rules of engagement’ that can themselves act as reverse salients when misaligned. We present a conceptual model that integrates these insights and offer a set of propositions to guide future empirical research."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes FAS-LLM, a novel large language model (LLM)–based architecture for predicting future channel states in Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS)-enabled satellite downlinks equipped with fluid antenna systems (FAS). The proposed method introduces a two-stage channel compression strategy combining reference-port selection and separable principal component analysis (PCA) to extract compact, delay–Doppler–aware representations from highdimensional OTFS channels. These representations are then embedded into a Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA)-adapted LLM, enabling efficient time-series forecasting of channel coefficients. Performance evaluations demonstrate that FAS-LLM outperforms classical baselines including GRU, LSTM, and Transformer models, achieving up to 10 dB normalized mean squared error (NMSE) improvement and up to threefold root mean squared error (RMSE) reduction across prediction horizons. Furthermore, the predicted channels preserve key physical-layer characteristics, enabling near-optimal performance in ergodic capacity, spectral efficiency, and outage probability across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). These results highlight the potential of LLM-based forecasting for delay-sensitive and energy-efficient link adaptation in future satellite IoT networks."

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has been increasingly adopted by firms for different organizational purposes. While such AI adoption is expected to affect firm performance, it may also have different effects on firms' stakeholders such as employees, shareholders, and customers. To provide a more comprehensive understanding of the stakeholder implications of AI adoption, we conduct a systematic review of 84 relevant papers published in business journals in the past 8 years (2017-2024). Our review suggests that firms' AI adoption does have different, sometimes conflicting, effects on different stakeholder groups. We also uncover several limitations of the extant literature and develop an integrative AIMS (AI Impacts Multiple Stakeholders) framework that summarizes important directions for future research. Our AIMS framework emphasizes the need to consider underexplored stakeholder groups such as suppliers and competitors, as well as the trade-offs and dynamics among different stakeholder groups induced by AI adoption. Our framework also encourages future research to move beyond examining the direct impact of AI adoption on stakeholders by investigating when (contextual factors) and why (underlying mechanisms) AI adoption affects stakeholders, thereby advancing the literature on AI-stakeholder relationships. Finally, we discuss the implications for future operations management research, encouraging scholars to adopt a supply chain perspective to study the stakeholder implications of firms' AI adoption."

    "abstract": "Computed tomography (CT) is extensively used for accurate visualization and segmentation of organs and lesions. While deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) have significantly improved CT image analysis, their performance often declines when applied to diverse, real-world clinical data. Although foundation models offer a broader and more adaptable solution, their potential is limited due to the challenge of obtaining large-scale, voxel-level annotations for medical images. In response to these challenges, prompting-based models using visual or text prompts have emerged. Visual-prompting methods, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), still require significant manual input and can introduce ambiguity when applied to clinical scenarios. Instead, foundation models that use text prompts offer a more versatile and clinically relevant approach. Notably, current text-prompt models, such as the CLIP-Driven Universal Model, are limited to text prompts already encountered during training and struggle to process the complex and diverse scenarios of real-world clinical applications. Instead of fine-tuning models trained from natural imaging, we propose OpenVocabCT, a vision-language model pretrained on large-scale 3D CT images for universal text-driven segmentation. Using the large-scale CT-RATE dataset, we decompose the diagnostic reports into fine-grained, organ-level descriptions using large language models for multi-granular contrastive learning. We evaluate our OpenVocabCT on downstream segmentation tasks across 14 public datasets and 1 institutional dataset for organ and tumor segmentation, demonstrating the superior performance of our model compared to existing methods. All code, datasets, and models will be publicly released at https://github.com/ricklisz/OpenVocabCT."

    "abstract": "Low-altitude wireless networks are increasingly vital for the low-altitude economy, enabling wireless coverage in high-mobility and hard-to-reach environments. However, providing reliable connectivity to sparsely distributed aerial users in dynamic three-dimensional (3D) spaces remains a significant challenge. This paper investigates downlink coverage enhancement in vertical heterogeneous networks (VHetNets) beyond 5G, where unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operate as emerging aerial base stations (ABSs) alongside legacy terrestrial base stations (TBSs). To improve coverage performance, we propose a coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmission framework that enables joint transmission from ABSs and TBSs. This approach mitigates the limitations of non-uniform user distributions and enhances reliability for sparse aerial users.

    "abstract": "In continuous casting and rolling (CCR) systems, precise billet cutting is critical for ensuring product dimensional accuracy and minimizing material waste. However, conventional rule-based cutting strategies rely on static parameters and heuristic rules, which often fail to adapt to real-time disturbances such as thermal expansion, cross-sectional fluctuations, and trimming losses. These limitations frequently lead to suboptimal control performance and excessive residual lengths. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL), with its dynamic decision-making and self-adaptive capabilities, offers a promising alternative. This study proposes an intelligent billet cutting strategy based on the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, integrating process disturbances, thermodynamic characteristics, and physical constraints into a unified control framework. Extensive evaluations conducted in a high-fidelity CCR simulation environment demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms both traditional approaches and existing RL-based methods in terms of control accuracy, generalization ability, and robustness to disturbances, highlighting its practical potential in intelligent steel manufacturing systems."

    "abstract": "Multifractal analysis (MFA) provides a framework for the global characterization of image textures by describing the spatial fluctuations of their local regularity based on the multifractal spectrum. Several works have shown the interest of using MFA for the description of homogeneous textures in images. Nevertheless, natural images can be composed of several textures and, in turn, multifractal properties associated with those textures. This paper introduces an unsupervised Bayesian multifractal segmentation method to model and segment multifractal textures by jointly estimating the multifractal parameters and labels on images, at the pixel-level. For this, a computationally and statistically efficient multifractal parameter estimation model for wavelet leaders is firstly developed, defining different multifractality parameters for different regions of an image. Then, a multiscale Potts Markov random field is introduced as a prior to model the inherent spatial and scale correlations (referred to as cross-scale correlations) between the labels of the wavelet leaders. A Gibbs sampling methodology is finally used to draw samples from the posterior distribution of the unknown model parameters. Numerical experiments are conducted on synthetic multifractal images to evaluate the performance of the proposed segmentation approach. The proposed method achieves superior performance compared to traditional unsupervised segmentation techniques as well as modern deep learning-based approaches, showing its effectiveness for multifractal image segmentation."

    "abstract": "The fidelity and utility of synthetic network traffic are critically compromised by architectural mismatch across heterogeneous network datasets and prevalent scalability failure. This study addresses this challenge by establishing an Architectural Selection Framework that empirically quantifies how data structure compatibility dictates the optimal fidelity-utility trade-off. We systematically evaluate twelve generative architectures (both non-AI and AI) across two distinct data structure types: categorical-heavy NSL-KDD and continuous-flow-heavy CIC-IDS2017. Fidelity is rigorously assessed through three structural metrics (Data Structure, Correlation, and Probability Distribution Difference) to confirm structural realism before evaluating downstream utility. Our results, confirmed over twenty independent runs (N = 20), demonstrate that GAN-based models (CTGAN, CopulaGAN) exhibit superior architectural robustness, consistently achieving the optimal balance of statistical fidelity and practical utility. Conversely, the framework exposes critical failure modes, i.e., statistical methods compromise structural fidelity for utility (Compromised fidelity), and modern iterative architectures, such as Diffusion Models, face prohibitive computational barriers, rendering them impractical for large-scale security deployment. This contribution provides security practitioners with an evidence-based guide for mitigating architectural failures, thereby setting a benchmark for reliable and scalable synthetic data deployment in adaptive security solutions."

    "abstract": "Molecular Communication (MC) is an emerging field of research focused on understanding how cells in the human body communicate and exploring potential medical applications. In theoretical analysis, the goal is to investigate cellular communication mechanisms and develop nanomachine-assisted therapies to combat diseases. Since cells transmit information by releasing molecules at varying intensities, this process is commonly modeled using Poisson channels. In our study, we consider a discrete-time Poisson channel (DTPC). MC is often event-driven, making traditional Shannon communication an unsuitable performance metric. Instead, we adopt the identification framework introduced by Ahlswede and Dueck. In this approach, the receiver is only concerned with detecting whether a specific message of interest has been transmitted. Unlike Shannon transmission codes, the size of identification (ID) codes for a discrete memoryless channel (DMC) increases doubly exponentially with blocklength when using randomized encoding. This remarkable property makes the ID paradigm significantly more efficient than classical Shannon transmission in terms of energy consumption and hardware requirements. Another critical aspect of MC, influenced by the concept of the Internet of Bio-NanoThings, is security. In-body communication must be protected against potential eavesdroppers. To address this, we first analyze the DTPC for randomized identification (RI) and then extend our study to secure randomized identification (SRI). We derive capacity formulas for both RI and SRI, providing a comprehensive understanding of their performance and security implications."

    "abstract": "Accurate estimation of State-of-Charge (SOC) and State-of-Health (SOH) is critical for the safe and reliable operation of Electric Vehicle (EV) batteries. However, centralized approaches face challenges such as data privacy, communication overhead, and poor scalability under non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. Although some methods attempt joint estimation, most rely on centralized learning, lack computational efficiency for embedded systems, and overlook uncertainty quantification, limiting real-world applicability. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a federated framework for joint SOC and SOH estimation that is privacy-preserving, lightweight, and uncertainty-aware. The core model is a Temporal-Degradation-Aware Informer (TDA-Informer), which incorporates an Informer-Lite encoder and a multi-task prediction structure. A Battery-Focused Multi-Feature Attention (BFMFA) module emphasizes critical inputs such as voltage, current, and temperature. The Stochastic Controlled Averaging for Federated Learning (SCAFFOLD) algorithm is employed to mitigate client drift under non-IID conditions, enhancing convergence across distributed EV clients. Uncertainty Quantification is achieved via Monte Carlo Dropout to provide confidence intervals for SOC and SOH predictions. The framework is trained and validated on the NASA battery dataset and tested for generalization on the unseen Oxford dataset, with realistic sensor noise added to simulate practical conditions. Extensive experiments, including ablation studies and comparisons with baseline models, confirm its superior accuracy, robustness, and scalability. While physical deployment remains future work, the results confirm the framework’s potential for intelligent, scalable Battery Management Systems (BMS)."

The transmission of underwater acoustic data requires a large amount of spectrum resources. Aiming at the problems of improving the utilization rate and security of spectrum resources, an underwater acoustic spectrum sensing algorithm based on personalized federated learning (PFL) and RepViG is proposed. A security protection framework is established for underwater acoustic data based on PFL. The common features of each underwater acoustic data are extracted through the meta-model. Each client only needs to fine-tune the parameters of the meta-model based on the local underwater acoustic data to achieve a personalized model. Based on the improved RepViT and the improved ViG, a dual-branch sensing model of RepViG is designed. In the improved RepViT, we employ the Haar wavelet downsampling (HWD) module to retain the low-frequency and high-frequency detail features of the underwater acoustic signal through multi-resolution. And we employ Interactive Convolution Block (ICB) to capture the relationship between local features and global features through multi-scale dynamic convolution kernels. In the improved ViG, we adopt the lightweight Star-Blcok module to reduce feature redundancy and enhance sensing efficiency. Compared with other algorithms, the simulation results show that the detection probability is increased by 7.6%, and the false alarm probability is reduced by 7.5%."

Introduction of decoupling capacitor enables charging decoupling between high voltage battery (HVB) and low voltage battery (LVB), thereby simplifying multi-port energy management. Furthermore, minimum current ratio is employed to determine optimal phase shift, achieving minimized conduction losses during HVB charging while maintaining zero voltage switching (ZVS) for all switches. Comprehensive analysis of proposed converter is conducted, covering operational principles, steady-state performance, soft switching characteristics, efficiency and loss breakdown, along with control methodology. Experimental prototype rated at 500W for OBC and 300W for APM is implemented to validate converter performance. Experimental results demonstrate peak system efficiency of 95.3% during simultaneous HVB and LVB charging, and 93.16% during LVB charging alone, confirming effectiveness of proposed converter."

    "abstract": "The ongoing transition to sustainable and resilient energy systems has led to the increasing adoption of microgrids, which integrate diverse energy resources to enhance local energy management. However, existing approaches often overlook the complex interplay between these diverse energy resources. Addressing these limitations, this work proposes a comprehensive microgrid optimization framework that simultaneously coordinates the operation of combined cooling and heating power (CCHP) systems, large-scale building prosumers, and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) within a unified strategy. The proposed approach jointly minimizes microgrid operation cost, flattens the electrical load profile at the substation level, and ensures net-zero energy exchange with the main grid. Moreover, the optimization of the CCHP system is achieved while explicitly limiting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, contributing to environmental sustainability—an increasingly critical goal in the context of decarbonization. Additionally, the proposed optimization framework incorporates a wide range of technical and operational constraints including building thermal comfort at thermal zone level, energy storage and charging power limitations of PEVs and voltage drop throughout the distribution network. Furthermore, aggregation is applied to the PEVs hosted by the microgrid and smart thermal power dispatch techniques are developed and hierarchically applied at building and thermal zone levels, achieving improved computational efficiency and scalability. Extensive simulations were performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

    "abstract": "The rapid evolution of digital technologies has led to the widespread adoption of digital health services, including telemedicine, e-health, and m-health. However, the sustainability of these services relies heavily on users' intention to continue using them over time-known as Continuance Use Intention (CUI). This study aims to systematically review the application of the Expectation Confirmation Model (ECM) in analyzing CUI within digital health contexts. Using a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) approach, 17 peer-reviewed studies published between 2019 and 2024 were examined. The review identifies key factors influencing CUI, including confirmation of initial expectations, perceived usefulness, and user satisfaction. Findings reveal that ECM is the most widely used theoretical framework to explain continuance behavior in digital health, often extended with models such as TAM, UTAUT, and trustbased theories to provide a more holistic analysis. Future research is encouraged to further explore contextual factors such as digital literacy, trust in technology, and types of health conditions, which may moderate the relationships among ECM variables, including self-efficacy and service quality. The results of this review offer both theoretical and practical implications for enhancing the sustainability of digital health platforms."

    "abstract": "Higher education institutions (HEIs) face increasing scrutiny to document how their curricula advance the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Existing semantic matching approaches successfully label about 75 percent of courses but leave persistent unlabelled units and provide no guidance for remediation. This study addresses the critical diagnostic gap in SDG curricular alignment by introducing a novel large language model-based (LLM-based) framework that transforms unmatched courses into actionable sustainability insights. Leveraging GPT-4, the proposed diagnostic framework identifies reasons for misalignment, offers targeted revision recommendations, and suggests actionable SDG mappings for each course. It integrates a dynamic, evolving codebook that systematically categorises the reasons for SDG misalignment and informs strategic curriculum development. Analysing 749 unlabelled courses from an Australian university, the framework reduced the unlabelled courses to under two percent and identified disciplinary blind spots, particularly in engineering and business. In addition, the study found that nearly half of the courses lacked explicit societal or environmental dimensions, while many others were too general for effective alignment. Furthermore, the framework recommended SDG matches, revealing substantial latent alignment potential. The framework not only improves explainable AI in education by producing transparent, audit-ready outputs, but also enables school-level dashboards for targeted SDG forecasting. The proposed framework operates in a fully automated workflow with an optional expert validation step to support audit-readiness, and is designed for institutional scalability and potential cross-institutional adoption."

To ensure broad frequency range and polarization stability in C-band—both required for transmission of telemetry data—the structure incorporates a probe-coupled feed and slots within the radiating patch. The relative bandwidth of optimized topology is 29.8% (i.e., from 4.85 GHz to 6.55 GHz). The proposed array adopts a 4 × 4 layout with rotational feeding which ensures high directivity and low cross-polarization. Simulation results demonstrate that the structure offers a wide beam steering of ±60° with a stable axial ratio maintained below the 3 dB level. Owing to compact, planar architecture, broadband circular polarization, and flexible scanning ranges the proposed topology is well-suited for supporting multi-angle dynamic communication scenarios imposed by modern telemetry systems."

    "abstract": "With the development of distributed generation system, the system equivalent impedance fluctuates over a wide range, leading to significant changes in grid strength. The interactive coupling between the phase-locked loop and the grid impedance causes the grid-following (GFL) control converter to easily lose synchronization with the grid. The grid-forming (GFM) control can improve the grid-tied stability under weak grid, but it is easy to destabilize under strong grid. A dual-mode adaptive switching strategy based on non-intrusive sensing is proposed. First, the least squares method is used to realize the non-intrusive impedance identification and calculate the short circuit ratio (SCR). Then, the adaptive switching between the GFL and the GFM modes is realized according to SCR. This strategy enhances the stability of the grid-tied converter when the grid strength varies over a wide range. Finally, simulation verifies the effectiveness of the proposal."

    "abstract": "Diagnostic errors are a major global health challenge that demonstrates the need for better clinical decision support. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), with their powerful natural language processing capabilities, provides a novel opportunity to mitigate this global challenge. This study aims to quantitatively assess and compare the diagnostic capabilities of various LLMs on a symptom-based disease classification task. We compare models based on their architecture (reasoning vs non-reasoning), and the impact of enhancement strategies such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Using the CoD-PatientSymDisease dataset, we examined a sample of open-source and API-accessed models. Our result shows a positive correlation between model size with its diagnostic performance. Evidence also shows that for symptom-based diagnostic tasks, non-reasoning models outperform their reasoning model counterparts. For example, GPT-4.1 accessible via the API had the highest precision using RAG (62.75% accuracy and 56.90% F1 score). Other open-source models such as LlAma-3.1 8B and Qwen-3 Non-Think 8B also showed competitive performance, especially when enhanced with SFT. Using SFT on the language model also generally increases its diagnostic performance, which bodes well for the adaptability of LLMs to specific domains. Overall, our findings suggest that in a practical symptom-based diagnostic context, adaptive techniques, such as fine-tuning, produce better results than reasoning alone, which suggests the benefit of domain-based contextual training for AI diagnostic support products. These insights highlight the importance of domain-specific adaptation in AI rather than relying solely on complex reasoning architectures."

This study aims to detect emotions in customer reviews using the IndoBERT model and compare its performance with other machine learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest. The study follows an experimental method by applying different models to a dataset of customer reviews to evaluate and compare their performance in emotion classification. The dataset consists of 63521 customer reviews categorized into five emotion labels: \"satisfied,\" \"disappointed,\" \"angry,\" \"urgent,\" and \"neutral.\" The analysis involves data preprocessing, tokenization using IndoBERT, feature extraction through word embeddings, and classification using machine learning algorithms. Model evaluation is based on accuracy and F1-score. The results show that IndoBERT combined with Logistic Regression and SVM performs best, reaching an accuracy of 89.08%, while Random Forest achieves only 77.91%. The study concludes that IndoBERT is an effective approach for emotion detection in customer reviews and holds strong potential to support more targeted improvements in PT Air Minum Giri Menang’s service quality and response."

By analyzing the operating modes of the LLC circuit, a multi-physics field coupling model that comprehensively considers the high-frequency eddy current effect of windings and the nonlinear characteristics of the magnetic core is established, accurately quantifying the transformer loss distribution and temperature rise characteristics. The performance of EE and EI type magnetic cores is compared, and it is found that the EE type has advantages in efficiency, loss control, and leakage suppression. The influence mechanism of air gap layout on winding loss is deeply analyzed, indicating that the optimization effect is significant when the longitudinal avoidance distance is approximately three times the air gap. By collaboratively optimizing parameters such as magnetic core materials, winding structure, and turn ratio, the final design scheme effectively controls the volume and temperature rise of magnetic components while ensuring electrical performance, achieving a balance between efficiency, volume, and thermal management. This provides an important theoretical basis and practical reference for the development of high power density LLC converters."

    "abstract": "The millimeter-wave filters fabricated using the GaAs IPD (Integrated Passive Device) process offer advantages such as low-loss, compact size, easy integration, high manufacturing precision, and suitability for mass production. Based on this technology, this paper utilizes full-wave simulation software to design a microstrip interdigitated bandpass filter with a passband ranging from 33GHz to 37GHz. The center frequency is set at 35.15GHz, featuring a 1dB difference passband spanning 32.60GHz to 37.71GHz and a maximum insertion loss of 1.97dB. Within the 32.68GHz to 36.91GHz frequency range, the return loss meets the requirement of being better than 15dB. Band-stop suppression reaches 37.2dB and 37.5dB at 28GHz and 42GHz respectively. The voltage standing wave ratio remains below 1.5 between 32.66GHz and 37.06GHz. The group delay peaks at the passband edges, measuring 0.37ns, indicating excellent linearity in the filter's phase response. These characteristics demonstrate that the filter has practical application value."

Manual sorting is considered ineffective by 74.4% of respondents. This study proposes a smart waste sorting robot using artificial intelligence, embedded systems, and sensors to automate classification. A key novelty lies in the implementation of edge computing, where a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is deployed directly on a Raspberry Pi, enabling real-time, offline waste classification without cloud dependency. This approach offers low latency and high system autonomy, making it suitable for limited-connectivity environments. The development process includes data collection, prototype design, model training using MobileNet in Google Colab, and deployment on Raspberry Pi. Testing results show that the CNN model achieved a 90.53% validation accuracy and the robot reached an 85% user acceptance rate.

This study proposes an automated book cover recognition system using deep learning methods to recognize book covers such as computer vision techniques. By researching methods such as the You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection models, to address these issues. Five YOLO versions (v8 to v12) were trained and evaluated on a curated dataset of book covers, annotated and processed according to standard object detection workflows. Performance was assessed using precision, recall, mean Average Precision (mAP), and confusion matrix analysis. Experimental results show that YOLOv10 outperformed other versions by achieving the best balance between detection accuracy and coverage, with the highest precision (0.7273) and strong recall (0.6953). Confusion matrix analysis revealed that all models effectively identified visually distinctive genres, while struggling with categories that have overlapping or subtle features. The findings highlight that model selection must be empirically validated, as newer versions do not always yield superior results. This work provides a benchmark for deploying AI-based book recognition systems and lays the groundwork for future multimodal approaches integrating both image and text features."

However, the non-stationarity and nonlinear dynamics of oceanic meteorological data pose significant challenges for prediction. This study proposes a Sampling-based Koopman Interactive Model (SKIM), which integrates Koopman theory to improve SST prediction through interactive feature extraction and linearized modeling. SKIM first employs a downsampling interaction structure to enhance the capture of multi-scale features and to improve the efficiency of temporal representation. Then, a Fourier filter is applied to decompose the complex non-stationary time series into linear and nonlinear components, which are further analyzed by the Koopman operator to enhance the model’s generalization ability. We conducted experiments on real-world datasets from the South China Sea and the Bohai Sea. The results show that SKIM significantly outperforms traditional machine learning methods (RF, SVR) and deep learning models (ConLSTM, TCN, SCINet), achieving the lowest prediction error and the highest accuracy in spatial distribution prediction."

The analytical calculation was prepared to ensure that the geometric parameters of the stator, rotor, characterisation of the windings, selection of permanent magnets, and calculation of losses were obtained from nominal data and remained within the limits of the vehicle wheel. For validation purposes, nominal data from an existing motor were applied to the analytical method, the resulting geometric parameters were compared to those of the existing motor, and variations of about 1% were observed. As a next step, three simulations were performed using Finite Element Method software, two in 2D, static and stationary (steady state), and one in 3D transient. The simulation results showed that the nominal data were achieved, with variations of up to 3% for mechanical power and 2% for shaft torque. The temperatures obtained showed that there was no damage to the permanent magnet (63°C) or the stator’s enamelled conductors (107°C), while the flux density presented values within the expected range for the air gap and there was no saturation in the core. These results demonstrated the analytical method’s ability to dimension the motor."

This study proposes an embedded sensor-based modal shape detection and self-compensation control scheme to address these challenges. By leveraging the direct and inverse piezoelectric effects, the system enables real-time monitoring and active adjustment of the modal response. A feedback sensor array was designed and validated through simulation, followed by the development of an equivalent resonant model and a self-compensation control algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method accurately tracks modal deformation and dynamically adjusts driving parameters to counteract modal drift caused by preload variations and stress relaxation. After prolonged storage conditions, this approach significantly enhances motor performance, increasing output torque from 7.6 μNm to 19.3 μNm, rotational speed from 5,268 rpm to 11,865 rpm, and reducing rotational fluctuation from 45% to 12.4%."

This paper addresses this gap by introducing BONDS, a blockchain-based protocol designed for optimized digital contract signing among N parties.

This paper develops a novel freeway traffic state estimator based on physics-informed deep learning (PIDL), whereby the deep-learning neural network is guided with physical laws of traffic. The innovative features of this work are as follows. In the data-driven aspect, the representation capability of neural networks is enhanced by introducing a nonlinear expansion layer, an attention mechanism, and a point-weighting mechanism. In traffic flow modeling aspect, a neural network is designed for the adaptive identification of model parameters. Additionally, a ramp flow self-learning neural network is constructed in consideration of system observability. This study employs four macroscopic traffic flow models LWR, ARZ, JWZ and PW to design PIDL-based traffic state estimators. Field-data evaluations and comparative analyses are conducted with respect to an urban expressway of 17.5 km. The results show that the designed PIDL traffic state estimators are able to simultaneously achieve traffic state estimation, ramp flow estimation, and adaptive identification of model parameters. The PIDL estimators outperform a number of baseline estimators, and are least sensitive to the number of input sensors and missing data. It is also discovered that the effectiveness of PIDL hinges on the appropriate tuning of the imbedded physical model as well as accurate boundary condition inputs, and failure to meet these requirements may lead to performance degradation."

However, the limited onboard energy of UAVs poses a major challenge for long-duration or large-scale missions. To address this issue, this paper proposes a dynamic trajectory planning framework for cooperative task search involving multiple UAVs. First, a UAV capability evaluation approach is developed to assess the relative performance of heterogeneous UAVs. Next, a density-aware clustering mechanism is employed to partition the search region based on spatial distance and regional density. After clustering, a sequential matching strategy is employed to assign UAVs with higher capabilities to larger or more complex task regions, ensuring efficient resource utilization. The problem is then formulated as a combinatorial optimization task, and a pointer network is designed to generate UAV trajectories. The network is trained using deep reinforcement learning to produce near-optimal paths, thereby minimizing the overall system cost. Experimental results confirm that the proposed method can substantially lower total task execution expenditure."

    "abstract": "Identifying cancer subtypes is crucial for understanding disease progression and guiding precision medicine. With advances in high-throughput experimental technologies, the integration of multiple types of omics data for cancer subtype identification has become increasingly feasible. However, despite the promising performance of existing integrative cancer subtyping methods, efficiently integrating and clustering multi-omics datasets remains challenging due to the high levels of noise inherent in omics data, which impede the accurate characterization of relationships among samples. To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep multi-view subspace clustering model that incorporates a self-reinforced learning strategy. This strategy iteratively improves the quality of self-representation, which is critical for accurately capturing sample relationships and enabling effective clustering. Specifically, during model training, the proposed method learns a highly reliable self-representation through a good-neighbor learning mechanism, allowing it to model more accurate and robust inter-sample relationships. Building upon this reliable self-representation, we further develop a learnable view-graph fusion framework that integrates complementary information across multiple omics views to derive a consensus representation for clustering, thereby guiding the overall learning process. In addition, we introduce a local graph-guided learning mechanism based on an initial graph constructed from the raw data. This mechanism serves as an effective regularization strategy to prevent the model from converging to suboptimal solutions, thereby enhancing stability and robustness during training. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches, validating its effectiveness and robustness for cancer subtype identification."

A Four-Quadrant Controlled Switch (FQCS) is employed between the voltage doubler circuit and the resonant inductor on the secondary side of the converter to accomplish these objectives. The presence of the FQCS switch sets the duty ratio of the primary side switches at 50%, hence accomplishes zero-voltage switching (ZVS), inherent power factor capability, and reduced size of DC-link capacitor. The duty <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">D</i> of the FQCS is used to regulate the other parameters, such as output voltage control and power factor correction. Moreover, all switches are either ZVS turned on or ZCS turned off at 50 kHz due to the converter’s resonance operation and fixed duty operation. Therefore, incurs very little switching loss with high efficiency and power density. The converter’s operational concept is presented alongside its design methodology. A 1.2 kW prototype was designed and tested to demonstrate the viability of this approach. The converter has achieved an efficiency of 96.4%, a power factor of 0.995, and regulated the output voltage to 400 V."

However, a major challenge in practical applications is the limited availability of comprehensive and diverse datasets. To address this, synthetic datasets have been developed. However, their inherent limitations in quality and diversity prevent deep learning models from effectively generalizing from synthetic to field data. This often results in overfitting and hinders the accurate learning of geophysical patterns. To tackle these challenges, we propose a comprehensive strategy to enhance the generalization capabilities of deep learning models, incorporating domain adaptation and data augmentation techniques. First, we introduce a domain adaptation method that adjusts the amplitude spectrum of the data in the frequency domain, generating synthetic samples that closely resemble field data. Additionally, we employ various data augmentation techniques to further enrich the diversity of the data. By improving both the realism and diversity of synthetic data, convolutional neural networks trained on these augmented datasets can effectively mitigate overfitting and enhance generalization, leading to more accurate feature identification in field data. We validated our strategy in geophysical tasks such as fault identification and channel detection. Experimental results demonstrate that our strategy significantly improves the models’ performance on both synthetic and field datasets."

    "abstract": "Obstacle avoidance (OA) is a critical safety challenge in mobile robot navigation, particularly in unstructured environments. In this article, the navigation task is formulated as a time-varying convex optimization (TVCO), with OA incorporated as inequality constraints. Accordingly, an error-dynamics-based neurodynamic network (EDNN) utilizing a nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP) function, referred to as the NCP-EDNN solver, is developed to solve TVCO problems accurately. It is worth mentioning that this is the first application of NCP-EDNN to mobile robot navigation with OA. For comparison, the NCP-EDNN solver, the interior-point method (IPM) based on a barrier function, and typical iterative QP solvers are applied to a same TVCO problem and a same robot navigation task. Comparative results demonstrate that the NCP-EDNN solver obtains more accurate solutions compared to the IPM solver, avoids the risk of solution failures, and delivers faster computation compared to representative iterative QP solvers. Its effectiveness is further validated through high-fidelity Gazebo simulations and real-world experiments with an IR-C100 mobile robot, demonstrating the practical applicability and physical feasibility."

    "abstract": "Cloth-changing person re-identification (CC-ReID) aims to match individuals wearing varying clothes across camera views. Existing CC-ReID methods typically focus on extracting clothing-invariant features such as body shape, pose, gait, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">etc</i>. However, these features are diverse and often entangled with clothing-related visual clues, posing significant challenges for comprehensively and effectively separating and leveraging them for re-identification. To address these challenges, we propose a text-guided clothing generalizable (Tex-CG) model, which employs multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to comprehensively and explicitly decouple clothing-invariant features from pedestrian images in the textual domain. By shifting feature disentanglement to the textual domain, the interference caused by visual entanglement between clothing and clothing-invariant clues can be significantly reduced. Additionally, to ensure compatibility between offline-decoupled features from MLLMs and our online-trained Tex-CG model, we utilize CLIP-based image-text matching to train implicit clothing-invariant prompts that embed discriminative pedestrian information. A dynamic fusion module is subsequently introduced to leverage these implicit prompts for selectively integrating valuable and compatible components from the MLLM’s explicitly decoupled features, constructing robust guidance to direct our model to effectively capture clothing-invariant visual clues for re-identification. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, and the Tex-CG model achieves state-of-the-art performance on five mainstream CC-ReID benchmarks.

    "abstract": "Seeding conflict in online society is a public issue obtaining increasing attention. In this paper, we take a step to study the problem of maximizing conflict in online social networks from the adversarial perspective. More specifically, we combine the widely used stochastic information propagation model and opinion dynamics model to jointly model the processes of adversarial content propagation and opinion evolution through peer pressure on social networks, based on which we define the adversarial perturbations maximization (APM) problem. The APM problem focuses on two popular network conflict measures, disagreement and polarization. Our analysis begins by showing the complex nature of the APM problem. We show that by decomposing the objective into a subtraction of two set functions, an upper bound of the objective which is essentially a difference of two submodular (DS) functions can be devised. Then inspired by the success of modular-modular procedure and reverse influence sampling technique in related optimization tasks, we build a two-level approximation framework to maximize the upper bound heuristically with a data-dependent guarantee and further strengthen the approximation result using the sandwich approximation framework. Also, we apply dimension reduction technique to design a faster naïve greedy algorithm for the objective. Experiments show both the seriousness of this problem and the performance of our proposed algorithms."

In this work, we propose a configurable rule-based expert system that delivers a sorted list of motivated recommendations based on data submitted through a web survey service and, most importantly, entirely implemented in PHP and deployable to a basic shared web hosting service, which the vast majority of companies, even the smallest ones, such as single-person brokerage companies, are already using to have a presence on the Internet. This has the potential to impact social sustainability, making AI technologies accessible to a broader variety of business players and to their customers, and to impact environmental sustainability by making the identification of the right provider for the right client less expensive from all the different points of view. Software artefacts are available on GitHub that can be used for demo purposes and as a starting point for the development of customised systems."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes an interference suppression beamforming method for sparse circular arrays (SCAs) based on the joint updated diagonal loading (UDL) and combined particle swarm optimization (CPSO) algorithms. The UDL algorithm mitigates the adverse impacts of improper diagonal loading factor selection on beamforming by delineating its allowable value range. The CPSO algorithm employs chaotic map and updating velocity weight to expedite convergence, meanwhile incorporating cross-mutation strategy to overcome susceptibility to local optima entrapment. Simulation results demonstrate that the CPSO algorithm achieves approximately 90% faster convergence than the conventional PSO algorithm. For a full 25-element array with a sparsity ratio of 44%, the SCA-based beamforming suppresses interference signals to be less than -30 dB while maintaining good radiation directivity. This approach effectively reduces element number and system cost while delivering significant interference suppression. Furthermore, under the condition of six-user access, the sparse circular array remains high beam sharpness and interference suppression more than 20 dB, confirming excellent antiinterference characteristics."

Corn, as a major food commodity, is highly susceptible to various leaf diseases that can reduce productivity and threaten food security. Manual diagnostic methods are often inefficient, time-consuming, and prone to subjective errors, necessitating a fast and accurate automated detection system. This study applies deep learning techniques with the ResNet-50 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to classify corn leaf conditions into four categories: healthy, leaf spot, blight, and common rust. ResNet-50 was chosen because it can overcome the problem of decreasing accuracy in deeper networks through residual connections, allowing for more effective image feature extraction. The model was trained with hyperparameter settings such as learning rate, batch size, optimizer, and number of epochs to achieve optimal performance. The test results showed excellent performance with 96% accuracy on the training data and 94% on the validation data, indicating the model's robustness and generalization ability."

Conventional industrial grippers are capable of gripping regularly shaped objects in parallel. The gripping effect on flat-shaped objects is poor. This paper proposes a novel robotic hand (PS Hand) with parallel pinching and scooping. This PS Hand combines the Grasshopper mechanism and the double parallelogram mechanism, with three phalanges similar to a human hand, and has three gripping modes: parallel pinching, scooping and adaptation. This proposed hand allows compound gripping, as the hand passively presses down, collides with the desktop, and the table and fingers interact, after the hand is pressed down to a certain height, the parallel pinching can be automatically converted to the scooping. When gripping flat objects such as cards, it can be effectively clamped by flipping the objects. At the same time, the adaptive gripping of this hand is suitable for grabbing objects of different shapes and sizes on the desktop. The setting of compound gripping allows it to grasp irregular objects. This paper analyzes both the kinematics and dynamics of this hand. Combined with the experiments, it is shown that this hand can have a good grasping effect and stable performance."

The goal of text-based 3D human dance generation is to produce 3D dance motions from text prompts, with the main challenge being the preservation of semantic consistency between text and motion. We augmented the existing Text-toDance framework by incorporating a Text-to-Music module as a new modality, resulting in an enhanced quality of generated dance motions. The audio craft model generates a particular style for our music generation. VTM uses a cross-modal transformer to generate motion codes aligned with the relevant dance motion representations in the embedding space to obtain quantized features and generate the dance. The motion codes are synthesized by leveraging the beat information of the music, which is obtained through transforming the semantic content of the text into beat-related features. Following an encoderdecoder architecture, the cross-modal Transformer employs a multi-head attention mechanism internally to effectively capture element-wise dependencies between audio features. Extensive experimental evaluations have been conducted, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed VTM architecture. Results on the public AIST++ and HumanML3D datasets indicate that the added text-to-music modality facilitates the generation of human dance poses, outperforming previous methods in quantitative and qualitative evaluations."

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents a paradox for Muslim societies, offering transformative opportunities alongside complex challenges. This research, employing a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of 22 selected articles, identifies that AI has the potential to enhance efficiency in the fields of education, Hajj management, economics, and public services. However, conversely, AI also poses nine multidimensional challenges encompassing epistemological, theological, jurisprudential (fiqh), ethical, social, and cultural identity aspects. Key challenges include the erosion of religious authority, academic plagiarism, algorithmic bias, privacy violations, and the degradation of spiritual values. This paper concludes that Islam offers a moderate and comprehensive normative framework for navigating this duality. Based on a synthesis of the literature, eight Islamic ethical guidelines for AI are formulated, centered on two main foundations: Maqāṣid alShariī'ah (the five objectives of Shariah) and the principle of Wasathiyyah (moderation). These guidelines emphasize legitimacy, justice, data protection, human accountability, integrity, and sustainability. Thus, this paper argues that the responsible integration of AI requires a balanced approach that harnesses its technological benefits while rigorously ensuring its alignment with Islamic values and law."

In our human-robot cooperation system, an MYO arm ring in the human side is used to capture Surface Electromyography (SEMG) signals and the related interactive motion information, and an advanced force sensor in the robot side is used to capture six-dimensional forces at the end effector. In order to fuse the different modalities during the human-robot cooperation system, a time-loop neural network-based Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) approach is used to optimize the entire cooperation process by fusing the motion information modality generated by the human with the force-aware information modality generated from the robot. Three models were developed using LSTM network: two trained separately on the modal data from individual channels and one trained on the fused dual-channel modal data. A cooperative handling object task is specially conducted to verify our compliance control approach via the response force and response time. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively reduces response latency in human-robot collaboration while improving the system's robustness against unintended activations caused by non-human collaborators."

However, integrating IDS into resource-constrained environments, particularly across heterogeneous processor architectures such as ARM and RISC-V, presents significant challenges. This study performs a comparative analysis of ARM and RISC-V architectures using power-time series measurements to evaluate their suitability for anomaly-based intrusion detection. The analysis was conducted on the MAX78002 development platform using controlled anomaly injection scenarios designed to simulate abnormal system behaviour. Power consumption patterns were captured and analysed using DTW and Normalised Cross-Correlation metrics to detect deviations indicative of potential intrusion events. The results revealed that RISC-V cores exhibited greater sensitivity to anomaly-induced deviations, while ARM cores produced more consistent power patterns under anomalous conditions. Additionally, ARM anomalies had a more pronounced impact in concurrent core scenarios, suggesting asymmetric observability across architectures. These findings highlight the significant role of processor architecture in the design of effective, power-aware IDS solutions."

    "abstract": "Large-scale wake vortices will be left behind during the voyage of an underwater vehicle, and the information collection of dynamically spreading wake vortices by multiple ASVs through multiple viewpoints can help to track the underwater vehicle. However, the communication distance between low-cost ASVs is limited, and the wake vortex is in the process of spreading continuously, so it is necessary to form a full encirclement of the wake vortex within a preset time. In this paper, the multi-view information acquisition problem of the wake vortex is transformed into an encirclement problem with limited preset time and communication distance. In this paper, Multi-ASV multi-stage pre-set time roundup control method for multi-view coordinated observation(MMPR) is introduced. Firstly, an ASV kinematic model is established, and the time threshold for roundup is determined according to the diffusion nature of the trailing vortex and the roundup capability. Then, the encirclement path is generated and optimised by combining the B-spline curve with the collision penalty function. Finally, the orientation-based multi-ASV preset time interference observer, formation controller and encirclement controller are designed.

    "abstract": "Industrial robots have been broadly used in machining applications, but low-stiffness characteristics limit further development; therefore, accurate evaluation and optimisation of the robot end stiffness are required. In the case of drilling robots, the current stiffness evaluation metrics do not visually evaluate the stiffness of the robot end in any tool axis, and positional optimisation criteria are not proposed for continuous drilling operations. To improve the machining quality and efficiency of drilling robots, this paper introduces a comprehensive position optimisation technique for drilling robots. Firstly, a stiffness performance index represents the axial force in any robot direction. Secondly, the robot's comprehensive position optimisation model is established by considering the effects of configuration invariance and singularity on machining. Enhancing the robot's drilling quality ensures working efficiency and stability under continuous operation. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by drilling experiments, which reduces the robot drilling processing defects."

    "abstract": "Multiclass network attack classification presents significant challenges due to the imbalanced distribution of data. So far, no existing studies have explicitly combined three main approaches: Recursive Feature Elimination with CrossValidation (RFE-CV), Class Weights, and Adaptive Synthetic Sampling (ADASYN) within a single evaluation framework. This study evaluates the combination of these techniques on the UNSW-NB15 dataset using the XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost models. The results reveal a trade-off. While the full combination of techniques improves the recall of the minority class Backdoor to 0.88, it also reduces the performance of other classes. Model interpretation using SHAP confirms that this trade-off arises from the similarity of feature characteristics between classes such as Exploits and DoS and minority classes like Analysis and Backdoor. Considering the need for stable overall performance, this study concludes that the combination of RFE-CV and Class Weights with the XGBoost model provides the most balanced approach, achieving an F1-Macro score of 0.58 and an accuracy of 0.76, which indicates that although the overall accuracy decreased compared to the baseline, the unchanged F1-Macro reflects a trade-off where performance on majority classes dropped while detection of minority classes improved."

However, achieving perfect multiplexing and superposition of VBs with different orders remains challenging. This paper proposes a single-layer metallic porous metasurface structure suitable for the visible light band. By rationally designing elliptical apertures arranged in a ring pattern, VBs with topological charges of l=2, 4, 6, and 8 are successfully generated. To obtain VBs with ideal wavefront quality, a genetic algorithm is employed in this study to optimize the key structural parameters of the metasurface. Meanwhile, leveraging the intrinsic orthogonality of VBs with different topological charges, concentric ring-shaped multi-channel VBs arrays (l=2, 6) and (l=4, 8) with high purity (>90%) are constructed. This research provides an innovative approach for advancing the development of high-capacity optical information transmission and high-security optical communication encryption technologies."

Through theoretical analysis and simulation optimization, a dual-frequency (2.4 GHz/5 GHz) microstrip structure is designed, with good characteristic impedance matching (S<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">11</inf><25dB, S<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">21</inf>>-0.2dB, VSWR <1.15), and a trapezoidal transition structure is used to achieve efficient impedance matching between the microstrip and the chip pins. In order to solve the problem of mutual interference between RF and DC signals, a combination scheme of decoupling capacitance (0.6 pF) and filtering inductor (10 nH) is proposed, and an integrated circuit test system containing three RF injection ports and a shared power supply port is constructed. The experimental scheme uses power amplifier, directional coupler and bandpass filtering to realize the combined injection of HPM signal and normal working signal, and uses vector network analyzer and peak power meter to monitor the response.

    "abstract": "Nowadays, a variety of intelligent technologies are gradually being introduced into power scenarios. In substations, intelligent inspection robots are increasingly replacing manual labor for patrol tasks. One of the primary focuses of robot patrols is the operating parameters of equipment, which requires accurate reading of parameters from various instruments. For pointer-type instruments, accurate segmentation is one of the key steps for automatic reading. To address this need, this paper proposes a method based on the Vision Transformer (ViT). Specifically, ViT is adopted as the backbone to extract image features more effectively, as it enables better capture of global information-a factor crucial for image segmentation tasks. To further enhance the capture of contextual information, a pyramid pooling module (PPM) is integrated into the feature pyramid. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves competitive accuracy performance, with an mIoU value of $97.42 \\%$. This method can provide valuable support for the subsequent steps of automatic reading for pointer-type instruments."

Leveraging mesh telemetry, we automatically construct a Service Dependency Graph (SDG) that captures inter-service communication and operational context; network-analysis metrics and structural queries are then applied to surface problematic architectural structures. The approach scales to large clusters, runs continuously, and requires neither static code inspection nor intrusive changes to application deployments. By turning production telemetry into actionable architectural signals, it enables early remediation and continuous governance of microservice systems."

Advertisements are a significant tool or medium to convey messages to consumers. A positive brand image will influence consumers’ perspectives on a brand, which will have a positive impact on consumer loyalty. However, there are still issues regarding the extent to which the credibility and informativeness of e-commerce advertisements play a role in shaping brand image through advertising value. This study aims to analyze the influence of e-commerce advertisements on brand image. This study was conducted using a quantitative survey method. The sample obtained online amounted to 223 samples. The results showed that credibility and informativeness significantly affect advertising value. However, credibility has more significant value than informativeness regarding advertising value. Advertising value has a significant effect on brand image. This study proves that understanding the value of an advertisement plays a crucial role in building brand image, thus enabling e-commerce business actors to develop effective marketing strategies that will positively impact their business. Therefore, this study is practical and theoretical in increasing knowledge about digital advertising, and in practice, it can help e-commerce actors create more effective advertising strategies.

The simulation results indicate that the voltage of the DDR signal waveform ranges from 0V to 1.2V, with no significant jitter or overshoot. The rise and fall times of the signals satisfy design requirements and maintain signal integrity (SI). Furthermore, the near-field field strength of the main control board reaches a maximum of 38.492 V/m at 189.2 MHz, and the radiation distribution is consistent with theoretical predictions. These findings provide a theoretical foundation and practical engineering references for the electromagnetic compatibility design of electrical cabinets and similar onboard electronic devices."

The failure or damage of electronic products due to ESD has led to considerable losses in the industry. To prevent damage, ESD protection devices are often installed between the antenna and sensitive circuits. However, these extra components can result in issues like impedance mismatch, lower efficiency, and higher costs. In this paper, a simple and efficient method using loaded microstrip-line based LC resonator is proposed. The ESD current can flow from the positive arm of the dipole to the negative arm and then to the ground. ESD protection is automatically realized without any additional devices. By simply adjusting the dimensions of the capacitor (C) and inductor (L) of the resonator, the LC resonator equivalent to an open-circuited condition at the operating frequency of the antenna, thus the performances of antennas are remained. This method can also be applied to other types of antennas."

The experiment takes the “rock coal rock” three-layer standard sample as the object, and uses the RTR-4600 rock mechanics system and NF-5035 electromagnetic instrument to collect EMR signals at loading rates of $0.3,0.4$, and $0.5 \\mathrm{~mm} / \\mathrm{min}$. Firstly, the original signal is decomposed using ICEEMDAN to obtain IMF and residual components. By combining sample entropy and Kmeans, IMF is classified into high, medium, and low frequency categories; $2=$ Then use VMD quadratic decomposition on highfrequency components to refine frequency characteristics; Finally, a CPO CNN BiLSTM model is constructed for training. The results showed that the $\\mathbf{R}^{2}$ of all three operating conditions in the test set exceeded $95 \\%$, with the lowest MAE of 0.33966 and the lowest MAPE of 0.057666; The ablation experiment confirmed that secondary decomposition and CPO optimization improved the model performance by $15 \\%-83 \\%$ compared to CNN and BiLSTM alone. This method can effectively capture the time-frequency evolution law of EMR signals, providing technical support for ground pressure warning."

By synergistically combining discrete rigid bodies with parametric force fields—transmitting fundamental stiffness via Bushing force elements and introducing cross-stiffness terms through custom torque elements—the method achieves precise characterization of tension-torsion coupling effects. A 200 mm gauge-length model of the LGJ/JL/G1A-70-10 conductor was validated against high-fidelity Ansys LS-DYNA finite element simulations. Comparative analysis demonstrated that the approach accurately replicates axial stiffness, torsional stiffness, and tension-induced torsional deformation. The proposed methodology addresses computational bottlenecks in large-span conductor modeling, offering an efficient paradigm for construction dynamics research and enabling proactive risk mitigation in overhead transmission line projects."

This study proposes the utilization of an improved differential evolution algorithm for PID controller design. The improved differential evolution algorithm sets weighted sum of overshoot, adjustment time, and integral of absolute error as the optimization cost function. To avoid the shortcoming of the standard differential evolution algorithm of easily falling into local optima, this algorithm introduces individuals outside the population and dynamic mutation coefficients in the mutation stage, and dynamic crossover factors in the crossover stage. To compare the performance of different parameter tuning methods, a brushless DC motor control system model was constructed using the Matlab/Simulink platform, and traditional PID methods, standard and improved differential evolution algorithms were applied to tune the PID parameters. Simulation results show that, compared with traditional methods and standard differential evolution algorithms, the PID parameters tuned by the improved algorithm presented in the present study demonstrate superior overall performance with respect to response speed, overshoot, and interference resistance, verifying its effectiveness and superiority."

The isolator utilizes a unique multilayer structure incorporating a custom ultra-high permittivity dielectric, copper, and patterned silicon. Key results demonstrate that the isolator effectively mitigates detrimental coil-metamaterial coupling. Crucially, it achieves a substantial >11x enhancement of the local magnetic field intensity within the metamaterial, increasing it from 0.6 A/m to 7.0 A/m.

    "abstract": "Performance evaluation is one of the most important methods to guarantee the safe and reliable operation of complex systems. Currently, there are three main problems in the performance evaluation of complex systems: the evaluation model is difficult to establish; the correlation between indicators is difficult to measure; and expert knowledge is not effectively incorporated. To solve these problems, this article proposes a performance evaluation model considering indicator correlation on the basis of considering the cohesion ratio factor evidence reasoning rule (ERr-CRC). In the process of calculating indicator correlations, expert knowledge is first used to determine whether there is a correlation between two indicators, and then an outcome-oriented correlation calculation method is proposed, which transforms the problem of calculating the correlation between indicators into the problem of calculating the correlation between the confidence distributions of each outcome level. On this basis, the order of evidence fusion is determined according to the size of the correlation factor, and it is integrated into the process of assigning the basic probability quality of evidence in the form of a global discount factor for the final performance evaluation. To prove the effectiveness of the correlation factor, this article carries out a sensitivity analysis and a perturbation analysis. Finally, a case study of the ERr-CRC model is conducted using the rocket structure state-aware simulation platform."

    "abstract": "There is a vast literature on representation learning based on principles such as coding efficiency, statistical independence, causality, controllability, or symmetry. In this paper we propose to learn representations from sequence data by factorizing the transformations of the latent variables into sparse components. Input data are first encoded as distributions of latent activations and subsequently transformed using a probability flow model, before being decoded to predict a future input state. The flow model is decomposed into a number of rotational (divergence-free) vector fields and a number of potential flow (curl-free) fields. Our sparsity prior encourages only a small number of these fields to be active at any instant and infers the speed with which the probability flows along these fields. Training this model is completely unsupervised using a standard variational objective and results in a new form of disentangled representations where the input is not only represented by a combination of independent factors, but also by a combination of independent transformation primitives given by the learned flow fields. When viewing the transformations as symmetries one may interpret this as learning approximately equivariant representations. Empirically we demonstrate that this model achieves state of the art in terms of both data likelihood and unsupervised approximate equivariance errors on datasets composed of sequence transformations."

This article proposes a computationally efficient model predictive control (CE-MPC) based on adaptive switching states for grid-connected three-level active neutral-point-clamped (3L-ANPC) inverters. The proposed CE-MPC method optimizes the switching states of the 3L-ANPC inverter by applying three-step constraints of adaptive candidate vector boundary, small voltage vector polarity, and zero switching states operation mode. Therefore, the adaptively selected switching states reduce MPC computation time by up to 84.08% compared to the traditional FCS-MPC algorithm, effectively minimizing the computational burden and freeing up processing resources for other tasks. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed CE-MPC method are experimentally validated using a 3kW hardware prototype."

Current research endeavors are predominantly centered on utilizing visual context information exclusively through meticulous architecture design, often overlooking significant semantic details. This oversight limits the efficacy in tackling the challenge of intra-class variations. While in this paper, we propose CLIP2RS which is devised to leverage the pretrained Vision-Language Model (VLM) for semantic segmentation of RS images via the guidance of prior knowledge stored in the pretrained foundation model. Specifically, CLIP2RS utilizes a two-stage training strategy to overcome the domain gap challenge between natural images and remote sensing images. A dual-granularity alignment framework that simultaneously aligns pixel-level local features and image-level global features is designed to alleviate severe class sample imbalance problem. Additionally, a novel prompting mechanism is effectively explored to to fully harness the potential of CLIP textual descriptions. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the iSAID, Potsdam, and Vaihingen datasets, and the experimental results show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performances, demonstrating its superiority."

    "abstract": "Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) is rapidly advancing in edge applications such as micro-UAVs and autonomous vehicles. However, the small size and low brightness of targets often necessitate complex architectures in existing models, making deployment on resource-constrained edge devices challenging. Therefore, designing a model that balances high detection accuracy with low resource consumption is critical for the successful implementation of IRSTD. To address this challenge, this study proposes a lightweight shape-texture mutual-guided predictor-corrector network (STMG-PCNet). Through the collaborative design of a detection branch and a shape-aware branch, along with efficient module architectures, STMG-PCNet strikes a balance between accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, a progressive lightweight dilated dense (PLD<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>) module in the detection branch combines dense connections and cascaded multi-scale dilated convolutions to enhance local texture retention and precise localization. A shape-aware vision Transformer (SAViT) module in the shape-aware branch models target edges and shape features via global context interaction. In addition, a numerical predictor-corrector fusion (NPC-Fusion) module is proposed to achieve lightweight multi-stage feature fusion. Experiments on three public infrared datasets reveal that STMG-PCNet significantly outperforms existing algorithms in detection accuracy, parameters, computational efficiency, and inference speed, verifying its robustness and practicality in complex scenarios.

They partition the packet stream into windows and then apply various stream processing techniques to summarize flow-level statistics. However, existing studies focus on the measurement within each window. Window management is still a missing piece due to the resource limitation of programmable switches. In this paper, we propose OmniWindow, a general and efficient window mechanism framework. OmniWindow splits the original window into fine-grained sub-windows such that the sub-windows can be merged into various window types. To deal with the resource restriction, OmniWindow carefully designs its data plane memory layout and proposes a window synchronization method. It also employs a collaborative architecture that can collect and reset stateful data in sub-windows within a limited time. We prototype OmniWindow on Tofino. We incorporate OmniWindow into a SOTA query-driven telemetry system and eight sketch-based telemetry algorithms. Our experiments demonstrate that OmniWindow enables these telemetry solutions to achieve higher accuracy than conventional window mechanism."

    "abstract": "Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a severe type of hemorrhagic stroke that causes nearly 3 million deaths annually. Recent studies have indicated minimally invasive surgery (MIS) can improve functional outcomes in patients with lobar ICH. However, despite these promising results, challenges persist, including tool dexterity and visualization. Our group has been developing a concentric tube robot (CTR) for MR-guided ICH evacuation to address these concerns. We have demonstrated feasibility in prior ex vivo studies. However, to improve clot evacuation, better control strategies, such as closed-loop evacuation control, are needed. In this short paper, we present a modeling strategy for hybrid pneumatic-hydraulic closed-loop evacuation control that is suitable for use in the MR-environment, which requires long pneumatic (for vacuum canister regulation) and hydraulic (for hematoma evacuation) transmission lines. The control strategy is evaluated in a bench-top setting using our CTR and evacuation system. The CTR is used to evacuate an artificial hematoma at volumetric flow rates ranging from 2.5 cm3min to 10 cm3min. Notably, prior to steady-state, the system exhibits a mean evacuation volumetric flow rate error of 0.533 cm3min and a steady-state mean error of 0.229 cm3min."

    "abstract": "The dielectric properties of terahertz semiconductor materials significantly impact the operational performance of terahertz devices, which typically operate in an environment with a certain microwave field strength. Therefore, it is significant for the design of terahertz semiconductor devices to achieve dielectric measurement under simulated microwave field loading environment. This paper proposes an improved dual-cavity integrated sensor technology that enables dielectric property measurement of materials using the terahertz open resonator method under microwave field loading. This technology addresses the critical challenge of weak test signal extraction in strong microwave fields through a dual-mode cooperative and decoupled mechanism. The open resonator is used for complex permittivity inversion, while the re-entrant coaxial cavity provides the microwave field environment. The open resonator is designed with multi-channel coupling and operates at 0.11~0.5 THz. Meanwhile, the phenomenon of the microwave field effect on the terahertz dielectric properties of semiconductor is observed through the parameter variation of the open resonator. Based on this system, the non-thermal and thermal effects of semiconductor materials can be accessed through changes in their dielectric parameters by setting the signal source for microwave field excitation to either pulsed or continuous wave signals. This system can provide a variable microwave field environment, which provides a support for the measurement of the complex permittivity of semiconductor materials in a simulated working environment."

The algorithm requires an initial controller that robustly stabilizes the uncertain system. For this purpose, we apply an auxiliary iterative algorithm that computes a stabilizing controller by progressively shrinking a disk in the complex plane containing all closed-loop poles. The radius of the disk is reduced until it lies strictly inside the unit circle, ensuring robust stability. This algorithm is also formulated as a semidefinite program, using the newly proposed Finsler-based conditions, with the controller treated as a decision variable. Three numerical examples demonstrate that the combination of the two proposed algorithms can outperform existing methods in the literature, without requiring scalar tuning parameters.

    "abstract": "Crop diseases remain a major threat to global agricultural productivity, particularly in resource-constrained regions, where early intervention is critical to ensuring food security. Smallholder farmers often practice intercropping, creating complex field conditions that challenge conventional disease detection systems. Although computer vision and machine learning offer powerful tools for early diagnosis, most existing approaches are tailored to single-crop scenarios and rely on cloud-based or high-resource environments, limiting their applicability in the field. This review synthesizes and explores recent advances in AI-based crop disease detection with emphasis on multi-crop and intercropped systems. We provide an overview of the detection pipeline from data acquisition and preprocessing to model training and deployment. We highlight technical challenges such as dataset scarcity, lack of modality diversity, poor model generalization, and limited real-world validation. Unlike prior reviews that isolate crops and modalities, this review uniquely integrates multi-crop, multimodal and edge deployable perspectives. We identify key research gaps and outline emerging opportunities for scalable solutions, including lightweight, multimodal models, offline-capable inference, edge deployment, and the integration of conversational AI for field-level support. By centering on the realities of low-connectivity, heterogeneous farming environments, this review aims to offer guidance toward inclusive and sustainable AI-driven agriculture."

    "abstract": "Many reconnaissance missions require a group of mobile terminals (such as soldiers, mobile robots, and unmanned boats) to jointly operate within a region which is far away from the command centre. When a critical event occurs and is detected by a terminal, it is often required for the terminal to upload some critical data to the command centre (or via the satellite). As the bandwidth of the upload link is usually low due to the long distance, uploading the critical data often has long latency. To reduce the latency, a feasible way is to utilize the nearby terminals’ idle uplinks to help with the upload process, which requires the terminal’s data to be disseminated to other terminals as soon as possible. This is a new dissemination problem because the data being disseminated is also partially being uploaded, which seems as a novel <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">data-leaking</i> dissemination problem. To solve it, we propose LHDS (Low-latency Heterogeneous Dissemination Scheduling) scheme by transforming the problem into two special sub-problems, i.e., constructing a special degree-decreasing tree with maximum multichild nodes, and designing a leaking-sustained dissemination schedule for each subtree. Extensive simulation experiments have been conducted on LHDS as well as two heuristic algorithms (i.e., <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">DBO</i> and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">S-GA</i>) designed for baselines.

After deriving the Hankel transform describing the flux linkage, the semi-infinite integration interval is continued to the negative real axis. Next, the part of the integrand that exhibits branch point singularities is expressed in pole-residue form. This task is accomplished through the use of a well-established rational function fitting algorithm. Finally, the integration contour is deformed in the complex plane, so as to surround the pole singularities produced by the fitting algorithm. This makes it possible to apply the residue theorem, which leads to converting the integral representation for the flux into the sum of residues at the poles of the integrand. The derived solution has value in practical applications like wireless power transfer systems for battery electric vehicles charging."

    "abstract": "Decoding gait dynamics from EEG signals presents significant challenges due to the complex spatial dependencies of motor processes, the need for accurate temporal and spectral feature extraction, and the scarcity of high-quality gait EEG datasets. To address these issues, we propose EEG2GAIT, a novel hierarchical graph-based model that captures multi-level spatial embeddings of EEG channels using a Hierarchical Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) Pyramid. To further improve decoding performance, we introduce a Hybrid Temporal-Spectral Reward (HTSR) loss function, which integrates time-domain, frequency-domain, and reward-based loss components. In addition, we contribute a new Gait-EEG Dataset (GED), consisting of synchronized EEG and lower-limb joint angle data collected from 50 participants across two laboratory visits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EEG2GAIT with HTSR achieves superior performance on the GED dataset, reaching a Pearson correlation coefficient (r) of 0.959, a coefficient of determination (R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>) of 0.914, and a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.193.

Statistical analyses confirm that these improvements are significant compared to all prior models. Ablation studies further validate the contributions of the hierarchical GCN modules and the proposed HTSR loss, while saliency analysis highlights the involvement of motor-related brain regions in decoding tasks.

Utilizing an integrated CMOS capacitive sensor, the system detects evaporation from micro-liter volumes of chemical solvents deposited on the surface of interdigitated electrodes. This platform enables precise ToE measurement, which varies based on the composition of the binary solvent mixture. The functionality and practicality of the proposed sensing method were validated through experiments involving mixtures of pure water, ethanol, and methanol. Over 66 experimental results demonstrate that at room temperature, ToE serves as an indicator of the relative composition of two chemical solvents. Specifically, the ToE Change Ratio (TCR) and Capacitance Change Ratio (CCR) for water-ethanol mixtures were approximately 21.13% and 1.19%, respectively. Despite the droplet being freely placed on the CMOS chip at room temperature, the characterization curve between ToE and alcohol concentration exhibits linearity, with an R² value exceeding 0.945 for water-ethanol mixtures. These findings underscore the sensor's ability to provide rapid, accurate, and cost-effective liquid characterization. This evaporation-based sensing platform holds significant potential for advancing life sciences, offering a reliable and efficient tool for liquid analysis."

Based on the drift-diffusion model, this study establishes a discharge model under extremely uneven electric fields. High-speed imaging experiments are employed to validate the spatiotemporal evolution of streamers. The results indicate that cottonseed oil, which possesses a relatively higher permittivity, exhibits a smaller electric field gradient. Streamers in cottonseed oil demonstrate stronger spatial expansion and more pronounced lateral electric field components, along with a shorter duration of the fieldstrength surge phase. Increasing the impulse voltage significantly enhances the streamer length, brightness, and branching density, with the number of secondary streamers in both oils being approximately proportional to the voltage amplitude. A smaller tip radius triggers earlier streamer inception. Cottonseed oil exhibits a velocity transition following the I–II–III–II mode sequence, whereas mineral oil displays only an I–II transition, and only at small tip radius. These findings clarify the streamer evolution mechanisms in cottonseed and mineral oils, providing theoretical support for insulation enhancement and discharge mitigation in high-voltage equipment."

    "abstract": "In practical shielding engineering, apertures and seams on the surface of shielding enclosures are prone to electromagnetic leakage, which can be effectively mitigated by installing EMI gaskets. To analyze the influence of gasket dimensions on shielding effectiveness and support electromagnetic shielding design, this study employs isotropic materials to fill regular gaps, establishing an analytical model to evaluate the impact of gasket size. The shielding effectiveness of gaskets with dimensions ranging from 1 mm to 10 mm is calculated and analyzed. The findings indicate that smaller gasket sizes result in higher shielding effectiveness. Therefore, in practical electromagnetic shielding design, selecting smaller gaskets—while ensuring basic functionality and reliability—can enhance the overall shielding performance of the product."

The primary objective is to design and evaluate a pipeline that integrates YOLOv8 Medium, character recognition using EasyOCR, and validation against the official government vehicle database (Bapenda Jabar) for a plate detection system. The primary contributions are: (1) detection-OCR pipeline integration linked to official government databases for verification, (2) a lightweight image-processing system suitable for and can be applied to resource-limited devices, and (3) comparative analysis of YOLOv8 and YOLOv11 on an internal dataset. Three sample categories (Kaggle, foreign plates, and direct captures; n_total = 13 images) used for initial testing showed correct readings for all samples; however, the results have yet to be generalized as the results are limited by the small size and low variability of the dataset. Detection metrics, average inference time, environmental limitations, and plans for further improvement are included in the discussion. However, the overall results of the initial testing have proved the very effective potential that exists within the proposed system for implementation in Automatic Number Plate Recognition as well as Intelligent Transport Systems."

Secondly, an incremental learning (IL)-based control framework is presented, where the nominal controller and the IL-based controller are designed in parallel, and the nominal control law is developed using backstepping control approach to theoretically ensure the system stability, while the incremental learning control law is proposed with a data-driven form to optimize the indicators. Considering the low computing power of the flight controller, an adjustable neural network (NN) is introduced with an adaptive algorithm, and the size of the NN is determined by the need for the user. Finally, the simulations are given to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme."

To systematically evaluate its effectiveness, we construct a visual benchmark tailored for process anomaly detection in scientific workflows. Experiments on two representative vision-language models show that detection accuracy improves as more contextual information is provided, confirming the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed reasoning approach for process anomaly detection in scientific workflows. Furthermore, realworld validations at selected experimental steps confirm that first-person visual observation can effectively identify processlevel anomalies. This work provides both a data-driven foundation and an evaluation framework for vision anomaly detection in scientific experiment workflows."

    "abstract": "Accurate control of support torques within the human body caused by an exoskeleton contributes to its efficacy as well as the understanding of its functionality. Hence, it is a basis for higher level control functionalities. A standardized technical test procedure has already been established to measure support torques for lower-back support exoskeletons. However, appropriate inverse dynamic control approaches directly considering the accurate control of these torques with respect to human coordinates have not yet been implemented and tested with technical procedures. The main objective of this contribution is to formulate such a control approach for an exemplary application of a cable-based lower-back support exoskeleton and to test it with a novel test bench. A combination of a neural network and a solution of a nonlinear equation is applied to calculate kinematic quantities. Kinematic and inverse dynamics calculations are conducted on microcontroller hardware in real-time. It is revealed that the consideration of support torques with respect to human coordinates instead of exoskeleton coordinates decreases the root mean square error for two different reference support torques by approx. 62 % (13 % of its reference value) for the application example. Difficulties in precise actuation of support torques are present mostly due to friction in cable-based actuation. Further, kinematic calculations show significant errors. The findings suggest that, depending on differences between human and exoskeleton kinematics, control approaches considering support torques are superior when referred to human coordinates."

The resulting model integrates three domains - core, futuristic, and gap-bridging concepts-providing a holistic architecture that connects blockchain affordances to agility-enabling mechanisms. Evaluation through competency questions demonstrated its applicability in aligning governance with architecture, translating ecosystem adoption drivers into organizational design, and operationalizing agility capabilities.

A commutation-overlap-based PWM control strategy is then proposed. Unlike conventional dual closed-loop control, the method adaptively sets the overlap duration from current dynamics and employs high-frequency PWM to balance current slopes, ensuring smooth phase transitions. Simulation and experimental results confirm that the proposed strategy effectively suppresses commutation torque ripple, thereby enhancing torque smoothness, stability, and control precision."

    "abstract": "Data analysis plays a crucial role in the insurance industry for processes such as claim prediction, risk management, and fraud detection. One of the major challenges in this field is the presence of outliers—values that significantly deviate from normal patterns in financial data. This study applied four anomaly detection algorithms—Isolation Forest (IF), Local Outlier Factor (LOF), Elliptic Envelope (EE), and One-Class SVM (OCSVM)—to a dataset consisting of 766 insurance records, each containing monthly income data from January to December. The detection results show that IF, LOF, and EE each identified 39 anomalies, while OCSVM detected 38. Among these, 36 records were flagged as anomalies by at least two algorithms, 22 by at least three, and 17 were consistently identified by all four methods, forming a high-confidence anomaly subset. A comparison of results highlights that IF and LOF often overlap in their detections, suggesting strong suitability for joint use in financial anomaly detection. OCSVM displayed a more conservative approach, detecting fewer anomalies, while EE, based on Gaussian distribution assumptions, produced distinct results compared to distance-based methods. Overall, the findings indicate that while no single algorithm is universally superior, Isolation Forest and LOF demonstrated the best balance of consistency and responsiveness in detecting anomalies within monthly insurance income data."

    "abstract": "Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) can enhance the transparency and trustworthiness of control systems by delivering decision-making insights that are readily understandable to humans. This is especially crucial in scenarios where data-driven controllers employing closed box approaches, or mathematically rigorous yet complex controllers, are adopted. However, existing XAI methods typically focus on predictive tasks such as classification and regression, with limited applications in control. To bridge this gap, this paper integrates XAI techniques into control systems by proposing an eXplainable Control Framework (XCF) which explains how controllers determine their control actions and their underlying working mechanism. A novel XAI method, fuzzy model-agnostic explanation (FMAE), is introduced as an instantiation of the proposed framework. The innovations and contributions of this work include applying and adjusting the hierarchical structure, model-agnostic algorithm and user interface of FMAE within the proposed XCF to better align with the needs of explainable control. To validate the proposed XCF based on FMAE in real control scenarios, we conduct a case study on the cartpole inverted pendulum system. The generated explanations comprise comprehensible IF-THEN rules revealing the decision logic of controller and the salience values of the system states illustrating their contributions to control output. Furthermore, we employ large language models (LLMs) to refine the explanations. Experimental results based on the designed evaluation metrics demonstrate that the explainer accurately approximates the behavior of real controller. This work enhances control system explainability and usability for accessible design, analysis, and deployment."

Traditional energy control strategies overlook the perturbations caused by frequent changes in driving intentions and fail in complex scenarios without vehicular connectivity. To overcome these challenges, we propose a multi-objective control strategy based on data from the OnBoard Diagnostic (OBD) system. This strategy employs the AGE-MOEAII algorithm to construct three fitness functions for multi-objective optimization, achieving a comprehensive optimal control of energy consumption, NOx emissions, and driving comfort. Furthermore, to enhance the convergence speed in solving the optimization problem, we adopt a local optimization approach, which nearly doubles the solution speed compared to global optimization methods. When applied to reduce NOx emissions, the optimized solutions consistently yield a mean reduction of NOx levels between 300 and 350 ppm across five experimental trials, demonstrating both significant and stable reductions in NOx emissions."

This paper proposes a residual neural network-based method for predicting reflection parameters of metasurface unit structures, significantly improving analysis speed. By using 2D structural images as input data, a metasurface reflection parameter prediction model was trained. Test results show close agreement between model predictions and traditional software simulations, validating the model's accuracy."

This paper introduces a self-optimizing EA framework that integrates telemetry-driven maturity monitoring, generative co-design, and an AI governance layer. Telemetry from service logs and performance metrics feeds a real-time maturity orchestrator, while an AI meta-layer performs predictive analytics and generates policy-compliant BPMN workflows and capability maps under human oversight. A knowledge-graph backbone links policies, processes, and technologies to enable reasoning and interoperability across agencies. A proof-of-concept prototype demonstrates near real-time maturity updates (latency below five seconds), artefact accuracy of up to 100 percent after review, and complete governance traceability. The results indicate that EA in government can evolve from static documentation toward an adaptive, evidence-driven, and trustworthy foundation for digital transformation."

In this framework, the railway network is considered as an extended microgrid that incorporates distributed active loads such as trains, along with renewable sources and energy storage units. Traditional control strategies, typically based on PI controllers, often encounter steady-state errors and increased harmonic distortion. To overcome these challenges, the proposed system combines solar and wind generation with battery storage, coordinated through an NN-based energy management scheme. The controller regulates the DC bus voltage and controls the current through the buck-boost converter. A comparative analysis between the PI and NN controllers is performed in MATLAB/Simulink, focusing on voltage and current performance. The simulation findings confirm that the proposed configuration enhances the efficiency and reliability of the powertrain and the microgrid station."

Firstly, a multi-time-scale coordination optimization method is proposed, accounting for uncertainties in wind power and load prediction using triangular fuzzy numbers.

The need to decrypt data before applying anonymization or masking techniques introduces potential vulnerabilities, where data could be exposed during processing. This article provides a comprehensive solution to implement robust security measures throughout the entire data lifecycle, including training machine learning models on data without applying differential privacy. Our approach ensures end-to-end encryption to protect data at rest, during processing, and in transit. We encrypt the region of interest in visual imagery at the source, allowing machine learning or deep learning models to use it directly for training purposes. This ensures models focus on abstract visual information rather than private details such as facial features or clothing colour. Our work demonstrates that machine learning models trained on privacy-aware data can be as accurate as those trained on raw data. We employed widely used AES encryption and object detectors like YOLO, Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD-MobileNetv1-FPN-640x640, SSD-ResNet101-FPN-640x640), and the EfficientDet family (EfficientDet-D0 and EfficientDet-D1) for detection and classification of visual objects."

    "abstract": "This brief presents a system for high-efficiency S-band magnetron microwave power combining based on the mutual synchronization mechanism (peer-to-peer locking mechanism) between magnetrons, which effectively addresses the issues of low efficiency and complex architecture in the existing magnetron microwave combining systems. The system is simplified through a modification of the H–T waveguide tee by introducing multiple tuning pins to control the coupling coefficient precisely. This modification achieves tunable coupling strength and mutual frequency pulling and locking. It leverages the intrinsic coupling characteristics of microwave signals between magnetrons and ensures stable interlocking. Moreover, it significantly simplifies the combining system and eliminates the need for circulators or phase shifters. Additionally, a fixed-length (or tunable) straight waveguide is added to fine-tune the phase difference between the two magnetrons, thereby maximizing the combining efficiency to approximately 99% in experiments. The high combining efficiency is maintained once the combining system is established. The combining efficiency remains above 95% even when different magnetrons are alternated. These results highlight its potential as a high-efficiency solution for magnetron microwave combining applications and industrial-scale use."

Comprehensive experiments on the large-scale Aerial Image dataset show that GeoMamba’s performance comprehensively surpasses current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, reducing the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) by up to 28.1% compared to the strongest baseline, while maintaining an average registration time of 0.3 seconds. More importantly, when directly applied to the SUIRD dataset for zero-shot generalization testing, the model demonstrates exceptional robustness and adaptability, proving that it has achieved a new SOTA level in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and generalization."

    "abstract": "Under unbalanced grid conditions, inverter-based resources (IBRs) are required to remain connected to the grid and provide reactive current injection to mitigate voltage unbalance at the point of common coupling. Most existing research focuses primarily on steady-state reference current generation under such conditions, whereas current overshoot and oscillations induced by reference-switching have been largely overlooked. Driven by this gap, this paper proposes a mode-constrained two-stage current injection optimization framework. In the first stage, the dominant oscillatory modes of a grid-connected IBR are identified through closed-loop transfer function modeling and eigenvalue analysis. In the second stage, a reference-switching trajectory optimization problem is formulated in the frequency domain, in which the trajectory is constructed through a virtual acceleration sequence. By maximizing the virtual energy contained in the sequence under spectral energy constraints, the fastest and optimal trajectory is indirectly obtained, and the excitation of dominant oscillatory modes during reference switching is thereby prevented. Since this framework is implemented at the reference level, it is fully compatible with existing controllers and adaptable to varying operating conditions. Simulation and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed optimization framework."

To tackle the filtering errors typically associated with classic dynamic surface control methods, novel compensation signals are designed and integrated into the control framework. The proposed control strategy is divided into two main phases. In the first phase, a feedforward control input is constructed to ensure the boundedness of all system states, while a first-order auxiliary signal is introduced to effectively suppress the influence of unmodeled dynamics. In the second phase, a near-optimal control input is developed by minimizing a carefully formulated cost function based on a reconstructed error system. This is achieved through the use of adaptive dynamic programming techniques, where radial basis function neural networks are employed to approximate the unknown nonlinear components. A rigorous stability analysis confirms the uniform ultimate boundedness of all closed-loop signals. The effectiveness of the proposed control method are validated through comprehensive simulation studies on two representative nonlinear systems."

Point label propagation is a technique that uses existing images labeled with sparse points to create augmented ground truth data, which can be used to train a semantic segmentation model. In this work, we show that recent advances in large foundation models facilitate the creation of augmented ground truth masks using only features extracted by the denoised version of the DIstillation of knowledge with NO labels version 2 (DINOv2) foundation model and K-nearest neighbors (KNN), without any pretraining. For images with extremely sparse labels, we use human-in-the-loop principles to enhance annotation efficiency: if there are five point labels per image, our method outperforms the prior state-of-the-art by 19.7% for mean intersection over union (mIoU). When human-in-the-loop labeling is not available, using the denoised DINOv2 features with a KNN still improves on the prior state-of-the-art by 5.8% for mIoU (five grid points). On the semantic segmentation task, we outperform the prior state-of-the-art by 13.5% for mIoU when only five point labels are used for point label propagation. In addition, we perform a comprehensive study into the number and placement of point labels, and make several recommendations for improving the efficiency of labeling images with points."

The OWC devices harness wave energy by trapping air in a chamber, which converts ocean wave motion into a pulsating airflow that drives an air turbine coupled to an electrical generator. Efficient energy extraction necessitates a clear understanding of the complex interactions among hydrodynamic, pneumatic, turbine, and electrical subsystems. The power takeoff (PTO) mechanism is particularly critical, as it governs the entire energy conversion chain from hydraulic to electrical power. Given the analytical challenges, experimental studies are essential for model validation, with small-scale experiments offering a cost-effective approach before full-scale prototype deployment. This study decouples the hydrodynamic and pneumatic subsystems for efficient testing. A piston rig, constructed from 6-in cylindrical pipes and driven by a reciprocating actuator, generates controlled oscillatory pneumatic flow. The downstream end of the cylindrical pipe is fitted with the power generation device or its proxy—miniature Wells turbine, orifice plate or porous plug. Key performance metrics for all the above devices subject to different levels of oscillatory flow are determined and compared. The turbine achieved the highest pneumatic power output (<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\sim$</tex-math></inline-formula>28 W) due to elevated chamber pressures, while an orifice plate yielded approximately 9 W and a porous plug 0.8 W. Notably, the porous plug exhibited qualitative flow behavior similar to that of the miniature Wells turbine. These experiments provided valuable insights into the effectiveness of oscillatory pneumatic systems. Such knowledge is critical for developing scaled damping proxies for PTO systems in oscillatory flows, ultimately contributing to the advancement of OWC converters."

To address these difficulties, we construct a cross-regional, manually annotated benchmark dataset named MDD-Human and propose a novel Transformer-based detection network, MDT (Mars Dust Devil Detection Transformer). The model adopts FasterNet as its backbone to ensure a balance between computational efficiency and feature extraction capability. A key innovation lies in the multi-scale attention fusion module, which incorporates hierarchical fusion strategies and hybrid attention mechanisms to effectively enhance the representation of dust devil features under diverse Martian terrains. In addition, we introduce a shape-aware localization loss function, SMIoU (Shape-Augmented Minimum Point Distance IoU), which improves geometric sensitivity by integrating corner distance constraints and structural shape priors. Experimental results on the MDD-Human dataset demonstrate that MDT achieves 92.7% Precision, 90.8% Recall, 92.4% mAP@50, and 91.8% F1-score, outperforming several classical and state-of-the-art detectors. Further tests on unseen THEMIS and CRISM datasets confirm the model's strong cross-source generalization, highlighting its robustness and applicability in diverse Martian imaging scenarios."

    "abstract": "Determining the harmonic contributions (HCs) of multiple harmonic sources (HSs) is a challenging task owing to the large fluctuations of background harmonic sources (BHSs) that impede the accurate evaluation of HCs for the existing approaches. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel approach based on the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) using multipoint synchronized harmonic phasor measurements. In the proposed approach, the multipoint model capable of simultaneously solving multiple harmonic transfer impedances (HTIs) is first constructed, where the fluctuations of background harmonic voltage are treated as the statistical variables represented by multiple different Gaussian distributions. Then, we resort to the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) for the estimation of the model parameters associated with BHSs and HTIs, achieving good estimation performance under large fluctuation levels of BHSs. Finally, a new HC index is formulated to synthetically evaluate the overall HCs of each HS to the harmonic problems of the concerned area. The proposed index considers not only the differences in the severity degree of harmonic-standard-exceeding problems on different concerned buses but also the time-varying characteristics of the HSs being evaluated. It is more effective than the existing index in identifying the real harmonic contributors to the concerned area. The simulations performed in the IEEE 33-Bus test system have demonstrated the advantages of the proposed approach, with more than 50% accuracy improvement over the existing approaches."

    "abstract": "This article studies the energy efficiency optimization of cargo uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) pickup systems, with constraints on on-board energy and load capacity. In the UAV-enabled cargo pickup system, minimizing the total energy consumption and ensuring the safe flight of the cargo UAV is a problem to be solved. However, due to building blockages, the channel between the UAV and ground base stations (GBSs) frequently switches between line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS), thereby affecting the UAV’s communication quality. This effect is further aggravated by environmental noise interference. Moreover, limited by the on-board energy, it is unrealistic for the UAV to pick up all the cargo in a single flight without charging or replacing the battery. To address the above-mentioned challenges, we propose a UAV pickup system energy efficiency optimization (UPSEEO) framework. In this framework, the UAV’s trajectory between any two pickup points is optimized via the A<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${}^{*}$</tex-math> </inline-formula> algorithm to ensure the stability of the UAV communication link. Next, we employ the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to optimize both task allocation and flight speed to minimize the total energy consumption, subject to constraints on UAV on-board energy limits and payload capacity. Numerical results show that the proposed framework can ensure the UAV’s communication quality in any spatial topology, with an improvement in energy efficiency of approximately 5% to 50% compared to the comparison experiment."

    "abstract": "Calibration is crucial for ensuring the performance of phased array since amplitude-phase imbalance between elements results in significant performance degradation. While amplitude-only calibration methods offer advantages when phase measurements are impractical, conventional approaches face two key challenges: they typically require high-resolution phase shifters and remain susceptible to phase errors inherent in these components. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Rotating element Harmonic Electric-field Vector (RHEV) strategy, which enables precise calibration through time modulation principles. The proposed technique functions as follows. Two 1-bit phase shifters are periodically phase-switched at the same frequency, each generating corresponding harmonics. By precisely adjusting the relative delay between their modulation sequences, the phase difference between the +1st harmonics produced by the two elements can be precisely controlled, utilizing the time-shift property of the Fourier transform. Furthermore, the +1st harmonic generated by sequential modulation of individual elements exhibits a linear relationship with the amplitude of the modulated element, enabling amplitude ambiguity resolution. The proposed RHEV-based calibration method generates phase shifts through relative time delays rather than physical phase shifter adjustments, rendering it less susceptible to phase shift errors. Additionally, since the calibration process exclusively utilizes the +1st harmonic, which is produced solely by the modulated unit, the method demonstrates consistent performance regardless of array size. Extensive numerical simulations, practical in-channel and over-the-air (OTA) calibration experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and distinct advantages of the proposed method."

Herein, a high speed and highly sensitive FOVS was demonstrated by using the liquid mass block (silicone oil), which can transmit the inertial force to all the direction inside the FOVS for omnidirectional sensing. Owing to the liquid nature of oil, the inertial force can be uniformly applied on the diaphragm without deteriorating its mechanical properties. The response magnitude of FOVS can be enhanced ~48 dB by employing the liquid mass block. Moreover, because without using any optical interference effect, precise control on the light wavelength and cavity length is no longer needed, which simplifies sensor fabrication and demodulation system for compact and low cost. An omnidirectional detection limit of 0.1 μg, a sensitivity of 3.2 V/g, and a resonance frequency of 2.7 kHz was realized for the FOVS."

    "abstract": "Accurate computer-aided interpretation of fetal heart rate (FHR) recordings depends on detecting the baseline and transient accelerations (Acc) and decelerations (Dec) that deviate from it. Most deep learning models treat FHR as a simple 1-D time sequence, overlooking the spectral separation between the low-frequency baseline and high-frequency Acc/Dec patterns. Neglecting this clinically important time-frequency structure can result in missed detections of Acc and Dec events and increased susceptibility to noise. To overcome these limitations, we present WaveFHR-VNet—a U-Net-style, multi-scale, multi-basis wavelet-voting network that analyzes FHR signals in the joint time-frequency domain. WaveFHR-VNet embeds a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) in every encoder block. Each DWT splits the features into approximation (low-pass) coefficients, which preserve the low-frequency baseline trends, and detail (high-pass) coefficients, which preserve the high-frequency Acc/Dec edges. Cascading these decompositions through successive layers yields a hierarchical, multi-scale representation. The decoder uses inverse DWT for full-resolution reconstruction. Skip connections are equipped with an Interactive Coefficient Selection (ICS) module that learns attention masks to suppress Doppler noise and motion artefacts in the detail stream while amplifying diagnostically salient transients. To enhance spectral diversity, five complementary wavelet bases (db4, db6, sym4, sym5, bior3.5) operate in parallel; a simple voting layer fuses their outputs, eliminating manual basis tuning. Evaluated on four FHR datasets, WaveFHR-VNet achieved state-of-the-art performance, with improvements of up to 5.3995% Dice, 5.4758% IoU, and 4.6263% accuracy over the best baselines on LCU-DB, the most widely used public benchmark. It also demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization, consistently outperforming all comparison models. These results suggest that WaveFHR-VNet can serve as a reliable tool for intrapartum monitoring."

In S2S VC, the accuracy of alignment between source and target speakers strongly affects conversion performance. In this paper, we propose EdenVC and WSAS-VC using attention-based alignment. EdenVC simply introduces a diagonal-guided weighting initially proposed in EdenTTS, while WSAS-VC integrates the attention weights and those based on the alignment path obtained from the monotonic alignment search. We evaluate the conventional MAS-VC, EdenVC, and WSAS-VC using two types of speaker conversion conditions, from native to native speech and from non-native to native speech. Experimental results show that WSAS-VC achieves more stable training than EdenVC and better conversion accuracy than MAS-VC."

    "abstract": "Current deep learning-based methods for remote sensing image dehazing have developed rapidly, yet they still commonly struggle to simultaneously preserve fine texture details and restore accurate colors. The fundamental reason lies in the insufficient modeling of high-frequency information that captures structural details, as well as the lack of effective constraints for color restoration. To address the insufficient modeling of global high-frequency information, we first develop an omni-directional high-frequency feature inpainting mechanism that leverages the wavelet transform to extract multi-directional high-frequency components. While maintaining the advantage of linear complexity, it models global long-range texture dependencies through cross-frequency perception. Then, to further strengthen local high-frequency representation, we design a high-frequency prompt attention module that dynamically injects wavelet-domain optimized high-frequency features as cross-level guidance signals, significantly enhancing the model’s capability in edge sharpness restoration and texture detail reconstruction. Further, to alleviate the problem of inaccurate color restoration, we propose a color contrast loss function based on the HSV color space, which explicitly models the statistical distribution differences of brightness and saturation in hazy regions, guiding the model to generate dehazed images with consistent colors and natural visual appearance. Finally, extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in both texture detail restoration and color consistency.

Under locally skewed data distributions, traditional indexes (such as B+-trees) exhibit poor query performance and high memory consumption; while the existing learned index Chameleon achieves faster query speed under skewed data, it still occupies a large amount of memory space. To optimize the utilization of memory space, this paper proposes MOCHA-a memory-optimized learned index based on Chameleon, aiming to solve the problem of inefficient memory usage under skewed workloads. MOCHA introduces three key strategies: cold node compression strategy (compressing cold nodes with low access frequency), subindex construction strategy (excluding cold keys to save more memory space), and redundant node cleanup strategy (eliminating redundant nodes). Experiments on dataset such as FACE (extremely skewed) show that MOCHA retains the query efficiency of Chameleon (faster than other indexes such as DIC and ALEX), and under skewed workloads, memory usage is reduced by up to 24 %, making it more suitable for systems with limited memory resources."

The incorporation of grid security constraints significantly expands the model scale, resulting in low computational efficiency. To improve solving performance, this paper proposes a data-driven solution method for SCUC. First, a surrogate model for AC power flow calculation is constructed using a CNN-BLS (Convolutional Neural Network-Broad Learning System) architecture. By training on extensive historical power flow data, a nonlinear mapping between system operating states and power flow results is established. Furthermore, the implicit relationship between generator output and line power flow is derived. Using sensitivity analysis, the complex AC power flow constraints are transformed into linear constraints expressed in terms of generation power variables. Consequently, the SCUC problem is reformulated into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model, which is solved using Cplex. Simulation results on the 10 -unit 39-bus system demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces solution time while maintaining accuracy, thereby effectively enhancing the computational efficiency of the SCUC problem."

Exoskeletons have been introduced as assistive devices to alleviate joint stress and enhance mobility. However, most commercially available exoskeletons rely on predefined gait patterns, which may not effectively reduce knee joint load. This study integrates musculoskeletal modeling and predictive simulation to optimize exoskeleton-assisted gait strategies for KOA patients. In this framework, a reflex-based controller produces muscle excitation signals. These signals are then introduced into the musculoskeletal model to compute muscle forces, which in turn drive gait motion. By incorporating joint load reduction into the optimization process and refining exoskeleton torque application, we enhance the realism and efficacy of simulated gait patterns. The simulation results demonstrate the optimized gait pattern can reduce joint load for KOA patients. Our proposed approach provides valuable insights into exoskeleton design and clinical rehabilitation, supporting future efforts in simulation-based exoskeleton gait optimization."

    "abstract": "Pharmaceutical ecosystems involve multi-layered interactions across organizational, regulatory, and digital domains, demanding a coherent conceptual foundation to capture their dynamics. Previous frameworks have rarely combined business architecture with ontology, leaving ecosystem-level interactions only partially represented. This study addresses these gaps by proposing a business-architecture-informed conceptual framework grounded in the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO). Importantly, the framework positions business architecture as a bridge to enterprise architecture, ensuring that ecosystem-level conceptualization aligns with organizational structures and strategic objectives. The framework was developed through a systematic literature review (PRISMA-guided) of 17 peer-reviewed studies (2018–2025) and a qualitative thematic synthesis. It formalizes key components and relationships across domains to ensure semantic coherence and structural clarity. The proposed model contributes to advancing theory and provides a reference for ontology-based system design, strategic governance, and policy development in pharmaceutical contexts. Furthermore, the framework offers extensibility for future adaptation at both the enterprise and ecosystem levels, supporting broader applicability in digital health, regulatory alignment, and inter-organizational collaboration."

    "abstract": "Applying multiple rewards of equal value to QLearning is necessary for accurate anomaly detection, but there is so far little research done into the topic. In this paper, the authors make use of the HBOS algorithm to establish multiple bandpass ranges, which are then used in the training of a Q-Learning algorithm, which is itself based on the Gridworld game, to create Multiple Rewards for Q-Learning Version 2 (MRQLv2). A brief introduction into the concepts and formulae behind Q-Learning and the HBOS algorithm are included. The methodology section shows how the bounds of the bandpass filters are created; how the data is prepared; how the algorithm handles different types of data; the creation of category maps and the use of parameters. The full MRQLv2 algorithm is tested on the Statlog Shuttle and Satellite UCI datasets. The results show a recall of 1, a precision of 0.946408 and a ROC-AUC score of 0.973204 on the Shuttle dataset. These results are compared against a variety of machine learning, deep learning and hybrid models including; OCSVM, MF, kNN and Fast kNN, GNNs, RNNs, MCOD and Approx-Storm using precision, recall and averaged AUC scores. The results show a significant improvement on previous models for the Shuttle dataset, but more research needs to be done to improve the performance of the MRQLv2 algorithm overall."

However, conventional microwave magnetic field detection methods based on Rabi oscillations suffer from time-consuming measurement procedures. In this study, a rapid microwave magnetic field imaging method based on the mathematical relationship between fluorescence and microwave field intensity in diamond NV center is proposed. By correlating the fluorescence intensity emitted by NV centers with microwave field strength, the single-point measurement time is reduced from minutes to seconds. Experimental validation on a serpentine microstrip line demonstrates that this method enables fast and high-resolution 2D microwave magnetic field imaging with high spatial resolution."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a design optimization framework for a low-profile dual-polarized frequency-selective rasorber, leveraging a combination of equivalent circuit theory and the space mapping (SM) technique. The reflection coefficient formula derived from the equivalent circuit model (ECM) serves as the coarse model, while the full-wave electromagnetic (EM) simulation of the rasorber functions as the fine model. An artificial neural network (ANN) is employed to establish the mapping between these two models. This integration of the coarse model and the ANN mapping forms the neuro-SM model, which rapidly predicts the EM response, effectively replacing the need for computationally intensive EM simulations. To enhance efficiency by reducing the number of training samples for this surrogate model, a star sampling approach is implemented. The application of this model has successfully led to an optimized design that achieves a reflection coefficient below -10 dB within the 2.3-5.8 GHz frequency band. This approach has demonstrated a significant reduction in design optimization time, achieving an approximate 80% decrease compared to conventional full-wave simulation methods. These results validate the efficacy of the space mapping technique in the design of frequency-selective rasorbers."

    "abstract": "When high-voltage transmission lines operate in high-altitude complex terrain areas, conductor windage yaw has become a key external factor that threatens the safe and stable operation of the power grid. Based on the typical windage yaw fault cases in Naqu City and Yanglang area of Tibet, combined with field investigation, windage yaw angle check and simulation analysis, this paper reveals the occurrence mechanism and evolution law of wire offset under special meteorological conditions such as valley wind and brash wind. The research shows that the combination of thin air, strong wind and topographic circulation in high altitude areas significantly aggravates the suddenness and unpredictability of windage yaw fault. In view of the above problems, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional prevention and control strategy covering design, operation and maintenance, including wind speed data collection, windproof design standard improvement, parameter optimization and local environmental adaptability design, and further proposes comprehensive measures for operation monitoring, fault warning and operation and maintenance improvement. The research results can provide theoretical basis and engineering reference for the safe operation of UHV transmission lines in extreme environments, and have important academic value and engineering application significance."

Structurally, they can be regarded as electromagnetic hybrid of induction motor and permanent magnet synchronous motor. Fractional slot concentrated windings (FSCW), which feature short end turns and simplified manufacturing, have been adopted successfully with PMSM. However, their inherently rich magnetomotive force (MMF) harmonics negatively impact starting performance, generate torque pulsations, and reduce efficiency, which restrict the application with LSPMSM. This paper proposes an interleaved squirrel-cage design method which can effectively suppress the influences of the MMF harmonics. Through the optimal design of the starting unit, FSCW becomes viable for LSPMSM. Finite element method (FEM) validates the proposed method."

This noise can couple to other power networks, degrading power integrity, while coupling paths are often difficult to be determined due to the complexity of the power delivery system from chip to board. To address this issue, the coupling electromagnetic energy density is proposed for visualizing noise coupling paths. This method is applied in a practical case where the system includes multiple power domains, and the coupling path is successfully identified. After localizing the sensitive area for coupling, targeted layout optimization for noise suppression is proposed. Both coupling path visualization and noise suppression strategies are verified by simulation and measurement."

A parallel matching branch is inserted at an optimized position along the main feed line, combined with a tapered microstrip transition, to realize stable impedance transformation without the use of any active components. Measurement results indicate that, in free space, the antenna achieves a −10 dB impedance bandwidth of 5 MHz, centered at 154 MHz, with a peak gain of 1.75 dBi and an approximately omnidirectional radiation pattern. When placed 20 mm away from the human body, the bandwidth is reduced to 2 MHz, the peak gain decreases to −6.77 dBi, and the radiation pattern exhibits a main lobe directed away from the body, accompanied by a resonance frequency shift toward the lower frequency."

Primary data were gathered through an online questionnaire distributed via social media and messaging platforms. Data collection was conducted among 442 respondents from various regions in Indonesia, particularly Jabodetabek, who had prior experience using digital payments for international transactions. Secondary data were also used to support the analysis. The results show that Perceived Advantage, Perceived Usefulness, and Trust significantly influence users' intention to adopt digital payment systems, while Financial Literacy and Social Influence had no significant effect. Security and social recommendations were found to enhance trust, while key motivators for users included cost savings, speed, and convenience. The findings highlight the importance for digital payment providers to focus on these values to boost user adoption by integrating both functional and behavioral factors. This study provides actionable insights for digital payment providers to optimize strategies around trust, cost efficiency, and transaction speed, while also helping users understand that security, trust, and usefulness are the main factors when choosing a way to conduct international transfers."

A comprehensive measurement campaign was conducted in a Compact Antenna Test Range (CATR) chamber, featuring 120 repeatable test points across the N260 and N261 bands, both with and without charging cables. The key performance metric, namely Peak Equivalent Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP), was analyzed. Results indicate mean deviation of approximately 0 dB (Delta-EIRP) with standard deviation below 0.30 dB, confirming a negligible influence.

    "abstract": "Political hoaxes are a form of disinformation that contains government policies or strategies that have not been confirmed as accurate and often do not follow the facts, thus becoming a serious threat to the spread of information globally. The significant risk of spreading false information highlights the need for effective mitigation strategies, which include early detection and classification of news. Additionally, utilizing machine learning as a technological solution is crucial. This study aims to compare the performance of feature extraction from Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and Word Embedding (Word2Vec) in classifying political hoax news. This research method employs three machine learning methods: Random Forest (RF), Naïve Bayes (NB), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The follow-up process in this study aims to enhance the performance of the machine learning algorithm analysis used. The results of the study show that the TF-IDF provides a more stable and accurate classification performance than Word2Vec. The RF model utilizing TF-IDF achieves the highest accuracy of 99%, followed by NB at 98% and SVM at 96%. Meanwhile, Word2Vec also demonstrates high accuracy, with a rate of 94% in RF, and the lowest rates are 93% in SVM and NB. The conclusion of this study shows that TF-IDF has advantages in selecting relevant words with political themes when compared to the word embedding method."

    "abstract": "With the increasing complexity of electronic circuit systems, the problem of electromagnetic interference (EMI) has become increasingly severe. Accurately obtaining EMI signals is a crucial step in addressing this issue. In this paper, the broadband time-domain restoration algorithm is applied to the current monitoring probe for measurement cable EMI noise. This method establishes the response relationship between the probe output signal and the cable interference signal by using the transfer impedance of the measurement probe and restores the time-domain interference signal through Fourier transform. Based on the above, a time-domain current measurement verification system is built using the current probe and its calibration piece. The reconstruction methodology is validated using two characteristic test signals: a 1 μs-pulse-width modulated 300 MHz waveform and a 100 ns-pulse-width modulated 700 MHz waveform. Quantification of reconstruction fidelity yielded errors of merely 5.53% and 5.25% for these respective cases, confirming the technique's effectiveness across different modulation regimes."

To address this, we propose a novel framework that integrates federated graph learning, contrastive representation learning, and game-theoretic optimization. EA is modeled as a decentralized graph of entities, where Graph Attention Networks (GAT) capture structural dependencies, contrastive learning yields robust cross-silo embeddings, and Nash Bargaining ensures fairness and stability in federated aggregation. Experiments on multi-firm financial data show consistent gains over baseline federated GNNs, with lower prediction error and stronger resilience to noisy, non-IID data. To complement the accuracy, the system enhances EA practice by making decentralization, equity, and flexibility work—isolated data converges to create shared intelligence, bargaining grants equal weight, and contrastive embeddings support agility. The system is then a digital twin of EA, enabling collaborative, privacy-driven analytics that improve governance, accountability, and strategic decision-making."

This paper's proposed Future KYC (FKYC) is a blockchain framework that leverages Base Blockchain (Layer 2 Ethereum) for on-chain verification hashes and encrypted off-chain KYC data storage. Using an incremental development process, FKYC is developed as a hybrid framework utilizing the combination of multiple actors, for KYC that meets this standard's requirements and allows for verification across institutions via roles-based access control (individuals, institutions, or regulators) while minimizing or eliminating duplicate or redundant checks. The prototype illustrates cryptographic separation between the public hashes (on-chain) and private data (off-chain), providing privacy while conforming to Indonesia data localization laws. FKYC is designed to provide an efficient and scalable solution for lowering costs and expanding financial access; however, to realize its potential requires off-chain integration to be completed, institutional workflows to be modified, and policy frameworks for financial institutions to collaboratively develop."

UGRNets require not only low-latency communication but also high spatial awareness to ensure effective coordination and decision-making. This paper proposes a unified spatiotemporal framework that evaluates and enhances the quality of updated information in UGRNets from both temporal and spatial dimensions. On the temporal side, we develop a martingale-theory-based prediction method for the delay violation probability bound (DVPB), coupled with a novel joint decay rate model to accurately characterize latency violations in heterogeneous multi-hop communication UGRNets. On the spatial side, we introduce the use of Wasserstein distance to quantify and improve the spatial completeness of robotic coverage. By integrating these metrics, we formulate a spatiotemporal optimization problem that jointly minimizes DVPB and maximizes spatial completeness, enabling robotic agents to adapt their information collection strategies accordingly. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves information timeliness and spatial completeness in heterogeneous and dynamic UGRNets scenarios, thereby providing practical insights for real-world deployment."

We first introduce the framework of vehicular edge-enabled Metaverse rendering through the collaboration of roadside unit (RSU) and in-vehicle rendering. Then, the cooperative AI agent scheduling strategy is proposed to improve the resource utilization. An adaptive privacy preservation scheme is developed to protect the privacy information of vehicle users.

    "abstract": "With the increasing demand for terrain visualization in many fields, such as augmented reality, virtual reality and geo-graphic mapping, traditional terrain scene modeling methods encounter great challenges in processing efficiency, content realism and semantic consistency. To address these challenges, we propose a Text-Guided Arbitrary-Resolution Terrain Scene Generation Network (TG-TSGNet), which contains a ConvMamba-VQGAN, a Text Guidance Sub-network and an Arbitrary-Resolution Image Super-Resolution Module (ARSRM). The ConvMamba- VQGAN is built on top of the Conv-Based Local Representation Block (CLRB) and the Mamba-Based Global Representation Block (MGRB) that we design, to utilize local and global features. Furthermore, the Text Guidance Sub-network comprises a text encoder and a Text-Image Alignment Module (TIAM) for the sake of incorporating textual semantics into image representation. In addition, the ARSRM can be trained together with the ConvMamba-VQGAN, to perform the task of image super-resolution. To fulfill the text-guided terrain scene generation task, we derive a set of textual descriptions for the 36,672 images across the 38 categories of the Natural Terrain Scene Data Set (NTSD). These descriptions can be used to train and test the TG-TSGNet<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>. Experimental results show that the TG-TSGNet outperforms, or at least performs comparably to, the baseline methods in image realism and semantic consistency with proper efficiency. We believe that the promising performance should be due to the ability of the TG-TSGNet not only to capture both the local and global characteristics and the semantics of terrain scenes, but also to reduce the computational cost of image generation."

To deal with the unknown state- and time-dependent disturbance, and a robust intergral of the sign of the error (RISE) disturbance observer is utilized, which can ensure the estimation error exponentially converge to zero. Then, the safety and stability control objectives are transformed into the constraint conditions of quadratic program (QP) by utilizing control barrier function (CBF) and control Lyapunov function (CLF). By applying the event-triggered control mechanism (ETM), the control input is calculated only on event-triggered moments by solving the discrete-time QP with the constraints of safety and stability. The control objectives are achieved in whole time interval, while also enhancing the feasibility of control algorithm and saving calculation resources. Moreover, the Zeno behavior is excluded in the ETM. Finally, numerical simulations validity the proposed control algorithm."

    "abstract": "The dielectric contrast between healthy and osteoporotic bones can be monitored using microwave techniques. However, previously reported values of bone dielectric properties are inconclusive: significant variations exist due to different sample types, preservation methods, and measurement techniques. To overcome these limitations, we present an anatomically accurate dielectric model of bone loss in the trabecular bone at microwave frequencies along with accompanying phantoms. Specifically, bone volume fractions (BVFs), or ratios of red bone marrow to trabecular bone, are developed with dielectric mixing equations to represent various stages of bone loss. The dielectric properties for BVFs of 10% and 40% are calculated for realistic representation of bone loss in simulations. Then, semi-solid phantoms for emulating bone loss from 0.75 to 5 GHz are developed for experimentation. The phantoms are composed of sunflower oil, salt water, gelatin, and dish soap. The average percent error between the permittivity and conductivity of the proposed simulation model and the fabricated phantom is 4.30% and 8.38% for a BVF of 10% and 5.57% and 6.58% for a BVF of 40%, respectively, from 0.75 to 5 GHz. This work is the first to consider the dielectric properties of red bone marrow as a critical factor in monitoring bone loss in the trabecular bone regions at microwave frequencies. Additionally, this work develops the first known phantoms for emulating bone loss. The proposed dielectric model and semi-solid phantoms can be used for realistic simulation, testing, and development of microwave sensing and imaging systems for bone loss prior to human testing."

These characteristics fundamentally undermine conventional security methods and traditional artificial intelligence (AI)-driven solutions. Generative AI (GAI) is a transformative approach that can safeguard SAGIN security by synthesizing data, understanding semantics, and making autonomous decisions. This survey fills existing review gaps by examining GAI-empowered secure communications across SAGINs, with a focus on core models such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational autoencoders (VAEs), generative diffusion models (GDMs), and large language models (LLMs). First, we introduce secured SAGINs and highlight GAI’s advantages over traditional AI for SAGIN security defenses. Then, we explain how GAI mitigates failures of authenticity, breaches of confidentiality, tampering of integrity, and disruptions of availability across the physical, data link, and network layers of SAGINs. We present three step-by-step tutorials to discuss how to apply GAI to solve specific security problems across different layers and segments of SAGINs utilizing concrete methods, emphasizing its generative paradigm beyond traditional AI. Finally, we outline open issues and future research directions, including lightweight deployment, adversarial robustness, cross-domain governance, and heterogeneous compatibility, to provide major insights into GAI’s role in shaping next-generation SAGIN security."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS)-assisted integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems in the presence of one eavesdropper (Eve). The signature sequence (SS) sensing scheme is applied at the dual function base station (DFBS) for distinguishing different targets, and the artificial jamming is utilized to improve the system security. On this basis, we formulate an optimization problem of sum secrecy rate maximization by jointly designing the DFBS active beamforming and STAR-RIS passive beamforming, while meeting the constraints of sensing illumination power, passive structure for STAR-RIS, interference for multiple targets, and total transmit power for DFBS. It is arduous to deal with the devised optimization problem forthrightly. Thus, we propose an alternating optimization algorithm by splitting the primitive problem into two sub-problems. Specifically, for the first sub-problem of optimizing STAR-RIS reflection and transmission coefficients, we propose a penalty-based iterative optimization algorithm to obtain the solutions. For the second sub-problem of optimizing DFBS active beamforming and artificial jamming, we transmit it into a semi-definite relaxation program by removing the rank-one constraints, and an iterative optimization algorithm is exploited to solve it. And then, we obtain the final solutions by iteratively optimizing these two sub-problems until convergence. Ultimately, the simulation outcomes corroborate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme."

Deep networks are vulnerable to such label-corrupted samples due to the memorization effect. One major stream of previous methods concentrates on identifying clean data for training. However, these methods often neglect imbalances in label noise across different mini-batches and devote insufficient attention to out-of-distribution noisy data. To this end, we propose a noise-robust method named Jo-SNC (<bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Jo</b>int sample selection and model regularization based on <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">S</b>elf- and <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</b>eighbor-<bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">C</b>onsistency). Specifically, we propose to employ the Jensen-Shannon divergence to measure the “likelihood” of a sample being clean or out-of-distribution. This process factors in the nearest neighbors of each sample to reinforce the reliability of clean sample identification. We design a self-adaptive, data-driven thresholding scheme to adjust per-class selection thresholds. While clean samples undergo conventional training, detected in-distribution and out-of-distribution noisy samples are trained following partial label learning and negative learning, respectively. Finally, we advance the model performance further by proposing a triplet consistency regularization that promotes self-prediction consistency, neighbor-prediction consistency, and feature consistency. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets and comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach over existing state-of-the-art methods.

Then, we propose a novel ellipse fitting-based shape context descriptor (EFSCD) to correct the ship orientation estimate. The method integrates ellipse fitting for directional estimation with shape context features to handle multiscale variations. Finally, the dynamic programming (DP) technique is used to accurately localize key areas of ship targets. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we contribute a new dataset comprising simulated and measured data for key area identification. Experiments validate the robust performance in recognizing and localizing key areas of ship targets in SAIR images, as well as the superiority in computational time."

    "abstract": "Speaker identification in auditory attention decoding (SI-AAD) aims to identify the attended speaker from electroencephalography (EEG) signals. However, its application for hearing-impaired individuals is limited since existing methods rarely consider altered auditory perception from hearing-assistive devices under mixed-speech conditions, compounded by the lack of relevant datasets and difficulties in learning robust EEG-speech correspondences due to weak cross-modal alignment and insufficient feature extraction. Therefore, we construct five mixed-speech AAD datasets (MS-AAD), serving as the first EEG benchmark to simulate typical device-induced acoustic alterations without spatial cues. To enhance modality alignment, we propose a timbre-enhanced latent alignment (TELA) framework that jointly models latent embeddings and perceptual speaker cues via contrastive learning and auxiliary timbre classification. To further improve EEG-based feature extraction, we design FCTNet, a frequency-channel-temporal attention-based EEG encoder that captures rich neural patterns across multiple domains. Experiments on MS-AAD demonstrate that TELA and FCTNet jointly achieve 89.5% SI-AAD accuracy across diverse hearing conditions, highlighting the critical role of device-simulated acoustic dataset design and perceptually guided representation learning with advanced EEG encoding in mixed-speech SI-AAD for hearing-assistive applications."

Empirical studies over a range of problem parameters show that the asymptotic risk estimate is accurate in finite samples and that the minimax test is significantly better than the chisquared test or a test that only uses collisions. Our analysis involves the reduciion to a structured subset of alternatives, establishing asymptotic normality for linear statistics, and solving an optimization problem over <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>-dimensional sequences that parallels classical results from Gaussian white noise models."

    "abstract": "Accurate fault location is crucial for power system emergency repair. However, the existing fault analysis-based fault location methods for the outgoing line of inverter-based resources use the traditional synchronous generator-based source model as the remote-end source model. The reliance on traditional source characteristics limits the adaptability of these methods in low-frequency transmission system (LFTS) used for offshore wind farm integration, where both ends of the system are inverter-based resource. Therefore, a novel fault location method is proposed for LFTS, which incorporates the source equations and fault network equations. Firstly, the source equations of LFTS are derived from control characteristics, while the network equations are derived from sequence networks and fault boundary conditions. Then, the fault location is converted into an optimization problem. The constrains of source equations, network equations and actual measured values are integrated in the objective functions, thereby the fault distance and fault resistance can be identified by solving optimization problem. Finally, the performance of proposed fault location method is verified in PSCAD/EMTDC. The proposed fault location method exhibits an error of less than 1% in most cases, with a maximum error of less than 4%, and a fault resistance tolerability up to 300 Ω."

    "abstract": "Among various production methods, hydrogen generation via electrolysis powered by renewable energy plays a key role in achieving large-scale green hydrogen production. The triple active bridge isolated dc–dc conversion system exhibits significant application potential in hydrogen production due to its advantages, such as high energy density, wide step-down ratio, and high reliability. However, the output current ripple at the hydrogen production port critically affects the efficiency of the electrolyzer and the hydrogen production rate. Existing studies have limited optimization effects on current ripple and struggle to achieve dynamic optimization, leading to constrained ripple suppression under dynamic operating conditions. To address this issue, this article proposes a low-ripple modulation strategy based on coordinated optimization of inner and outer phase-shift angles for multiport power conversion systems in renewable energy hydrogen production. By establishing an accurate mathematical model, the optimal phase-shift angle combination under minimal current ripple conditions is derived. An improved differential evolution algorithm with adaptive parameter strategy is employed to achieve global optimization under dynamic conditions. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed strategy effectively suppresses current ripple, providing an efficient and reliable solution for hydrogen production from fluctuating renewable energy sources."

A vast and complex body of domain knowledge has emerged as the relationship between electricity consumption and carbon emissions grows increasingly complex. Consequently, there is a growing demand across sectors for intelligent services related to energy and carbon. Large language models (LLMs), with their powerful natural language understanding and generation capabilities, offer a promising foundation to meet these challenges. To enhance the accuracy and domain relevance of LLMs in the carbon field, we introduce a retrieval augmented generation framework that integrates both structured and unstructured carbon-related knowledge. The performance in the domains of energy, electricity, and carbon of the developed question and answer system is validated through testing and evaluation. The system is capable of extracting information from unstructured files and generating text that incorporates accurate details, ultimately supporting the development of intelligent and reliable electric-carbon-related services."

    "abstract": "Read-Copy-Update (RCU) is widely used in the Linux kernel to manage concurrent access to shared data structures. However, improper synchronization when removing RCU-protected hash table entries can lead to stale pointers, inconsistent lookups, and critical use-after-free (UAF) vulnerabilities. This paper investigates a driver-level synchronization issue arising from the omission of explicit synchronize_rcu() calls during hash table updates, using a discovered weakness in the Intel® ICE network driver’s Virtual Function (VF) management. Previous kernel vulnerabilities, such as a bug in the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) subsystem, show how improper RCU synchronization can directly cause kernel crashes. Experimental results demonstrate that removing VF entries without proper synchronization leaves transient stale entries, delays memory reclamation, and results in significant memory fragmentation under rapid insert/delete workloads. RCU hash tables are widely deployed in Linux kernel subsystems such as networking, virtualization, and file systems; improper synchronization can cause memory fragmentation, kernel instability, and out-of-memory (OOM) conditions. Mitigations are proposed, recommending explicit insertion of synchronize_rcu() calls to ensure timely and safe memory reclamation. These findings reinforce established best practices for RCU synchronization, highlighting their importance for maintaining kernel stability and memory safety."

This paper proposes a digital predistortion (DPD) technique based on the Volterra series memory polynomial (MP) model, integrated with deep learning architectures (LSTM, BiLSTM, and self-attention mechanisms) for nonlinear compensation optimization. By employing an indirect learning architecture (ILA) and reverse modeling methodology to extract the nonlinear inverse characteristics of the power amplifier, the proposed approach significantly reduces the parameter complexity inherent in conventional DPD methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the self-attention enhanced neural network model effectively suppresses both in-band distortion and out-of-band spectral regrowth, thereby optimizing signal linearization output."

    "abstract": "Urban rail transit has the advantages of being fast, efficient, and pollution-free, and presents the development trend of large-scale and high-speed in China. With the rapid development of urban rail transit, the DC bias of transformers brought by the invasion of metro stray current into the power grid is becoming more and more prominent, endangering the safe and stable operation of the power system. The causes of DC bias are mainly related to the high voltage DC grounding pole, geomagnetic storms and metro systems. However, the generation and characteristics of stray current in the power grid are very different from the first two. Considering the increasingly close coupling of stray currents between metro and power grids, stray currents in power grids deserve the attention of urban power grid planners. This paper firstly clarifies the mechanism of stray current invasion in urban power grids; secondly, it analyzes the effects and characteristics of DC bias of transformers under the action of stray currents, and puts forward the shortcomings of the existing research; finally, it summarizes and looks forward to the corresponding research progress for the management of stray currents in two categories of source-end and receiver-end. The research results can provide theoretical and technical references for the engineering management of stray currents in power grids."

However, existing approaches often rely on imitation using low-dimensional action steps or motion primitives, which are not effective in capturing the characteristics and diversity of behaviors. In this paper, we propose a condition-guided motion generation framework for a rat-like robot called SMuRo. To model motion distributions at the sequence level, a freely behaving rat dataset is first retargeted to a robot motion dataset. We then design a transformer-based diffusion model that employs cross-attention mechanisms for condition injection. The model directly predicts motion samples and integrates kinematics-based loss functions, enabling the generation of stable motions for robotic execution. Using the nose tip activity area as the condition, we perform repeated conditional motion generation and conduct clustering analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework generates motions that exhibit both diversity and biomimetic characteristics. In common nose tip activity areas, the framework achieves a motion generation success rate of 80 %. This work contributes to improving the biological compatibility of robots within animal groups."

    "abstract": "Despite the substantial progress of deep models for face recognition, it still struggles in efficiently developing face recognition models, due to the high costs and low efficiency of the annotation process. Existing representation learning methods (e.g.CNN-based pre-trained models) are good at extracting features but struggle to disentangle multi-modal facial attributes, leading to entangled uncertainty estimation in latent spaces and biased uncertainty estimation in active learning. Traditional confidence metrics are prone to prediction smoothing in fine-grained tasks, limiting the effectiveness of active sampling. Considering this, this paper proposes the Uncertainty-decoupled Active Learning framework (UDAL), which synergizes variational uncertainty disentanglement with Monte Carlo mutual information (MI)-based sampling for efficient feature extraction and precise uncertainty quantification. To achieve this, UDAL employs the Variational Autoencoder in a co-training manner to enhance the discriminability of latent features. Then, Bayesian MI estimation can be realized via Monte Carlo dropout explicitly distinguishes epistemic uncertainty from aleatoric uncertainty, prioritizing annotation of semantically ambiguous samples. Our experiment results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves a 2.20% performance gain over the existing SOTA active learning methods on the MRFD face dataset."

This study evaluates and combines three classification models Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Artificial Neural Network), and Fuzzy using the UCI Credit Card dataset with 30,000 records and 25 features. The data were preprocessed through normalization, irrelevant feature removal, and split into 80% training and 20% testing. Model performance was assessed with Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and AUC. Results show that XGBoost achieved the highest accuracy (95.61%, AUC = 0.95), Fuzzy obtained the highest recall (0.94), while ANN reached perfect precision (1.00). The hybrid Artificial Neural Networks-Xgboost model provided a balanced trade-off between precision and recall, whereas Artificial Neural Networks-Fuzzy performed the weakest. These findings highlight that XGBoost is the most effective model for accuracy, Fuzzy is more sensitive in detecting defaults, and Artificial Neural Networks-Xgboost offers a practical balance for credit risk management. Future improvements may involve data balancing techniques such as SMOTE to enhance sensitivity to minority cases."

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the stability challenges associated with high-penetration renewable energy grids, with particular emphasis on key engineering issues related to grid-forming energy storage systems. Based on multiple demonstration projects conducted in Kezhou, Xinjiang, Shache, and other locations, the study systematically conducts electromagnetic transient modeling simulations and field tests. These analyses reveal 12 typical problems categorized into four major areas: insufficient model compatibility and accuracy, flawed control strategies and logic, dynamic response and stability deficiencies, and improper strategy configuration. In response to these issues, a set of systematic solutions has been developed and implemented: at the model level, the user-defined (UD) module was reconfigured to a standardized 50-μs simulation step, and the inertia-damping coefficient matching relationship was optimized using Lyapunov stability theory, achieving a dynamic error convergence of 0.1pu; at the control level, the fault judgment logic threshold was adjusted to ensure compliance with reactive power support standards, and control strategies and logic were unified to meet dynamic response requirements; symmetrical and asymmetrical current limits were standardized to 3.0pu, and the accuracy of sequence component calculations was improved through the adoption of an enhanced double dq rotating coordinate system; at the strategy configuration level, voltage dead zones were eliminated and reactive power limits were extended to 3.0pu to enhance grid support capability. Additionally, the rectification cycle was shortened through coordinated project management. All proposed solutions were validated through electromagnetic transient simulations, hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) tests, and on-site artificial short-circuit tests. The results demonstrate that the reactive power support rate reaches 100%, the amplitude of power fluctuations is reduced by 75%, and oscillation risks are completely eliminated. These improvements significantly enhance the fault ride-through and grid support performance of grid-forming equipment. Furthermore, the reusable technical framework and practical engineering experience derived from this study provide critical support for the large-scale deployment of the new power system and contribute to the stable operation of high-penetration renewable energy grids under the \"dual-carbon\" strategy."

This paper examines the role of intelligent Cloud Operations (AI-Augmented CloudOps) in linking EAM with the IT4IT operating model. First, AI-Augmented CloudOps is viewed as an operational capability in the Detect-to-Correct value stream, using AI to enable predictive monitoring, failure detection, and self-healing. Second, it is treated as a digital product whose lifecycle spans all four IT4IT value streams. The proposed model was implemented in a real-world organization, where OpenStack and Ceph-based automation enabled secure and sovereign cloud deployment with continuous architectural compliance. The system automatically generates optimized architecture recommendations based on existing organizational assets and performs fully offline and automated deployment. The results demonstrate significant reductions in incident response time, downtime, and operational costs. Moreover, the model enables the delivery of stable, secure, and governance-compliant digital services— particularly critical in highly regulated industries—while also addressing challenges such as technical complexity, the need for specialized expertise, and ensuring security in offline environments."

    "abstract": "As a fundamental motion mode of legged robots, jumping can significantly enhance their mobility and terrain adaptability. However, due to the high mobility involved, jumping places stringent demands on real-time trajectory planning. This paper presents a real-time jumping trajectory planning and control method for wheeled biped robots (WBRs). A dual-mass spring (DMS) model is employed to simplify the description of the robot's jumping dynamic behavior and decouples the planning in the vertical and horizontal directions. By solving two nonlinear programming (NLP) problems, the spring parameters in each motion phase and the center of mass (CoM) motion sequence in the horizontal direction are optimized, generating a jump trajectory with precise control over both height and distance. The proposed method can significantly reduce the dimensionality of the optimization variables, thereby improving solution efficiency. Whole-body control is then applied for trajectory tracking. Experimental validation on a human-scale WBR demonstrates the successful achievement of stable jumping."

    "abstract": "Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are a type of gas that is highly detrimental to the environment, accounting for up to 80% of total global greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, it is not surprising that researchers recognize the need to conduct immediate research on CO2 emissions. Besides that, making predictions without using intelligent tools often results in wrong decisions. In the meantime, Backpropagation has gained widespread use for prediction as one of the algorithms that exhibits intelligence. In turn, research on CO2 is a significant research challenge today. That is why this research aims to predict CO2 emissions using the Backpropagation method, based on the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The findings of this study revealed that the CO2 gas emission prediction had an RMSE of 0.063 and an MAE of 0.032. These findings indicate that the proposed model in this study can predict well, with no significant signs of overfitting, and yields a prediction result with low error."

    "abstract": "To accomplish more complex tasks, multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) often operate in formation, making the formation control of UAV swarm systems a focal point of research. Due to the inherent nonlinearity and uncertainties in UAV swarm systems, formation control remains challenging, particularly when swift and accurate formation (SAF) is required. This article proposes a constraint-following-based adaptive robust swift and accurate formation control (ARSAFC) for UAV swarm systems, which accounts for unknown time-varying uncertainties. The UAV swarm system is modeled as an artificial swarm, where ideal swarm behavior serves as the target equality constraint for formation. The formation control problem is then converted into a constraint-following problem. To meet the SAF requirements, user-defined hard-limit functions are introduced, and the SAF requirements are formulated as inequality constraints. A diffeomorphism approach is adopted to uniformly transform both classes of constraints into new equality constraints. An adaptive robust control strategy is introduced to handle uncertainties, featuring an adaptive law that online estimates the bounds of uncertainties and counteracts their influence. The proposed formation control approach is validated for robustness and effectiveness via rigorous proofs and simulations."

By integrating PIN diodes, the system can dynamically alternate among various modes. A comprehensive investigation into the dispersion properties and transmission characteristics of these diodes in different states was undertaken to elucidate the fundamental theory and method. The guiding wave amplitude and phase can be manipulated in real time when the diodes are switched between ON and OFF states. For amplitude control, the propagating waves transition from bandpass (ON state) to bandstop (OFF state) characteristics. The measured -3 dB passband ranges from 3 to 8.1 GHz, while the measured -10 dB stopband ranges from 3.7 to 5.6 GHz. As for phase control, the measured dual-band phase shifts range from 192° to 203° and 248° to 292° in the 3.1-3.4 GHz and 6.1-9.4 GHz frequency bands, respectively. The demonstrated ability to control both amplitude and phase opens up possibilities for tunable SSPPs in advanced multifunctional microwave devices."

These values are derived from perceptual and physiological responses of touch receivers rather than natural behaviors of touchers. Herein, we observe untrained touchers in delivering pleasant touch as gentle strokes to a receiver's forearm through high-resolution force and position measurement using an instrumented brush. Twenty participants delivered about eleven strokes in each of five trials, yielding data on stroke velocity, force, duration, and length. The cohort deployed forces (0.37 N ± 0.24, 2 SD) near 0.4 N, but stroking velocities (13.7 cm/s ± 8.8, 2 SD) slightly higher than typically considered “optimal” (1-10 cm/s). We observed no correlation between stroke force and velocity, which led us to consider these factors jointly in characterizing an individual's brushing strategy. Moreover, while the cohort of participants exhibited a compact range of forces and velocities, individuals tended to occupy only subsets of this range with high repeatability across trials. Altogether, the findings suggest a need to further evaluate the velocity range between 10-30 cm/s and to jointly consider force, velocity, and consistency in characterizing an individual's brushing strategy."

Candidate RIS locations are identified via reflection- and scattering-based heuristics using calibrated electromagnetic models within the Sionna Ray Tracing (RT) engine. Outage users are clustered to reduce deployment complexity, and the tradeoff between coverage gains and infrastructure cost is systematically evaluated. It is shown that achieving meaningful coverage improvement in urban areas requires a dense deployment of large-aperture RIS units, raising questions about cost-effectiveness. To facilitate reproducibility and future research, the complete simulation framework and RIS deployment algorithms are provided as opensource software."

Due to their vastness, limited evasion possibilities for trains, and their long braking distances, ensuring the safety of these networks is challenging and can be improved through the application of deep learning. While the localization of objects in the track bed is a common topic, the classification of obstacles is not yet solved robustly for all relevant classes at a high-performance level. This study proposes an architecture tailored to the specific characteristics of track bed images based on a ResNet-50 backbone, leveraging individual characteristics of those images (i.e. high frequency noise, repetitive textures) and significantly reducing misclassifications in this problem domain. Using a five-fold cross-validation and a dataset of 2,003 images in six classes, an average balanced accuracy of 99.26 % can be achieved, outperforming the baseline model (98.50 %) and thereby reducing misclassifications by approximately 46 %. We demonstrate that rather than increasing model complexity, leveraging domain-specific characteristics can lead to highest accuracies. This will enable the application of automatic railway surveillance in the future to ultimately enhance security."

We propose a novel frozen set design approach for polar codes with dynamic frozen bits that guarantees the best possible trade-offs between closed-form bounds on successive cancellation (SC) and maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding error probabilities, where the ML bound is the union bound parameterized by the ensemble-averaged weight distribution. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method to generate Pareto-optimal frozen sets for these dual objectives. The low complexity of generating the frozen set Pareto front stems from our analysis of the bounds. Experimental results show that the resulting polar codes with dynamic frozen bits and near-uniformly distributed frozen bit expressions outperform the state-of-the-art codes under successive cancellation list (SCL) decoding with list sizes ranging from 2 to 16. These results suggest promising applications for next-generation wireless communication systems requiring both high reliability and computational efficiency."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a quantized penalty gradient (QPG) detection algorithm for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). To tackle the challenges of maximum likelihood (ML) detection under discrete constraints, we reformulate the detection problem into an unconstrained optimization by introducing two customized penalty functions that promote alignment between the estimated signals and target constellation set. Based on this, the QPG algorithm is developed to efficiently solve the resulting problem, achieving competitive detection performance with only second-order computational complexity. We further provide a theoretical analysis establishing the Lipschitz continuity of the objective function, which guarantees the monotonic descent property of QPG and ensures its convergence. Moreover, we prove that QPG efficiently finds the local minima with an accessible linear convergence rate, thus leading to an explicit trade-off between detection performance and computational complexity. Finally, simulation results confirm the significant performance gains of QPG over the conventional quantized detectors across various channel conditions, while maintaining low computational complexity."

    "abstract": "Sustainable supply chain operations that emphasize environmental and social welfare have drawn significant attention. Supply chain members and governments are increasingly implementing incentive strategies to promote sustainability. This paper develops a game-theoretical model of a sustainable supply chain to examine the effectiveness of cooperative advertising under different government subsidy schemes. We consider that the supply chain consists of a green manufacturer and a retailer who sells a green product through advertising. The manufacturer can share advertising costs with the retailer, a strategy known as cooperative advertising, while the government can offer either the advertising subsidy or the consumption subsidy to support sustainability. Our analytical findings uncover that cooperative advertising may not always benefit the sustainable supply chain. Without the government subsidy, cooperative advertising is beneficial to the manufacturer, consumers, and the government only when the negative effect of cooperative advertising is mild; however, it is always detrimental to the retailer. In contrast, when a government subsidy is provided, not engaging in cooperative advertising is always superior. On the other hand, we find that government subsidies are always effective in facilitating sustainable supply chain operations, with the consumption subsidy outperforming the advertising subsidy. We further extend the model to explore the scenarios under (i) the manufacturer encroachment and (ii) a marginal advertising cost. We find the major findings remain valid in two extensions. This study not only contributes to the existing literature on sustainable supply chain management, but also offers practical insights for firms and governments to design incentive mechanisms."

    "abstract": "Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) is emerging as a transformative tool for synthetic dataset generation in Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS). Traditional Autonomous Vehicle (AV) datasets face high collection costs, limited edge-case diversity and scalability challenges, making alternative data generation approaches essential. This paper introduces an innovative application of multi-modal generative AI models for AV perception tasks with a focus on ADAS applications. Specifically, the study explores Text-to-Image (T2I), Text-to-Video (T2V), Image-to-Video (I2V), and Image-to-Image (I2I) models to generate high-fidelity data for object detection, segmentation, and trajectory prediction. Despite their promise, practical deployment is obstructed by prompt adherence failures, mode collapse, uncontrollability, domain adaptation inconsistencies, and computational inefficiencies. We provide a comparative evaluation of these models, benchmarking their realism, consistency and adaptability in bridging the synthetic-to-real gap and enhancing AV robustness. Experimental results highlight the strengths and limitations of different approaches, with insights into controllable data synthesis and improvements in real-time efficiency. Furthermore, YOLO models fine-tuned on generative AI-generated datasets achieve superior detection performance with GAI_YOLOv7 reaching 74.48% mAP and GAI_YOLOv8x achieving 76.16% mAP, outperforming VR-based models (29.76%, 23.44%)."

    "abstract": "This study presents a soft, wearable shoulder exosuit designed to assist shoulder abduction and flexion through adaptive gravity compensation. In contrast to traditional rigid exoskeletons that often restrict natural movement and are limited to controlled environments, the proposed system features a lightweight, tendon-driven architecture that preserves mobility while providing effective support during shoulder-intensive activities. The exosuit integrates a dual-motor Bowden cable actuation system with a real-time control strategy that dynamically aligns assistive forces with the users voluntary motion. This responsive design reduces muscular effort and supports sustained activity by adapting assistance levels in real time. Experimental evaluations with eight healthy participants demonstrated significant reductions in muscle activation, namely 36% in the anterior deltoid, 29% in the medial deltoid, and 27% in the trapezius. Prioritizing portability, modularity, and user comfort, the exosuit offers a compelling alternative to bulkier assistive systems. By combining a soft, wearable form factor with synchronized, multi-degreeof-freedom assistance, it highlights a promising direction for shoulder-assistive technologies suited for daily and occupational use."

    "abstract": "We investigate direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation for airborne sound sources using a tetrahedral microphone array, addressing key challenges in drone detection and situational awareness applications. Practical deployment of DoA systems is often constrained by computational demands, stringent calibration requirements, and susceptibility to sensor failures. To address these limitations, we propose MADANet, a lightweight signal processing pipeline coupled with a pairwise attention-based neural architecture designed for robust performance under sensor failure scenarios. The architecture extracts magnitude, phase, and geometric features for each microphone pair from resampled acoustic signals (4-20 kHz), selects active frames via energy gating, and embeds these features through a shared multilayer perceptron before applying multi-head self-attention for adaptive fusion. A structured sensor dropout mechanism is introduced to mask feature pairs from randomly deactivated microphones and normalize attention weights accordingly. Experiments conducted in a semi-anechoic chamber demonstrate that down-sampling to 4 kHz and using four attention heads minimizes mean spherical error, approaching the Cramér-Rao lower bound for the given array geometry. The model exhibits strong generalization to single and double-microphone failure scenarios, maintaining sub-degree accuracy."

The research develops a comprehensive multi-objective optimization framework that simultaneously addresses voltage stability, unserved energy minimization, economic considerations, traffic congestion patterns, amenity density, and proximity to generation sources. The methodology employs a <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$10 \\times 12$</tex> urban grid configuration interfaced with the IEEE 118-bus power system to evaluate JSO performance against established algorithms, including Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA). These determined locations maintain voltage levels close to nominal values, minimize power losses, and feature high amenity density with moderate congestion probability, all strategically positioned near high-capacity generators to ensure reliable power supply while minimizing transmission losses. The JSO algorithm successfully determines optimal EVCS placement achieving to practical constraints like space availability and while demonstrating superior convergence characteristics and solution robustness. Comparative analysis shows JSO performs competitively against PSO and outperforms SCA, with greater robustness This research advances EVCS deployment strategies by balancing technical, economic, and social factors, potentially accelerating EV adoption through more efficient charging infrastructure."

    "abstract": "This research paper is a work in progress to establish if Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) is a viable solution to the transport problem of servicing non-regular trips in non-urban areas. Public transport/shared transport and private cars is an important resource for people to get from their origin to their destination or vice versa. These origin-to-destination trips could be for example work commutes or shopping trips. With increased focus on sustainability from environmental and economic standpoints, more innovative means of public transport are being devised. Policies and goals such as the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals have ensured that it is a priority that public transport becomes more sustainable and the level of private car usage decreases. While innovative transport solutions have been applied in urban centres and cities such as MaaS integration, ridesharing, and multimodal solutions, non-urban areas remain under-resourced. There are a few attributed reasons for poor non-urban transport solutions such as a lack of demand, sparsely populated areas, and the travel distances involved in supplying transport. The use of active modes such as walking and cycling is more challenging in non-urban areas due to the travel distances involved. The goal of this research is to develop an agent-based transport model with integrated MaaS services to establish whether MaaS transport could positively impact shared transport uptake in non-urban areas for non-regular journeys which consequently would lead to decreased private car usage, decreased emissions, improved social inclusion, and establishing how sustainable a MaaS solution is in these poorly serviced areas. This research also investigates whether attractive nodes, such as points of interest in the transport network, could also increase the uptake of shared transport."

Katalon Studio applies this method to a scenario consisting of user stories, feature files, and step definitions. NLP algorithms describe and analyze user story data to ensure the proper requirements for writing user stories. Uipath Studio creates an application workflow and test cases using a BDD template. The test application is built based on two different developments: traditional code (XAMPP-PHP) and low code (Oracle Apex and Retools) to enrich the GUI features of the application to be tested. The total points obtained from the three test parameters consisting of test constraints, running tests, and response times are 10 for Selenium Ide, 15 for Uipath Studio, and 10 for Katalon Studio. Eight test cases run on Uipath Studio, while only five run on Katalon Studio and Selenium Ide. Katalon Studio has minor testing constraints with 2 test constraints, and the fastest response time with BDD verification is Uipath Studio, with an average test time of 24.8 seconds."

Multi-objective optimization offers a robust framework for addressing this challenge by simultaneously optimizing conflicting objectives, such as fairness and accuracy. In this work, we leverage causal graphs to model dependencies and identify potential sources of bias. We evolve directed acyclic graphs that represent causal structures, optimizing them for fairness and accuracy using evolutionary computational methods. Our approach employs multi-objective optimization to explore trade-offs between these objectives, enabling the discovery of solutions that balance ethical considerations with performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the multi-objective framework effectively improves fairness while maintaining competitive accuracy alongside building causal graphs. This approach provides a scalable and interpretable solution for mitigating bias in machine learning models, paving the way for more responsible and transparent AI applications."

Quality control must ensure that product quality meets product standards, is consistent, and reliably as intended. Previously, quality control still used traditional or even manual technology, resulting in slow work speeds, prone to errors, impractical, and less efficient for large-scale production. However, along with the rapid development of technology, computer vision has emerged as a new game changer, giving rise to the idea of creating quality control using computer vision. By considering aspects of image processing and machine learning, quality control using a computer vision system can detect nonconforming bottles and cans quickly and accurately, such as measuring product dimensions, and classifying them into products that must be recycled or unfit for release to the market. This detector uses the YOLOv8, YOLOv10, and YOLOv12 methods. Based on the experiment that YOLOv12 achieved the best accuracy in detecting plastic bottles where mAP50, mAP 50-95 are 92%, 59%, followed by YOLOv8 which is 88% and 61%, However for defect detection in Cans accuracy with mAP50, mAP 50-95 for YOLOv12 is 93%, 86%, followed by YOLOv8 which is 89% and 87%.

Five healthy subjects participated in the underwater diving experiments. The recognition results demonstrated that the proposed method achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.2157 rad (3.43% of the kicking cycle) at both MHF and MHE events, surpassing the existing single-phase reset process by reducing the MAE across the entire cycle by 22.6%. The algorithm exhibited robustness under variable flutter kick frequencies and minimized sensor complexity (two inertial measurement units). These findings demonstrate promising potential for future application in the assistance control of underwater exoskeletons."

    "abstract": "The expansion of 5G Non-Standalone (NSA) networks has made E-UTRA NR Dual Connectivity (ENDC) an essential capability for user equipment, driving the need for efficient performance evaluation. While Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) Over-the-Air (OTA) testing serves as the standard validation method, existing approaches fail to adequately evaluate ENDC MIMO performance. This is because such assessment typically requires two synchronized channel emulators—a solution that is both complex and costly. This paper introduces a practical Symmetric Per-Link Evaluation (SPLE) method that overcomes this limitation. The approach divides ENDC testing into two phases: the NR link is evaluated firstly under static UMa CDL-C fading using a channel emulator while the LTE link is held stable, then the roles of the two links are reversed. This symmetric solution enables the separate evaluation of MIMO performance for each Radio Access Technology (RAT) using only one channel emulator. The proposed SPLE provides a cost-effective and efficient way for comprehensive ENDC MIMO OTA testing. It delivers critical insights for R&D debugging and performance benchmarking."

    "abstract": "Monitoring and classifying vegetative drought in tropical agricultural areas requires reliable spatial-temporal indicators and precise predictive modeling. This study presents a new computational approach for aridity classification by combining five satellite imagery-based vegetation indices (NDVI, SAVI, VCI, TCI, and VHI) using machine learning algorithms (KNN and SVM), together with ordinary kriging for spatial interpolation. We use Landsat-8 OLI/TIRS imagery from 2014 to 2018 in Boyolali Regency, Central Java, Indonesia. Pearson correlation analysis showed a robust relationship between NDVI and SAVI (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$r=1.000$</tex>) and between NDVI and VHI (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$r=0.925$</tex>), while TCI showed a negative correlation with the other two. This predictive modeling produced high accuracy for VCI and VHI, with MAPE values below 7 % for both KNN and SVM. Compared with prior Central Java studies using ensemble trees and IDW, our baseline KNN/SVM with ordinary kriging remains competitive on VCI/VHI (MAPE <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$=5.55- \\mathbf{6. 5 8 \\%}$</tex>) across 2014-2018 while enabling LULC-aware interpretation. The predictions are then interpolated via ordinary kriging to obtain spatial drought-risk maps. The results indicate that agricultural and residential areas are most affected by vegetative drought. The proposed machine learning provides a replicable spatial framework for drought monitoring by integrating remote sensing and geostatistics, which can support informed land management and climate adaptation decisions in data-limited tropical regions."

    "abstract": "Grasp planning for multi-fingered dexterous hands presents a formidable challenge. Existing mainstream learning-based methods regard the joint angles of the dexterous hand as both the grasp representation and the objective function for optimization. However, the high degree of freedom (DOF) characteristic of multi-fingered dexterous hands allows for multiple joint angle configurations to correspond to the same grasp, which complicates the learning process. Furthermore, the coupling of joint angles can propagate errors during the grasping process, diminishing the grasp success rate. In this work, we have decoupled the mechanical structure of the dexterous hand from its grasp representation. We introduce the circular equation that tend to stable grasping to model the contact points and subsequently employ inverse kinematic (IK) to translate these contact points into the grasp configuration of the dexterous hand. Leveraging this grasp representation, we have developed a fully automated annotation pipeline within a simulated environment and have constructed a dataset encompassing 40 objects across more than a thousand varied scenarios, totaling more than 20K entries. We propose an efficient per-point grasp generation network, PP-graspnet, for collection of multi-fingered grasp points in cluttered scenes. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."

The primary focus of this paper is the design and fabrication of a sweat capacitive sensor based on spiral channels and spiral electrodes. The flow of liquid within the channel was theoretically derived and verified through experiments. By comparing with traditional sweat sensors that use interdigitated electrodes and serpentine channels, the superiority of the spiral sweat capacitive sensor in sweat measurement was verified from both theoretical and experimental perspectives."

    "abstract": "Universities are adopting conversational tools for coursework, yet evidence is mixed on what drives students’ intention to use them in higher education, especially in Metro Manila. Prior work rarely integrates credibility factors with belief-based predictors, so we test information quality and source trustworthiness alongside effort and performance expectancy to explain intention. Using a cross-sectional research design, primary data were collected through an online survey distributed via email and WhatsApp to students from Metro Manila. A total of 256 valid responses were analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). The results reveal that source trustworthiness has a significant impact on both effort expectancy and performance expectancy, while effort expectancy has a strong predictive relationship with performance expectancy. In turn, performance expectancy is the most significant predictor of intention to use ChatGPT. However, the study found that information quality does not significantly influence performance expectancy, and effort expectancy does not directly influence intention to use. The study’s novelty is the integrated UTAUT–ELM model estimated on a Manila student sample, clarifying how credibility shapes usefulness beliefs and intention. Practically, instructors should emphasize transparent use, verification scaffolds, and course-aligned examples to raise perceived usefulness and credibility."

However, the control accuracy of the PMLM system is largely affected by parameter uncertainties, and thus has a great impact on whether the unmanned ground vehicle swarm can respond to commands efficiently and accurately. To address this problem, this paper employs a state transition method that converts bounded states to unbounded states so that the output states of the system are subject to the desired boundary constraints. Subsequently, this paper builds a new robust control strategy. The goal of this control strategy is to ensure that the uncertainty control system has consistent boundedness and consistent final boundedness."

    "abstract": "An imbalanced dataset has become a critical challenge to achieving ideal performance in classification. One of the most frequently used methods to overcome this problem is oversampling. In the case of image oversampling, DeepSMOTE was one of the options that has outperformed several GAN-based methods. DeepSMOTE implemented a set of MLP layers for image processing. However, as deep learning capabilities have grown, alternative studies have also emerged, leading to Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), which may replace MLP in some circumstances. This study is intended to integrate BSRBF-KAN as one of the most implemented KANs, in order to solve the imbalanced dataset problem. The conducted experiments showed that BSRBF-KAN is quite comparable with MLP in terms of performance evaluation. Additionally, BSRBF-KAN outperformed MLP in the majority of cases with respect to latent representation size, but remained comparable in terms of number of trainable parameters. Regarding to the experimental results, it can be concluded that KAN can be an analogous architecture to MLP for solving image oversampling problems.

To capture their sentiment, this research conducted sentiment analysis on a sample of 11,000 comments from X (Twitter), Instagram, YouTube, and Facebook. A model using a Simple Recurrent Neural Network (Simple-RNN) and bidirectional architecture performed the best in the positive category, achieving precision and recall metrics of 88% and F1-score close to 90%. For the negative category, recall was 84% and precision was 75%. For neutral sentiment, recall dropped to 72%.

However, due to the varying resolutions and viewing, the target exhibits multi-scale characteristics with discontinuous scattering. Meanwhile, anchor-based detectors often require intensive hyperparameter tuning and introduce redundancy. To address these issues, we propose an anchor-free network for multi-scale SAR aircraft detection method with strip pooling attention enhancement. We employed feature pyramids network to handle the multi-scale nature of aircrafts. Specifically, we designed a multi-scale global feature fusion module (MGFFM) in the neck, which captuers both multi-scale receptive fields and global contextual features. Given the discontinuity of scattering, MGFFM leverages the strip pooling attention to built long-range dependencies, enhancing the global perception ability. Extensive experiments on the public SAR AIRcraft-1.0 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method."

AES systems play a critical role in education by providing fast and consistent feedback, yet they face persistent challenges in handling varied vocabulary, often misinterpreting correct concepts expressed with different wording. To address this limitation, the Rabin-Karp algorithm, which applies hashing for efficient text pattern matching, is extended with synonym recognition and systematic parameter tuning. Specifically, the effects of the k-gram value (k) and prime base (b) are analyzed to determine their impact on scoring accuracy. Evaluation using Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) demonstrates that smaller k-gram values, particularly k = 2, consistently deliver superior accuracy. In contrast, larger k-grams reduce reliability due to natural variations in student writing that limit exact sequence matches. The most accurate configurations were k = 2 and b = 7 without synonym recognition, and k = 2 and b = 13 with synonym recognition. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating synonym recognition into AES, as it enables systems to capture conceptual equivalence and provide fairer, more reliable assessments. The results contribute to advancing AES methodologies by demonstrating how algorithmic optimization can enhance semantic sensitivity in automated scoring."

    "abstract": "Biometric and manual attendance systems are subject to human error, proxy attendance, and issues of hygiene. In order to counter these drawbacks, this paper suggests a contactless, real-time attendance management system that utilizes existing CCTV infrastructure in conjunction with sophisticated face detection and recognition methods. The system utilizes Haar Cascade classifiers for efficient face localization and FaceNet embeddings for strong identity verification, combined with AES-256 encryption and role-based access control for protection and privacy. In contrast to earlier works that are expensive due to the need for special hardware or degrade under realistic conditions, the proposed system is highly robust against difficult situations like low lighting, occlusion, and crowd density. Largescale experiments on more than 2,500 facial images and classroom pilot runs indicate that the system is 96.8 % accurate, 95.1 % precise, and has a mean response time of 1.2 seconds per individual, beating traditional manual, biometric, and webcam-based methods. Through its accuracy, security, and scalability, the suggested system offers a viable solution for large-scale institutions and sets the stage for future extensions like liveness detection, edge deployment, and multi-location synchronization."

Under a low power incidence, minimal insertion loss (IL) is experienced by transmitted signals. Conversely, when exposed to high power incidence, the bottom ESS is switched to a reflective state. Signals are subjected to multiple internal reflections within the structure, resulting in significant absorption loss and effective high-power microwave (HPM) dissipation. Design results demonstrate that an IL below -1.5 dB is exhibited by the proposed absorptive ESS across its passband from 8.7 to 9.8 GHz. Under HPM incidence, a shielding effectiveness (SE) exceeding 12 dB and an absorption efficiency greater than 85% are achieved simultaneously."

Suboptimal configurations can degrade diagnostic accuracy and reliability, making hyperparameter tuning essential. This study evaluates the impact of the Optuna tuning framework on an MLP model for automated thyroid diagnosis. The methodology involved using a public UCI dataset, data preprocessing, training a baseline MLP, and performing extensive hyperparameter optimization with Optuna to maximize the F1-score. This research provides an empirical evaluation of Optuna's effectiveness, showing that classification accuracy increased by 11.6 percentage points (from 0.837 to 0.954) and the macro F1-score rose by 21.3 percentage points (from 0.721 to 0.933) compared to the baseline model, with a particularly noteworthy improvement in recall for the minority classes. Optuna successfully identified a more complex and effective two-hidden-layer architecture. In conclusion, hyperparameter optimization using Optuna is highly effective for enhancing the accuracy and reliability of MLP models in thyroid diagnosis. This approach overcomes the limitations of suboptimal configurations, affirming that meticulous tuning is a critical step in developing robust clinical decision-support systems."

We design a scheduling algorithm with lightweight network state representation, considering device availability, communication on the network link, priority-aware pre-emption, and task deadlines. The scheduling algorithm aims to reduce latency by designing a resource availability representation, as well as a network discretisation and a dynamic bandwidth estimation mechanism. We implement the scheduling algorithm into a system composed of four Raspberry Pi 2 (model Bs) mobile edge devices, sampling a waste classification conveyor belt at a set frame rate. The system is evaluated and compared to a previous approach of ours, which was proven to outcompete work-stealers and a non-pre-emption based scheduling heuristic under the aforementioned waste classification scenario. Our findings show the novel lower latency abstraction models yield better performance under high-volume workloads, with the dynamic bandwidth estimation assisting the task placement while, ultimately, increasing task throughput in times of resource scarcity."

By tuning the gating frequency, we achieve flexible control over the effective gate width, enabling precise optimization of detection conditions. Shorter gate widths, achieved at higher frequencies, reduce avalanche carrier generation and suppress noise from dark carriers, thereby narrowing the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of photon peaks. Amplitude histograms clearly resolve multi-photon events. Key PNR performance metrics, such as the 1-photon peak voltage, voltage separation, and FWHM, are extracted and analyzed as a function of frequency. The results demonstrate that while increasing frequency improves resolution and reduces noise, it also reduces detection efficiency and statistical confidence due to fewer detected carriers. This trade-off highlights the advantage of sinusoidal gating for flexible, highresolution PNR detection in practical applications."

These anomalous areas closely coincide with the distribution of olivine-rich regions. Olivine has a lower dielectric constant compared to its surroundings, and the TB anomalies may be associated with this lower dielectric constant. (2) We identified the distribution and primary causes of typical TB anomalies in Mare Nectaris, highlighting an anomalous region in the northwest. The anomaly in this region is primarily driven by albedo.

To progress toward surgical automation, we address transoral central airway obstruction (CAO) removal, selecting this procedure for its relatively constrained environment and clear clinical objectives. Prior work has demonstrated successful CAO removal with single-port, minimally invasive robotic systems, making it a promising target for autonomy. We present a new autonomous system designed for CAO removal that integrates a learning-based tissue retraction policy with a model-based resection planner, deployed on a bimanual robotic platform with vision guidance. While our long-term motivation is minimally invasive intervention, we evaluate our approach in an open-surgery setting, enabling rapid development and testing. We evaluate our system in 12 ex vivo CAO removal procedures running at three distinct levels of autonomy. Our results indicate that the learned retraction policy performs similarly or better than a manually designed heuristic, with a mean surgeon-rated score (1-10) of 8.0± 1.6 compared to 6.8± 2.5, and a mean percent tumor volume removal of 113.9± 18.8% compared to 111.9± 13.3%. The model-based resections performed best when supervised, resulting in less tissue damage and better cutting accuracy. Furthermore, our approach produced clinically successful outcomes in all eight supervised autonomous trials. Notably, in one case, the system achieved complete tumor removal without any human intervention. Our overall findings underscore the importance of high-level supervision, revealing targets for future automation."

Firstly, a new barrier Lyapunov function is designed to solve the output asymmetric constraint requirement of the autonomous berthing system, and it is also adaptive to the unconstrained system without changing the control structure. Secondly, the convergence of adaptive fixed-time control and bounded tracking of BLF are combined to conquer the long convergence time and nonlinear system uncertainty. Finally, simulation and field tests are conducted to verify our proposed scheme’s superiority."

This letter introduces a method that employs Riemannian manifold optimization to effectively handle both the constant modulus constraint and dynamic range ratio (DRR) control in array beampattern synthesis. A multi-objective optimization function is developed to ensure uniform mainlobe response, ensure smooth beam transitions, concentrate energy at the beam center, and effectively suppress sidelobes. Additionally, log-sum-exp (LSE) smoothing techniques are utilized to convert non-smooth problems into differentiable forms, precise control of the beam direction is achieved through exponential transformations, and a smoothing term based on the Laplacian matrix is introduced to minimize power deviation between beams. In addition, a DRR constraint is constructed using complex circles, ensuring that the constraint remains rigorously maintained throughout the optimization process. This letter demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method through examples of array pattern optimization under amplitude constraints. The results indicate that the proposed method not only achieves precise main lobe performance but also provides effective sidelobe suppression, all while strictly adhering to the amplitude constraints."

The TP<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>N is based on self-supervised learning architectures MocoV2, SwAv, BT, and DINO; experiments show that DINO with ViT-S as a backbone performs the best.

Further improvement is achieved by the frame-level BofN meta-tracker effectively handling variations in the tracking scenarios within long sequences. For instance, on GOT-10k, BofN meta-tracker average overlap is 88.7% and 91.1% with video and frame-level settings, respectively. The best performing tracker, RTS, achieves 85.20% AO. On VOT2022, BofN expected average overlap is 67.88% and 70.98% with video and frame level settings, compared to the best performing ARTrack, 64.12%.

    "abstract": "To investigate the temperature characteristics of a laterally double-diffused metal oxide semiconductor (LDMOS) 1000 W shortwave solid-state power amplifier (PA), a comprehensive series of tests has been conducted. The results indicate that the output power (Pout), gain, power-added efficiency (PAE), and two-tone power of the PA all decrease significantly with rising temperature. Additionally, both the second and third harmonics increase as temperature rises. Similar trends were observed during temperature cycle testing. Further analysis reveals that high temperatures can dramatically reduce electron mobility and a reduction in scattering between electrons and the lattice, thereby intensifying self-heating effects. Concurrently, high temperatures can also increase thermal resistance (R<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">th</sub>), which in turn reduces the efficiency of the power amplifier. Moreover, both the second and third harmonics increase linearly with rising temperature. To ensure stable performance of the amplifier across different temperatures, a temperature compensation circuit has been proposed to offset the degradation in performance. This study provides an important reference for the reliability design of LDMOS power amplifiers."

The local constraint between neighboring modes are only known to each subsystem and distributed iteration is performed to satisfy the constraint of each node. The attacker can launch denial of service (DoS) attacks on the communication channel between neighboring nodes, making it impossible to receive the estimates of the neighbor node for iteration when a DoS attack occurs. Hence, a distributed iterative estimation scheme is constructed under DoS attacks, in which the compensation estimate is designed based on its own estimates and the local constraint. Then the convergence conditions are derived to ensure that the estimation error is monotonic and non-increasing in the distributed iterative process. Finally, the validity of the compensation estimates and the convergence of the distributed iterative updates are demonstrated by a collaborative navigation example."

    "abstract": "Quantum memories, which play a critical role in various aspects of quantum networks—such as timing synchronization, fidelity preservation, network performance continuity, and efficient resource management—are not well-suited for practical deployment due to their high cost and complex implementation requirements. For this reason, in our study, we propose a low-cost and easy-to-implement alternative method called soft memory, which does not require any physical quantum memory hardware and is based on a delay-aware routing strategy. Under varying threshold and request time window values, we evaluate two key performance metrics—mean time difference and request success rate—across three types of quantum networks: (i) memoryless quantum networks, (ii) quantum networks equipped with fixed qubit storage time, and (iii) the proposed soft memory architecture. Despite requiring no additional physical hardware, the soft memory approach achieves a request success rate nearly equivalent to that of a quantum memory with 0.15-second storage time, while providing a lower mean time difference."

    "abstract": "Grid-forming (GFM) converters with dc-link voltage-synchronization control (DVSC) are capable of simultaneously regulating dc-link voltage and achieving synchronization with ac grid. However, the interactions between DVSC and dc-link constant power dynamics may lead to low-frequency oscillations (LFOs) of GFM converters. This article develops a dc-link impedance-based equivalent circuit model for GFM converters with DVSC. The analysis reveals that the lack of positive resistance in dc-link impedance leads to LFO instability in GFM converters. To address this issue, a damping method, based on dc-link voltage feedforward (DVF) control is proposed, effectively suppressing oscillations and enhancing dynamic response performances. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed DVF-based damping method implements an active damper on the dc side and avoids inherent synchronous oscillations. Experimental results validate the theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of the proposed damping method."

The proposed control considers the nonlinear structure of the converter-motor system and formulates an optimal control problem that guarantees a unique and global optimum solution in each time step. Furthermore, closed-loop stability is ensured using the discrete-time Lyapunov theory and the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions. A disturbance observer is used to estimate the load torque, enabling precise control and mitigating variations and uncertainties in the parameters. Experimental results in both buck and boost setups demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves faster dynamics, shorter settling times, and more reliable speed regulation compared with traditional methods, for both regulating and tracking speed."

    "abstract": "Energy storage converters and their modulation strategies with high adaptability and operation capabilities considering multiinput and multioutput scenarios are important for meeting the needs of hybrid energy storage systems (HESSs), particularly in low-voltage scenarios such as household-scale microgrids and light EVs. By combining the advantages of battery and supercapacitor, this study proposes a novel partly isolated three-port dc–dc converter (PI3DC) for HESS. This converter is designed based on a partly isolated structure by reusing the high-voltage (HV) side switches. An improved dual phase shift (IDPS) modulation strategy is then introduced to suppress the leakage inductance current peaks by modulating the HV side switches and enabling zero current switching (ZCS) of the battery side switches. Experimental results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed topology and modulation strategies. Compared to the existing modulation strategies, the proposed IDPS modulation strategy can reduce the root mean square (rms) of leakage inductance current by 52% and improve system efficiency by nearly 10% under tested conditions."

By adjusting the inductance and tracking the resonant frequency via switching-frequency control, the proposed converter maintains resonant operation in both charging and discharging modes over the entire voltage and load range, significantly enhancing conversion efficiency. In addition, at the resonant frequency, the proposed bidirectional LLC resonant converter enables the magnetizing inductance to be involved in the resonance, which further reduces the current magnitude in each component compared to conventional LLC converters. A 1.5 kW hardware prototype with a 400 V input and a 240–400 V output range was developed to verify the performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed converter achieves peak efficiencies of 97.27% and 97.43% in charging and discharging modes, respectively."

    "abstract": "Pinching antenna system (PASS) configures the positions of pinching antennas (PAs) along dielectric waveguides to change both large-scale fading and small-scale scattering, which is known as pinching beamforming. A novel non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) assisted PASS framework is proposed for downlink multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications. The transmit power minimization problem is formulated to jointly optimize the transmit beamforming, pinching beamforming, and power allocation. To solve this highly nonconvex problem, both gradient-based and swarm-based optimization methods are developed. 1) For gradient-based method, a majorization-minimization and penalty dual decomposition (MM-PDD) algorithm is developed. The Lipschitz gradient surrogate function is constructed based on MM to tackle the nonconvex terms of this problem. Then, the joint optimization problem is decomposed into subproblems that are alternatively optimized based on PDD to obtain stationary closed-form solutions. 2) For swarm-based method, a fast-convergent particle swarm optimization and zero forcing (PSO-ZF) algorithm is proposed. Specifically, the PA position-seeking particles are constructed to explore high-quality pinching beamforming solutions. Moreover, ZF-based transmit beamforming is utilized by each particle for fast fitness function evaluation. Simulation results demonstrate that: i) The proposed NOMA assisted PASS and algorithms outperforms the conventional NOMA assisted massive antenna system. The proposed framework reduces over 95.22% transmit power compared to conventional massive MIMO-NOMA systems. ii) Swarm-based optimization outperforms gradient-based optimization by searching effective solution subspace to avoid stuck in undesirable local optima."

Firstly, a mathematical model of the brushless DC motor is established, and a multi-motor adjacent cross-coupling structure is designed. By defining tracking errors and synchronization errors, the state correlation between each motor and its adjacent motors is realized. Secondly, a single neuron PID is used to design the error controller, which utilizes the self-learning characteristics of neurons to achieve online tuning of PID parameters, thereby enhancing the antiinterference ability of the system. Finally, a simulation model of the motor synchronization control system is built using Simulink, and the verification is carried out by simulating working conditions with motor parameter differences and sudden load changes. The simulation results show that this strategy can make the motor speed tracking error converge to 0 quickly. When the load changes suddenly, the maximum synchronization error is controlled within $1 \\%$ of the speed. Moreover, compared with the ordinary PID, the single neuron PID significantly reduces torque ripple, effectively improving the multi-motor speed synchronization accuracy and system robustness, which provides technical support for the stable operation of the crossarm installation robot."

Every four seconds, someone around the world is diagnosed with dementia, which can have devastating consequences, including death. Consequently, it is essential to recognize dementia early. Deterioration of cognitive and social capacities, brought on by Alzheimer's disease, reduces a person's ability to live independently and is a major contributor to the worldwide burden of dementia. Dementia patients often experience a gradual erasure of recent memories, which starts in the early stages of the disease and worsens over time. For improved care, a prompt diagnosis is crucial. Determining if a person has mild, moderate, or no dementia is possible with the use of brain MRI imaging. For this classification, this study suggests a model that uses a comparison analysis of multiple deep learning architectures, such as ResNet50, Inception V3, Inception ResNet V2, DenseNet, and MobileNet."

    "abstract": "The coupling interference of electromagnetic pulses (EMP) on aircraft cables can easily lead to the malfunction or paralysis of onboard electronic equipment, severely threatening the survivability and operational effectiveness of the aircraft. Directed irradiation tests were conducted on the aircraft from the left and front using an EMP simulator. The results indicate: (1) When irradiating from the left, there is a positive correlation between the EMP irradiation electric field strength and the oscillation amplitude of the induced current in the cable, regardless of horizontal or vertical polarization. However, no significant positive correlation exists between the peak induced current and the EMP irradiation intensity. (2) When irradiating from the front, the peak induced current in the cable is positively correlated with the EMP irradiation intensity. The induced current exhibits small oscillation attenuation and rapidly returns to a stable state, with similar oscillation durations across different irradiation intensities. The variation in induced current is minimal when the irradiation intensity increases from E1 to E2. (3)The peak induced current from left-side irradiation is significantly higher than that from frontside irradiation. When the irradiation intensity increases from E1 to E2, the oscillation amplitude of the induced current is much greater for left-side irradiation compared to front-side irradiation. These findings provide a basis for assessing the EMP protection capabilities of aircraft electronic equipment and hold significant engineering importance."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a MATLAB/Simulink-based simulation study analyzing five distinct motor architectures in Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs): single-, dual-, tri-motor (front and rear-mounted), and quad-motor configurations. Using a fixed 100 kWh battery pack, performance parameters were evaluated under the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC). Metrics include energy consumption, range, SOC profiles, and 0–100 km/h acceleration. Results show a rise in energy consumption from 21.2 to 24.4 kWh/100 km and improved acceleration from 8.7 s to 5.8 s from 1M to 4M configurations. Estimated range drops as motor count increases, with 1M reaching 4716.98 km and 4M limiting to 4098.36 km. The simulation identifies energy-performance trade-offs that guide optimal powertrain design for future BEVs."

    "abstract": "In the LFMCW (Linear Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave) radar system, the frequency estimation of beat frequency signals is of vital importance for the ranging accuracy. However, the traditional Rife algorithm, due to the misjudgment of the interpolation direction, will generate significant errors in the noisy environment, especially when the real frequency is close to the quantization frequency point. To address these limitations, a novel PD-I-Rife algorithm is proposed. This algorithm first calculates the phase difference between the maximum amplitude spectral line and the adjacent maximum value to determine the interpolation direction. Then, based on the I-Rife algorithm, for different regions where the real frequency is located, it uses more accurate frequency shift factors for interpolation calculation to estimate the frequency value. Theoretical analysis and simulation verification show that the proposed algorithm achieves higher estimation accuracy near the quantization point and maintains stable performance under low SNR conditions, confirming its effectiveness in radar applications."

    "abstract": "Densely integrated microstrip patch arrays require high isolation without sacrificing radiation performance, even at extreme element spacings. Here, two adjacent patches are placed with an inter element center to center spacing of just 0.06  λ₀ (λ₀ referenced to 5.96 GHz), a regime in which mutual coupling is typically severe. We introduce a single layer composite decoupling structure that integrates dual split ring resonators (SRRs) on the radiator with a T-shaped slot in the ground plane. The SRRs elevate the odd mode impedance and suppress surface wave driven coupling, while the T slot increases the shunt surface impedance and disrupts return currents; their co tuned resonances form a hybrid stopband aligned with the operating band. Full wave simulations (CST) show that at 5.96 GHz the inter port isolation improves from −10.6 dB to −41.2 dB, while the input reflection reaches −46.7 dB. The H plane pattern remains essentially unchanged, and the E plane main beam level increases from 5.71 dB to 6.88 dB with sidelobe/backlobe suppression. Even at a spacing of only 0.06 λ₀, the fabrication friendly structure markedly enhances isolation without degrading radiation."

The focus shifts from high-level strategy to ground-level implementation. The first step requires the establishment of an artificial intelligence (AI) governance framework, which includes internal policies, regulatory compliance, oversight mechanisms, and documentation requirements. Next, organizations must build out a small, rapid prototyping squad to work on quick, high-impact pilot projects. This squad should use process mining to identify specific, broken internal processes that need fixing. The team should then select the appropriate AI tool based on the broken process’s need: machine learning for prediction, generative AI for creation, or an AI agent for autonomous actions. Success is measured via prototypes by assessing performance versus the human baseline."

However, The centralized bidding and clearing mechanism based on short-run marginal costs (SRMC) fails to adequately reflect the system regulation value of conventional energy units in new power systems, thereby makes the full recovery of their operating costs difficult. To address this issues, this paper proposes a dual-market trading mechanism. First, a dual-market bidding framework is proposed that incorporates supply-demand uncertainty, where the value of energy products from different market participants is assessed and categorized along three dimensions: energetic attributes, spatio-temporal controllability, and stochasticity. Next, a dual-market trading mechanism is developed by establishing controllable and uncontrollable energy markets with customized pricing and clearing rules. Finally, case studies are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism."

Traditional traffic control systems, based on fixed-time schedules, cannot dynamically adapt to fluctuating traffic conditions. This paper presents a dual-layer intelligent traffic signal control framework that integrates deep learning-based traffic flow prediction with reinforcement learning-driven adaptive signal optimization. Short-term traffic flow is predicted using CNN and RNN models trained on the PeMS dataset, while real-time detection of vehicles and emergency prioritization is enhanced through GPS and audio-based sensing. The reinforcement learning layer, implemented with DQN and PPO agents, optimizes traffic light phases using reward signals that balance wait-time reduction, flow efficiency, and emergency vehicle passage. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system reduces average waiting time from 120 s to 84 s, improves flow efficiency from 65 % to 88 %, and increases emergency prioritization accuracy to 92 %. The framework, deployed on real-world data streams, highlights the potential of combining predictive deep learning with adaptive reinforcement learning for scalable and sustainable urban traffic management."

    "abstract": "To investigate the effects of targeted training on attentional neuroplasticity, this study developed a training system with adaptive difficulty that acts on the three attentional subsystems: alerting, orienting, and executive control. Through a rigorous controlled experiment, we collected participants' electroencephalography (EEG) data and behavioral performance on a battery of standard paradigms (including ANT, Stroop, etc.) before and after training. The core neurophysiological finding, derived from the analysis of event-related Global Field Power (GFP), was that the training group displayed a more robust, cross-task neural activation pattern within critical post-stimulus processing windows compared to the control group. This result provides direct evidence that the training can reshape the neural underpinnings of attention. Crucially, this neural gain successfully transferred to a complex human-machine operation task, in which trained participants achieved significant improvements in both operational precision and response efficiency. In summary, this research demonstrates that the training system can effectively induce dual gains at both the neural and behavioral levels, which possess broad transfer value."

Subsequently, a nonlinear controller is designed based on nonvector space theory, and system stability is proven through the construction of Lyapunov functions, addressing the control accuracy deficiencies of traditional vector space methods in strongly coupled flexible arms. The simulation experiment results demonstrate the precise convergence and stability of the proposed controller, meeting the requirements of highprecision image alignment tasks in robotics and mechatronics applications."

    "abstract": "Emotion recognition is valuable for mental-health assessment, intelligent healthcare, and human-computer interaction. However, approaches based on facial expressions or speech are vulnerable to intentional masking and environmental noise. This paper targets electroencephalography (EEG)-based emotion recognition and addresses two challenges: (i) limited discriminability and generalization of hand-crafted features, and (ii) high computational cost and low accuracy in classifying highdimensional representations. We propose a lightweight hybrid framework that fuses EEGNet with a Transformer encoder. EEGNet extracts emotion-related frequency, spatial, and temporal features using depthwise-separable convolutions and spatiotemporal fusion, improving feature expressiveness while keeping the parameter count low. An autoencoder (AE) then performs dimensionality reduction and denoising. Finally, a Transformer with multi-head self-attention and positional encoding models long-range temporal dependencies for global context. Experiments on the SEED dataset demonstrate that the baseline EEGNet achieves 83.65% accuracy for emotion classification, and incorporating the AE-Transformer module increases accuracy to $91.03 \\%$, outperforming conventional methods. The results indicate that combining lightweight feature extraction with global temporal modeling is effective for highprecision EEG-based emotion recognition, with potential applications in mental-health monitoring and intelligent interaction. Future work will focus on improving real-time performance and evaluating cross-scenario generalization."

This study uses a mixedmethods approach with a sequential explanatory research design. Online questionnaires were distributed cross-sectionally in March-July 2024 through a purposive sampling technique to obtain quantitative data, followed by in-depth interviews with briquette entrepreneurs in Bandung. The results show that the predicted adoption of coconut shell briquettes as an alternative fuel in Indonesia is relatively low, at only 30.9%. It is related to the weak use of digital technology to support this initiative. Therefore, it is essential to enhance the integration of digital technologies, including the use of artificial intelligence and blockchain-based supply chain systems. This study provides valuable insights for the government, coconut plantation managers, entrepreneurs, and the community in supporting the SDGs program, particularly in the context of responsible production and consumption in Indonesia."

In a hybrid cavity comprising a short artificial fs-inscribed random reflector in combination with a natural Rayleigh reflector in the form of 100-m SMF fiber connected to the DFB laser the effect is greatly enhanced. The instantaneous linewidth narrowing by 2 orders is demonstrated which is in approximate agreement with theoretical estimation. For the long-term linewidth, the narrowing of approximately 3 orders of magnitude is observed. Thus, a compact and stable single-frequency laser with quite narrow linewidth (<5 Hz long term) for a wide range of application has been developed."

    "abstract": "Security and privacy concerns in real-world applications have led to the development of adversarially robust federated models. Previous works mainly target overcoming the adaptability constraints regarding communication and computation costs. However, the straightforward combination of adversarial training and federated learning might lead to undesired robust accuracy degradation emerging at later training stages. We reveal that the attribution behind this phenomenon is that the generated adversarial data could exacerbate the data heterogeneity among local clients, making the wrapped federated learning perform poorly. To deal with this problem, we introduce an <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\alpha$</tex-math></inline-formula>-slack mechanism to relax the original learning objective of federated adversarial training, and propose a novel framework called <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Slack Federated Adversarial Training</i> (SFAT) to combat the intensified heterogeneity. By assigning the client-wise slack during aggregation, SFAT realizes a weighted aggregation that alleviates the optimization bias induced by the local adversarial generation. We further extend to a more general setting, permitting both clients trained by standard/adversarial training in a unified framework, and propose SFAT* with a hierarchical aggregation schema for this scenario. Theoretically, we analyze the convergence of our method to properly relax the learning objective. Experimentally, we verify the rationality and effectiveness of our methods on various benchmarked and real-world datasets with different adversarial training and federated optimization methods."

Our method considers the dynamics of an one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate in a quantum simulation environment with a moving bichromatic optical lattice. Functional expressions and parameter regimes are derived for engineering some of the fundamental waveforms, including sinusoidal, sawtooth, triangular and square profiles. In addition, compound waveforms, such as step-sawtooth, triangular-square, slanted-square, and slanted-step-square are also constructed.

To keep hardware small, Path Weaver uses a compact position map and regenerates per-level choices on the fly with a pipelined pseudorandom function (PRF) overlapped with DRAM access; we micro-profile these stages to quantify their cost. The design targets random-access main memory (DRAM) and requires no changes to the software stack.</p> <p xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Path Weaver preserves the Path-style invariant of one legitimate bucket per level, thereby retaining indistinguishability and the same stash-overflow guarantees as Path ORAM. Evaluated in gem5 on SPEC CPU 2017, Path Weaver processes 2.32× more requests per traversal than Hitchhiker, reduces single-core ORAM latency by 2.1×, and accelerates four-core workloads by 3.3×. By making path diversion a core architectural feature, Path Weaver brings ORAM significantly closer to practical, ’deployonce” secure memory.</p>"

    "abstract": "This paper presents two asymmetric one-way full-duplex (FD) cooperative communication systems that incorporate advanced multiple access schemes. Both systems are formed using a mixed free-space optical (FSO)/millimeter wave (mmWave)-radio-frequency (RF) configuration, where the first hop employs a hybrid FSO/mmWave and the second hop utilizes RF links to support mobile connectivity for multiple users. The first system employs rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) to minimize successive interference cancellation (SIC) operations, termed the FD asymmetric cooperative-RSMA (C-RSMA) system. In contrast, the second system adopts quadrature RSMA (QRSMA) to eliminate SIC, termed the FD asymmetric C-QRSMA system. For comprehensive analysis, the FSO, mmWave, and RF links are modelled using Málaga-<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">M</i> distribution with pointing error, Nakagami-<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</i>, and κ − μ fading, respectively. Unlike existing works that focus on sum rate or signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio, this study derives outage probability, coverage probability, average sum rate, and energy efficiency. These metrics, derived in multi-user environments with imperfect SIC and signal space diversity, are validated through Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, the proposed systems are compared with state-of-the-art schemes, revealing that the systems not only enhance spectral efficiency but also significantly reduce system complexity."

Designed to address this issue, Mask focuses on balancing storage/query overhead and privacy (a key trade-off in this field), allowing users to define parameters for random data distribution across buckets to realize fine-grained control over storage and query performance, integrating Bloom filters with a bounded cache for efficient indexing (optimizing performance under skewed query workloads); extended to MaskIO for reduced client-side storage, it obfuscates query indexes and uploads them to the server, achieving constant-bounded client storage overhead, and experiments show Mask outperforms the bucket-based peer Veil with 2–4 × higher performance and a lower stash ratio."

Unlike prior approaches that rely on retraining, auxiliary outlier data, or external supervision, our method identifies out-of-distribution (OOD) regions by analyzing query-level behaviors. Specifically, we suppress confidently predicted inliers while amplifying uncertain predictions through entropy-guided selection and spatial consistency analysis. To improve spatial coherence, we introduce an object-aware refinement step that enforces consistency within class-agnostic segments, yielding anomaly maps that align more closely with object boundaries. Our approach operates in a strictly zero-shot setting and requires no modification of the base model. Experiments across standard benchmarks, including SMIYC, Fishyscapes, and RoadAnomaly, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance among zero-shot approaches and narrows the gap to training-based methods, while providing interpretable insights into model uncertainty. This competency-driven framework demonstrates that robust anomaly segmentation can be achieved without retraining or external data, making it suitable for practical real-world deployment."

Although both have demonstrated effectiveness, their theoretical performance and, more importantly, a comprehensive understanding of their comparative abilities in supporting a UD communication meanwhile anti its sensing remain underexplored. In this letter, we model the CSI-based sensing and communication performance of a UD controlled by RIS and PP in multi-antenna system contexts, respectively. Towards enhancing communication while restricting the sensing accuracy, we derive the exact optimal PP performance case and RIS performance bounds over feasible configurations. By analyzing the derived results, we draw insights into the characteristics of RIS and PP in influencing environment privacy and the UD communication, answering when RIS or PP is preferable.

    "abstract": "The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) introduces significant voltage fluctuations in distribution networks. While their inverter-based nature offers Volt/VAR control capabilities to mitigate these issues, existing frameworks typically model and operate local control at second-level timescales, overlooking millisecond-level power electronics settling dynamics. This oversight restricts the tuning of control parameters: conservative droop gains lead to limited performance, while aggressive parameters may induce instability. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a Discretization-Timescale-Dependent Volt/VAR Control (DTD-VVC) framework that explicitly incorporates inverter dynamics in local control rule design. We first derive a stability condition for the Volt/VAR controller, demonstrating that a millisecond-level discretization timescale can potentially enhance stability. These insights reveal that steeper gains can be safely accommodated under a millisecond-level discretization timescale, thereby improving voltage regulation performance while guaranteeing stability. By embedding this stability condition as a constraint, we formulate a convex optimization framework to design millisecond-level local control rules that jointly minimize power loss and voltage deviations under uncertainties. Extensive validation on an RTDS–Python co-simulation platform demonstrates that the proposed millisecond-level DTD-VVC scheme substantially outperforms in both voltage regulation performance and stability."

Despite the development of various detection, protection, and mitigation strategies, the majority of them are based on transforming descriptor-type power systems into ordinary differential equations, which often introduce challenges that limit their effectiveness, particularly under constraint violations. In this paper, we present a novel linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) control method that directly addresses the D-LAA problem, which happens at multiple points, without relying on transformations to any restricted system equivalence. First, we model the under-attack power system as a cyber-physical power system (CPPS) to establish conditions for solvability and admissibility based on the topological structure. Next, we utilize a regularized least-squares framework to generate a quadratic cost function, which we then connect to a constrained recursive minimization problem to develop an LQR algorithm through dynamic programming. To accomplish this, we employ the derived algorithm on CPPS to mitigate D-LAAs and stabilize the system. We validate the proposed approach using the IEEE standard test systems as case studies, demonstrating the feasibility of an effective mitigation strategy against D-LAAs."

In particular, to deliver performance and energy efficiency advantages, several techniques have been applied based on new forms of specialization while maintaining usability. As a result, data movement and communication have become the primary bottlenecks in computer systems. To overcome this, one of the most recent breakthroughs has been the introduction of data streaming mechanisms, just like those used in accelerators, into modern general-purpose processors (GPPs). This article comprehensively reviews stream-based architectures, tracing their development from accelerator solutions to their recent adoption in GPPs. This survey starts by introducing the fundamental principles of stream specialization, followed by a taxonomy for memory accesses, and formal mathematical models to represent them as data streams. Then, it categorizes different topologies of data stream specialization and examines them from a compiler’s perspective. Some of the most representative architectures proposed in the past few years, including instruction set architecture (ISA) and streaming engines, are described, followed by a comparative analysis that highlights their key features and presents quantitative evaluations. Then, we discuss some open challenges and suggest directions for future research in stream-based architectures."

    "abstract": "DC series arc faults in photovoltaic (PV) systems pose a risk of reignition during the extinguishing process because the outcome depends on the system impedance. In addition, the rapid decrease in current needed for arc suppression can induce large overvoltage through the line inductance, leading to additional hazards such as equipment damage. However, most conventional arc-fault approaches focus only on detection and cannot address these extinguishing issues. Even when power-modulation-based methods attempt suppression, the risk of extinguishing failure remains if the slew rate is not designed with respect to the system impedance, resulting in arc reignition or line-inductance-induced overvoltage. Therefore, this paper proposes power modulation for arc fault extinguishing with an optimal slew rate design and considering system impedance, which prevents reignition and overvoltage conditions. Experimental results verified the performance of the series arc fault detection and extinguishing according to the optimal slew rate and system impedances."

Our approach integrates four key components: (1) the ECIES scheme to ensure end-to-end confidentiality of email content, (2) BIP-32-derived addresses to achieve sender anonymity, (3) stealth addresses to provide receiver k-anonymity, and (4) a broadcast encryption scheme to enable efficient broadcast messaging. Moreover, our design allows the sender to prove membership in the broadcast mailing while preserving anonymity. Further, the proposed system introduces an incentive mechanism that allows recipients to charge fees for incoming emails, effectively discouraging spam. We present a proof-of-concept implementation on the Ethereum blockchain and evaluate its on-chain performance in terms of gas consumption.

This paper presents XSF, an interpretable machine-learning framework that predicts the optimal SF for each device using lightweight multilayer perceptrons (MLP) and majority voting. The model combines physical-layer indicators and device location to adapt transmission settings without changing the LoRaWAN protocol. In this paper, first, a one-time dataset has been generated using ns-3, and five MLP were trained on the dataset. Then a majority voting was employed to choose the best SF. Finally, we utilized SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis for interpretability for SF classification. Furthermore, the pre-trained model was then utilized in ns-3 on the end devices for efficient SF allocation based on newly generated data during simulation. The proposed XSF achieved an average classification accuracy of 85%, with up to 10.7% and 6.0% higher packet success ratio in mobility and static scenarios, respectively, while reducing energy consumption by 33.6% and 20.6% compared with the state-of-the-art baseline AI method."

Signals from GNSS are noisy, not always stationary, and can be disturbed intentionally or unintentionally by the operation of other devices, systems, or malicious attacks. In this paper, we propose the use of the Sliding Mode Control (SMC) algorithm for frequency and phase synchronization of a local oscillator, which has not been considered in telecommunications applications so far. The significance of our research lies in its ability to provide a practical and computationally efficient solution to oscillator synchronization, overcoming the complexity and high theoretical demands associated with existing optimal control techniques for high-stability oscillators. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm was demonstrated for three types of generators used in telecommunication systems."

Microservice, renowned for its lightweight, loosely coupled, and modular architecture, has emerged as the de-facto standard for developing edge native applications. However, the resource scarcity and heterogeneity, coupled with request dynamics in edge environments, pose substantial challenges for effective microservice orchestration. To address these challenges, we propose MicroEdge, an online optimization framework designed for cost-efficient microservice orchestration in edge-native environments. MicroEdge employs a multi-level optimization approach by strategically coordinating four key dimensions: microservice placement, layer placement, layer pulling, and user request scheduling. The framework confronts two fundamental challenges in solving this joint optimization problem: (1) the time-coupled nature of long-term holistic cost minimization, and (2) the NP-hardness of the underlying problem. MicroEdge tackles these dual challenges by integrating a regularization method for online algorithm design and a dependent rounding technique for approximation algorithm design. Both rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive simulations driven by realistic Alibaba microservice workload traces validate the efficacy of MicroEdge."

    "abstract": "Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) offers a practical solution for deploying image segmentation models under domain shift without accessing source data or retraining. Among existing TTA strategies, pseudo-label-based methods have shown promising performance. However, they often rely on perturbation-ensemble heuristics (e.g., dropout sampling, test-time augmentation, Gaussian noise), which lack distributional grounding and yield unstable training signals. This can trigger error accumulation and catastrophic forgetting during adaptation. To address this, we propose A3-TTA, a TTA framework that constructs reliable pseudo-labels through anchor-guided supervision. Specifically, we identify well-predicted target domain images using a class compact density metric, under the assumption that confident predictions imply distributional proximity to the source domain. These anchors serve as stable references to guide pseudo-label generation, which is further regularized via semantic consistency and boundary-aware entropy minimization. Additionally, we introduce a self-adaptive exponential moving average strategy to mitigate label noise and stabilize model update during adaptation. Evaluated on both multi-domain medical images (heart structure and prostate segmentation) and natural images, A3-TTA significantly improves average Dice scores by 10.40 to 17.68 percentage points compared to the source model, outperforming several state-of-the-art TTA methods under different segmentation model architectures. A3-TTA also excels in continual TTA, maintaining high performance across sequential target domains with strong anti-forgetting ability. The code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/HiLab-git/A3-TTA."

    "abstract": "The utilization of plastic mulch has facilitated the rapid advancement of agricultural practices. However, the extensive utilization of plastic mulch has also given rise to environmental concerns. Timely and accurate monitoring of plastic mulch is important for a comprehensive understanding of the pattern of plastic mulch and for the formulation of agricultural policies. The development and validation of advanced Plastic-Mulched Landcover (PML) detection algorithms are currently restricted due to the limited availability of publicly available datasets. To address this critical gap, this study introduces a novel and challenging benchmark dataset for PML detection. This dataset was constructed using co-registered Sentinel-2 and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery and encompasses complex agricultural landscapes. Secondly, we propose a PML detection method based on deep learning model and utilizing multi-source remote sensing images. The proposed PML Detection U-Net (PMLDU-Net) model is a U-Net architecture with an added attention mechanism, designed to effectively utilize the complementary spectral and polarimetric scattering features from these multi-source data. The PMLDU-Net was rigorously bench-marked on the new dataset and its results were compared with several models. The results show that the proposed model achieves the best performance, with an overall accuracy (OA) of 95.08% and the mean intersection over union (mIoU) of 86.17%. The resulting prediction map is more continuous, and the boundaries between PML and the background better align with the actual situation. We also demonstrate the promising generalization capability of the proposed model in a different region. To reproduce our work, we provide the PML detection dataset at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jiangxiaoxiao1014/plastic-mulched-landcover-detection-dataset."

The double two-ray ground reflection model is employed to analyze a two-antenna Multi-Input Single-Output (MISO) system placed on human skin. The system operates at 24 GHz with polarization tangential to the skin. Key parameters such as antenna-separation, antenna-to-skin spacing and phase difference between transmitter antennas are varied to analyze the resulting path gain. The results obtained from analytical model are experimentally validated using Yagi antennas placed over a forearm phantom. Based on the findings, the DM technique is implemented. The results demonstrate successful demodulation at the intended receiver location with Bit error rate (BER) <10-4, while at the eavesdropper’s location the BER >0.2 for all investigated transmitter–receiver antenna separations. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness and validity of the proposed concept."

    "abstract": "Extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, cold snaps, and storms, frequently cause sudden and unpredictable shifts in electricity consumption, significantly complicating accurate load forecasting. Existing forecasting methods, predominantly offline-trained deep learning models, struggle to rapidly adapt to these abrupt changes due to limitations in real-time processing and the issue of catastrophic forgetting, and they rarely capture the uncertainties inherent in load predictions under extreme weather conditions. To overcome these challenges, this study proposes a novel complementary online learning network (COLNet) explicitly designed for probabilistic load forecasting during extreme weather events. The key innovations of COLNet include the following: first, a fast adaptation mechanism to rapidly assimilate new load patterns; second, an associative memory module to preserve historical load information and mitigate catastrophic forgetting; finally, a weather-aware gating mechanism that dynamically incorporates real-time meteorological variables, enhancing the model's sensitivity and forecasting robustness. Extensive comparative evaluations using real-world hourly datasets from the 2022 Australian floods, covering three affected regions over about 14 months, and from the 2021 Texas cold snap, comprising statewide load over about 24 months with a test set covering the mid-February event, are conducted. These evaluations confirm that COLNet substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving mean absolute percentage error of 3.205%, 2.457%, and 4.882% during the flood period and 0.84% on the Texas event, corresponding to an average reduction of about 21% in point error relative to the strongest baselines and about 19% in probabilistic error, thereby improving both accuracy and uncertainty quantifications."

The spread of fake images that are difficult to recognize directly becomes a serious problem because they can be used for purposes that are detrimental to many people. This study proposes the use of the Residual Network 50 (ResNet50) architecture with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach to detect changes in digital images. ResNet50 functions as a model to extract important features from images, while SVM functions as a classification algorithm to distinguish between original images and edited images. The dataset used consists of two categories, namely original images and edited images, evaluated under three scenarios: Scenario 1 with 700 images (350 original and 350 modified), Scenario 2 with 1,400 images (700 original and 700 modified), and Scenario 3 with 2,100 images (1,050 original and 1,050 modified). All images were taken from the Kaggle platform, where edited images were created using Photoshop with several editing variants and exported as PNG files sized 256×256. Testing of the model was carried out to assess the performance of the detection system that has been created. The highest accuracy, 84%, was achieved in Scenario 2 (1,400 images) using ResNet50 feature extraction combined with an SVM classifier with an RBF kernel. This configuration achieved a precision value of 0.85, a recall value of 0.82, F1-score of 0.83 in the original image class and a precision value of 0.83, recall value of 0.85, and an F1-score of 0.84 in the edited image class. These findings indicate that the proposed model is a promising and effective solution for the automatic detection of fake images across various digital platforms."

This paper examines the limitations of purely spatial two-dimensional networks for drone routing purposes and evaluates the efficacy of adding a temporal dimension to enhance available airspace capacity. With multiple operators seeking to deploy drone fleets in crowded airspace, simplistic spatial routing approaches risk congestion and reduced service reliability. Our simulations compare spatial and spatio-temporal approaches using sequential drone delivery routing scenarios, demonstrating that temporal networks significantly reduce path deviations and eliminate logjamming effects. Additional simulations evaluate how varying edge lengths affect spatio-temporal network performance, revealing tradeoffs between granularity, capacity, and computational requirements. Results indicate that selecting between spatial and spatiotemporal networks involves balancing computational cost against achievable network capacity. Spatial networks offer simplicity and low computation complexity, while spatio-temporal networks provide superior capacity at greater computational expense. These findings provide valuable guidance for the development of scalable drone traffic management systems as aerial delivery services expand in urban environments."

    "abstract": "To enable machine learning in archaeology, data must encode both observed traces—what we detect on Earth’s surface today—and their inferred past states. We propose a signal-based framework where archaeological features are treated as degraded spatiotemporal signals emitted by past human activity, and archaeology becomes a form of inverse signal reconstruction. Unlike traditional typological or period-based models, this approach models each site’s history as a vector in a unified 3D spatial manifold with temporal relationships anchored to a fixed reference (J2000), enabling integration with astronomical models and signal processing techniques.Applying this to northwest Ireland, we test signal correlations between archaeological distributions and hypothesised territorial boundaries circa (t<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</inf>+400) (1600 CE). Using contiguity matrices, kernel density estimation, and K-nearest neighbor graph analysis, we find significant alignments between spatial signal clusters and historic boundaries across a 6,000-year span. This suggests that we can greatly increase the scope, resolution, and accuracy of our temporal pattern analyses even in noisy, incomplete data.By framing archaeology as an inverse signal reconstruction problem, our model aligns with broader signal science paradigms, including SETI’s search for technosignatures. It enables scalable, quantitative inference of long-term human territorial behavior and is extensible to other domains dealing with temporal degradation."

Educational Data Mining (EDM) uses an algorithm-based analytical approach that utilizes machine learning to evaluate and predict learning outcomes with higher objectivity than traditional methods. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of two classification algorithms, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF), in predicting students' academic achievement. To overcome the problem of data imbalance between classes, an oversampling approach using the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied. The data used were obtained from both academic and non-academic sources, which we collected independently. The results show that the SVM algorithm exhibits stable performance in terms of accuracy and is effective in classifying the majority class, whereas the Random Forest is more effective in classifying the minority class. The application of the SMOTE technique helps to improve the balance of predictions between classes, although it does not necessarily improve overall accuracy. These findings suggest that SVM is better suited for use when overall accuracy consistency is a priority, whereas Random Forest is more effective at improving classification performance in minority classes under conditions of unbalanced data distribution."

In this paper, a controllable capacitor commutated converter (CCCC) structure is proposed to prevent CF, and the control system is designed based on the artificial neural network (ANN). Specifically, the CCCC can automatically determine a suitable capacitance value according to the prediction result of fault severity by ANN, which not only can prevent the occurrence of the CF but also makes the voltage stress applied on commutation valves at a low level. To increase the accuracy of the prediction of the fault severity, the genetic algorithm (GA) is utilized to optimize the structure of the ANN. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, a monopolar 500 kV and 1000 MW HVDC system is built in PSCAD/EMTDC software as the test network. The simulation results indicate that the regression mean square error of the fault severity predicted by the GA-optimized ANN is low as $\\mathbf{0 . 0 0 6 4 7 0}$, and for the simulated $\\mathbf{2 4 6 0}$ kinds of faults, $\\mathbf{9 7 . 1 \\%}$ are eliminated successfully by the CCCC."

    "abstract": "Robotic grasping tasks face key challenges such as insufficient multi-modal perception and difficulty in semanticspatial alignment in unstructured and complex scenes. Traditional unimodal methods rely on visual or tactile information and have difficulty in parsing the semantic intent of language instructions. Existing language-guided grasping frameworks mostly adopt cascade design or simple feature splicing, resulting in error accumulation and low modal coordination efficiency. This paper proposes CLIP-Grasp: a multi-modal grasping framework based on deep language-vision fusion, which realizes semantic-guided refined grasping decisions through dynamic feature modulation and hierarchical decoding mechanism. This method encodes language instructions into semantic priors of visual features through the conditional feature modulation (FiLM) module, and extracts cross-modal context information in combination with a multi-scale Transformer decoder, and simultaneously optimizes grasping parameters. The experimental results demonstrate that CLIP-Grasp achieves 85.12 % top1 and 90.66 % top-5 grasping accuracy on the OCID-VLG dataset, outperforming the CROG model by 7.92 % and 2.96 % in top-1 and top-5 accuracy, respectively, while utilizing only 156 M parameters. At the same time, verified by simulation experiments, our method has low-latency real-time reasoning and high robustness."

    "abstract": "The use of Internet of Things (IoT) devices by startups in Saudi Arabia brings both innovation and increased cybersecurity vulnerabilities. This study examines the level of cybersecurity awareness amongst startups and investigates their perceptions of blockchain as a potential cybersecurity solution. We conduct cross-sectional surveys using online questionnaires. Data is analyzed using the SPSS tool, employing descriptive statistics and inferential methods, including Pearson correlation and variance analysis. The results from the survey indicate lack of awareness, budget constraints, training limitations, and lack of clear policy at organizational level as the most outstanding challenges in the startups. Only a minority of respondents encountered cyberattacks, although concern levels for them were high. There is a need for structured training and strategic investment in cybersecurity among startups. The results also show the potential of Blockchain but lack a broad perception of feasibility."

The increasing deployment of distributed energy resources, remote substations, and wide-area monitoring systems has elevated the importance of reliable and low-latency communication networks in modern power systems. Experimental latency measurements were collected over several weeks using low-cost Raspberry Pi nodes deployed across a range of delivery technologies, including consumer GPON fibre, enterprise-grade optical networks, fixed wireless access (both licensed and unlicensed), and public cellular networks (4G/5G). The latency data was analysed using Python to fit statistical models, including normal, lognormal, and extreme value distributions, providing a quantitative characterisation of each technology's performance. These models inform the design of a WAN simulation platform used to prototype and evaluate the robustness of PTP implementations under realistic network conditions."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "The explosive growth of connected fleets and telematics systems continues to strain the limited IPv4 address space [1]. Although IPv6 offers a long-term solution, its adoption remains hampered by cost and backward compatibility issues, making optimized IPv4 allocation a critical near-term requirement. This paper proposes a machine learning–enabled IPv4 allocation framework that dynamically resizes subnets and aggregates supernets based on vehicle mobility patterns, thereby improving utilization and routing efficiency in fleet networks. The framework employs a multistage clustering pipeline comprising Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for dimensionality reduction, HDBSCAN [2] for density-based cluster detection, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) for probabilistic refinement, and hierarchical clustering for macrozone aggregation with Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) support. Building upon these adaptive zones, Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM) assigns address blocks proportional to density, while a random forest predictor achieves 94.1% precision in forecasting subnet transitions for proactive allocation. Experiments on more than 5.2 × 10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">6</sup> GPS records demonstrate significant gains in utilization efficiency, routing scalability, and adaptability compared to static subnetting schemes. The novelty and inventiveness of this approach have been confirmed by an independent patent search report, which highlights the unique integration of multi stage clustering, CIDR-based macrozone aggregation, and density-aware VLSM allocation. The method has been formally filed as a provisional patent application with the Indian Patent Office (Application No. 202541079985, filed on 22 August 2025). This work therefore provides a practical, patent backed and standards-compliant solution that extends the viability of IPv4 in fleet telematics while offering a scalable pathway toward intelligent address management in next-generation connected mobility."

To improve sentence similarity, this paper examines how our approach integrates text augmentation and Transformers. Additional training examples are generated through text augmentation, which involves various transformations such as random swapping, synonym replacement, random deletion, and random insertion of the original sentence or text. By expanding the dataset, we aim to capture a wide variety of sentence variations. We used 1,800 pairs of human-written English sentences were obtained from two testing datasets, namely The Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) corpus (version 1.0) and the Sentences Involving Compositional Knowledge (SICK). The Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model, which is very effective in NLP, employs a self-attention mechanism to collect contextual data. To encode the input sentence into a high-dimensional representation, this paper uses a pre-trained transformer model. As a first step, we extend the original sentence pair by adding part of the text using easy data augmentations. Then, we calculate the similarity between sentence transformation and sentence embedding using sentence BERT (SBERT). We found that random swap augmentation achieved the highest F1-score in the all-MPNET-base-v2 model; however, for the experimental group using the all-roberta-large-v1 model, random insertion achieved the highest F1-score."

This biologically plausible model has the advantage of low latency and energy efficiency. Recent work using SNNs for autonomous driving mostly focused on simple tasks like lane keeping in simplified simulation environments. This paper studies SNNs on photo-realistic driving scenes in the CARLA simulator, which is an important step toward using SNNs on real vehicles.

It reduces productivity and worsens the environment through increased air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Automated traffic systems have been implemented to optimize signals, regulate flow, and provide real-time updates. However, they often face challenges from irregular vehicle movements, weather changes, and accidents. A Mamdani fuzzy logic approach enables intelligent decision-making under uncertain traffic conditions. By processing real-time vehicle counts (from camera feeds via YOLO), the Mamdani controller optimizes signal timing based on traffic density and queue length, improving traffic flow. In simulations, the proposed fuzzy-vision controller significantly outperforms a fixed-time signal on three metrics. On average, waiting time decreased by 28.7%, delay by 34.1%, and queue length by 8.4%. Overall, the Mamdani fuzzy logic system yields lower congestion and faster throughput than conventional timing."

This approach divides the problem of echo prediction into three components: electromagnetic modeling of the emission environment, electromagnetic wave propagation and scattering. The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method is employed for precise modeling of complex emission source region and distant target, while the parabolic equation (PE) method is utilized for long-range propagation. Through a typical case example, the proposed method is validated against traditional FDTD approaches, demonstrating its accuracy. The results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively predicts echo of maritime target in complex emission environments."

To test the benefits of using the system, five variables adopted from the two theories are used. This study empirically examines the model to measure the success of the Artificial Intelligence tool, namely ChatGPT, the extent of the benefits obtained, and what factors influence it. Data were collected from 100 users consisting of lecturers and students who use ChatGPT in their activities. Two direct variables, namely perceived usefulness and user satisfaction, have a direct influence on perceived benefits.

By means of data mining and machine learning, a graphic browser graph recommendation technology based on machine learning is put forward. Specifically, first, the historical operation behaviors of the graphic browser in the human-machine cloud terminal are collected and analyzed periodically. Subsequently, through log analysis and data mining techniques, the user's historical browsing behaviors are excavated. Finally, by integrating the random forest classification algorithm, predictions are made to present the graph information that is most likely to be browsed based on the current graph. Through multiple experimental validations of this technology, the experimental results demonstrate that the technology proposed in this paper can recommend the graph information that users may browse during specific task operations.

Grid-based methods offer greater adaptability than cell decomposition; however, they often fail to ensure full coverage near obstacle boundaries, potentially leading to the omission of critical information. To address this limitation, a grid-based complete coverage path planning method is designed for arbitrary irregular obstacles. This approach begins by assigning values to grid cells, which allows to transform the coverage path planning (CPP) problem into a line coverage problem. Based on this, a path points generation algorithm that guarantees full area coverage is developed. To further enhance efficiency, an integer linear programming (ILP) model is formulated to minimize turning angles, reducing unnecessary maneuvers and improving UAV flight efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively generates full coverage paths while minimizing the number of turns. Additionally, it exhibits adaptability for multi-UAV systems."

Currently, this robot is still in the development stage, such as in distance measurement. Several studies have been conducted on measuring the distance of objects using cameras, one of which uses the Complex Log Mapping (CLM) method. Although CLM can be used, this method still has weaknesses in measurement time. Therefore, this study improves the measurement model, formula, and algorithm, and the results show that the distance measurement time is faster than the CLM method."

This paper established a test platform for investigating the no-load excitation characteristics of transformers under dynamic stray current conditions and conducted corresponding experiments. The study analyzed the impact of dynamic stray currents on the no-load excitation currents in each transformer winding. Due to the influence of dynamic stray currents, the DC bias characteristics of the transformer also exhibit dynamic behavior. The severity of transformer DC bias does not strictly synchronize with the instantaneous magnitude of the stray current and is correlated with the saturation state of the transformer core. Experimental results demonstrate that the core saturation level in the center phase leg is less pronounced than in the other two phases, resulting in lower consumption of both active and reactive power. The findings of this paper reveal the dynamic DC bias characteristics of transformers, providing valuable insights for risk analysis associated with dynamic stray current intrusion."

Early diagnosis is crucial to prevent delays in treatment; however, there is a lack of parental awareness of early symptoms, and currently, no classification tool is available to identify the severity level of autism based on DSM-5 criteria. This study aims to classify autism in children based on DSM-5 criteria using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm with a CRISP-DM approach, and to address data imbalance using the SMOTE oversampling technique. The dataset consists of children's symptom data labeled as ASD (ASD 1, ASD 2, ASD 3) and Non-ASD. Evaluation results show that the SVM model without SMOTE achieved the best performance with an overall accuracy of 98.77%, along with high and balanced precision, recall, and F1-scores. Meanwhile, the application of SMOTE increased sensitivity for minority classes but reduced the accuracy to 90.12%. Therefore, the SVM model without SMOTE is considered the most effective. This model has potential as an early diagnostic aid but still requires further clinical validation."

On this basis, HFSS software is used to establish a parametric wire harness model, which makes the distribution parameters of the equivalent single-stranded wire consistent with the multi-stranded wire harness by customizing the material frequency properties. Finally, based on the synergistic integration of the equivalent model and the frequency-variable parameters, the efficient and accurate prediction of broadband crosstalk response is realized."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the fuel-saving potential of a retrofitted diesel hybrid dual-mode train based on energy management optimization and different railway operation scenarios. Dual-mode trains offer high operational flexibility by operating on both electrified and non-electrified tracks. The presented investigation begins with experimental campaigns on real trains currently operating in France. The results revealed a 22% to 25% reduction in fuel consumption for the retrofitted hybrid train compared to its conventional counterpart. These outcomes, accomplished using a rules-based energy management strategy following a charge-sustaining concept, reflect a suboptimal utilization of the hybridization potential. To fully exploit this potential, the energy management is herein optimized through the dynamic programming method, following a charge-depleting concept. This permits leveraging different factors, such as the large size of batteries afforded by the retrofitting procedure, the recharging opportunities provided by the rail electrical infrastructure, the knowledge of the track characteristics, and the daily operational missions. This approach is analogous to the operational logic of on-road plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. The optimization is conducted on daily rail operational schedules under three real-world scenarios, which vary based on their authorization of intermediate recharging using the catenary as well as the online transition from catenary-free to catenary-powered operation. On average, the optimization results, over the daily schedules and the defined scenarios, reveal that the fuel saving ranges from 4% to 37% relative to the charge-sustaining. When compared with the conventional version of the train, this translates into a fuel-saving of 25% to 51%."

A lightweight gated recurrent unit (GRU) network is proposed, leveraging motion-lagged hip angle, current hip angle, and slope angle as inputs. The system requires only two inertial measurement units (mounted on the socket and prosthetic foot) and a force sensor (at the ankle joint). Network regularization and hyperparameter optimization were applied to enhance computational efficiency, and subject-specific fine-tuning was used for personalized adaptation. The optimized GRU framework achieved high prediction accuracy with a prediction time of <0.007 s, enabling real-time deployment. Experiments with an amputee participant demonstrated seamless adaptation to variable slopes and speeds, improved gait symmetry, and reduced compensatory behaviors in the residual hip and intact ankle. The proposed method enables natural and adaptive gait coordination for transfemoral amputees using a computationally efficient, sensor-minimized approach. This work advances intelligent prostheses toward more natural locomotion in daily environments by improving adaptability to real-world terrain variations."

The proposed method integrates error-driven variable gains to dynamically enhance transient performance and steady-state performance, includes a finite-time variable gain tracking differentiator (FTVGTD), a finite-time variable gain extended state observer (FTVGESO) and a finite-time variable gain controller (FTVGC). The FTVGTD is designed to accurately extract differential signals from measured displacement signals with noise. Inspired by super-twisting theory, the FTVGESO is developed to estimate unknown states and disturbances in finite-time, while mitigating chattering during the estimation process. Based on the power integral technique, the FTVGC is proposed to compensate the disturbances in real time, thereby improving system robustness. For convergence analysis of the proposed method, robust analysis techniques and Lyapunov methods are utilized to address the non-Hurwitz characteristic of variable gain matrices, and the disturbance rejection capability is analyzed theoretically. Finally, simulation and experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for active suspension hydraulic systems."

    "abstract": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Schizophrenia (SCZ), and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) pose significant challenges to global healthcare due to their rising prevalence and diagnostic complexity. Early and accurate detection is critical to improve treatment outcomes for these neuropsychiatric disorders. While existing learning models offer some success, they often fall short in scalability, adaptability, and diagnostic precision. Recent efforts lack mechanisms to dynamically optimize network structure for complex clinical data, limiting their real-world application. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a novel neural architecture search strategy inspired by the small world network concept, resulting in the Small World Optimal Neural Architecture (SWONA). SWONA enhances learning by establishing optimal links between non-adjacent layers, mirroring the high clustering and short path lengths of small world networks. It dynamically determines key parameters such as layer connections, count, and network depth, resulting in an adaptive and efficient model suitable for clinical and wearable diagnostic settings. Evaluated on 7 standard benchmark datasets, SWONA consistently outperformed both traditional and state-of-the-art methods across multiple neuropsychiatric disorders and evaluation metrics. These findings highlight SWONA’s potential as a reliable clinical tool, supporting early diagnosis and enabling more personalized treatment strategies."

In this work, a methodology for measuring the magnetic properties of soft ferromagnetic samples is developed. The proposed methodology utilizes an inexpensive desktop instrument designed to be amenable to automation. The use of the newly designed hardware and requisite data analysis methodology is validated and shown to have acceptable accuracy and repeatability for screening purposes; saturation magnetization is typically accurate to 1% and repeatable to 0.2%, while coercivity is repeatable to 20–30 A/m. The measurement time per specimen is under 20 seconds, with an architecture that allows for significant further improvement. No post-processing of samples is required, nor precise geometries. These characteristics are compared to existing techniques and shown to represent a favorable tradeoff for many screening applications."

Using 16×A10 GPUs, we find the decode stage—dominant in inference runtime—is memory-bandwidth-bound in matrix multiplications, I/O-bandwidth-bound in <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">AllReduce</i>, and underutilizes compute resources.

Analytical modeling shows that a 16×A10 with NMP DIMMs and INT8 communication quantization can match 4×A100 performance at 30% lower cost and even surpass it under equal cost.

Intelligent vehicles (IVs) offer onboard computing and sensing capabilities for delivering a wide range of services. In this paper, we propose a dynamic adaptability service model that leverages the swift mobility of vehicles to adjust the distribution of IVs to users’ dynamically changing locations. There are two types of areas in our model: the user area and the parking area. The former is where services are provided, while the latter serves as the preparation zone for backup IVs. IVs in the parking area are dispatched to service areas, where existing vehicle resources cannot meet user demand, and they return to the parking area after delivering the service. Multiple users share sensing resources, and our model allocates the costs among them. To ensure strategy-proofness, we introduce the concepts of no additional cost and allocation stability. We propose a strategy-proof cost-sharing mechanism for dynamic adaptability service. The proposed mechanism achieves no positive transfers, voluntary participation, individual rationality, consumer sovereignty, budget balance, no additional costs, and allocation stability. Moreover, the proposed mechanism’s approximation performance is analyzed. We further use comprehensive simulations to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed mechanism."

In the MOMPC PF control, two control objectives, the path convergence and the energy efficiency, are considered simultaneously. The path convergence is identified as the primary task which must be guaranteed, while the energy efficiency should be improved provided the guaranteed path convergence. To accommodate the prioritized PF control objectives, the lexicographic ordering method is applied to solve the MOMPC problem. With an appropriate reference augmentation and well-designed optimization formulations, the path tracking error can be guaranteed to converge to zero, and the recursive feasibility of the MOMPC algorithm is further proved. The thrust allocation subproblem is addressed within the MOMPC PF control. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and show that the MOMPC presents a flexible framework to perform the energy-efficient PF control."

Learning mad is very important to ensure proper pronunciation and understanding of the correct meaning in Quranic verses, as the law of reading the Qur'an correctly is considered an obligation for every Muslim. Currently, there is no standardization that regulates the length of mad recitation. To address this gap, this study introduces a pioneering model using one of the reading tempo standards, namely slow tempo (Al-Tahqiq), offering a novel approach in this field. The chosen algorithms, CNN combined with MFCC feature extraction, have not been specifically used in prior research for creating a mad reading classification model, marking a unique contribution. The research process began with a comprehensive data collection from literature study and dataset accumulation, followed by the development of a model capable of classifying mad tajweed readings. The development process included preprocessing steps like cutting the audio according to specified verse beheadings and adding noise to enhance dataset robustness. Feature extraction was performed using MFCC, and the resulting data was used to create a classification model with the CNN algorithm. Testing was carried out across 10 scenarios, with Scenario 5 yielding the highest results: 98.25 % training accuracy, 92.00 % validation accuracy, and 96.00 % testing accuracy. Compared to a previous study that applied an LSTM-based model with a smaller dataset and achieved a maximum testing accuracy of 90.0 %, the CNNbased model proposed in this research demonstrates superior performance in classifying madd tajwid. These results not only demonstrate the suitability of the CNN and MFCC for madd tajweed classification but also position this research to potentially set a precedent for further studies, aiming to establish standardized methods for madd recitation in Quranic reading."

Traditional emotion assessment methods rely on subjective self-reports, which have a limited ability to capture real-time fluctuations in emotional states. This study proposes a self-supervised learning (SSL) framework combined with a transformer-based emotion classification model to enable continuous anxiety tracking in patients with stroke using smartwatch-derived photoplethysmography (PPG) signals. The SSL model was pretrained on the VitalDB dataset using R-peak-to-peak intervals (RRIs) extracted from electrocardiography (ECG) signals. The pretrained encoder is then integrated into a transformer-based classifier trained on the Psycho-physiology of Positive and Negative Emotions POPANE dataset containing labeled emotional responses. Finally, the trained model was applied to smartwatch-derived pulse peak intervals (PPI) from patients with stroke, and the predictions were applied to Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scores and we evaluated it against GAD-7 scores using both group-level and 90-day longitudinal analyses, alongside on-device feasibility on a Galaxy Watch6. Over the 30 days preceding the second survey, between-group differences were significant by Welch's t-test (p = 0.0086), and discrimination reached AUC 0.859 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.664–0.992. In 90-day monitoring, generalized estimating equations (GEE) showed persistent divergence when groups were defined by the second survey, with significant differences across multiple weeks preceding the survey, consistent with the retrospective GAD-7 window. These findings indicate that ECG-pretrained cardiac representations can be translated to smartwatch PPG to support unobtrusive, continuous anxiety tracking in stroke. Results constitute feasibility-level evidence and motivate multi-site external validation, larger cohorts with clinician-rated assessments, and prospective studies toward clinical deployment."

    "abstract": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a technique that generates high-resolution volumetric images of the human body using a strong magnetic field. The image quality is directly dependent on the homogeneity of this field. Commercial superconducting magnets typically achieve field homogeneities below two parts per million (ppm) and are based on Nb-Ti conductors, which require cooling to 4 K. Maintaining this temperature is costly and demands two-stage cryocoolers. Second-generation (2G) high-temperature superconducting (HTS) tapes offer a promising technical and economic alternative, as they operate at higher temperatures (20–77 K), where it is possible to use a one-stage cryocooler. However, their performance is sensitive to magnetic fields. In this study, the objective is to investigate the use of 2G HTS tapes in a DC MRI magnet cooled by helium gas, aiming to reduce cryogenic costs in installation and operation. A 0.5 T magnet with a 700 mm patient bore was simulated, accounting for the space required by the gradient and RF body coils at different operating temperatures. The magnet is modeled using the J-A formulation alongside the power law to simulate the DC coil behavior, incorporating angle-dependent critical current and n-value characteristics. This initial study focuses on the achievable homogeneity of the applied field, with an ideal field distribution where the effects of screening currents are not considered in the final homogeneity assessment. The final design achieves a magnetic field homogeneity better than 3 ppm within a 10 cm diameter spherical volume (DSV)."

Unlike conventional array-domain methods that require access to per-antenna baseband, the proposed approach leverages joint transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) beamsteering observations to enable high-resolution, digital-beamforming-like parameter estimation under practical hardware constraints. A generalized signal model is developed that incorporates measured beam patterns, including sidelobe and phase effects, ensuring a practical representation of hybrid transceivers. Building on this model, we adapt the classical SAGE and MUSIC algorithms to operate in the beamsteering domain, allowing accurate estimation of multipath angle and delay parameters without relying on discretized angular grids. The proposed methods are evaluated through extensive Monte Carlo simulations across different SNR levels, array configurations, and beamsteering resolutions, and are further validated on a 28 GHz hybrid beamforming testbed. Results demonstrate that the beamsteering-based SAGE achieves superior resolution in dense multipath environments, while beamsteering-based MUSIC provides robustness under reduced beamsteering diversity. These findings establish the proposed framework as a practical and effective solution for accurate mmWave channel parameter estimation with hybrid beamforming architectures."

However, achieving a wide memory window (MW) without compromising endurance remains a key challenge, particularly for enabling triple-level cell (TLC) operations in high-density applications. To address this, we propose a hybrid HfZrOₓ (HZO) stack that combines solid-solution (SS-HZO) and superlattice (SL-HZO) structures, integrating their respective advantages, namely, a higher coercive field (Ec) and a reduced concentration of oxygen vacancies (Vo). This design effectively optimizes the trade-off between MW and endurance. Additionally, interface engineering is employed, including NH₃ plasma treatment to form a high-k, high-quality interfacial layer that improves the MW, and microwave annealing (MWA) to suppress Vo generation and enhance endurance. The proposed devices achieve a large MW of 2.7 V, with stable endurance up to 10⁷ cycles for single-level cell (SLC) operation and 10⁴ cycles for TLC operation, demonstrating strong potential for reliable, high-density NVM applications."

    "abstract": "Complementary field-effect transistors (CFETs) improve integration density through vertical stacking, but dense middle-of-line (MOL) routing introduces significant parasitics that affect circuit performance. This work presents an MOL-aware compact modeling framework for 3-nm CFETs, where MOL-related capacitances are analytically captured using conformal mapping and calibrated with TCAD extraction. The resulting compact model is implemented in a customized PDK based on the BSIM-CMG formulation and supports layout-aware circuit evaluation. Including MOL parasitics increases the total parasitic capacitance by approximately 20%. Post-layout analysis of a 5-stage ring oscillator shows that the MOL contribution to frequency behavior grows with fan-out, while capacitance analysis indicates that the MOL domain accounts for more than half of the total parasitics in low-fan-out conditions. These results demonstrate that MOL effects form a major performance bottleneck in vertically stacked CFETs and highlight the importance of MOL-aware modeling for accurate circuit prediction and design optimization in advanced technology nodes."

    "abstract": "We present a novel modeling technique to accurately simulate the gain, single-sideband noise temperature, and image rejection of a sideband-separating superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) heterodyne receiver. We provide details of the modeling of all relevant receiver components, featuring a novel quasi-linear approach which combines the nonlinear Harmonic Balance method and Tucker’s quantum theory of SIS mixers. To enhance accuracy, the modeling technique utilizes full electromagnetic simulations or S-parameter measurements for all the other receiver components, depending on availability. The model also accounts for sideband noise contributions from various sources, including the local oscillator and internal terminations. To illustrate its capabilities, we applied the technique to a developmental receiver for the upgraded Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 6. A rigorous comparison between simulation and measurement results from a single polarization channel prototype receiver demonstrates excellent accuracy. This agreement is evidenced across the entire frequency range by the small difference in noise temperature values (less than 10%) and the low difference in the number of frequency points that fall below an image-rejection threshold of 15 dB (8%). The proposed model also allows the identification of various noise and image rejection features and enables improvement by re-optimization of components. This generalized modeling technique is applicable to any SIS sideband-separating receiver."

Nevertheless, the existing channel estimation methods are not applicable to NMB-MIMO due to its unique magnitude-only detection mechanism. This paper introduces an innovative channel estimation framework specifically designed for NMB-MIMO systems. Initially, we deploy a local oscillator (LO) to transmit known reference signals, and the NMB-MIMO channel estimation is formulated as a compressive phase retrieval problem by leveraging the inherent angular-domain sparsity of wireless channels. To address the proposed problem, we subsequently develop an efficient universal compressive phase retrieval (UCPR) algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the robustness of the proposed UCPR approach, validating its effectiveness in accurately reconstructing NMB-MIMO channels."

    "abstract": "This study developed a new design for a high-efficiency broadband continuous class-F (CCF) power amplifier (PA) that employs an independent harmonic termination load network (IHTLN) to simplify impedance matching in a compact structure. In the CCF operation, the developed IHTLN provides independent, sequential matching at the second- and third-harmonic frequencies while maintaining a robust performance under load impedance variation. The design optimizes transmission line widths to achieve the desired CCF mode impedances at these harmonics, thereby eliminating the need for additional matching stages, minimizing the losses, and reducing the form factor by re-utilizing harmonic networks. To validate the approach, a high-efficiency CCF PA featuring the developed IHTLN was designed, fabricated, and evaluated. The experimental results showed that the fabricated PA achieved a peak power added efficiency (PAE) greater than 50% in the range of 1.85–2.7 GHz, a saturated output power of 40.6–42.5 dBm, and a large-signal gain of 12.1–16.5 dB. Moreover, it realized a peak drain efficiency of 85.8% and a peak PAE of 75.6% at 2.4 GHz. The developed design effectively simplifies broadband impedance matching while precisely controlling harmonic impedances, thereby achieving enhanced efficiency at a targeted frequency without narrowing the bandwidth."

    "abstract": "With the continuous expansion of power system construction and maintenance, both the volume and variety of onsite operation documents are rapidly increasing. Typical examples include work permits, safety disclosure cards, the “three measures and one plan,” and field survey records. These documents appear in heterogeneous formats such as scanned images, PDFs, and Word files, posing significant challenges for review and crossverification. Conventional OCR-based methods often fall short in terms of accuracy and robustness, making it difficult to meet the requirements of safety supervision platforms for efficient and precise auditing. To address this issue, this study introduces a structured data acquisition approach grounded in end-to-end visual document understanding. The method is built around the KOSMOS-2.5 model and proceeds through three main stages: document input and preprocessing, semantic feature modeling, and structured data generation and storage. Experiments conducted on safety disclosure cards and the “three measures and one plan” documents demonstrate that the proposed approach can reliably extract key fields and produce unified structured outputs. The results significantly enhance the automation and accuracy of document processing, thereby offering technical support for intelligent auditing and safety supervision in power operation sites."

The structure is implemented on a stack of two felt-based substrates. Its metallization layers comprise (from top to bottom) a microstrip-fed rectangular patch, a top-coupled square patch, and a ground plane. Off-body behavior (unidirectional radiation) is achieved by excitation of a TM<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">10</inf> mode at the top patch, whereas on-body (omnidirectional) operation stems from shorting the top patch to the middle and bottom metal layers resulting in excitation of a TM<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">00</inf> mode. Compared to other radiators from the literature, the presented antenna features a simple topology while enabling independent tuning of both resonant frequencies. The simulation results show that the structure offers 30 MHz (i.e., from 2.46 GHz to 2.49 GHz) and 580 MHz (5.52 GHz to 6.1 GHz) bandwidths (at the –10 dB level) around the lower and upper resonant frequencies, respectively."

    "abstract": "Understanding and predicting customer behavior is essential for developing effective personalized marketing strategies in the digital economy. However, traditional segmentation techniques such as k-means or rule-based models struggle to handle the ambiguity and evolving nature of real-world customer data. This paper presents a hybrid framework that integrates Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering with Weighted Interval-Valued Dual Hesitant Fuzzy Sets (WIVDHFS) and Deep Q-Network (DQN)-based reinforcement learning to enable adaptive and interpretable customer targeting. Using a cleaned version of the publicly available Online Retail dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, customers are segmented via a weighted RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model, and a hesitancy score is derived from fuzzy membership uncertainty. These segments inform a reinforcement learning agent that selects optimal marketing actions—such as discounts, cross-selling, waiting, or reordering— based on customer state and context in a simulated environment. Experimental results show that fuzzy clustering achieved a Fuzzy Partition Coefficient (FPC) of 0.6423, indicating robust segmentation with moderate overlap. Among nine reinforcement learning models tested, those prioritizing inventory efficiency (w<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf> = 0.7) achieved the highest average reward of 73.0, consistently favoring a waiting strategy. This outcome highlights the framework’s ability to generate strategic, context-aware marketing decisions based on revenue and inventory which demonstrates a path toward intelligent marketing automation. The main limitation of this work is that it has only been validated in a simulated setting, and results may differ in real-world deployment."

However, conventional MPC methods typically employ fixed weight matrices, which lack the capability to adapt to environmental changes in real time. To address this limitation, a novel MPC strategy with adaptive weight adjustment is proposed in this study. The proposed approach initializes the weight matrix based on the robot velocity and subsequently adjusts the optimization weights in real time by comparing the robot current state with the reference state. This adjustment allows for task-specific and environment-sensitive behavior optimization, thereby improving the robot ability to handle complex scenarios and enhancing the overall control performance. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared to traditional MPC, the adaptive-weight MPC adjustment reduces the variation in the center of mass (CoM) height by 2.5 %, decreases the maximum roll angle by 0.2°, and mitigates pitch angle oscillations. Additionally, it effectively suppresses velocity deviations, leading to a significant improvement in stability during the early walking phase."

The XGBoost model achieved the highest accuracy (94.59%) and was further analysed using SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) to interpret feature influence and detect potential biases. Results indicate that while Centrelink income is a significant predictor, its association with loan approval is nuanced, revealing potential biases against welfare-dependent applicants. The study underscores the need for inclusive, data-driven credit assessment models that account for the unique financial profiles of Centrelink recipients, promoting equitable access to credit and aligning with global financial inclusion efforts."

Media clock recovery is a mechanism for achieving a glitch-free audio experience over Ethernet. A complete software-based MCR mechanism requires a lot of Software tuning and is prone to system latencies, whereas a hardware-based MCR requires costly electronic components. The proposed Media clock recovery mechanism in this study combines both hardware and software-based media clock recovery (MCR) mechanisms. The hardware part consists of a clock multiplier, which can be considered as a PLL but lacks phase alignment, effectively making it a frequency syntonization. Therefore, using software components, this phase alignment is achieved, making it a complete frequency synchronization. Keywords— Automotive AVB, Ethernet, MCR, Hardware-Software Co-design"

    "abstract": "The internet has both positive and negative aspects, with cybercrime being one of its most concerning negative consequences. As cybercrime continues to pose a significant threat, measures have been developed to mitigate these risks. One such measure is the use of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). However, vulnerabilities still exist in certain VPN protocols, particularly PPTP VPN, which relies on client authentication using MS-CHAPv2. This authentication method is susceptible to attacks, including the theft of VPN user login passwords. Such password theft can be accomplished through brute-force attacks, assisted by tools like Asleap on Backtrack. This study investigates the effectiveness of these attack techniques by applying them to a VPN server and analyzing the data obtained from victims to determine whether passwords can be successfully stolen. The research utilizes Ettercap for ARP poisoning, Asleap for generating challenge-response values, and Wireshark for packet capture. The study applies the Security Policy Development Life Cycle (SPDLC) method to analyze the results. The findings reveal that PPTP VPN with MS-CHAPv2 authentication on Windows OS remains vulnerable to password theft through brute force and assisted techniques using Backtrack's Asleap tool. A potential solution to prevent such password theft is upgrading the client operating system to latest OS version."

The research explores AWS environments to analyze the implementation of Reserved Instances together with Spot Instances when addressing cost-reliability trade-offs. A combination of Reserved Instances with Spot Instances which provides stable production workload coverage and fault-tolerant capabilities produces substantial cost savings without unacceptable MTTR increases according to real-world experimental analysis. Technical solutions for this implementation consist of load balancers that provide failover capabilities and checkpointing methods that preserve state information while EC2 Auto Scaling automates instance recovery processes. The analysis demonstrates that excessive Reserved Instance procurement results in underutilized resources and Spot Instance testing interruptions create longer recovery durations. Hybrid models solve deployment problems while they enhance high deployment speeds through reduced lead time variations. The research investigates machine learning technologies and multi cloud solutions as potential strategies for optimizing dynamic resource utilization in the future. The research discovers practices that support operational leaders in adjusting their cloud resource utilization per organizational requirements."

    "abstract": "Recruiting medical students for user studies is a challenging task. They usually have overflowing schedules and often limited experience using advanced prototype applications, which entails complex scheduling challenges and extended introduction and training periods. Among potential solutions to this challenge is the recruitment of engineering students to model of medical students’ skills and knowledge. We believe that wider, more easily accessible pools of study subjects may effectively model more valid — albeit less available — subjects, particularly in early validation and testing studies in preparation for more detailed and mature on-the-field experiments. This is because, through careful and controlled transfer of knowledge and mental models, the gap between medical and engineering students can be effectively bridged. In this paper, we delve into some of the pros and cons of recruiting among the latter students rather than the former, and propose an approach based on estimating to what degree one can leverage engineering students as suitable mental models (ESAMMs). Additionally, we advocate for the need of a more systematic analysis and comparison of these two populations, especially in the context of XR for medical education."

    "abstract": "Brushless dual rotor machines (BLDRM) hold significant potential in many fields due to multiple motion units and higher integration. It is essential to boost performance for their drive systems in both dynamic transitions and steady conditions. Firstly, this paper introduces deadbeat predictive current control (DPCC) to both regular windings and modulation windings in the BLDRM drive system to achieve rapid response. To further improve the accuracy of current prediction, the paper proposes a radial basis function (RBF) based DPCC to suppress the harmonic currents by incorporating an RBF neural network for model compensation. The RBF has a strong fitting capability for nonlinear functions. Utilizing rotor position as a continuous input, online disturbance estimation can be achieved due to RBF's characteristic of fast convergence. Besides, prior knowledge of harmonic orders is not required, and harmonics across multiple frequencies can be suppressed effectively, making it particularly suitable for BLDRM. Finally, the capability of the proposed control scheme is demonstrated by the simulation. Periodic and non-periodic disturbances can be observed by RBF, significantly reducing the total harmonic distortion in two sets of windings."

The results show that the accuracy P, recall R, mean average precision mAP50 and mAP50-95 of the improved model are improved by 0.28%, 6.03%, 2.82% and 1.87% compared with the original YOLOv8 model. This shows that the improved model can detect road and bridge cracks in complex environments more efficiently, which can provide a part of ideas for industrial target detection."

This paper introduces an innovative MPC-Decoupling approach that significantly reduces errors in these variables while integrating acceleration constraints to further enhance performance. Simulations conducted on the UR5e manipulator using the Pinocchio library reveal notable improvements: a 48 % reduction in position error and a 92 % decrease in velocity error compared to conventional MPCDecoupling position-tracking methods.

This work presents a novel mixed-signal Ising accelerator capable of highly efficient annealing. The switched-capacitor (SC) network implemented with high-precision metal-oxide-metal capacitors solves Ising problems with 8-bit coefficients and an all-to-all interaction matrix, allowing for the flexible representation of a diverse range of COPs. Highly accurate, energy-efficient, fully-parallelised, analogue computations are carried out at high speeds using a 2.5GHz clock. At this frequency, a 16x16 SC network consumes 11.6mW average power using a supply voltage of 0.8V.

Explainable AI (XAI) has emerged as a crucial field to address this challenge by making model decisions interpretable to humans. This paper conducts a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) following the PRISMA framework to investigate the role and application of XAI in the context of ISRM. We analyze existing literature to identify commonly used XAI techniques, primary application domains, documented benefits, and persistent challenges. Our findings reveal a growing trend in applying methods like SHAP and LIME for interpreting threat detection models, yet a significant gap remains in their integration into holistic, realtime risk management frameworks, particularly within specific institutional contexts such as higher education.

The shielding capability of the electronic equipment compartment is crucial for ensuring the normal operation of electronic devices. In this study, directional irradiation tests were conducted on an aircraft from the left side and the front using an EMP simulator. The electric field strength inside the electronic equipment compartment was measured using horizontally and vertically polarized electric field sensors. The shielding effectiveness of the compartment was calculated and analyzed. The results show that When the aircraft is exposed to either horizontally or vertically polarized electromagnetic pulses, the oscillation decay trend and decay time of the electric field waveform within the electronic equipment cabin remain consistent. Notably, as the irradiation intensity increases from E1 to E2, the oscillation amplitude of the horizontally polarized electric field exhibits a more pronounced variation. In contrast, the oscillation amplitude of the vertically polarized electric field shows a consistent level of change. The maximum difference in shielding effectiveness under varying EMP peak intensities, polarization modes, and irradiation directions was 3.3 dB, with the variation in shielding effectiveness remaining consistent. The shielding effectiveness is closely related to the materials and structure of the aircraft body but is largely independent of the EMP irradiation intensity, polarization mode, and irradiation direction. These findings provide a basis for evaluating the EMP protection capability of aircraft electronic equipment compartments and have significant engineering implications."

    "abstract": "Autonomous robots require efficient local path planning capabilities to handle complex dynamic obstacles in unstructured environments. However, traditional methods, such as Timed Elastic Band (TEB) local path planning, rely on static parameter settings, making them less adaptable to environmental changes and reducing their effectiveness in dynamic scenarios. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an adaptive TEB-based local path planning algorithm optimized using the Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) optimizer. The approach integrates <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{1 6}$</tex>-line LiDAR, RGB-D cameras, and YOLO-based obstacle detection to identify different obstacles. Based on obstacle type and distance, the algorithm applies gradient-based tuning to key TEB parameters, improving obstacle avoidance under dynamic field conditions. The algorithm was tested in dynamic scenarios, and the experimental results indicate that the proposed method improves path planning efficiency while maintaining a safe distance from obstacles."

    "abstract": "Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) devices show better performance as compared to solid-state devices in terms of radio frequency (RF) response, like insertion loss and isolation. However, MEMS devices face reliability issues, and stress is one of the main concerns. MEMS devices involve many non-traditional fabrication steps, like releasing hanging structures. Released MEMS structures show built-in stress from the fabrication process. This stress can cause them to bend, curl, or buckle. Especially in the case of Radio Frequency (RF) MEMS switches, curling buckling increases the pull-in voltage. In the literature, to address stress-related buckling, thermal annealing was applied at different temperatures after release. However, post-release annealing reduces the stress and results in curled-up and unstable structures. The present paper explores a novel and innovative method for thermally annealing structures at an appropriate stage to reduce stress and buckling in released cantilever structures. Annealing at the appropriate step results in a significant reduction in cantilever bending and warping, indicating effective stress relaxation and yielding straight, mechanically stable cantilevers. After controlling the stress and buckling, the pull-in voltage is reduced to 40 V, which is in close agreement with the simulated results. The measured insertion loss of the switch is -0.4 dB, and isolation is -22 dB for the DC to 20 GHz frequency range."

To mitigate this burden, this letter proposes an autoregressive (AR) model based method for predicting improved initial guesses to accelerate convergence. The AR model parameters are estimated using the Burg algorithm. Predicting each initial guess incurs only (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>) computational complexity, which is lower than the (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N<sup>2</sup></i>) cost of a single iteration in the iterative solver. Compared with those from the conventional phase-corrected initial guess method, the initial guesses predicted by the proposed method are closer to the converged solution. The proposed method effectively reduces the number of iterations, particularly under stringent convergence criteria. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "Inthis paper, a prescribed-time fuzzy optimized control scheme is developed for quadrotor uncrewed aerial vehicles (QUAVs) under asymmetric global performance constraints and disturbances. Firstly, a prescribed-time fuzzy optimized controller for QUAVs is designed based on the actor-critic architecture. In this approach, the fuzzy logic system is employed to approximate unmodeled dynamics, while the critic network evaluates performance indexes, and the actor network executes control actions. Furthermore, by constructing a piecewise continuous function, the controller not only drives the QUAV to achieve prescribed-time tracking, but also ensures asymmetric global prescribed performance, which eliminates the initial conditions of tracking errors. Moreover, a prescribed-time disturbance observer is designed to compensate for the effect of external disturbances. Different convergence rates are set for the attitude loop, position loop, and observers by adjusting the prescribed times. In addition, a second-order command filter is adopted to avoid direct differentiation of virtual control laws. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under asymmetric global prescribed performance constraints and external disturbances, all error signals of QUAVs satisfy practical prescribed-time stability, while minimizing the cost index. Finally, a simulation validates the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy."

However, in an alternating magnetic field environment, the conductors will generate AC losses, which can cause local overheating. Filamentary technology can effectively reduce the AC losses. This work investigates the magnetization and transport losses of stacked HTS cables based on multi-filamentary REBCO tapes. Results directly demonstrates the fact of the multi-filamentary structure in reducing magnetization loss. As the twist angle increased, magnetization losses first decreased and then stabilized. At low magnetic fields, the difference in magnetization loss between the original cable and the multi-filamentary cable is relatively small. Under higher magnetic fields, the magnetization loss of the original cable is significantly higher than that of the multi-filamentary cable. The transport losses of the multi-filamentary cable are always lower than those of the original cable. The optimization effect of filamentization on magnetization losses is significantly stronger than that on transport losses."

Yet, these tactile assessments lack sensitivity, reliability, and ergonomic compatibility for the millions of individuals who experience a clenched hand posture following their brain injury. We present a novel compact, automated tactile stimulator with real-time force estimation, which we designed for use in brain injury and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The system interfaces with the finger through a compact-sized stimulator (9 mm height -18 mm outer diameter) that uses pneumatic actuation to inflate a silicone membrane. The membrane indents a Kirigami cut-out, maintaining a constant 6 mm contact area on the finger and enabling precise force application down to 0.01 N with increments as low as 0.01 N. Integrated fiber optic displacement and pressure sensors provide real-time measurement of the indentation of the skin and estimation of forces applied. A physical model and a neural network each estimated the applied forces, with the latter achieving higher accuracy. This novel tactile stimulator system addresses critical limitations of existing devices, enabling accurate, low-force tactile stimulation and measurement, while maintaining a compact size to investigate the neural processes governing tactile perception, including following a brain injury."

To address the challenge of precise control under uncertain external disturbances, we propose a method utilizing null space control of a redundant robotic manipulator integrated with a nonlinear disturbance observer (DO). This approach extends the classical DO by decoupling the compensation of disturbances in the task space and the null space, ensuring task-space precision while preserving null space compliance. Experimental comparisons with existing methods demonstrate superior tracking accuracy and disturbance rejection under unknown external interactions. Finally, to simulate human-robot collaboration (HRC) in robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery scenarios, remote center of motion (RCM) constraint trajectory tracking experiments under external disturbances show that this method effectively balances motion constraint precision and system resilience against disturbances."

Graph diffusion, a graph learning method that can focus on neighborhood structure and transmit information, has great research potential. In this study, a novel dynamic diffusion graph nonnegative matrix factorization (DGNMF) method is proposed, which uses a diffusion graph to improve the performance of FL and further enhances the effectiveness and stability of downstream classification tasks. DGNMF aims to mine and retain structural information more deeply in FL to build a more powerful and stable FL method. First, the model embeds graph learning into FL to obtain features containing structural information. Second, dynamic diffusion graph learning is used to mine deeper and more global structural information. Finally, we construct an updateable indicator matrix to enhance the discriminability of features. The classification experimental results of DGNMF on six databases demonstrate its advantages, verify its effectiveness and stability, and prove the importance of diffusion graph in improving FL."

    "abstract": "Radiation testing of microelectronics remains essential for ensuring reliability in environments such as space and nuclear power systems. One critical component found in many systems is the metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET). While work has been conducted on early MOSFET designs, there remains a gap in three key areas: testing modern power MOSFETs, collecting live test data, and evaluating components in combined radiation environments. Using modern components ensures that systems currently in use, both public and private, are better protected against radiation damage. Live monitoring allows observation of single-event effects and transient behavior not detectable through post-irradiation analysis. Additionally, conducting experiments in fission-spectrum neutron and gamma environments better replicates real-world conditions. While the literature addresses each of these topics separately, this work combines them by live-testing a boost converter circuit composed of a MAX1932 gate driver and a BSS119N N-type MOSFET under both neutron and gamma radiation. Testing was performed at the Purdue University Reactor Number One (PUR-1) and the Hopewell cobalt-60 irradiator, evaluating the circuit’s response to gamma total ionizing dose (TID) and thermal neutron-induced transients. Live monitoring displayed real-time transients, degradation, and recovery behavior. Results indicate gamma radiation plays a dominant role in circuit degradation. However, when considering the dose-dependent degradation, the combined radiation environment of PUR-1 induces failure with 34.8% less dose when compared to the Co-60. Suggesting neutron activation is contributing to secondary gamma dose or boron-10 (n,α) reaction damage. While Co-60 testing remains critical, thermal neutron facilities may offer a useful, cost-effective screening method for identifying gamma-sensitive components."

The Trajectory Planner in Multiagent and Dynamic Environments (MADER) algorithm has been successfully used for this purpose; however, it assumes perfect knowledge of the future trajectories of the dynamic obstacles. In practical scenarios, the future trajectory of the obstacles may not be known in advance. To address this limitation, we propose POF+MADER, an enhanced version that integrates a probabilistic obstacle filter with adaptive prediction horizons based on obstacle velocity. Our approach integrates a decentralized real-time Kalman Filter-based trajectory estimation with MADER’s planning core, eliminating the need for perfect a priori knowledge. We validate our approach through simulations with sensor noise (σ = 0.2 − 0.5m) to simulate realworld localization uncertainty, with performance benchmarked against the MADER, Robust-MADER, and Ego-Swarm planner baselines. To further demonstrate its practical applicability, we conducted real-world experiments on the Crazyflie UAV platform, comparing its performance to the original MADER algorithm. Results show a 38.75% collision rate reduction in simulation and a 25% reduction in real-world experiments, without a significant increase in average navigation time. Furthermore, even in the presence of real-time sensor-induced noise in obstacle position measurements, our approach consistently outperforms the baseline planners, demonstrating its robustness in trajectory planning under perception uncertainty."

    "abstract": "With the widespread adoption of mobile smart devices and the Internet, a new paradigm known as Mobile Crowdsourcing (MCS) has emerged, which can provide efficient execution of large-scale tasks. However, it faces challenges due to an insufficient number of crowdsourcing participants. Existing works primarily focus on increasing participants’ willingness to engage, without addressing the issue of a limited user pool. In this paper, we incentivize users to diffuse the task within their social networks through financial rewards in the task duration, thereby recruiting additional social neighbors, expanding the user pool, and maximizing task completion. Specifically, we propose a Dynamic Reward Update and User Selection under the Diffusion (DRUUSD) algorithm for social network diffusion scenarios, given a budget constraint. The algorithm dynamically updates the task diffusion reward and task execution reward based on the current recruitment, while selecting users with the highest utility whose activated social neighbors can contribute more to task completion to diffuse tasks. Through multiple time steps of user selection and reward updates, the algorithm aims to recruit more participants and maximize task completion. We run extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed algorithm against four benchmark methods. The experimental results show that under the same total budget constraint, our algorithm can recruit more mobile users and achieve higher task completion compared to other benchmark algorithms."

We present Physio-BP, a physiologically-guided dual-radar system enabling calibration-free, continuous tracking of systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by integrating spatially resolved vascular dynamics. Unlike conventional single-waveform radar approaches, Physio-BP synchronously captures mechanical signals from the heart and pulse waves from the carotid artery, allowing precise measurement of pulse arrival time (PAT) and inter-beat intervals (IBI). To enhance signal quality, we introduce a novel joint signal selection algorithm that optimizes feature extraction across dual radars, effectively addressing the inherent signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) disparities between the chest and neck monitoring sites. To validate our system, an extensive dataset exceeding 50 hours was collected under diverse conditions, including different seasons, times of day, body postures, and radar devices, ensuring comprehensive coverage. Experimental results on the dataset confirm that Physio-BP enables continuous and precise SBP and DBP tracking, a capability not achieved by current baseline methods, thereby advancing non-contact sensing for hemodynamic monitoring."

Each element integrates four PIN diodes, providing 1-bit phase control for LP waves and 2-bit control for circular polarization (CP) waves. Using a beam-coding strategy inspired by Pancharatnam–Berry (PB) phase manipulation, the reflectarray can switch among LP, cross-LP, left-hand CP (LHCP), and right-hand CP (RHCP) states. Notably, distinct 1-bit and 2-bit phase compensations are employed for the LP and CP modes, respectively. A 16 × 16 Ku-band prototype was fabricated and experimentally characterized. Measurements demonstrate beam scanning up to ±60°, with peak gains exceeding 21 dBi and 3-dB gain bandwidths of 19.0% in LP mode, 19.5% in cross-LP mode, and 16.9% in both CP modes. Compared with prior works, the proposed design achieves wider bandwidth and quad-polarization reconfigurability with a structurally simpler single-feed configuration, making it attractive for polarization-diverse applications such as satellite communications, airborne platforms, and emerging wireless systems."

Over the past several years, numerous LEO satellites have entered orbit to support networking capabilities and initiate operations. At present, LEO communication services mainly focus on Ka/Ku frequency band. Multiple systems, large scale, and limited frequency bands will bring great spectrum pressure to the geostationary orbit (GSO) system. An adaptive centralized power control method for mega-constellation satellite communication system is proposed, aiming to maximize the average capacity of LEO satellites subject to interference limit imposed on GSO system and the restriction of feeder link quality of service in the article. The adaptive centralized power control problem with constraints based on disturbance is modeled as a nonconvex nonlinear problem. Then, it is reconstituted into a number of nonlinear convex problems by the quadratic transformation. The adaptive centralized power control problem is addressed by optimizing iterative convex problems, achieving convergence at a stationary point and reaching the optimal solution. Finally, the performance of this algorithm is verified by simulation. Utilizing this method can reduce 8.62% of the total amount of interference from mega-constellation system while improving 0.49% of the average satellite capacity of mega-constellation system when the limit is equal to -140 dBw."

    "abstract": "The paper addresses the problem of phase synthesis of apertures with assigned amplitude. Applying the method of stationary phase it will be shown that the asymptotic solution satisfies a Monge–Ampère partial differential equation (PDE) with appropriate boundary value conditions. In agreement Chu’s energy mapping principle for reflector shaping, the Monge–Ampère PDE can solved identifying an irrotational transport map from the source aperture to the target beam. After a description of the general theory, the paper focuses on irrotational linear maps associated to quadratic phase solutions demonstrating the possibility of obtaining beams of the same shape of the source aperture, a result only observed for circular and square apertures. Exploiting a polar decomposition of the affine transformation matrix, it will be also demonstrated the possibility of rotating the beam, a result reported (to the best knowledge of the authors) for the first time. In a companion paper, the general problem of finding a solution to the Monge–Ampère PDE via irrotational transport maps will be addressed by mean of the theory of “optimal transport”."

    "abstract": "We introduce a novel approach that combines tactile estimation and control for in-hand object manipulation. By integrating measurements from robot kinematics and an image-based tactile sensor, our framework estimates and tracks object pose while simultaneously generating motion plans in a receding horizon fashion to control the pose of a grasped object. This approach consists of a discrete pose estimator that tracks the most likely sequence of object poses in a coarsely discretized grid, and a continuous pose estimator-controller to refine the pose estimate and accurately manipulate the pose of the grasped object. Our method is tested on diverse objects and configurations, achieving desired manipulation objectives and outperforming single-shot methods in estimation accuracy. The proposed approach holds potential for tasks requiring precise manipulation and limited intrinsic in-hand dexterity under visual occlusion, laying the foundation for closed-loop behavior in applications such as regrasping, insertion, and tool use.

This application is designed to recognize and generate text naturally, enabling a more human interaction between users and machines. The application, developed by OpenAI, was released on November 30, 2022. This initial version was a part of the development of a larger language model and had undergone various updates afterwards. This study was intended to analyze the factors influencing the use of the AI Chat GPT. UTAUT (Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology) model, which has been widely used to measure the level of users' acceptance of the application as well as the intensity in using the technology, was used to collect the data. Its variables, namely Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, Social Influence, Facilitating Condition, Behavioral Intention, and Use Behavior, were expected to reveal the factors influencing the acceptance and the use of the AI Chat GPT application. The results of this study exhibited a significant relationship between the variable ‘Effort Expectancy’ with ‘Behavioral Intention’, ‘Facilitating Condition’ with ‘Use Behavior’, and ‘Social Influence with Behavioral Intention’ with each achievement value of EE- > UB with P values 0.046, FC- > UB with P values 0.043, and SI- > with a value of 0.082. Other variables did not show sufficient significance to reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, there was no sufficient evidence to support the hypothesized relationship."

By integrating the shaped metal jets with the ultra-wideband advantages of cage antennas, it resolves the bandwidth limitations of traditional shaped-charge jet antennas. Simulation results show that at time 5 and time7 of jet formation, the antenna achieves ultra-wideband impedance matching with $\\mathrm{S} 11\\lt -10 \\mathrm{~dB}$ in the $2-12 \\mathrm{GHz}$ frequency band, with a peak gain of 8 dBi at 9 GHz. Although experimental measurements indicate gain attenuation due to machining errors and poor feed contact, the impedance matching performance remains significantly superior to traditional structures. This validates the enhancement effect of the dynamic reconfiguration scheme on UWB antenna performance."

The results indicate that the RCS from rough spherical surfaces is larger than that of smooth spherical surfaces, and the influence of spherical surface roughness on RCS becomes more pronounced with increasing frequency. The simulation results offer deeper insights: as the operating frequency increases, the impact of surface roughness on RCS becomes non-negligible even for seemingly smooth spherical surfaces."

However, BRIN currently lacks an integrated and effective system for presenting these reports in real-time. Existing data is still managed through static spreadsheet tables, which are less interactive and do not adequately support comprehensive analysis or monitoring. This study focuses on designing and implementing a real-time web-based interactive dashboard for visualizing researcher networks and intellectual property reports. The dashboard leverages the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) method for topic modeling and the ForceAtlas2 algorithm for network visualization. Developed using the Streamlit framework, the dashboard includes features such as bar charts, pie charts, network graphs, word clouds, and filtering options to enhance data accessibility and analysis. The system development follows the Rapid Application Development (RAD) methodology to ensure a structured and efficient process. The results demonstrate that the dashboard provides an innovative solution for BRIN by enabling dynamic visualization and analysis of researcher networks and intellectual property. This approach improves data transparency, accessibility, and usability for stakeholders while significantly enhancing the efficiency of reporting <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{9 1, 1 \\%}$</tex>.

This paper explores the central role of XAI in enhancing the reliability, ethical transparency, and regulatory compliance of AI-powered, KG-based drug repurposing. One of XAI's most important contributions is its ability to explain why a drug is predicted to treat a particular disease - by revealing key features, paths, or biological relationships that support the prediction. This allows researchers and clinicians to verify the biological plausibility of AI-driven suggestions, which is crucial for preclinical validation and clinical decision-making. The paper also discusses key XAI techniques - including feature attribution, counterfactual analysis, and path reasoning - and the challenges and ethical implications tied to biomedical use cases."

    "abstract": "As the global population ages, the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is increasing. With no cure and unpredictable course, ALS presents two major unmet challenges: the need for effective treatment strategies and objective, quantitative methods to assess disease progression. This study addresses these challenges by designing and validating an experimental protocol for collecting key biomechanical parameters, which facilitates a standardized evaluation of ALS. The protocol involves acquiring data from both healthy and ALS subjects to refine patient assessment and evaluate the advantages of exoskeleton use. The protocol was validated using a passive upper limb exoskeleton on five healthy subjects and two ALS patients with varying severities of the Flail Arm phenotype. Analysis of key performance indicators, extracted from electromyographic signals and inertial measurement unit during selected tasks, showed a reduction in the average Root Mean Square and integrated EMG values for healthy subjects, which confirms the effectiveness of the protocol in evaluating the benefits of the exoskeleton. In ALS patients, not only were similar benefits seen, but differences between the different stages of the disease were also highlighted. The results obtained provided the basis for further improvements in some protocol specifications."

    "abstract": "The ground plane plays a crucial role in antenna performance. Variations in ground plane size can significantly alter the radiation pattern, affecting parameters such as gain, beamwidth, and axial ratio. This can pose challenges, for instance, in circularly polarized antenna arrays where individual elements may exhibit excellent circular polarization on a small ground plane but degrade when integrated into a larger array. In this paper, we use the dielectric resonator antenna (DRA) as an example to propose a method that renders the antenna insensitive to ground plane size variations. This approach is effective for both linearly polarized and circularly polarized antennas, with potential applications in array design and automotive antennas."

The core aim is to identify and track vehicles in real time while classifying road segments based on traffic dynamics. A detailed, annotated dataset of traffic videos was compiled to train the YOLO model, ensuring robust performance. Roads are segmented into three zones to depict traffic flow: Red Zone, marking heavy congestion with immobile or crawling vehicles; Orange Zone, indicating moderate congestion with sluggish movement; and Blue Zone, representing smooth traffic with negligible delays. By evaluating vehicle speeds and motion patterns, the system dynamically labels road sections, enabling the detection of traffic bottlenecks and supporting efficient urban traffic management. This work showcases the transformative potential of deep learning and computer vision for smart city infrastructure."

Yet UAVs face growing electromagnetic interference during flight, risking navigation failure or loss of control. To address the issue that traditional algorithms fail to consider energy consumption and anti-Interference, an A*-based dual-objective UAV path planning algorithm is proposed. First, key factors of UAV energy consumption and interference are analyzed, and corresponding calculation models are built. Second, energy and interference penalties are added to the traditional $A^{*}$ s cost and heuristic functions to form a dual-objective optimization function. Finally, MATLAB simulations compare the proposed algorithm with traditional A*. Results show it effectively balances UAV energy consumption and anti-interference capabilities."

A CAN sniffing tool is used to map the data form the car. An Arduino board, wifi shield, mcp2515 and an On-Board Diagnostics tool (OBD II) are connected in a setup in order to inject the messages into the car. The connections support both monitoring and message injection allowing users to control in vehicular functions. The proposed setup offers a tool for diagnosing, testing and vehicular controlling by highlighting cybersecurity implications in automotive networks."

The CRISP-DM method was used as the research framework, covering the stages of business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modeling, and evaluation. Data were collected through a VAKbased questionnaire (Visual, Auditory, Kinesthetic) completed by 224 students. SVM was used to detect optimal margin-based patterns, while Random Forest improved accuracy through a combination of several decision trees. The prediction results of both models were combined using a Voting Classifier to maximize performance. Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics showed that the combination of SVM and Random Forest with Voting Classifier produced higher accuracy than either method alone. These findings are expected to help teachers adjust learning strategies according to student needs, thereby improving learning effectiveness at MAN 3 Padang Lawas."

A closed-form memory polynomial model of the PA is derived from input–output data, accurately representing the PA system function and overcoming the limitations of conventional methods that rely on linear approximations of the PA system. In addition, a recursive formulation is employed to perform precise predistortion at each sample, effectively addressing the problem arising from the possible non-existence of a universal inverse of the PA system function. The simulation results confirm that the proposed DPD scheme achieves orders-of-magnitude reductions in amplitude and phase errors and achieves a maximum ACLR improvement of 3.26 dBc, demonstrating better performance and robustness across different input amplitude ranges."

    "abstract": "The accuracy of automated hind leg bone segmentation in swine slaughtering and processing is currently insufficient. Several challenges contribute to this issue, including the small grayscale difference between the bone marrow cavity and soft tissues in X-ray images, as well as blurred joint edges resulting from insufficient cartilage calcification. These factors lead to low deboning efficiency and a high rate of misjudgment in the bone marrow region, which directly impacts the standardization of meat quality grading and the profitability of industrial production. In response to the previously described challenges, this work presents a segmentation network for X-ray images of porcine hind legs, which employs a dualchannel architecture for multi-scale feature enhancement. The framework of this network consists of two main modules working in tandem: an image edge texture feature enhancement module and a global information feature fusion module. By utilizing a combination of local texture enhancement and an attention mechanism, this first module substantially improves edge definition in areas with poor contrast. Subsequently, the designed global information feature fusion module integrates the preliminary segmentation results with the edge-enhanced features to consolidate global image contextual information. By integrating multi-scale feature fusion with attention mechanisms, the network is able to generate consistent and highly accurate segmentation paths for porcine hind leg bones in X-ray images. Quantitative analysis demonstrates that, in comparison to LinkNet and DeepLabV3Plus, the proposed approach enhances the F1 Score (FS) by 4.5 % and 1.08 %, and Accuracy (Acc) by <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{1. 1 3 \\%}$</tex> and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{0. 7 8 \\%}$</tex>, effectively boosting both segmentation accuracy and stability."

The PMU is a representational measurement, and for this kind of measurement, it is appropriate to test performance (but it is not appropriate to specify a measurement method, as the standard does). This paper proposes a testing solution based on archiving real world data. It would permit testing of both existing and proposed equipment, with both \"synthetic\" waveforms and real-world recordings. Cooperation between users and developers would be encouraged, and is expected to lead to further advances in the field of synchronized measurement."

    "abstract": "On Indian roads, potholes are a serious hazard that frequently results in accidents and vehicle damage, underscoring the necessity for precise, real-time detection systems. Problems like small pothole sizes, inconsistent weather and lighting, and several potholes close together cause existing solutions to frequently fail. To overcome these obstacles, this study suggests a YOLOv11-based strategy, more especially the YOLO11n variant. Real-world complexities such as tiny, overlapping potholes, shifting light levels in the morning, evening, and night, and unfavourable weather conditions like rain were all included in the real-time dataset used to train the model. By combining attention-enhanced, anchor-free detection with multi-scale feature extraction, YOLO11n allows for accurate pothole localization in a variety of situations. With 96.6% mAP@50, 93.5% precision, and 90.6% recall, the model produced exceptional results, proving its usefulness for real-time applications. this research reduces vehicle damage by early detection of road hazards and enhances road safety by pothole detection on above challenging scenario."

    "abstract": "The development of multiple projects and hardware prototypes frequently requires collaboration between software and hardware teams, who are focused on a certain programming languages. This can result in communication challenges during sharing ideas and solutions. It leads to integration difficulties by the fundamentally distinct nature of the programming languages. Also, knowledge gaps may arise, increasing the risk of code failures and extending of development timelines. In such scenarios, teams often need specialists in both software and hardware description languages. In case, if it can be complicated, developers and researchers have created the frameworks such as MyHDL, HDPython, AmaranthHDL etc. Using the Python syntax and decorators on the top-layer, the frameworks can convert Python source-code into VHDL instructions, initiating further FPGA-Prototyping. In parallel, recent achievements in Large Language Models (LLMs) like CodeT5, CodeBERT have introduced new functionality for automating code transliteration tasks. The mentioned models are pretrained by Go, Java, PHP and Python languages, which are quite common for software developers. However, the support of hardware languages such as VHDL or Verilog needs additional investigations. Due to the following fact, the proposed investigations, represent an investigation and realisation of PytoVHDL framework. Inspiring by MyHDL, AI-HDLCoder, the framework aims to bridge the gap between Python and VHDL programmers. Making numerous experiments with middle layer interface, the proposed work shows conversion results for systems that include combination logic or can be sufficient for digital signal processing."

Subsequently, a Fresnel phase modulation is introduced to realize axial focal-plane shifting. By further combining two sets of holographic patterns through strip-segmentation integration and applying Debye vector diffraction theory for numerical simulations, a three-dimensional nonorthogonal Dammann array distribution is generated within a single coordinate system.

In this paper, we propose the Attention-Contextual U-Net (AC U-Net), a new architecture for multi-step solar irradiance map prediction using GK-2A satellite imagery over the Korean Peninsula. The proposed model enhances a standard U-Net by integrating spatiotemporal attention and a Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layer. This layer injects high-level contextual information directly into the model’s bottleneck, allowing for dynamic feature adaptation. Experiments demonstrate that AC U-Net outperforms not only the persistence baseline but also deep learning-based competitors such as ConvLSTM and HRNet. Our work demonstrates that conditioning on contextual features is a powerful strategy for improving long-range forecasting accuracy."

    "abstract": "Fault diagnosis is crucial for ensuring fault-tolerant control in multiphase motors, necessitating an accurate, simple, and robust fault diagnosis technique. However, current multiphase fault diagnosis methods face several challenges, such as susceptibility to interference in fault indices, difficulty in diagnosing multiple open-circuit faults (OCFs), high computational complexity, and lack of universality. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a robust, easy-to-implement, and broadly applicable multiphase diagnostic scheme. The proposed algorithm first identifies the faulty phase, then pinpoints the faulty switch within the faulty phase, and finally diagnoses the open-phase faults (OPFs). To suppress misdiagnosis caused by interference, a virtual dc component is introduced to improve the calculation of fault indices, and indices for the same fault types are unified and normalized. Subsequent normalization attenuates the influence of speed and load variations. By extracting the commonalities and differences of the improved fault indices across various OCFs, newly binary fault indices for OCFs are derived from common features to identify the faulty phase, and newly binary fault indices for open-switch faults (OSFs) and OPFs are derived from distinctive features to locate the faulty switch and diagnose OPF. The proposed approach significantly reduces computational burden while enabling the identification of multiple open-circuit faults. Experimental results under different nonideal conditions verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) hold significant potential for enhancing road safety and traffic efficiency. The performance of VANETs heavily relies on the strategic deployment of roadside units (RSUs), which gather and disseminate critical information. A key challenge is that different types of information possess varying timeliness requirements, rendering delayed information ineffective. However, this crucial aspect has not been sufficiently addressed in the existing RSU deployment literature. To bridge this gap, we first classify operational scenarios based on discretized traffic flows and information types, analyzing their corresponding transmission time constraints. We then formulate an RSU deployment model that explicitly incorporates these heterogeneous timeliness requirements. To solve this complex problem, we develop a Branch-and-Benders decomposition (BBD) algorithm, which partitions the problem into a master problem for determining RSU locations and multiple subproblems for allocating vehicle communication demands in each scenario. The master problem is solved using a branch-and-cut procedure. Upon finding an integer feasible solution, the dual subproblems are solved to generate optimality and feasibility cuts that are dynamically added to the master problem. Furthermore, we introduce valid inequalities to accelerate convergence. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed BBD algorithm can efficiently generate provably high-quality solutions."

While WiFi-based authentication via motion recognition has shown potential in single-user scenarios, its effectiveness diminishes significantly in multi-user environments. Detecting subtle movements, such as breathing, from multiple users simultaneously poses a significant challenge, pushing the capabilities of current WiFi authentication systems to their limits. In this paper, we present <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">BreathEye</i>, a multi-user authentication system that leverages only a pair of commercial WiFi devices to detect and authenticate the subtle respiratory patterns of multiple individuals simultaneously. The core insight of our approach lies in exploiting the inherent variability in individual breathing patterns, which manifest in short-term energy fluctuations and long-term dependencies within the breathing signals. To this end, we propose a dual-attention fusion mechanism that captures these subtle differences, enabling the effective disentanglement of individual breathing signals from overlapping multi-user data. To further enhance practicality, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">BreathEye</i> incorporates a few-shot learning framework to minimize user registration time and reduce system training overhead by analyzing independent breathing signals for authentication.

    "abstract": "This paper presents Hydra, a dynamic BFT protocol that allows replicas to join and leave the system dynamically. It addresses the limitations of traditional static BFTs in managing membership changes and can be used to simplify the implementation of many features in modern blockchain applications. Hydra relies on weaker assumptions to achieve standard properties compared to the existing solution Dyno and introduces a configuration auto-transition protocol to ensure liveness. Through temporary configurations and explicitly defined replica responsibilities for request handling, Hydra pipelines membership requests alongside regular requests and realizes clarity, achieving a more efficient and smoother configuration transitions. It also employs a non-blocking configuration discovery mechanism, enabling new replicas to participate in consensus quickly. We formally prove Hydra's correctness under the dynamic BFT model. Experimental results demonstrate Hydra's ability to maintain throughput fluctuations within 5% during various replica join and leave scenarios, outperforming Dyno and existing BFT system supporting reconfiguration in both stability and efficiency. Hydra effectively manages scenarios that Dyno circumvents with stronger assumptions and quickly restores throughput to normal levels."

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of smart buildings and Internet of Things (IoT) applications, indoor positioning technology plays an essential role in smart environments. However, wireless fingerprinting often suffers from signal distribution shifts caused by dynamic changes and device heterogeneity in real-world settings, which significantly affects localization accuracy and generalization ability, limiting its practical use. To address the challenge of adapting to new environments without the need for additional data labeling, this study proposes MASCLoc (Multimodal Adaptation with Signal Consistency for Localization), an innovative indoor localization framework based on wireless fingerprinting that combines multi-modal feature representation and regression-based domain adaptation. MASCLoc integrates multiple modalities, including received signal strength (RSS) vectors, relative fingerprint gradients (RFG), and radio maps, and employs a spatial embedding strategy to enhance cross-modal semantic integration. It further extends the adversarial learning framework by incorporating cosine similarity and Pearson correlation losses. This design not only improves feature alignment across domains but also ensures greater physical consistency and stability in the predicted results. Experiments conducted on a longterm, cross-month dataset validate MASCLoc’s performance under various data scales and environmental changes. Results show that MASCLoc maintains an average localization error (ALE) below 3 meters, demonstrating strong adaptability and generalization capability. Overall, this research presents a highly practical unsupervised indoor localization solution that reduces labeling costs and supports efficient long-term deployment in real-world applications."

    "abstract": "The ferrite phase shifter (FPS) is a microwave device that utilizes the gyromagnetic properties of ferrite materials to achieve phase shift. It offers advantages such as fast switching speed, low insertion loss, and high reliability, making it widely used in phased array antenna systems. However, the power handling capability of Ku-band FPSs remains inadequate, limiting their application in high-power microwave phased array systems. Based on the theory of ferrite gyromagnetism and the structure of the latching non-reciprocal FPS, this paper derives a transcendental equation for the phase constant of the device. Expressions for the internal field distribution and power distribution are obtained. The interrelationships among phase-shifting efficiency, power handling capability, and various structural parameters are analyzed, leading to recommended value ranges for the structural parameters of high-power FPSs, thereby providing a theoretical foundation for phase shifter design. The ferrite material is another critical factor influencing the power handling capability. The high-power quality factor of the ferrite material is introduced, serving as a criterion for material selection. On this basis, the design, optimization, and development of a latching non-reciprocal double-toroid FPS have been completed. Through appropriate selection of structural parameters, improvement of ferrite material properties, and enhanced integration techniques, the power handling capability of the Ku-band FPS has been increased to over 500 kW, with an insertion loss of less than 1.3 dB and a maximum differential phase shift of approximately 400°."

    "abstract": "The pervasive threat of jamming attacks, particularly from adaptive jammers capable of optimizing their strategies, poses a significant challenge to the security and reliability of wireless communications. This paper addresses this issue by investigating anti-jamming communications empowered by an active reconfigurable intelligent surface. The strategic interaction between the legitimate system and the adaptive jammer is modeled as a Stackelberg game, where the legitimate user, acting as the leader, proactively designs its strategy while anticipating the jammer’s optimal response. We prove the existence of the Stackelberg equilibrium and derive it using a backward induction method. Particularly, the jammer’s optimal strategy is embedded into the leader’s problem, resulting in a bi-level optimization that jointly considers legitimate transmit power, transmit/receive beamformers, and active reflection. We tackle this complex, non-convex problem by using a block coordinate descent framework, wherein subproblems are iteratively solved via convex relaxation and successive convex approximation techniques. Simulation results demonstrate the significant superiority of the proposed active RIS-assisted scheme in enhancing legitimate transmissions and degrading jamming effects compared to baseline schemes across various scenarios. These findings highlight the effectiveness of combining active RIS technology with a strategic game-theoretic framework for anti-jamming communications."

Specifically, we consider an open radio access network (O-RAN) architecture that, although it favors the deployment of ultra-dense networks, is constrained in the number of APs that can be active simultaneously. In this context, we propose an innovative framework termed pixel-based CF-mMIMO, which enables efficient control of both the AP activation and cooperation cluster formation. Recognizing the parallels with pixel-based reconfigurable antennas, the proposed framework allows dynamic reconfiguration of the network coverage map with reasonably low computational cost. The high scalability and performance of the framework are mainly supported by a learning model based on graph neural networks (GNNs) that effectively exploits the existing graph-like structures in CF-mMIMO systems. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves competitive spectral efficiency (SE) in challenging scenarios with dense AP deployments and numerous user equipments (UEs)."

We design an evaluation pipeline based on a Top-TM-score target metric that prioritizes closest-shape matching with ground truth exemplars. We evaluate the effectiveness of this reference-guided controllability approach for protein design across various models and a diverse range of GO term combinations. We formalize controllable protein sequence generation as: given GO control termsGand reference sequencesR, generate a sequence s that maximizes structural consistency with a target fold while satisfying G. Across targets, the Top-TM-score count at thresholds ≥ 0.8 is within 3.5% of the benchmark protein count."

    "abstract": "Zero-shot neural architecture search (NAS) offers a significant boost to the efficiency of automated network design, where zero-cost proxies play a key role in evaluating the quality of candidate networks without training. However, most existing proxies measure network capability by a single specific characteristic, which is insufficient to achieve a high correlation with the final performance. Although some studies attempt to use multiple proxies for better estimation performance, they often fall short in considering the inherently multi-dimensional properties of neural networks and/or rely on simple combinations of these proxies. This work presents an effective nonlinear ensemble method to aggregate nine representative zero-cost proxies aiming at various network characteristics for comprehensive network evaluations. To obtain a reliable aggregation of proxies on a given task and efficiently utilize candidate base proxies, a diversity-aware adaptive particle swarm optimization (DAA-PSO) approach is developed to evolve the ensemble proxy. DAA-PSO maintains a pool of best solutions with varying sparsity levels to enhance the diversity of particles and employs an adaptive solution sparsification strategy to effectively identify the most suitable base proxies for the ensemble. The proposed method, named EvoREP (evolving reliable ensemble of zero-cost proxies), can efficiently discover the best ensemble proxy for the target task. Extensive experiments on popular NAS benchmarks and open-domain search spaces demonstrate the effectiveness and promising transferability of EvoREP in evolving ensemble proxies, exhibiting remarkably high correlation with test accuracy."

Three strategies were tested sequentially: volumetric flow rate reduction, scheduled volumetric flow rate cycling based on operational hours, and air filter replacement. Each intervention was followed by a dedicated monitoring period, during which energy consumption, cost, and CO₂ emissions were recorded and compared against a baseline configuration. Results showed that initial volumetric flow rate reduction achieved a modest 9.37% decrease in hourly energy consumption, while the combination of filter maintenance and programmed cycling yielded the most substantial reduction of 79.75%. This study highlights the effectiveness of low-cost monitoring tools and simple control modifications in improving the energy efficiency of legacy Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems.

    "abstract": "In photovoltaic (PV) power generation systems, traditional overvoltage prediction methods struggle to effectively handle the complex spatiotemporal coupling characteristics and multi-source heterogeneous data of power plants, while lacking quantitative assessment of prediction uncertainty. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a deep learning-based framework for PV power plant overvoltage prediction. First, we design a Heterogeneous Spatio-Temporal Graph Encoder (HSTGE) that models PV plants as heterogeneous graph structures, simultaneously capturing plant topology features and electrical temporal dynamics through spatiotemporal graph convolution operations, and introducing an adaptive graph structure learning mechanism to reflect dynamic electrical coupling relationships under different operating conditions. Second, we propose a Cross-Modal Attention Fusion mechanism (CMAF) that employs multi-head attention and hierarchical fusion strategies to achieve adaptive deep fusion of spatiotemporal features with multi-source heterogeneous information including meteorological and operational status data. Finally, we construct a Probabilistic Hierarchical Prediction Head (PHPH) that simultaneously accomplishes three tasks through a hierarchical prediction structure: normal voltage regression, overvoltage risk classification, and extreme event detection, while providing prediction uncertainty quantification based on mixture density networks and Bayesian inference. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to existing state-of-the-art baseline methods, our approach improves the F1-score for overvoltage prediction by $7.2 \\%$. Additionally, ablation experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed modules."

    "abstract": "Software defect prediction is a critical activity in software development. this work was continuous work from our research road map. Historical data is required to predict software defects, but such data is not always available for every project. In cross-project prediction, data availability is not a problem as data from other projects is available, for example, in repositories like PROMISE. However, this technique has a limitation in that the differences between the source and target projects can affect the accuracy of the predictions. Therefore, multi-source cross-project defect prediction has been developed to combine data from multiple sources to reduce the impact of domain differences between source and target projects. Previous studies have shown that appropriate selection of training data can improve cross-project defect prediction quality. In this study, we propose a distance-based strategy for selecting training data based on the distributional characteristics of available data. We evaluated the proposed strategy in a large case study with 11 datasets from different projects. We compared two source selection methods, namely KNN-TDS and median z-score, to obtain the best performance. Finally, we used the Neural Network algorithm to train the training data. The results showed that the average F1-score of the KNN-TDS method was 6% higher than the median z-score method."

In this work, a fully modular hybrid station that synergistically couples three energy vectors—photovoltaics, second-life Li-ion battery packs, and the utility grid—via an intelligent, sub-50 ms source-arbitration network. The power-conditioning front end employs a flyback-derived SMPS delivering five tightly regulated outputs (5 V, 12 V, 37 V, 48 V DC; 230 V AC) at 92–95% efficiency, while a bidirectional synchronous boost stage attains 94–97% efficiency and future-proofs the system for vehicle-to-grid operation. End-to-end power quality is preserved with < 5% total harmonic distortion under dynamic loads. An ESP32-centric IoT stack with LoRaWAN back-haul furnishes kilometre-scale telemetry, secure billing, and over-the-air firmware updates, whereas a BiLSTM-assisted battery-management layer enables real-time state-of-charge and state-of-health tracking of repurposed EV modules—extending their usable life and anchoring circular-economy objectives.

The PPO-ICM model was interfaced with the testbed’s Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) model, facilitating the control of multiple tracking UAVs as a coordinated swarm. The target UAV, in contrast, is operated by the Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) model. This study incorporates a distributed framework that enables parallel execution of an experimental simulation across multiple systems interconnected via computer networking. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated using four interconnected systems, ensuring efficient UAV coordination and scalability. This methodology has overcome the problem of policy degeneration of RL agents. The graphical results evaluate the performance of PPO-ICM, showing significant improvements in scalability, adaptability, and computational efficiency.

In contrast, cavity mode theory models the top and bottom surfaces as electric walls and the side walls as magnetic walls. The results demonstrate that both MPIE-based CMT and cavity mode theory calculate resonance frequencies are close to the full-wave analysis. However, regarding electric field distribution, the MPIE-based CMT reveals additional degenerate modes not captured by cavity mode theory, thereby providing deeper insights."

While previous work examined domain mismatch in speech tasks, the impact of domain alignment and pre-training data scale when the acoustic modalities differ between pre-training data and the downstream task remains unclear. This study trains and evaluates wav2vec 2.0 on diverse acoustic modalities to analyze the influence of these factors. The results indicate that more pre-training data leads to higher performance if the pre-training domain is closely aligned with the downstream task. However, when domain alignment is weak, downstream performance is more influenced by shared acoustic structural properties between the pre-training and fine-tuning data than by the scale of the pre-training dataset."

    "abstract": "Machine learning-based hiring systems are increasingly adopted in recruitment due to their efficiency. However, the systems can inadvertently introduce or amplify biases, particularly gender bias, leading to ethical and legal concerns. This study aims to detect gender bias in AI-based hiring systems through the application of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques. A controlled bias-perturbation framework is implemented using a job application dataset, where progressively imbalanced training sets favoring male candidates are generated. Two classification models–logistic regression and XGBoost–are trained and evaluated. SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) are utilized to analyze the decision-making processes of AI models and interpret feature contributions under different bias conditions. The analysis indicates that SHAP provides more reliable and interpretable insights into model behavior compared to LIME. Additionally, XGBoost exhibits greater robustness to biased data than logistic regression, maintaining relatively consistent accuracy and interpretability. These findings demonstrate the vulnerability of hiring models to gender-related bias and underscore the importance of integrating XAI tools to enhance transparency and fairness in AI-driven recruitment systems."

Initially, a neural network is employed to establish the mapping relationship between the rotated elements and its active element pattern (AEP). The features of the rotated element are determined by its own rotation angle and the states of its adjacent elements. Then, the radiation pattern of the full array can be calculated by superimposing the AEPs of each array elements so that we can obtain desired XPL by optimizing rotation angles of the array elements using optimization algorithm like Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). To validate the proposed method, two cases for synthesizing pencil beam and flat-top patterns are conducted. The results show that the optimized patterns agree well with full-wave simulations and achieve an extremely low XPLs."

    "abstract": "As a crucial component of the power system, transmission lines undertake the key task of electrical energy transmission. Their safe and stable operation is directly related to national energy security and socio-economic development. Transmission lines are prone to low-frequency, large-amplitude oscillation under wind loads or mechanical vibrations. Intense conductor galloping not only causes wear of hardware fittings, conductor breakage and tripping, but may even lead to tower collapse accidents, resulting in large-scale power outages. Traditional monitoring methods are unable to timely capture the dynamic process of galloping and fail to meet the needs of refined power grid operation and maintenance. To detect the galloping of transmission lines in a timely manner, this paper conducts research on the design of an online monitoring device for transmission line galloping. The hardware system of the device mainly includes sensors, an information wireless transmission and processing module, and a power supply module. The software part mainly realizes functions such as data acquisition control, real-time data processing, and local alarm. This system can accurately monitor the conductor displacement, acceleration, angle, and other parameters, providing a reference for the formulation of galloping prevention and control strategies."

First, we partition the state space of the multiplayer system and design relay defense strategies based on initial conditions. Second, we introduce a multi-target allocation scheme, incorporating risk metrics and a nonlinear feedback control strategy that adapts to different state spaces. Finally, we provide sufficient conditions for the defenders to successfully intercept the intruder, considering their capture radius.

    "abstract": "Nitrogen oxides (NOx) are the main emissions from heavy-duty diesel vehicles. Although the NOx concentration downstream of the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system in the exhaust after-treatment system can be directly measured by sensors, the measurement results may have significant errors due to the sensitivity to external environmental factors, driving styles, and road conditions. Therefore, it is necessary to model the key components of diesel vehicles to improve the accuracy of online measurement of diesel vehicle emissions. This study integrates digital twin technology with the Deep Forest regression algorithm to develop a comprehensive state prediction model for key components of heavy-duty diesel vehicles. The model encompasses predictions for NOx levels both before and after Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) treatment. Among the models compared, this approach yields the smallest prediction errors. Additionally, the Random Forest regression algorithm is employed to construct an engine speed model, which also demonstrates the lowest error rate when juxtaposed with other models. Furthermore, the ElasticNet regression algorithm is utilized to build an engine coolant temperature model, again achieving the smallest model error in comparative analyses. Through the development of these datadriven digital twin models, a robust digital twin framework for heavy-duty diesel vehicles is established. This framework provides a reliable basis for real-time NOx emission optimization, facilitating effective and rational NOx emission control strategies for heavy-duty diesel vehicles."

The introduction of a periodically perturbed structure enables the antenna to satisfy the condition for periodic modulation, thereby facilitating beam-scanning leaky-wave radiation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed LWA achieves desirable dual CP radiation over the beam-scanning range from -22° to 41° and -158° to 139°, respectively. Compared to existing designs, this LWA features a low-profile, single-layer structure, offering advantages of ease of fabrication and reduced manufacturing cost."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates secure formation control for unknown networked multi-vehicle systems under denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Unlike most existing studies that assume a unified attack model across all inter-vehicle communication channels, we propose an asynchronous, distributed DoS attack strategy targeting individual communication links. Specifically, we develop a resilient distributed observer capable of withstanding multi-channel asynchronous DoS attacks. This observer simultaneously provides both specific secure state estimation and output tracking references for each vehicle by introducing the concept of channel-dependent decay rates. Building upon the estimated information, we introduce a novel hybrid policy learning algorithm that combines off-policy and on-policy learning mechanisms. This hybrid approach enables data-driven derivation of decentralized formation control policies while overcoming key limitations of traditional methods, including the requirement for initial stabilizing policies and limitations in dynamic optimization capabilities. Finally, numerical simulations of networked multi-vehicle systems demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methodology."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have gained significant attention in natural language processing (NLP) area recently. While providing notable benefits, PLMs are still vulnerable to security threats, such as backdoor attacks. In particular, the output of the backdoored PLMs can be manipulated by specific triggers in inputs. The traditional fine–tuning defense methods, which can only effectively mitigate the backdoor attack with the full dataset, become impractical. Therefore, the development of the defense method under the prompt–based, few-shot learning is necessary. In this paper, we propose two methods to enhance the existing defense method, masking–differential prompting (MDP), designed for the prompt-based paradigm under the few–shot learning. When the distribution of the anchor set information approaches zero (i.e., exhibits insufficient density), the Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence tends to infinity. To mitigate this issue, we adopt the Jensen–Shannon (JS) divergence, which remains finite and is able to more effectively exploit the anchor set information. Furthermore, the conventional manual threshold selection method (the ROC curve (AUC)) typically requires substantial computational resources. To address this limitation, we propose an adaptive threshold method to search for the threshold automatically based on the false rejection rate (FRR) allowance to overcome the high–cost manual threshold search method. Evaluation results demonstrate our proposed method can achieve better defending performance against all the typical backdoor attacks on benchmark datasets of the text classification and generation tasks."

    "abstract": "Motor imagery (MI) based brain-computer interfaces hold significant promise in assistive control and rehabilitation applications. However, conventional paradigms face critical limitations: multi-dimensional MI paradigms based on spatial separability suffer from non-intuitive control mechanisms and high user learning costs, while unilateral limb MI paradigms exhibit limited classification accuracy, failing to satisfy practical requirements. To address these challenges, this study proposes an intuitive MI paradigm that integrates the spatial separability of neural activity in limbs. The proposed paradigm includes four distinct MI movements: left hand abduction (leftward movement), right hand abduction (rightward movement), bilateral upper limb elevation, and bilateral upper limb depression. Ten subjects were recruited for data collection. A frequency-band double-branch network (FBDBNet) was developed to enhance decoding performance, which is a hybrid architecture combining multi-frequency band segmentation, double-branch (spatiotemporal and time-frequency) feature extraction, and a one-dimensional channel attention mechanism. Comparative analysis demonstrated that FBDBNet can achieve superior classification accuracy (p<0.05, Wilcoxon signed rank test) compared to existing advanced models, significantly improving MI recognition efficiency. In addition, the time-frequency characteristics of the collected data were analyzed to validate the novel paradigm. This investigation provides foundations for advancing brain-computer interface technology toward broader applications in neurorehabilitation and control."

    "abstract": "Insider threat detection (ITD) remains a significant challenge in cybersecurity due to the concealed nature of malicious activities by trusted insiders. This paper introduces a novel post-hoc ITD framework that enhances detection capabilities by integrating explicit and implicit graph structures with a temporal component to analyse user behaviour effectively. We construct an explicit graph using predefined rules that capture user activities within an organisation’s network, providing insights into explicit relationships between actions. To address potential noise and sub-optimality in the explicit graph, we complement it with an implicit graph derived from feature similarities using the Gumbel-softmax trick, which refines the structure by leveraging underlying patterns. Both graphs are processed through separate Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to produce node embeddings, which are then concatenated and refined using an attention mechanism to emphasise critical features for threat detection. These refined embeddings are subsequently fed into a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) network to capture the temporal dynamics of user behaviour. The model flags activities as anomalous if their probability scores fall below a predefined threshold. Extensive evaluations on two CERT datasets, r5.2 and r6.2, demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. On the r5.2 dataset, our model achieves an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 98.62, a perfect Detection Rate (DR) of 100%, and a low False Positive Rate (FPR) of 0.05. For the more challenging r6.2 dataset, the model achieves an AUC of 88.48, a DR of 80.15%, and an FPR of 0.15. These results illustrate that combining explicit and implicit graph representations, along with advanced sequential modelling, leads to a robust ITD solution capable of effectively distinguishing between normal and abnormal activities, even in complex scenarios."

In this paper, we propose a novel JSCC architecture, named MambaJSCC, that achieves great performance with low computational and parameter overhead. MambaJSCC utilizes the visual state space model with channel adaptation (VSSM-CA) blocks as its backbone for transmitting images over wireless channels, where the VSSM-CA primarily consists of the generalized state space models (GSSM) and the zero-parameter, zero-computational channel adaptation method (CSI-ReST). We design the GSSM module, leveraging reversible matrix transformations to express generalized scan expanding operations, and theoretically prove that two GSSM modules can effectively capture global information. We discover that GSSM inherently possesses the ability to adapt to channels, a form of endogenous intelligence. Based on this, we design the CSI-ReST method, which injects channel state information (CSI) into the initial state of GSSM to utilize its native response, and into the residual state to mitigate CSI forgetting, enabling effective channel adaptation without introducing additional computational and parameter overhead. Experimental results on different devices, including IoT device JETSON AGX ORIN, show that MambaJSCC not only outperforms existing JSCC methods (e.g., SwinJSCC) across various scenarios but also significantly reduces parameter size, computational overhead, and inference delay.

Firstly, the node cost function of hybrid A* is improved with a series of penalties to optimize the generation of smoother parking paths, specifically targeting vehicle direction, turning, and heading constraints. Secondly, to streamline planning time and complexity in narrow spaces, one parking target in hybrid A* is substituted with a set of reverse parking paths, i.e., target-tree; concurrently, the issue of curvature discontinuity in the original target-tree is addressed using a cubic parabola method. Thirdly, the optimal node for the shortest maneuvering time path is selected from the predefined obstacle-avoided target-tree, through which the improved hybrid A* and target-tree are smoothly integrated to find shorter paths in less time. Finally, based on both simulation and real-world experiments, the feasibility and effectiveness of our algorithm are validated; meanwhile, our algorithm is also superior to hybrid A* variants and other algorithms, as it enables more efficient and rapid acquisition of the shortest continuous curvature paths while achieving higher success rates in APSs."

Preliminary studies conducted with palladium (Pd) thin films coated on stainless-steel substrates demonstrated ³H absorption and metal-tritide formation, followed by ³H desorption upon heating the metal-tritide. These processes were confirmed using activity concentrations measured by a commercial tritium monitor and pulse height spectra acquired from a custom-built detector."

    "abstract": "We study the joint power allocation and reflecting-element (RE) activation to maximize the energy efficiency (EE) in communication systems assisted by an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS), taking into account imperfections in channel state information (CSI). The robust optimization problem is mixed-integer, i.e., the optimization variables are continuous (transmit power) and discrete (binary states of REs). In order to solve this challenging problem we develop two algorithms. The first one is an alternating optimization (AO) method that attains a suboptimal solution with low complexity, based on the Lambert <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">W</i> function and a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm. The second one is a branch-and-bound (B&B) method that uses AO as its subroutine and is formally guaranteed to achieve a globally optimal solution. Both algorithms do not require any external optimization solver for their implementation. Furthermore, numerical results show that the proposed algorithms outperform the baseline schemes, AO achieves near-optimal performance in most cases, and B&B has low computational complexity on average."

    "abstract": "Community detection is capable of uncovering the inherent structure and functional organization within complex networks by analyzing multi-scale topological features. According to the brief survey, local detection methods demonstrate notable strengths, but challenges persist in selecting suitable seeds, identifying community cores, and precisely extending communities. Therefore, in this paper, a local community detection algorithm based on identifying high-quality core region is proposed. Specifically, at the seed selection stage, a core cohesiveness index is constructed to quantify the node importance, with two-step filtering strategy implemented to refine the selection of suitable seeds. After that, a hierarchical affinity evaluation mechanism is proposed on the basis of node-core affinity values to ensure the formation of high-quality core region (i.e., high-quality initial community). Community extension is then achieved by using the enhanced objective function combined with an incremental update strategy, it preserves structural cohesion and reduces computational costs. Finally, the membership assignments of the remaining nodes will be further processed through community optimization to refine community boundaries. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms other community detection algorithms with relatively low time complexities across multi-scale real-world and synthetic networks."

Understanding the formation mechanism of this damage morphology can help in achieving higher LIDT gratings. The laser-induced damage threshold (LIDT) of the grating was measured to be 15.3 J/cm² under 1064 nm, 10 ns pulsed laser irradiation according to the ISO 21254 standard. Through finite element analysis, we simulated the ensuing temperature and thermal stress fields. The results identify interfacial thermal stress as the primary driver of damage. The model qualitatively reproduces the characteristic hexagonal damage morphology observed in experiments, revealing a thermo-mechanical shaping process. These findings provide critical insight into the damage evolution in nanostructured surfaces and offer guidance for the design of high-LIDT optical gratings."

    "abstract": "The rapid development of flexible load technologies brings new challenges to short-term spatial load forecasting (SSLF) in distribution networks (DNs). Conventionally, as an open-loop method, SSLF is unable to dynamically improve the forecast results. However, the nonstationary and volatility features of loads reduce the accuracy of the SSLF, the errors caused by load data loss and distortion further reduce the robustness of the forecasting. In this paper, we propose a closed-loop probabilistic forecasting method for the SSLF by integrating the modified Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional network (ST-GCN) and the statistical load baseline profile (SLBP). The modified ST-GCN consists of GCN-Gate Recurrent Unit (GCN-GRU) and GCN in parallel to simultaneously learn the spatio-temporal correlation of loads. To capture the uncertainty of the SSLF, the concrete dropout enabled Bayesian neural networks are applied. The SLBP, which is calculated by statistical method, is used to extract the periodicity of the load and mitigate the impact caused by corrupted data. The closed-loop forecasting architecture is devised to integrate the modified ST-GCN and SLBP by the dynamic clustering technique, to in turn improve the accuracy and the robustness of the forecasting results. Numerical tests are conducted using the real load data of DNs in China. Test results confirmed the superiority of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "The detection of astronaut body parts on the space station is of great significance for astronaut behavior safety monitoring, state assessment, and interaction optimization. It is a key technology for improving mission efficiency and ensuring astronaut safety. However, there are two major challenges in achieving high-precision astronaut body part detection in microgravity environments: first, there is a lack of largescale, well-annotated dedicated datasets; second, astronauts in microgravity environments lack fixed directional orientation, which increases detection difficulty. To address them, we have constructed the first space station astronaut body part detection dataset, AstroBodyParts, which includes 10,048 images and 67,180 annotation boxes, covering fine-grained body part classifications and hierarchical relationship annotations, providing important data support for future research. Additionally, we have proposed a novel baseline method, Ori-YOLO, which is an improvement based on YOLOv5. By introducing orientation-invariant convolution and a spatial dimension auto-alignment module, the model's ability to model rotating targets is enhanced, making it particularly suitable for microgravity environments. Our method effectively solves the complex problems in microgravity and achieves end-to-end astronaut body part detection. Both the codes and dataset are publicly available (https://github.com/saber778899/Ori-YOLO)."

To address this challenge, the IEEE 802.11ax standard introduced the overlapping basic service set packet detection (OBSS PD) based spatial reuse (SR) mechanism to increase simultaneous transmissions in the network. However, the performance gain under OBSS PD is uncertain and depends on the network topology. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that dynamically adjusts the Carrier Sense Threshold (CST) and transmission power (TP) of a node based on interference and contention level to minimize the channel access time. We developed a simulator in Python and evaluated the performance of the proposed algorithm using the average number of transmission opportunities, frame error rate (FER) and channel access time under saturated network conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm provides consistent performance under different network topologies and reduces the average channel access time by 28.1% and 42.1% compared to the conventional CSMA/CA and the OBSS PD mechanism, respectively."

A microstrip line feeding structure is adopted, and a center-symmetric matching stub is introduced on the narrow and long coupling slot to efficiently excite the radiating patch. To achieve a wider bandwidth, a parasitic structure is introduced at the top layer, ultimately realizing an Axial ratio (AR) bandwidth of 15.8% (24.37-28.47 GHz). Compared with the traditional CP ME dipole antenna, the AR bandwidth of this design is wider."

    "abstract": "Sensitivity analysis methods are widely applied in line overload correction, as they can eliminate overloads without solving complex optimization problems. However, whenever an N-1 contingency occurs in a power system, the node-to-branch sensitivity factors change with the altered topology. Thus, how to quickly solve the new node-to-branch sensitivity factors after an N-1 contingency has become a critical challenge. To address the difficulty of calculating these sensitivities, this paper proposes a sensitivity prediction method between lines and generator outputs based on a Broad Learning System (BLS) model, which enables sensitivity prediction under multiple topologies. Simulations on the IEEE 30-bus system demonstrate that this method can accurately calculate sensitivity values; using these sensitivity values to construct a linear correction model can effectively eliminate line overloads."

    "abstract": "The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources, particularly photovoltaic (PV) systems, has accelerated the deployment of DC microgrids (DCMGs) as reliable and efficient energy networks. However, the intermittent nature of renewable generation and the dynamic load variations impose challenges on bus voltage regulation, state-of-charge (SoC) management, and optimal coordination of hybrid energy storage systems (ESS). This paper presents a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-based Energy Management System (EMS) for a 4 bus DCMG comprising PV arrays, batteries, and supercapacitors. The proposed controller dynamically allocates charging and discharging commands among the distributed storage devices to minimize voltage deviation, power mismatch, SoC imbalance, and excessive supercapacitor usage. A detailed simulation study is carried out in MATLAB/Simulink, considering irradiance variations and sudden load changes. Results demonstrate that the PSO-based EMS effectively maintains DC bus voltage stability, ensures real-time power balance, and reduces stress on batteries by optimally utilizing supercapacitors for transient compensation. The proposed method enhances system reliability and extends the lifetime of storage devices, making it a promising solution for next-generation DC microgrids."

A pneumatic bistable origami actuator (PBOA) is introduced based on a hybrid origami structure combining Miura-ori and Waterbomb patterns, which can be applied in diverse robotic applications using 3D-printed quick couplings. We present the design, fabrication, modeling, and experimental validation of the PBOA. Based on the PBOA, a multimodal gripper is proposed that can passively grasp objects in 0.15 seconds and actively lift targets with 41 times self-weight. By fast altering accessories, a locomotion robot is developed with 0.35 body lengths per second. The actuator exhibits significant potential for applications in scenarios that demand high speed, high strength, and multi-functionality."

This study investigates 16-QAM symbol labeling using Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Simulated Annealing (SA), focusing on logical-layer optimization of bit-to-symbol mapping on a fixed constellation, thereby enhancing performance without altering hardware. The optimization objective is to minimize the average Hamming distance (HD) between adjacent symbols to reduce BER in Rayleigh fading channels. Simulation results show that GA achieves an average HD of 1.167, compared to 1.33 for Natural, 1.7 for SA, 2.16 for Random, and 1.00 for Gray mapping achieved. At a BER level of 10-2, Gray reaches this target at approximately 23 dB, GA requires 0.5–1 dB more, SA and Natural require about 2 dB more, and Random is nearly 3 dB worse. These findings confirm that GA and SA provide measurable BER gains over Natural and Random, while closely approaching Gray performance. Overall, this work serves as a proof-of-concept validation of logical-layer mapping optimization as a low-complexity, hardware-compatible enhancement for future 5G/6G systems."

While compliance control strategies mitigate operational risks, two primary challenges emerge: (i) Integration-achieving equilibrium between human teleoperation commands and compliant behaviors; (ii) Passivity-preventing human commands from violating system's passivity. To resolve these challenges, we present a passivityguaranteed teleoperation method incorporating an enhanced compliance model. Integration is managed by the enhanced compliance model employing vector superposition of scaled human commands and interaction force, replacing the conventional force-only compliance model. Passivity is preserved by equipping the enhanced compliance model with an energy tank and designing a dynamic energy regulation strategy: The tank allocates energy to facilitate human command integration while recycling damping energy from the enhanced compliance model for tank replenishment. Experimental validation through boxpushing tasks under both quasi-static and dynamic conditions demonstrates our method's superior position-compliance coordination and disturbance rejection capabilities compared with direct teleoperation approaches."

In this paper, a double trapezoidal network is adopted as the high-frequency response modeling framework for transformer windings, and the Finite Element Method (FEM) is used to achieve high-precision extraction of circuit parameters (resistance R, inductance L, capacitance C). Emphasis is placed on the simulation of Disk Space Variation (DSV) faults and the analysis of FRA characteristics. The research shows that the double trapezoidal network can effectively reproduce the high-frequency distributed parameter effect of windings; the finite element method realizes the cross-scale conversion of “structure-field-electrical” parameters through solving Maxwell’s equations. In DSV faults, capacitance parameters play a dominant role, and the faults mainly affect the middle frequency band of the FRA curve. With the deepening of fault severity, the curve in the frequency band around 100kHz and 300kHz shows a downward-leftward shift trend, while there is no significant regularity in the FRA curve under different short-circuit positions. The results of this paper provide theoretical support and data basis for the FRA diagnosis of DSV faults in transformer windings."

The framework of optimizing a discrete loss (ODIL) transforms the inverse scattering problem into an optimization problem, enabling accurate reconstruction by leveraging the method of moments (MoM) to solve volume integral equations with high precision. Numerical results further validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, demonstrating superior performance compared to the conventional non-iterative back-propagation method."

Social media, such as Twitter, has become the main platform for the public to voice opinions regarding public policies, including the Tabungan Perumahan Rakyat (TAPERA). This study analyzes public sentiment towards TAPERA using the Lexicon-Based method and the Naive Bayes algorithm. The lexicon-based textblob method is used to detect sentiment based on words that appear in the text by calculating sentiment polarity. The research dataset consists of 2559 tweets, which were crawled using tweet-harvest from social media Twitter (X) which is divided into 81 positive data, 2456 neutral data, and 22 negative data, and processed through preprocessing stages, such as: Cleaning, Normalize, Stopwords Removal, Tokenize, Stemming. Meanwhile, the Naive Bayes algorithm is used to classify sentiment data into positive, negative, and neutral categories based on probability. The Naïve Bayes algorithm produces a weighted average of: 96% accuracy, 96% precision, 96% recall, and 96% F1 score."

    "abstract": "Containerisation is a software deployment method that packages all necessary components needed to run an application, such as code, runtime, libraries, and configuration, in a self-contained unit called a container. Containers are lightweight and scalable and enable fast deployment. As a result, containers are commonly employed in microservices architectures. However, microservice architectures add extra layers of complexity to managing resource allocation. Cloud orchestration platforms are abstracted further, which can lead to an over-reliance on monitoring sub-optimal metrics such as CPU utilisation. Identifying and mitigating thread pool starvation in containerised environments is an area of resource allocation and scaling that has been overlooked in the literature. Thread pool starvation occurs when the number of tasks queued in a thread pool’s waiting state exceeds the processing capacity of the pool. If thread pool starvation persists, a cascade event occurs, leading to a chain reaction that results in degraded performance until the system enters a state of unresponsiveness. This work explores the question: Can Thread Pool Starvation Detection Lead to Enhanced Performance and Scalability in Containerised Environmentsƒ and suggests that detecting thread pool starvation early and scaling accordingly can significantly improve system performance and scalability. This work contributes to system architecture design by providing empirical insights into application-level monitoring metrics and pragmatic strategies for identifying and mitigating thread pool starvation."

Indeed, ensuring decentralized economic dispatch through cost-based droop control is common practice; however, it lacks inertial response, leading to significant frequency deviation and a high rate of frequency change during disturbances. This paper introduces an optimal sophisticated control algorithm based on an enhanced dispatchable virtual oscillator control (dVOC) framework for grid-forming (GFM) inverters. The proposed controller supports fully decentralized dispatch under nonlinear cost functions. Moreover, it incorporates negative derivative feedback into the outer loop, introducing an additional degree of freedom to improve overall stability by shifting the most dominant modes deeper into the left-hand side of the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">j</i>ω axis. Hence, with this aim, it acts as an optimal cost-driven dispatch controller during steady-state and transitions to a stabilizing inertia-emulating mode during disturbances, reducing frequency excursions and improving overall system stability. The proposed approach is evaluated through small-signal sensitivity analysis and detailed time-domain simulations, performed using MATLAB/Simulink. Furthermore, the proposed approach is validated experimentally and on a modified IEEE 38-bus system, which represents a scenario with a larger number of GFMs. Consequently, results demonstrate improved frequency regulation, robust performance under non-ideal conditions, and enhanced small-signal stability compared to conventional GFM control methods."

    "abstract": "A low-light colonoscopy video enhancement method is needed as poor illumination in colonoscopy can hinder accurate disease diagnosis and adversely affect surgical procedures. Existing low-light video enhancement methods usually apply a frame-by-frame enhancement strategy without considering the temporal correlation between them, which often causes a flickering problem. In addition, most methods are designed for endoscopic devices with fixed imaging styles and cannot be easily adapted to different devices. In this paper, we propose a Style-Guided Network (SGNet) for unpaired Low-Light Colonoscopy Video Enhancement (LLCVE). Given that collecting content-consistent paired videos is difficult, SGNet adopts a CycleGAN-based framework to convert low-light videos to normal-light videos, in which a Temporal Compensation (TC) module and a Style Guidance (SG) module are proposed to alleviate the flickering problem and achieve flexible style transfer, respectively. The TC module compensates for a low-light frame by learning the correlated feature of its adjacent frames, thereby improving the temporal smoothness of the enhanced video. The SG module encodes the text of the imaging style and adaptively explores its intrinsic relationships with video features to obtain style representations, which are then used to guide the subsequent enhancement process. Extensive experiments on a curated database show that SGNet achieves promising performance on the LLCVE task, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and visual quality."

However, Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) and the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) often fall short for high-frequency, multimodal, AI-driven workloads. We present a practical framework that uses the Data Distribution Service (DDS) as the backbone for scalable, low-latency, and resilient Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) deployments. The design supports dynamic node discovery, automated Quality of Service (QoS) tuning, and containerized rollout across heterogeneous edge devices. It integrates AI-based video and audio analytics to detect critical events in real time, while a brokerless DDS model reduces latency and removes single points of failure. We provide implementation steps and lessons learned from a replicable gateway–sensor architecture. In experiments across four image-delivery scenarios (single- and multi-device), DDS sustained higher throughput and packet rate than MQTT and avoided the 14% packet loss observed for MQTT under multi-device transmission. These results indicate that DDS is an efficient and robust foundation for AI-powered home-care edge networks."

    "abstract": "Short-answer questions are commonly used in educational assessments, as they are often viewed as a more effective way than multiple-choice questions to determine whether students have achieved the intended learning outcomes. However, manually creating appropriate questions targeting different cognitive levels such as those defined by the Bloom’s Taxonomy, and grading text answers from students are not trivial tasks for instructors. Existing work on auto-question generation and scoring in computing education typically targets coding-based questions. However, in software engineering courses, assessments can extend beyond coding to understanding of processes, DevOps methodologies, system design, etc. This work aims to address the dual problem of auto-generating and auto-scoring text based short-answer questions in software engineering courses. We propose an agent-based approach to question generation and scoring, in which each agent performs a distinct task and communicates with each other to complete its tasks. An agent can be realized using a selected large language model (LLM). To this end, we have implemented the proposed approach into a fully functional web app, utilizing OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o models, which was deployed to support instructors and students in our course. We conducted a thorough evaluation of the agent-based approach using several public and private datasets. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach.

    "abstract": "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge. Yet, the performance of RAG pipelines is susceptible to design choices across retrieval, similarity metrics, indexing, and reranking. Despite growing adoption, little systematic work has explored the trade-offs between retrieval quality, semantic accuracy, computational efficiency, and cost in RAG systems. This study addresses this gap by conducting a comprehensive evaluation of RAG configurations across multiple dimensions. We propose a benchmarking framework that systematically varies retrievers (Fusion, HyDe, Hierarchical, SCaNN), indexing methods (HNSW, IVF, Flat), similarity metrics (Cosine, Inner Product, L2), and rerankers (BGE, minilm) over datasets of three scales (small, medium, and large). Performance is assessed through coverage, recall, MRR, and nDCG, while semantic quality is measured using correctness, faithfulness, and relevance. Efficiency is quantified via latency, throughput, and computational cost. Our experiments reveal that HNSW–IP–Fusion–minilm achieves the strongest semantic performance, with Coverage Retrieval of 0.942, Correctness of 0.909, and Faithfulness of 0.970, making it ideal for accuracy-critical tasks. Conversely, IVF–L2–Hierarchical demonstrates the lowest latency (1.736 ns) and cost, making it suitable for real-time deployments. Reranker analysis shows modest but consistent gains for minilm over BGE, while HyDe excels in precision at the expense of efficiency. Notably, no single configuration dominates; optimal designs depend on the application’s needs, whether it is maximizing semantic accuracy, minimizing latency, or striking a balance between the two. By demonstrating concrete trade-offs, this work provides a practical foundation for scaling RAG pipelines across diverse domains, including information retrieval, enterprise search, and knowledge-intensive reasoning."

    "abstract": "Polarimetric phased array radar (PPAR) has the capability to suppress mainlobe and sidelobe interferences by fully utilizing multiple polarization channels. However, adaptive beamforming technique for PPAR, which generates nulls in the space-polarization domain, causes the received signals from multiple polarization channels to be weighted into one. This results in an inherent loss of target polarization, preventing the measurement of target polarization scattering matrix (PSM). In this paper, a robust adaptive beamforming (RAB) approach for PPAR is proposed to estimate the PSM while suppressing the mainlobe and sidelobe interferences. In our solution, dual-beams characterized by a pair of optimal orthogonal polarizations are adaptively formed to reconstruct the polarization channels. Furthermore, multiple uncertainty sets are devised, including a spatial uncertainty set and a pair of polarization-associated uncertainty sets, which respectively improve performance in beam polarization stability and mainlobe interference suppression. This problem is then formulated as a non-convex quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP), which is transformed into a difference of convex (DC) programming problem. Subsequently, it is efficiently solved via a sequential convex programming (SCP) algorithm, incorporating an initial point selection strategy. We further conduct a thorough performance analysis focusing on three critical aspects. As a result, the dual-beams can suppress mainlobe and sidelobe interferences in the space-polarization domain while estimating the target PSM accurately. Simulation results demonstrate the validity of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "Model merging has become a popular approach for combining individual models into a single model that inherits their capabilities and achieves improved performance. However, its success has not yet been transferred to semantic segmentation tasks due to two major challenges: 1) current model merging methods predominantly employ static merging strategies with fixed coefficients, limiting their ability to incorporate task-specific prior knowledge and 2) semantic segmentation faces large distribution shifts across multiple domains, causing negative transfer in the merged model. In this article, we propose an effective model merging approach for semantic segmentation, named M<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>Seg. To dramatically integrate relevant priors based on the input data, we propose a novel SVD-structured MoE module for adaptive merging. To address the severe distribution shifts, we further introduce a test-time dynamic calibration function designed to minimize discrepancies between training and test statistics. Additionally, historical information is leveraged to refine activation statistics during inference. Recognizing that unreliable data can negatively impact update directions, we develop a pixel-efficient entropy minimization mechanism to filter unstable pixels, thus stabilizing the merging process and enhancing segmentation performance. Extensive experiments on both seen and unseen semantic segmentation tasks demonstrate the superior effectiveness and generalization capability of our proposed method.

    "abstract": "Due to transition permanent magnets (PMs) with high tangential magnetization component and located between main PMs, i.e., N and S poles, Halbach machines are featured for self-shielding effect. Consequently, rotor back-iron is not essential. In this paper, Halbach machines with optimal PM widths and optimal magnetization angles for the maximum torque are investigated. It is found that regardless of PM segment number per pole, in optimal air-cored Halbach machines, PM widths are almost equal and magnetization angle shifts between adjacent PMs are almost equal too. Therefore, the equal air-cored machines can be regarded as the optimal machines. In optimal Halbach machines with rotor back-iron, main PM widths are much larger than transition PM widths and magnetization angle shifts between main and transition PMs are lower than corresponding equal magnetization angle shifts. Therefore, the airgap field in optimal iron-cored Halbach machines exhibits a significant 3<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">rd</sup> harmonic field component and higher fundamental airgap field, and consequently the larger torque. Meanwhile, as the PM becomes thicker and the split ratio becomes lower, PM widths and magnetization angle shifts between adjacent PMs in optimal iron-cored machines both change from corresponding unequal values to almost equal. A prototype of optimal air-cored Halbach machine is fabricated and tested to verify the finite element analysis results."

    "abstract": "Belief propagation (BP) combined with ordered statistics decoding (OSD) can achieve near-optimal logical error rates for surface codes. However, OSD requires high-latency and unstable-complexity Gaussian elimination (GE), limiting its practicality. In this paper, we propose BP-LCGCD, a GE-free and high-performance decoder that replaces the GE-based OSD with the GE-free LC-GCD. Moreover, in contrast to the original BP-OSD, which adopts a single fixed normalization factor α, we further propose a list-parameterized variant, BP-LCGCD+ α, which performs multiple BP decodings with different α to generate diverse posterior LLRs. We present complexity analysis, demonstrating that at low physical error rates, the average decoding complexity of the proposed algorithm approaches that of standard BP. Simulation results demonstrate that BP-LCGCD achieves logical error rates close to BP-OSD, while BP-LCGCD+α nearly matches the performance of the BP-OSD. They also show that both proposed decoders significantly outperform standard BP and minimum-weight perfect matching (MWPM) in terms of logical error rate and threshold."

    "abstract": "The weak Pareto boundary (WPB) refers to a boundary in the objective space of a multi-objective optimization problem, characterized by weak Pareto optimality rather than Pareto optimality. The WPB brings severe challenges to multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), as it may mislead the algorithms into finding dominance-resistant solutions (DRSs), i.e., solutions that excel on some objectives but severely underperform on the others, thereby missing Pareto-optimal solutions. Although the severe impact of the WPB on MOEAs has been recognized, a systematic and detailed analysis remains lacking. To fill this gap, this paper studies the attributes of the WPB. In particular, the category of a WPB, as an attribute derived from its weakly Pareto-optimal property, is theoretically analyzed. The analysis reveals that the dominance resistance degrees of DRSs induced by different categories of WPBs exhibit distinct asymptotic growth rates as the DRSs in the objective space approach the WPBs, where a steeper asymptotic growth rate indicates a greater hindrance to MOEAs. Beyond that, experimental studies are conducted on various new test problems to investigate the impact of WPB’s attributes. The experimental results demonstrate consistency with our theoretical findings. Experiments on other attributes show that the performance of an MOEA is highly sensitive to some attributes. Overall, no existing MOEAs can comprehensively address challenges brought by these attributes."

    "abstract": "Rapid advances in engineering and materials science have introduced new possibilities for fabricating passive haptic interfaces such as tactile maps. This study proposes a dual-aspect evaluation methodology-based on user experience and production efficiency-to assess 12 tactile map production techniques, including additive manufacturing methods (e.g., SLA, UV printing), casting (epoxy resin, silicone), CNC milling, and paper-based techniques (e.g., swell-paper, TIGER). The user experience aspect includes spatial localization tasks, semantic differential ratings, and user rankings conducted with 21 people with visual impairments. It captures tactile comfort, symbol legibility, and perceptual clarity during 90-minute sessions using custom-designed pseudomaps. The production efficiency aspect considers cost, complexity, durability (including weather resistance), and versatility in reproducing hybrid - tactile and graphic content. Results showed that paper-based techniques offered high tactile comfort but lower spatial accuracy, legibility, and durability. In contrast, PolyJet and UV printing scored highest overall by balancing perceptual performance and practical production attributes. Several techniques-including UV printing and PolyJet-were evaluated for tactile map production for the first time. Our methodology is modular and adaptable: weights can be adjusted to prioritize specific application needs, such as cost-efficiency or outdoor durability. A case study involving tactile maps of historic gardens demonstrates the framework's utility in real-world use cases. This work contributes to the design and evaluation of passive haptic interfaces by providing a replicable tool for comparing tactile rendering methods across diverse material and perceptual dimensions."

    "abstract": "Siren identification systems are crucial for smart vehicles to early detect emergency situations that demand attention and, often, a response from the driver. The problem of recognizing the sound of a siren within traffic noise has been largely addressed using deep learning, to tackle the strong and unstructured background noise characterizing the urban soundscape. While convolutional neural networks processing spectrogram features are state-of-the-art, their performance is tied to the availability of large and diverse datasets and is hindered by domain-shift. In order to build domain-robust models that do not demand extensive training datasets, that are hardly available in practice, in this work we propose a low-complexity feature extraction method based on frequency tracking. Relying on the harmonic nature of siren signals, we adopt a single-parameter adaptive notch filter to track their periodically evolving fundamental frequency and the ratio between the power of the tracked sinusoid and that of the full input signal. These features are used as input for a small-scale convolutional network, trained entirely on synthetic data. Evaluation results indicate that the proposed system achieves a good generalization to multiple real-world datasets unseen during training, outperforming spectrogram-based state-of-the-art methods when limited data is available while also having a smaller model size."

    "abstract": "Fast Fourier transform (FFT)-accelerated, integral-equation-based electromagnetic simulators have gained significant attention due to their ability to compute parasitics of arbitrarily shaped and large-scale voxelized structures on desktop computers. However, FFT-based solvers have limitations as they require voxels of the same size across all Cartesian dimensions. This is a significant limitation, especially for printed circuit boards (PCB)-like geometries of very thin copper layers and much thicker dielectric layers, which leads to an excessive number of voxels, and consequently, a large number of unknowns. In addition, in PCB-like structures, vias represent small details that require finer meshing resolution for proper discretization. This work aims to overcome these limitations by developing a systematic anisotropic strategy for computing matrix-vector products using the FFT-based approach and automatically replacing vias with equivalent <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R–L</i> lumped elements. Furthermore, a zero-thickness conductor mesh is proposed within the partial element equivalent circuit (PEEC) method framework, which is in turn also suitable for use with other integral-equation-based methods. The accuracy, efficiency, and applicability of the proposed FFT-PEEC solver are demonstrated on three examples."

A finite-time convergent extended state observer is employed to relax the constraints on the variation rate of the water flow velocity, enabling accurate estimation of lumped disturbances. Leveraging this observer, a sliding mode controller is devised to guarantee trajectory tracking for the ROV system.

The fully connected ANN has only one hidden layer and no activate functions and bias, which simplifies the overall processing complexity compared to the normal ANN based FFT. Additional complexity reduction is achieved by dividing the image into sub-blocks. The performance of blur detection is verified, demonstrating the margin of approximate real-valued FFT with reduced computational complexity of up to ∼45% compared to untrimmed ANN, which is promising for deployment in resource-constrained edge devices."

This data is processed using LSTM recurrent neural networks, creating a deep-learning framework for species identification and quantification. The model can forecast the cell population in the blood sample and obtain information on the size and compressibility of individual cells due to the microfluidic nature of the data received by the Raman Spectroscope. Raman spectra allow estimation of the cell size and compressibility, guiding cell separation using acoustophoresis and allowing adjustments of the acoustic wave frequency based on the estimated size and compressibility of the cells. The targeted cells are directed toward a designated collection chamber within the microfluidic system by dynamically adjusting the acoustic wave frequency. Repeated application allows complete separation of the cells and pressure-driven delivery of the targeted cells to their respective collection reservoirs."

Moreover, experimenting the influence directly on real cyberphysical systems such as mobile robots is crucial for deriving realistic insights. In the present paper, a novel framework is introduced to evaluate the impact of systematically varying these factors on the PID auto-tuning processes that utilize Bayesian Optimization and Differential Evolution. Testing was conducted on two distinct PID-controlled robotic platforms, an omnidirectional robot and a differential drive mobile robot, to assess the effects on convergence rate, settling time, rise time, and overshoot percentage. As a result, the experimental outcomes yield evidence on the effects of the systematic variations, thereby providing an empirical basis for future research studies in the field."

By respectively changing the capacitance values of the varactor diodes along two orthogonal polarization directions, the metasurface unit can achieve a phase difference varying between 150° and 198° within the operating frequency band, while maintaining high reflectivity. This structure not only meets the conformal requirements but can also achieve the two digital coding states of 1-bit in programmable metasurfaces."

    "abstract": "Vienna rectifier is a high-performance three-level topology. The operation of the Vienna rectifier has special requirements for current and voltage symbols. When space vector modulation (SVM) is directly applied to the Vienna rectifier, the input current near the current zero crossing will be distorted. By analyzing space vector synthesis, this study identifies the root causes and operating conditions that lead to current zero-crossing distortion, and proposes a modulation method that can minimize current distortion while maintaining unit power factor at the grid side. This paper compares the conventional modulation method of Vienna rectifier, the modulation method of injected common mode voltage and the modulation method of clamp current zero-crossing phase with the modulation method proposed in this paper. And the feasibility and superiority of the modulation method proposed in this paper is verified by simulation and experiment."

Emergency repair costs, as a critical component of total expenditure, present substantial challenges for budget management due to their strong uncertainty, regional volatility, and nonlinear execution characteristics. To enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of special cost control in power grid enterprises, this paper proposes an emergency repair cost control method that integrates fuzzy interval modeling with robust optimization strategies. A dual-channel attention neural network is first constructed to fuse structural and categorical features, enabling a triplet fuzzy interval representation of repair costs. Subsequently, a risk-weighted robust optimization function is designed to generate reasonable cost ranges under varying tolerance coefficients, thereby improving decision-making flexibility and disturbance resistance. Empirical analysis based on real-world emergency repair cases demonstrates that the proposed approach has strong applicability and practical implementation value."

However, PV power stations are prone to failures such as hotspots, short circuits, and aging due to harsh operating environments, which threaten their safe and stable operation. Existing fault diagnosis methods face challenges such as class imbalance, poor model generalization, and underutilization of multi-source data. To address these issues, this paper proposes a fault diagnosis method for PV power stations based on multimodal data and a hybrid sampling deep ensemble learning algorithm. The method integrates operational data and infrared images to construct a multimodal dataset, adopts a SMOTE-RUS hybrid sampling strategy to alleviate class imbalance, and designs a heterogeneous deep ensemble model combining CNN, LSTM, and BP networks with an attention mechanism for feature fusion. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that the proposed method achieves an accuracy of $99.82 \\%$ and an F1-Score of $99.42 \\%$, significantly outperforming traditional single models and other ensemble methods, demonstrating strong robustness and generalization ability."

Pattern recognition (PR) methods have demonstrated promising results in laboratory settings. However, maintaining accurate and robust classification performance in practical applications poses significant challenges, particularly due to the “limb position effect”. This effect leads to decreased classification performance when testing positions differ from those used during training. Existing approaches necessitate time-consuming and cumbersome data collection that captures the variations across limb positions. This paper presents a data augmentation method based on diffusion models to synthesize EMG data that mimics the variability found in real EMG recordings across limb positions. By leveraging single trial under various limb positions, the proposed method can generate sufficient training samples to achieve accurate classification performance while minimizing data collection requirements. Experimental results show that the proposed method enhances the classification accuracy and reduces the intra-class variability, offering a potential solution to address the “limb position effect”."

A combined IC and monopulse angle estimation model is used to characterize post-cancellation residual angular error. Simulation results show a clear dependence on interferer bearing: Residual angular error decreases as the interferer’s azimuth moves away from the beam axis, reaching a local minimum at approximately −1.2° and exhibiting an error profile approximately symmetric about 0°. Cancellation becomes ineffective when the interferer lies on the beam axis (0°). These findings provide practical guidance for performance assessment and for designing countermeasures to defend against mainlobe-suppression jamming."

    "abstract": "Protection systems are indispensable components of power systems and critical infrastructure, responsible for detecting and isolating faults to ensure reliability and stability. Following fault detection, these systems issue commands to circuit breakers to initiate fault isolation. The faulty subsystem must be isolated from the power system before reaching a critical clearing time, beyond which system instability may occur. Thus, to safeguard the power system, protection systems must act before this critical clearing time. A larger time interval between the execution of protection systems and the critical clearing time increases the stability margin of the system. To accurately identify the total response time of protection system execution, this article presents a novel approach leveraging transient kinetic energy wave analysis coupled with online monitoring of circuit breaker performance. Initially, the healthy condition of circuit breakers is evaluated through the proposed probability distribution curves of the timing feature of the circuit breaker coil current and contact travel. Subsequently, the total response time of on-grid protection systems is calculated via transient energy waveform analysis. The results obtained from various simulation scenarios, along with experimental tests, validate the accurate performance of the proposed method."

For systems that allow SAE Level 3 or higher driving automation [1] there is a (partial) absence of human oversight. This requires developers to shift from ensuring controllability by the driver to ensuring that the Automated Driving System exhibits safe behavior in its environment. In the automotive functional safety domain, functional and technical safety concepts are established for the specification of safety measures to mitigate the malfunctioning behavior of E/E systems. However, ISO 21448 does not describe how a comparable safety concept regarding SOTIF can be generated that specifies safety measures for behavior at the vehicle level. Based on the terminology and objectives that <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">are</i> specified in ISO 21448, we elicit requirements for the specification (safe) behavior.

We follow a model-based approach to specify target behavior and document the conducted safety analyses. The semi-formal models provide traceability between functional insufficiencies in the target behavior and the according safety measures. To show the applicability of the proposed meta-model, we create an example model instance of a behavioral safety concept. The example model is based on a domain-specific SysML profile in a selected scenario. Finally, we verify the presented approach against ISO 21448 objectives."

    "abstract": "High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) plays a critical role in diagnosing lung diseases by providing detailed visualization of infections, inflammation, fibrosis and tumors. Recent advances in deep learning have enabled automated detection and segmentation of infected regions, with attention mechanisms further enhancing feature discrimination. This study proposes a multi-task attention-driven SegNet model for automated analysis of HRCT Scans. The model integrates attention layers to emphasize key pathological regions, including consolidation and ground-glass opacities, and supports both binary and multi-class segmentation/classification tasks. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed model achieves 91.4% accuracy in binary and 84.5% accuracy in multi-class lung infection segmentation and classification, outperforming the attention-driven U-Net baseline. By providing improved precision and efficiency, the attention-driven SegNet model can accelerate computer-aided diagnosis (CAD), support clinical decision-making, and promote standardized approaches for managing lung infections in healthcare settings."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a design methodology for broadband and compact millimeter-wave (mm-wave) single-pole double-throw (SPDT) switches targeting the Ku–Ka band. Conventional SPDT switches based on quarter-wavelength transmission lines typically occupy significant chip area, while alternative designs utilizing standard π-type equivalent circuits often suffer from bandwidth degradation due to the parasitic inductance at the isolation path. To overcome these limitations, a novel SPDT architecture based on modified π-networks is proposed. This approach incorporates the parasitic inductance of the isolation path into the π-network design, effectively enhancing the bandwidth performance without increasing circuit complexity. For validation, an SPDT switch was implemented using a 0.15-μm GaN MMIC process, covering the 10–28 GHz band. Measurement results confirm that the switch achieves an insertion loss below 2.1 dB, return loss better than 12 dB and isolation greater than 42 dB, with a compact core chip area of only 0.62 mm"

    "abstract": "In a companion paper the authors have shown that the problem of phase synthesis of apertures with assigned amplitude can be asymptotically reconducted to a Monge–Ampère partial differential equation (PDE) which can be solved identifying an irrotational transport map from the source aperture to the target beam. In this contribution we address the general problem of synthesizing beams with shapes that cannot be obtained as a linear transformation of the aperture. According to a fundamental result of Brenier, the irrotational transport map satisfying the Monge–Ampère PDE can be obtained as a solution of Monge’s Optimal Transport Problem (OTP) with quadratic cost. The phase profile can then be obtained by direct integration. A numerical method based on Von Neumann’s alternating projections is adopted with an original discretization of the involved differential equations and boundary conditions. The numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach."

    "abstract": "Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) are the standard of care for gastric acid disorders but carry significant risks when administered chronically at high doses. Precise long-term control of gastric acidity is challenged by the impracticality of invasive gastric acid monitoring beyond 72 hours and wide inter-patient variability. We propose a noninvasive, symptom-based framework that tailors PPI dosing solely on patient-reported reflux and digestive symptom patterns. A Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) prediction model learns to predict patient symptoms and quantifies its uncertainty from historical symptom scores, meal, and PPIs intake data. These probabilistic forecasts feed a chance-constrained Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm that dynamically computes future PPI doses to minimize drug usage while enforcing acid suppression with high confidence—without any direct acid measurement. In silico studies over diverse dietary schedules and virtual patient profiles demonstrate that our learning-augmented MPC reduces total PPI consumption by 65% compared to standard fixed regimens, while maintaining acid suppression with at least 95% probability. The proposed approach offers a practical path to personalized PPI therapy, minimizing treatment burden and overdose risk without invasive sensors."

The materials evaluated include SBR, NR, SIR, EPDM, CR, and NBR/SBR blends. Electrical parameters such as capacitance, loss factor, and dielectric constant were measured under various high-voltage conditions according to IEC 60625 standards. COMSOL Multiphysics was employed to simulate electric field distribution in three-dimensional joint geometries to validate experimental findings. Results showed that EPDM and SBR provided the most stable dielectric behavior, maintaining low loss factors and electric field strengths within acceptable limits. In contrast, SIR and NBR/SBR exhibited excessive electric field intensities, rendering them unsuitable for high-voltage applications. The simulations confirmed that field stress concentrates near dielectric discontinuities and geometrical transitions, especially in the absence of stress cones. The integrated approach used in this study highlights the importance of material selection and structural optimization in enhancing the electrical reliability of EHV cable joints. These findings offer valuable insights for future design strategies and the development of advanced insulating systems."

    "abstract": "Quantum computing is rapidly emerging as a promising technology for solving complex optimization problems that arise in various engineering fields. Therefore, it holds significant promise to transform the computational foundations of power electronics. Motivated by this potential, this paper adopts a visionary perspective to examine how quantum computing could influence the evolution of power electronics in areas such as converter design, control, modulation, simulation workflows, and beyond. Within this framework, the current status, limitations, and anticipated progress of quantum algorithms and hardware are discussed, together with their potential to enable efficient solutions to large-scale, multiobjective, mixed-integer optimization problems. To place these developments in context, the paper begins with a concise tutorial on fundamental concepts in quantum computing, serving as both an introduction to the field and a bridge to its potential applications in power electronics. As a first step in this direction, the use of quantum computing for solving offline mixed-integer optimization problems commonly encountered in power electronics is examined. To this end, a simplified power electronics design problem is reformulated as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem and executed on quantum hardware, despite current limitations such as low qubit counts and hardware noise. This demonstration marks a pioneering step towards leveraging quantum computing in power electronics and motivates the value of early adoption and exploration. Building on these insights, the paper outlines a forward-looking vision in which quantum computing becomes an integral part of the computational landscape of power electronics, guiding its transition from classical to quantum-enabled design and operation."

    "abstract": "Previous work suggests that people with mobility impairments move differently in the traditional gait laboratory than in natural environments, but the extent to which this possible divergence may have limited understanding of gait following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) remains unknown. We hypothesized that (1) patients following ACLR walk more asymmetrically in daily life than in the laboratory and (2) differences between patients following ACLR and individuals with no gait pathologies would be more pronounced in daily life than in the laboratory. Twelve participants (six post-ACLR, six healthy) completed gait assessments in the laboratory with optical motion capture and inertial measurement units (IMU) and in daily life with IMUs. Patients walked similarly to healthy participants in the laboratory, but in daily life, they walked with a higher gait-cycle time (1.22 ± 0.03 s vs. 1.08 ± 0.06 s), double-support (21.8 ± 1.3 % vs. 17.9 ± 2.7 % Gait Cycle Time), and single-support asymmetry (8.4 ± 0.9 % vs 4.1 ± 0.7 %). While the reasons behind the observed differences were not studied, these results suggest that gaitanalysis studies to date may have not realistically captured natural-environment behavior. Wearable sensors now offer a path toward deeper understanding of post-surgical gait and the specific patterns that may place certain patients at risk for post-traumatic osteoarthritis."

    "abstract": "Measuring and recognizing single cells are fundamental challenges in biology. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a non-destructive and label-free visualization monitoring technique, but its application in single-cell monitoring is limited by high contact resistance at the microscale and complex fabrication challenges. In this work, an easily fabricable EIT sensor at microscale is proposed, in which the liquid-electrode design enables a sufficiently large contact area between metal lead and liquid and thus significantly decreases the contact impedance, allowing the imaging of the shape, position and size of a single cell or multiple cells. The genetic algorithm is employed to optimize the sensor structure, resulting in a sensitive and concentrated sensing region at the center of the sensor to eliminate interferences from the outside surroundings. To better image cells, an adaptive block sparse Bayesian learning algorithm for small targets reconstruction is adopted and proven effective in removing artifacts near cells and at the edges of the sensitive region. Finally, experiments to image PS microspheres and yeast cells at microscale were conducted as a proof of concept. The result shows that the proposed sensor with liquid electrodes can effectively reconstruct the shapes, positions, and sizes of microspheres and cells, where the estimation errors of the microsphere size are less than 5%. The proposed liquid-electrodes EIT sensor provides a low-cost promising alternative to image single cell at microscale, which can enable the morphological characterization of single cell."

This work addresses this limitation by presenting a low-cost, low-power readout circuit for biasing and measuring the drain current of OECTs, specifically targeting portable and wearable applications for point-of-care testing (POCT). The proposed system utilizes a modified microcontroller-based potentiostat that is compatible with single positive voltage sources. It also includes Near Field Communication (NFC), which allows data to be retrieved wirelessly using a smartphone. A proof-of-concept lactate sensor is presented, designed for measuring lactate concentration in sweat and saliva. The sensor is based on an OECT with a platinum-coated gate and a Nafion membrane that immobilizes the lactose oxidase enzyme, significantly improving the selectivity of the substance to be measured. Low detection limits of 0.35 mM and 0.0485 mM have been achieved in sweat and saliva, respectively. This research provides a complete, low-cost, and non-invasive solution for OECT-based biosensors."

    "abstract": "With the advancement of autonomous driving technologies, passengers increasingly engage in non-driving activities. However, these activities are often limited by motion sickness (MS), which worsens with vehicle vibration characterized by longer exposure duration and greater magnitude. Although recent studies have detected MS using EEG-based artificial intelligence models, they have often overlooked the characteristics of MS in vehicles. In this study, we propose a method to enhance the performance of EEG-based convolutional neural network (CNN) models by incorporating the motion sickness dose value (MSDV) defined in ISO 2631-1, which considers both exposure duration and vibration magnitude. For the CNN models, we selected ShallowConvNet, EEGNet, TSception, and EEG-Conformer, which are widely used in brain-computer interface and emotion recognition. The proposed method assigns MSDV-based weighting factors to EEG segments, with MSDV computed from triaxial head acceleration. To validate the effectiveness of the approach, EEG signals were recorded from 42 participants who were exposed to various simulated road conditions with a motion simulator. Results demonstrated that the MSDV weighted models exhibited statistically significant improvements in classification performance compared to the models without MSDV. Furthermore, classification accuracy was enhanced by applying a cascade adaptive filter to eliminate movement artifacts induced by whole-body vibration. The proposed method achieved within-subject classification accuracies of 94.55–95.54% and cross-subject accuracies of 67.92–74.77%, outperforming existing MS detection models. These findings suggest that integrating EEG signals with MSDV weighting provides a promising pathway for accurate real-world motion sickness detection."

With containerized QPU nodes and GPU-accelerated backends, QTest supports circuit execution across heterogeneous and geographically distributed environments. By enabling task partitioning, inter-node entanglement distribution, fidelity-aware routing, and latency-throughput evaluation, QTest provides a reproducible and extensible environment for protocol development and validation. Experimental results show that QTest achieves efficient runtime scalability under ideal conditions.

    "abstract": "Conventional endoscopic systems provide two-dimensional images of three-dimensional structures. Real depth information is lost in these systems. Therefore, depth perception relies uniquely on monocular cues, such as occlusions, shadows or motion parallax. Three-dimensional endoscopy has been proposed to mitigate these adverse effects. Nevertheless, as it is usually based on aperture sub-sampling, the provided images suffer from a strong reduction in resolution, vulnerability to off-axis aberrations, and very low light efficiency. To face the challenge, we report here a 3D-imaging endoscopy system based on the implementation of an optical add-on that incorporates an electrically tunable lens. We demonstrate that, when attached to a standard commercial endoscope, the proposed system allows the capture of stacks of 2D images focused at different depths, with the same resolution as that provided by the endoscope alone. To demonstrate that the system is capable of capturing stacks of images with distinguishable depths, we calculated the depth map of a 3D simulated biological scenario with a standard free image-processing software. All these capabilities can be of great utility in surgery practice that require the 3D reconstruction of the surgical field."

    "abstract": "Achieving reliable initial alignment of liquid crystal (LC) molecules on copper surface of microwave materials remains a key challenge, primarily due to a more significant surface roughness of radio frequency (RF) materials compared to smoother substrates traditionally used in optical devices, where LCs were initially tailored for. To address this problem, we studied two principle LC alignment strategies: (i) direct alignment of the LC layer on microwave device substrates via a polyimide (PI) coating, and (ii) integration of a conventional LC cell incorporating two glass substrates to provide well controlled surface anchoring. Both approaches are implemented in two distinct phase shifter designs and evaluated through full wave simulations and experimental measurements at the X- and Ku-bands respectively. The results demonstrated that the LC cell with glass substrates supports thinner LC layer, which is pivotal for obtaining a more rapid response. Devices based on the LC cell configuration exhibit a 35<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\%$</tex-math></inline-formula> improvement in response time, attributed to enhanced molecular orientation and reduced fringing field effects.

A key limitation of prior work is the inability to handle the simultaneous presence of input and state delays under stochastic disturbances. Our unified control framework effectively addresses this challenge. Employing the idea of feedback domination, we develop a memoryless (or delay-independent) output feedback control law. Under constrained input delay (with arbitrary state delays), we demonstrate the stability of the closed-loop system using the Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional method. The feedback control strategy is delay-independent, which simplifies its implementation in practical applications. To show the efficacy of the proposed control scheme, we present an electromechanical system as an example."

Enterprise architecture, as a key framework for integrating strategies, processes, and technologies, offers a vital opportunity to redesign the security unit within its business layer. This redesign enhances system reliability, regulatory compliance, risk management, and business continuity. This article analyzes security capabilities and their related processes to propose a restructured security unit in the enterprise architecture’s business layer. By embedding security as a core element of business strategy, it ensures alignment with organizational goals. The redesign serves as both an operational necessity and a strategic imperative, boosting resilience, cost efficiency, and inter-unit coordination. We introduce a systematic method grounded in six key security capabilities: security strategy, security management, external compliance, risk management, internal control and audit, and response and recovery. Through an analysis of inter-capability relationships, we identify how capabilities are mapped to the sections of the security unit. Furthermore, a multi-modal operating model is proposed to balance centralization and decentralization between headquarters and subsidiaries. This model centralizes governance capabilities for unified oversight while decentralizing operational ones for local agility, achieving a dynamic equilibrium between control and flexibility. Implementing this approach not only elevates organizational security effectiveness but also fosters deeper adherence to enterprise architecture principles, promoting long-term sustainability in cybersecurity."

    "abstract": "In this paper, a metasurface operating in the 28 GHz frequency band is proposed, designed, and numerically analyzed. Adopting a classic square patch unit structure, this metasurface aims to achieve a highly robust response to the polarization state and incident angle of electromagnetic waves. Full-wave electromagnetic simulation results demonstrate that the design achieves a return loss (S11) of less than -10 dB at its central resonant frequency of 28 GHz. For incident waves with different polarizations (TE and TM), the structure exhibits nearly consistent performance. Additionally, under oblique incidence conditions with an incident angle of up to 30°, the performance degradation is negligible, demonstrating excellent angular stability. Such performance renders the proposed metasurface an ideal candidate for applications including polarizers, frequency-selective surfaces (FSS), and energy absorption in future 5G and Beyond-5G communication systems."

    "abstract": "Mobile payment (M-payment) information systems have evolved rapidly, driven by the proliferation of mobile internet and widespread smartphone usage. In Malaysia, the adoption of M-payment continues to grow; however, usability challenges remain a significant barrier. This research aims to explore how system quality, information quality, and service quality affect mobile usability and perceived benefits within m-payment systems. Specifically, it examines the complex relationships among these quality factors and their effect on user experience. Data were collected with a structured questionnaire used with 280 adult participants in Kuala Lumpur and Selangor. This research used the PLS-SEM method and functions to examine the evaluation and structural models. The research found that system quality, service quality, information quality, and service quality all convey positive support to mobile payment usability. Moreover, perceived benefits are found to fully concentrate these relationships, highlighting the pivotal role of user-perceived value in improving mobile adoption. The findings demonstrate that high-quality m-payment systems promote more user satisfaction, trust, engagement, and longterm loyalty. From a practical position, developers and service providers should concentrate on developing user-centric platforms identified by simple interfaces, trustworthy information, and responsive <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$m$</tex>-services. In conclusion, improving the three factors of quality while enhancing perceived benefits is crucial for developing a more effective, participating, and sustainable m-payment ecosystem. The contribution of the study is to the expanding body of knowledge in information systems and provides strategic insights for improving mobile financial technologies in emerging markets."

Therefore, this paper proposes an adaptive sliding mode control method with finite time convergence to alleviate influence of uncertainties, especially dynamic disturbances caused by the ground motion of the conveyor. Unlike traditional methods, the proposed method combines a non-singular fast terminal sliding mode function to enhance convergence speed. An adaptive control gain of chattering free is designed. The proposed method ensures that the tracking error converges to a region within the finite time. The adaptive law of leakage compensation improves the system's robustness under disturbances. In addition, this paper also designs a new desired speed function to maintain smooth acceleration throughout the entire process, thereby enhancing the stability of material transportation. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified under uncertainties and disturbances."

The threephase coaxial structure is a type of HTS cable design suitable for 10 kV urban power grids. However, due to its relatively poor short-circuit resistance, it is essential to study its transient behavior under fault conditions. This paper establishes an equivalent circuit model for a three-phase coaxial HTS cable and uses the model to analyze changes in temperature and mechanical stress under various fault scenarios. The results show that during a three-phase short-circuit fault, the cable experiences the highest temperature rise within a certain period, and the superconducting tapes are subjected to relatively large electromagnetic forces. When the fault resistance is close to 0, in both two-phase and threephase short-circuit faults, the magnetic forces acting on the cable are significantly greater than the electric forces. However, as the fault resistance increases, the proportion of the electric force will increase, and it is necessary to consider the influence of both the electric force and the magnetic force. These findings provide valuable reference data for the parameter design of HTS cables."

However, measurement discrepancies still persist, especially when detecting non-stationary or intermittent emissions. This paper analyzes the underlying causes of such inconsistencies by comparing the architectural and signal processing differences between receiver types. A detailed study of window functions, detector types, and timing parameters is presented to evaluate their influence on amplitude accuracy and scan reliability. Theoretical models and time-frequency domain analyses are used to derive practical guidelines for improving measurement consistency, especially in the context of short-duration transient signals."

    "abstract": "As newer cars keep developing with more connectivity and electronic control, their cybersecurity has become an essential challenge. The Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol, which is the foundation for vehicle communication, was initially developed without necessary security elements like authentication, encryption, or intrusion prevention. This intrinsic weakness leaves vehicles open to a large variety of cyberattacks, such as message spoofing, Denial-of-Service (DoS), and fuzzing, which can make both passenger safety and system reliability brittle. Conventional rule-based or signature-based intrusion detection techniques prove ineffective against contemporary threats that are constantly changing. Hence, it is necessary to have sophisticated, data-driven solutions that can detect intrusions and anomalies efficiently in real time. Creating smart Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) using machine learning or deep learning presents a promising avenue. Closing this security gap is paramount to advancing intelligent transportation systems as well as to establishing trust in autonomous and connected vehicle technologies."

Among mobile robots, quadruped robots have gained significant attention in mobile ground robots due to their excellent motion capabilities. However, existing quadruped robot following systems still face problems such as decreased tracking robustness under occlusion and nonlinear motion modes, decoupling perception and control, and limited motion adaptability in dynamic environments. To solve these challenges, this paper proposes a target recognition, tracking, and motion control collaborative framework for dynamic scenes of quadruped robots, dubbed Q-Tracking. At a perception level, a YOLO-Tracking-ReID threelevel architecture enhances occlusion and nonlinear motion robustness. Key innovations include spatiotemporal-synchronized RGB-D preprocessing, an observation-centered improved SORT algorithm (inverse Kalman filter + motion-appearance bimodal association), and a residual feature aggregation network with dynamic matching. At the control level, a model predictive control (MPC)-whole-body impulse control(WBIC) hierarchical architecture is constructed using the mini-cheetah solution, and the motion stability is achieved by combining model predictive control (periodic gait optimization) and whole-body impedance control (dynamic relaxation variable adjustment). Experiments show 85% real-world tracking success, enabling reliable human-robot collaboration in complex environments."

Accordingly, this work outlines and exemplifies some common types of errors and redundant data format issues.

The investigation centers on scenarios with nonlinear system behaviors and non-Gaussian noise, features that are frequently encountered in practical tracking applications. Simulations carried out using MATLAB provide the foundation for assessing each method based on tracking precision, processing demands, and resilience to fluctuating noise levels. The test framework incorporates a range of target movements and varying types of measurement and process disturbances to reflect real-world challenges. Results highlight the distinct compromises associated with each technique: while UKF and other more sophisticated filters enhance accuracy in nonlinear cases, they typically require greater computational resources; the EKF is less demanding computationally but does not perform as well under complex system dynamics; and the AKF adapts effectively to changing noise but may show variable consistency. The findings underline the need to match filter selection with the specific requirements and limitations of the intended application, providing valuable guidance for engineers and researchers engaged in the field of radar-based tracking."

Overflowing waste can create unsanitary conditions and public discomfort. To address this issue, the authors developed an IoT-based Smart Waste System that uses the Blynk app for real-time monitoring and alerts, along with a Real-Time Clock (RTC) module to record events. The system tracks the bin’s fill level using an ultrasonic sensor and records the times when the bin becomes full or is emptied. It also includes a basic prediction feature to estimate when the bin will likely fill up again. Based on the results of research that has been carried out, there are sensors with good accuracy, such as ultrasonic sensors with an RMSE value of approximately 0.062 cm, and RTC modules with an RMSE value of approximately 75 seconds. However, the prediction system, although functional, has an RMSE value of around 7.7 hours, which shows that further improvement is needed. Overall, the system performed well under expected conditions and offers a more efficient alternative to traditional waste collection methods that rely on manual inspections."

Conventional spectrograms, while effective for visualizing frequency content and its temporal evolution, suffer from some problems: they are susceptible to noise and can become visually cluttered, potentially obscuring relations between signal components. The reassigned spectrogram method transforms standard mesh-based spectrograms into discrete points within a continuous three-dimensional space of time, frequency and magnitude. This point cloud representation enables clustering techniques to be deployed that are atypical for audio data. The resulting point clusters can then be associated together for detecting harmonic relationships. Tests on both musical recordings and speech signals demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique for isolating and visualizing harmonic structures in audio data. Particularly strong performance is demonstrated in separating overlapping harmonic components. The presented processing pipeline successfully identifies harmonic relationships within complex signals and presents these aspects visually in a more interpretable format than conventional spectrograms, offering new possibilities for audio signal analysis, interpretation and depiction."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a robust hybrid artificial intelligence (AI) framework designed to improve diagnostic accuracy in medical imaging tests such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and positron emission tomography (PET) scans. The enhancement is achieved by combining deep learning methods with rule-based reasoning and model-agnostic explainability techniques. The proposed hybrid architecture integrates convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer models for feature extraction, while incorporating expert-defined rule-based logic to strengthen interpretability and ensure consistency in decision-making. To improve transparency, model-agnostic explainability approaches such as SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) are applied, offering deeper insights into AI-driven diagnoses. This integration addresses critical clinical concerns related to trust, traceability, and adoption of AI systems. Experimental evaluations conducted on benchmark medical imaging datasets achieved an accuracy of 94.2%, which is 3.8% higher than conventional deep learning approaches, demonstrating improved robustness. Additionally, the proposed system enhances clinical interpretability, with a 21% increase in explainability ratings provided by healthcare professionals. These findings highlight the novelty and clinical relevance of hybrid AI models by combining automation with decision support, thereby promoting greater trust and adoption of AI in diagnostic workflows across healthcare facilities."

    "abstract": "Hydrogen infrastructure is typically equipped with pressure relief devices (PRD) to protect systems from uncontrolled pressure increases. Without PRDs, significant pressure increases have the potential to rupture the equipment, resulting in a hydrogen leak, which could lead to fires, explosions, and nearby damage. However, recent incidents have shown that these PRDs can also be the root cause of leaks and releases, leading to fires and explosions, which potentially impact public and employee welfare and cause organizational losses. Organizations need to understand this risk to manage it effectively. However, a consistent and standardized failure vocabulary and terminology must be established to assess the risk and accomplish asset integrity objectives properly. This terminology would allow us to align the risk assessment needs with the data collection and asset integrity efforts, ensuring an improvement of the risk characterization. In that sense, this work focuses on establishing a common vocabulary, terminology, and failure causation for PRDs installed on hydrogen systems. This standardization is performed by evaluating PRD technology through a component failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) to identify failure pathways of PRDs installed in hydrogen systems. The FMEA result defines standard causes, failure mechanisms, failure modes, and consequences associated with PRDs installed on hydrogen systems. These failure elements are interconnected to show the failure causal chain. This chain between the failure elements is then used to define the controls needed to prevent these failures"

The algorithms used for sentiment classification testing are Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes and Logistic Regression. The test results using the three models on 1000 datasets with a comparison of 10% test data and 90% training data, produced the highest accuracy of 97% for SVM and Logistic Regression, and 96% for Naïve Bayes. To optimize the validity of the results, the Stratified K-Fold Cross Validation technique was used to evaluate the test results. As a result, the Logistic Regression model produced the highest average accuracy of 94.80%, Naïve Bayes 94.70% and SVM 94.50, with standard deviations of 1.52%, 2.14% and 2.38% respectively. Overall, the three models are very effective in classifying the distribution of user sentiment, most of which give positive reviews to the JKN Mobile application."

Using conditional distribution theory, we derive an optimal parameterization of the prediction policy as a linear function of future inputs, past inputs, and past outputs. Based on this characterization, we propose an online least-squares algorithm to learn the policy and analyze its regret relative to the optimal model-based predictor. We show that the online algorithm achieves logarithmic regret with respect to the optimal Kalman filter in the multi-step setting. Furthermore, with new proof techniques, we establish an almost-sure regret bound that does not rely on fixed failure probabilities for sufficiently large horizons N. Finally, our analysis also reveals that, while the regret remains logarithmic in N, its constant factor grows polynomially with the prediction horizon H, with the polynomial order set by the largest Jordan block of eigenvalue 1 in the system matrix."

To improve signal quality and connectivity, this work integrates cooperative communication and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) into content-centric F-RANs with unreliable backhauls. Specifically, a NOMA-enabled joint transmission scheme is considered, where cache-enabled FAPs are coordinated into clusters to perform non-coherent joint transmission and NOMA, enabling multiplexing signals for multiple users. Under a hybrid caching policy and non-uniform Nakagami-<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</i> fading channels, the system performance is analyzed in terms of the successful content delivery probability and outage achievable rate. To optimize FAP coordination, the clustering problem is formulated as a coalitional game, and a low-complexity transfer-based clustering algorithm is designed. Furthermore, a hierarchical hybrid NOMA-based algorithm is developed to enhance multi-user access efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that: 1) The NOMA-enabled joint transmission scheme allows the FAPs efficiently leverage the cached content to mitigate backhaul unreliability; 2) The NOMA-based design outperforms the orthogonal multiple access-based design by guaranteeing improved signal quality while maintaining the efficiency of multi-user access; 3) The coalitional game-based clustering algorithm effectively manages co-channel interference and improves spectrum utilization."

In the force control outer loop, an extended state observer (ESO) is constructed to compensate for disturbances arising from uncertain human intentions and unstructured environmental geometry, while a PID-based admittance enhancement scheme is introduced to improve dynamic responsiveness. In the position control inner loop, a novel barrier function is embedded into the backstepping framework to systematically regulate the convergence rate, transient overshoot, steady-state accuracy, and global performance of the trajectory tracking error. Moreover, a fuzzy logic system (FLS) is employed to approximate the lumped model uncertainty, which in turn strengthens the robustness of the control algorithm. The asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is rigorously established via the Lyapunov analysis criterion. Experiments involving trajectory tracking, planar cutting, and curved-surface carving conducted on an actual robotic platform demonstrate that the proposed method not only realizes superior force-position coordinated control, but also accommodates flexibility in physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) and smoothness in physical robot-environment interaction (pREI)."

This study presents a comprehensive trajectory planning and real-time correction framework for transnasal surgical robots, integrating Remote Center of Motion (RCM) constraints and real-time fiber optic sensing feedback. A personalized 3D point cloud and grid map of the nasal cavity are constructed based on computed tomography (CT) imaging. The improved RRT* algorithm is used to generate collision-free paths that adhere to RCM constraints. To address sensor measurement errors, an Adaptive Unscented Kalman Filter (AUKF) is employed to accurately estimate the end-effectors position and correct minor deviations in real-time through position control. When significant trajectory deviation or contact with nasal tissue is detected, a local trajectory replanning strategy with multiple constraints is introduced, dynamically adjusting the path based on sensor feedback. Experimental results show that the proposed framework effectively generates anatomically compatible motion paths and provides real-time trajectory error correction in complex nasal environments, offering a reliable and precise solution for robot-assisted transnasal surgery."

    "abstract": "From mass media theory, the message flow and the opinion evolution in real social networks adhere to a two-step communication process: opinion leaders first receive the messages from the message sources, and then convey their opinions to the normal agents. During this process, opinion leaders often exhibit confirmation bias by updating their opinions based on messages close to their opinions, reflecting their limited willingness to accept dissonant messages. However, few prior works jointly consider the two-step communication process involving message sources, opinion leaders, and normal agents, as well as the confirmation bias of opinion leaders. In this paper, we propose a unified framework called MOLENA to analyze how messages f low and opinions evolve in the two-step communication process. In the MOLENA framework, we introduce a mathematically tractable message preference model to quantitatively describe the confirmation bias. We obtain the approximate analytical solution of the opinion leaders' and normal agents' steady-state opinions, and theoretically analyze the influence of system parameters on their steady-state opinions. Furthermore, we examine the influence of messages on opinion leaders' steady-state opinions and study how opinion leaders influence normal agents' steady state opinions in the two-step communication process. Finally, we validate our theoretical analysis through numerical experiments and verify the correctness of the MOLENA framework via social experiments. This study is critical to understanding how messages f low and opinions evolve in real social networks and to designing effective mechanisms to guide agents' opinions."

    "abstract": "With the continuous development of fields such as national defense and military applications, the importance of infrared small target detection (IRSTD) technology based on thermal imaging has become increasingly prominent. However, in practical application scenarios, it remains difficult to effectively extract the features of weak and small targets under low signal-to-noise ratio conditions, while simultaneously suppressing background clutter, preserving target details, and balancing detection accuracy and speed. To address the issues mentioned above, this work proposes a real-time IRSTD network (ECMSFNet) based on efficient convolution and attention-guided multi-scale feature weighting and fusion. During the feature extraction stage, a dual-branch hybrid convolution module (DBHConv) is designed to extract infrared small target features more efficiently. In the feature fusion stage, a three-branch attention-guided module (TBAG) is designed to enhance the input features from both spatial and channel dimensions. By using a three-branch parallel structure to process input features in a differentiated manner, noise is effectively filtered while target detail information is preserved. In addition, to further address the issue of missed detections, a multi-scale feature weighting and fusion module (MSFWF) is designed at the added detection head to adaptively weight the features and optimize the feature propagation path, thereby improving the model’s detection accuracy. Extensive experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate that the method proposed in this paper outperforms other advanced approaches and achieves a real-time detection speed of 74.63 frames per second. https://github.com/liubiaohua/ECMSFNet."

    "abstract": "The rapid adoption of QUIC as a transport protocol has transformed content delivery by reducing latency, enhancing congestion control (CC), and enabling more efficient multiplexing. With the advent of 5G networks, which support ultra-low latency and high bandwidth, streaming high-resolution video at 4K and beyond has become increasingly viable. However, optimizing Quality of Experience (QoE) in mobile networks remains challenging due to the complex interactions among Adaptive Bit Rate (ABR) schemes at the application layer, CC algorithms at the transport layer, and Radio Link Control (RLC) queuing at the link layer in the 5G network. While prior studies have largely examined these components in isolation, this work presents a comprehensive analysis of the impact of modern active queue management (AQM) strategies, such as RED and L4S, on video streaming over diverse QUIC implementations—focusing particularly on their interaction with the RLC buffer in 5G environments and the interplay between CC algorithms and ABR schemes. Our findings demonstrate that the effectiveness of AQM strategies in improving video streaming QoE is intrinsically linked to their dynamic interaction with QUIC implementations, CC algorithms and ABR schemes—highlighting that isolated optimizations are insufficient. This intricate interdependence necessitates holistic, cross-layer adaptive mechanisms capable of real-time coordination between network, transport and application layers, which are crucial for leveraging the capabilities of 5G networks to deliver robust, adaptive, and high-quality video."

This paper examines the outage probability (OP) of multi-cascaded RISs (MCRISs)-aided systems over doubly-correlated Rayleigh multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels. The moment-generating function is invoked to convert the OP into a numerical inversion of Laplace integral. To capture profound insights, we conduct an in-depth asymptotic investigation into the outage behavior of MCRIS-aided MIMO communications by leveraging random matrix theory in the high-SNR regime. The asymptotic results reveal that the first <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">h</i> RISs with the smallest number of reflective elements primarily dictate the bottleneck of reliability performance, where <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">h</i> is influenced by the variation in the number of reflective elements across the RISs. Specifically, smaller variations result in a larger <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">h</i>, while greater disparities reduce it. Additionally, we identify an “unsaturation effect” that occurs when the performance margin, or residual spatial degree of freedom (DoF), after propagation through the first <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">h</i> RISs cannot be evenly distributed between the transmitter and the RISs. This effect slows down the decline of the OP with increasing SNR. More cascaded RISs impair the spatial DoF of wireless communications, resulting in the loss of half of the independent fading channels compared to the system without the support of RIS as the cascaded number of RISs increases. Majorization theory is subsequently applied to unveil the negative effect of doubly-spatial correlation on system reliability. Finally, Monte Carlo simulations are carried out for validations."

    "abstract": "Collaborative AI engineering is a paradigm that enables multiple stakeholders to maintain AI pipelines by exchanging artifacts, such as data, models, and software packages. It is a cost-efficient engineering process that accelerates the development of AI applications, specifically for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). However, AI artifacts are often associated with inherent intellectual property (IP) or sensitive information, which hinders collaboration due to a lack of trust among stakeholders. Digital sovereignty is viewed as an ideal state where artifact owners maintain full control over their assets, such as making key decisions regarding access, storage, and interoperability. Thus, it is postulated that implementing digital sovereignty mechanisms in multi-stakeholder information systems can address the trust gap and promote collaboration. This work addresses this gap by conducting a systematic review of the literature on digital sovereignty for collaborative AI engineering. The main contributions of this work include: (i) mapping digital sovereignty definitions and requirements within the context of collaborative AI engineering, (ii) identifying existing technologies and concepts for implementing sovereignty features in AI engineering, and (iii) analyzing existing collaborative AI platforms such as data marketplaces, data spaces, and GAIA-X. This analysis highlights their sovereignty requirements, solutions, benefits and implementation challenges. In addition, this work (iv) identifies research gaps in data pricing, confidentiality, and interoperability, while proposing future directions to enhance digital sovereignty in collaborative AI ecosystems."

    "abstract": "The Fourth Industrial Revolution has largely bypassed traditional, asset-heavy industries like cement manufacturing, which face significant challenges in digitizing operations while managing innovation resistance and multi-generational workforces, particularly in emerging economies. This study investigates how digital resource orchestration can overcome these barriers to create a competitive advantage, employing a single case study design with five-year longitudinal observation and twelve in-depth interviews from Indonesia’s largest cement manufacturer. The research reveals that innovation resistance is not a temporary hurdle but a persistent institutional feature that must be systematically managed. A comprehensive framework is developed, demonstrating that successful transformation requires orchestrating people assets (digital leadership, capability development), process assets (governance, resource mechanisms), and technology assets (infrastructure, integration). The findings show that organizations progress through five maturity levels-from Traditional to Transformed-by applying sequential orchestration states that address specific resistance patterns at each stage. This study contributes to digital transformation theory by reconceptualizing innovation resistance as an organizational capability and provides an empirically grounded model for traditional industries seeking to bridge the digital divide."

    "abstract": "The complex interweaving of authentic and fake news on social networks poses formidable challenges to modern information management. Existing fake news detection methods heavily rely on extensive labeled data and auxiliary information, such as propagation structures, facing critical issues of data scarcity and semantic integrity destruction in practical applications. Traditional data augmentation methods, due to their fixed rule-based transformation patterns, fail to effectively simulate the complexity and irregularity of information propagation in real social networks. To address these fundamental limitations, this article proposes a contrastive learning-driven fake news detection (CLFD) framework that breaks through existing technical bottlenecks through innovative distortion-reversion dual-view manipulation mechanisms and distortion-aware contrastive learning methods. The core innovation of CLFD lies in employing learnable neural networks to precisely simulate nonlinear information transformation processes, generating stylistically diverse contrastive views while preserving semantic core integrity, fundamentally solving the critical problem of semantic destruction in traditional methods. More importantly, our method achieves efficient detection using only textual content, requiring no additional information such as propagation structures or social network topologies, demonstrating outstanding universality and portability. Through dynamic view generation and multiobjective joint optimization strategies, CLFD significantly enhances the model’s capability to capture deceptive features in fake news. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in detection accuracy, robustness, and generalization capability."

    "abstract": "Buried hill reservoirs constitute a key unconventional hydrocarbon resource in offshore China, where fracture networks govern seepage capacity and production performance. However, their great burial depth, low seismic signal-to-noise ratio, and complex geophysical responses make accurate fracture prediction challenging. To overcome the limitations of existing curvature-based approaches-such as high noise sensitivity, poor detection of small-scale fractures, and lack of quantitative multi-scale classification-this study proposes a novel multi-scale curvature-attribute-based fracture prediction method. The proposed approach features three main innovations. (1) An attribute enhancement strategy that integrates local dynamic smoothing with a Gaussian distance-weighted grid scanning technique to suppress noise while amplifying weak responses, thereby improving robustness. (2) A multi-directional peak scanning algorithm that effectively extracts fractures without the information loss inherent in traditional binarization–skeletonization methods, enabling more complete and continuous fracture characterization. (3) A Median Absolute Deviation (MAD)-based dynamic grading model that classifies fractures into large-, medium-, and small-scale categories using curvature statistics. Application of this method to the Bozhong A buried hill gas field in the Bohai Bay Basin verifies its effectiveness: it extracts 5.4 times more cumulative fracture length than conventional methods and substantially enhances fracture detection resolution. Even under 15% noise contamination, the method retains 90.05% of its extraction performance, demonstrating strong noise resistance. The predicted multi-scale fracture distributions (large, medium, small) show high consistency with seismic horizon deformation patterns, drilling fluid loss records, well-log interpretations, and productivity data, confirming the reliability of the results. Importantly, medium-scale fractures are identified as the dominant factor controlling single-well productivity. The proposed method provides an effective pathway for quantitative multi-scale fracture prediction in buried hill reservoirs, particularly within the weathering zone—the main hydrocarbon-producing interval."

    "abstract": "To address the issues of low detection speed and high dependency on manual inspection in the digital management of low-voltage metering boxes, this paper proposes a YOLOv8-based image defect detection algorithm for metering boxes, termed YOLOv8-BBI. Building upon the backbone architecture of YOLOv8, the BiFormer attention mechanism is introduced at the end of the backbone to effectively reduce computational cost and memory consumption while enhancing feature extraction capability. Furthermore, the neck component is redesigned using a variant of the BiFPN structure with learnable weights to optimize multi-scale feature fusion, thereby improving adaptability to objects of varying sizes. In addition, the Inner-IoU loss function is employed to accelerate the convergence of predicted bounding boxes and enhance the accuracy of defect localization. Experimental results demonstrate that YOLOv8-BBI achieves a 2.7 percentage point improvement in mean Average Precision (mAP) over the original YOLOv8 model. Meanwhile, the model size is reduced by $28.5 \\%$, and the detection speed increases from 42.8 FPS to 57.8 FPS, indicating a significant improvement in inference efficiency. These results provide robust support for real-time defect detection of metering boxes in the digital management of low-voltage distribution areas."

This study aims to analyze word association patterns in public conversations about customs using the FPGrowth algorithm within the Knowledge Discovery in Database (KDD) framework. Data were collected through Twitter crawling with the keyword “bea cukai” (customs) from June 1, 2023, to June 30, 2024, resulting in 3,702 tweets. The experiment produced 14 association rules with lift values greater than 1, revealing strong connections between the term “custom” and words such as “tax” and “expensive.” These findings indicate that customs issues are frequently associated with taxation policies and high costs. Furthermore, this study developed a Python-based system that automates the processes of crawling, preprocessing, and text association analysis. The contributions of this research provide valuable insights for DJBC in understanding public perceptions and offer an efficient analytical tool for opinion mining."

We tested several deep learning architectures, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), and attention mechanisms, using the IMDB movie review dataset. The BERT + BiLSTM + Attention (BERT-LA) model we presented outperformed the LSTMbased models, especially when it came to capturing diverse emotions in Arabic and English text. A comprehensive ablation research proved its efficiency, with an outstanding 97.04% accuracy on the English dataset and 98.02% on the Arabic dataset. To increase the model's robustness, we tested it on enhanced data, and it maintained good performance with 98.24% accuracy in English and 98.38% in Arabic.

The model integrates sequential agricultural tasks and resource constraints into a unified optimization framework, ensuring that each maintenance stage is executed in the correct order while minimizing the overall makespan. Implemented in Python using Pyomo, the model produces feasible and efficient schedules that balance workload distribution across multiple areas and periods. Computational experiments on various plantation instances show that the proposed RG-OA method achieves superior performance compared to other hybrid approaches, namely the Reduced Gradient-Genetic Algorithm (RG-GA) and the Reduced Gradient-Particle Swarm Optimizer (RG-PSO). RG-OA consistently results in shorter execution times, requires fewer branch-and-bound nodes, and maintains a lower convergence lag, especially in large-scale problem instances. These results confirm the scalability and reliability of the proposed hybrid method for complex agricultural scheduling problems. These findings highlight the potential of optimization models and hybrid nonlinear programming methods as effective decision-support tools for agricultural operations. In the context of smallholder coffee plantation management, the RG-OA framework provides a practical approach to improving efficiency, reducing costs, and supporting sustainable practices."

    "abstract": "In power systems, measurement signals are frequently embedded in non-stationary fluctuation processes driven by multi-source dynamic factors such as mechanical vibration, load variation, et.al. Feature extraction and classification provide an effective means to capture these nonstationary characteristics and detect corresponding faults. However, existing deep learning approaches remain limited, as they generally assume quasi-stationary data, generate deterministic outputs, and lack the ability to quantify epistemic uncertainty in fluctuating scenarios. To address these issues, this paper proposes a diagnostic framework based on Bayesian neural networks (BNN). By constructing a dynamic dataset that explicitly incorporates non-stationary fluctuation processes and employing the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm, the framework enables quantitative evaluation of disturbance impacts on model performance. Experimental results show that the model maintains robustness against falling-trend fluctuations, but exhibits sensitivity to rising-trend fluctuations, where classification probabilities shift significantly as the slope increases. This study provides new insights into uncertainty quantification and risk assessment in power systems under non-stationary fluctuation scenarios."

    "abstract": "Saltmarshes are critical coastal ecosystems that offer biodiversity, shoreline protection, and high carbon sequestration. Monitoring these habitats is essential but challenging because of their spatial complexity and sensitivity. This paper presents a Unmanned Ariel Vehicle (UAV) based hyperspectral survey conducted over Derrymore Saltmarsh, County Kerry, Ireland, using a DJI Matrice 300 drone equipped with a Resonon Pika-L hyperspectral imager. We demonstrate the effectiveness of hyperspectral data and Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) classification for identifying key saltmarsh vegetation species. Field data from vegetation quadrats were used for validation. Our results highlight the potential of UAV and HSI integration in supporting ecological research, improving habitat mapping accuracy, and enabling scalable, nondestructive monitoring."

    "abstract": "Sign languages, alongside spoken language, have historically served as essential forms of communication. Despite its significance, sign language instruction has not been well supported by modern technologies, especially in Arabic-speaking areas. This study demonstrates Aydi, which is the first Arabic-language mobile app combining CNN, gamification, and real-time sign recognition for children. It creates an interesting and approachable learning environment. The program uses gamification strategies, visual storytelling, and real-time gesture recognition. Over 25 users, including parents, teachers, and children, successfully tested the app, which demonstrated excellent usability and educational value with a 95.6 % model correctness. Aydi was developed using the Agile methodology, facilitating iterative development through multiple sprints. Each cycle integrated feedback from educators, parents, and sign language experts to enhance usability and pedagogical effectiveness. A convolutional neural network (CNN), trained on the Grey Arabic Alphabet Sign Language dataset, was utilized for hand gesture recognition. The model was deployed via a Flask backend that delivers predictions to the mobile application through an API. Usability testing yielded promising outcomes in terms of user satisfaction and gesture classification accuracy. The app aligns with Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 by advancing inclusive education through emerging technologies and holds the potential for broader societal impact."

    "abstract": "In response to the scheduling challenge where, after the flood standard of the lower reservoir of a pumped storage power station was upgraded (designed for a 500-year flood and checked for a 2000-year flood), the measured 24-hour flood volume increased by approximately 23% compared with the preliminary design, and the flow constraint at the downstream control section needed to be satisfied, this study designed a total of 6 flood regulation schemes, including 3 groups without pumped storage and 3 groups with pumped storage. Using the static storage flood regulation method and the joint flood regulation method, combined with the storage curve, discharge characteristics, and regional composition of floods, the evolution of flood levels and outflow processes under different flood limited water levels, convergent discharges, and pumped storage shutdown strategies were analyzed. The results show that: without pumped storage, increasing the convergent discharge at the downstream control section to 1245 m³/s can avoid the exceeding of the flood control high water level and the benefit loss caused by lowering the flood limited water level; with pumped storage, the scheme of \"full shutdown of pumped storage at 212.3m + convergent discharge of 1245 m³/s\" is recommended, which meets the design standards, ensures normal power generation for floods with a recurrence interval of less than 200 years, and the verification in the plum rain flood season also meets the requirements of the preliminary design water level. The research results provide key support for the project completion safety appraisal and the formulation of operation regulations, effectively ensuring the safety of the project and downstream flood control."
