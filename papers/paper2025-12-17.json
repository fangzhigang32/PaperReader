    "abstract": "This paper presents a digital demodulation technique for use in galvanic coupling intra-body communication (GC IBC) with BPSK-modulated signals at low frequencies (below MHz). The technique relies on a direct oversampled acquisition of the BPSK- modulated signal with an analogue-to-digital converter (ADC) associated with an original digital processing algorithm to extract the demodulated data from the acquired samples. The originality of the solution resides in the digital processing algorithm which combines several mechanisms to fully exploit the redundancy present in the collected samples in order to provide a high degree of robustness, while maintaining a low level of complexity compatible with efficient implementation in a microcontroller. Simulation and measurement results are presented, confirming the robustness of the proposed solution. In particular, hardware measurements carried out under controlled conditions demonstrate very good performance, with a Bit Error Rate (BER) below 3 × 10−5 for a signal with a Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of −5 dB. The proposed solution is also validated under real conditions with a GC communication realized through the back muscle of a fish, resulting in a BER < 2.5 × 10−6."

    "abstract": "Quantization and chroma downsampling are two primary operations that introduce distortions in the JPEG compression. However, most existing blind methods treat artifacts removal as a direct mapping from compressed images to clean ones. They fail to explicitly model the underlying degradation process or design targeted compensation mechanisms. As a result, these methods can only partially remove compression artifacts and struggle to generalize to diverse or unseen degradation scenarios. In this work, we present a novel perspective that formulates artifacts removal as an approximate inversion of the lossy steps in JPEG. Based on this view, we propose an Inverse JPEG Compression Network (IJCN), which aims to progressively compensate for quantization errors and color distortions. Specifically, we first design a Learnable Offset Guidance Module (LOGM) to approximate inverse quantization by modeling both intra-block and inter-block coefficient correlations for predicting rounding offsets. In addition, we propose a Quantization Table Guidance Module (QTGM) that leverages the quantization tables to guide the reconstruction network in mitigating color distortions. By modeling compensation mechanisms under the guidance of quantization tables, IJCN effectively eliminates artifacts across varying compression levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IJCN outperforms existing methods in both quantitative metrics and visual quality."

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) enables mobile devices to collaboratively train deep learning models while maintaining data privacy and minimizing communication overhead. However, traditional FL methods typically assume access to pre-collected datasets, an impractical assumption for real-world mobile devices that continuously collect sensor data streams without retaining them while operating, due to limited memory constraints. Streaming Federated Learning (SFL) partially addresses this limitation by supporting online learning and asynchronous model aggregation directly from live data streams. Yet, a critical challenge in mobile data streams is the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">temporal class imbalance</i>, which may biase the streaming FL process toward early-arriving data classes during the critical learning period (CLP), the initial training phase when the model exhibits the highest plasticity. To address this, we propose <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math>${\\sf AdaCLP}$</tex-math></inline-formula>, a training scheduler that tracks global model plasticity using a staleness-decayed mechanism specifically designed for the dynamics of real-world mobile environments. <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math>${\\sf AdaCLP}$</tex-math></inline-formula> dynamically adjusts local training hyperparameters in SFL to prolong the CLP, thereby preserving model plasticity in the face of time-varying, imbalanced data distributions. Furthermore, a CLP-aware dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) strategy is integrated to reduce the energy cost of prolonged training, aligning with the tight energy budgets of mobile devices. Experimental results demonstrate that <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math>${\\sf AdaCLP}$</tex-math></inline-formula> can effectively handle either temporally imbalanced or periodic data, improving accuracy by up to 11% while reducing energy consumption by 69.5% compared to state-of-the-art methods, without modifying the standard FL training pipeline. These demonstrate that <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math>${\\sf AdaCLP}$</tex-math></inline-formula> is a practical and efficient solution for real-world mobile FL deployment, enabling robust on-device adaptation to evolving data streams."

    "abstract": "Disease gene prioritization is a computational strategy that assigns scores to genes or proteins to estimate their likelihood of being associated with a specific disease, helping reduce the cost and effort of experimental validation. Given the large number of candidate genes and limited laboratory resources, effective prioritization techniques are essential for focusing experimental efforts on the most promising targets. In this study, we introduce a novel disease gene prioritization method based on continuous-time quantum walks applied to a heterogeneous biological network comprising both gene and disease nodes. This heterogeneous formulation enables a more comprehensive representation of biological interactions compared to traditional homogeneous models. By propagating quantum amplitudes through the network, the proposed framework captures complex structural patterns and interaction dynamics that classical approaches may overlook. To assess its effectiveness, we perform two types of evaluation: (i) comparison of our predictions with established findings reported in the literature, and (ii) benchmarking against a widely used classical prioritization technique. Experimental results show that our quantum walk-based model consistently outperforms the classical baseline, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.912 versus 0.804. These results demonstrate the potential of quantum-inspired algorithms to enhance accuracy in disease gene discovery and highlight their value for advancing computational methods in omics research.We further validated the robustness of our approach by incorporating the Precision–Recall AUC, which confirmed the superior predictive performance of the quantum walk model across multiple seed genes."

MANER leverages a medical-domain PLM (MedBERT-wwm), incorporates a BiGRU-based fusion attention module with dynamic local windowing to enhance boundary awareness, and applies an entity/non-entity–aware augmentation strategy to improve robustness.Experiments on the non-nested cEHRNER dataset show that MANER outperforms several strong baselines in precision, recall, and F1-score. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each component, demonstrating MANER’s robustness and adaptability for medical NER tasks."

    "abstract": "As the marine economy continues to expand, the importance of efficient and reliable marine data collection has become increasingly evident. This paper investigates a multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted marine data collection network system, where multiple UAVs are deployed within a designated area to collect data from water buoy sensors (WBSs) and act as relays to offload the collected data to a central ship. The primary objective is to minimize the total system energy consumption, subject to constraints on access relationships, power scheduling, and movement trajectories. The formulated optimization problem is non-convex and highly complex due to the coupling of multiple variables. To address this challenge, we propose an alternating optimization algorithm that jointly optimizes the trajectories of multiple UAVs, the access selection of WBSs, the trajectory of the ship, the data offloading decisions, and the UAV transmit power scheduling in an iterative manner. The algorithm leverages techniques such as successive convex approximation (SCA) and greedy strategies to efficiently solve the decomposed sub-problems. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significant performance improvements compared to several benchmark algorithms, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing energy efficiency and system robustness in dynamic marine environments."

    "abstract": "The use of logic circuits combined with emerging devices has been studied to overcome the limitations of complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) transistors. Among a variety of emerging devices, magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) is a promising candidate owing to its non-volatility, high endurance, and CMOS compatibility. However, process variations in MTJs and CMOS transistors hinder reliable and precise resistance-to-voltage conversion in hybrid MTJ/CMOS logic circuits. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel separated pre-charge sense amplifier that achieves fast-sensing, low-power, small-area, and high-reliability. The proposed circuit eliminates intermediate inverters between the discharge and evaluation stages. It incorporates P-channel MOS (PMOS) transistors within the inverter latch, whose gates are directly biased by voltages that reflect the resistance difference between a pair of MTJs. It minimizes its nodes to be charged or discharged during operation. Furthermore, it reduces the total transistor count, including clock-driven transistors. Simulations are performed using Cadence and HSPICE tools with the NCSU CMOS 45nm design kit and a physics-based MTJ SPICE model. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to check the circuit’s reliability under process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations. Post-layout simulation results show that the proposed circuit achieves the fastest sensing delay among the compared circuits except for Separated Pre-Charge Sense Amplifier (SPCSA), lowest power consumption, lowest power-delay product, smallest area overhead, and lowest sensing error rate for a viable usage in hybrid MTJ/CMOS logic memory circuits."

    "abstract": "Underwater information networks (UINs) serve as an effective solution for exploring and utilizing ocean resources. Communication and sonar are the two fundamental functions of UINs. Traditional discrete design between sonar and communication increases the size, power consumption and cost of the system, and reduce the system compatibility. The integrated design of sonar and communication enables them to share hardware platforms and signal processing units, thus overcoming the above drawbacks, and has received extensive attention from both academia and industry. Although integrated sonar and communication (ISC) systems have attracted increasing attention in recent years, research in this area remains relatively limited compared with the decades of development in integrated radar and communication (IRC). Several key issues remain to be addressed in aspects such as channel modeling, interference management, waveform design, and receiver signal processing. This article presents an overview of state-of-the-art research for ISC systems. We analyzes the shortcomings and challenges of these research in light of the characteristics of underwater acoustic (UWA) channels Furthermore, this paper discusses open problems and highlights promising research directions that could guide the development of more robust and efficient ISC systems in future underwater applications."

The collaborative model utilizing 6G is expected to break through the vehicle’s inherent field-of-view deficiencies and heterogeneous computational resource constraints, further improving the efficiency of the technology. This paper proposes a novel 6G NOMA air-ground integrated sensing-computing framework that achieves high-quality collaborative perception and low-latency 3D computing offloading to alleviate restrictions through cooperative networking with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and road-side units (RSUs). To balance latency and UAV energy consumption for efficient collaboration, we formulate it as a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem (MINLP). Considering the time sensitivity of the perceptual task, we introduce queuing and Lyapunov optimization theory to transform the optimization objective into a Lyapunov drift-penalty function and derive its upper bound, which we model as a Markov decision process (MDP) and optimize it with Large Language Models (LLMs) assisted temporal replay deep reinforcement learning (TR-DRL). For perception quality improvement, an elite-guided binary-weighted firefly algorithm is developed to solve combinatorial optimization in perception fusion. Experimental results demonstrate 4.88% and 8.26% improvements in latency and energy efficiency respectively, alongside enhanced perception fusion quality 7.41% compared with advanced counterparts."

    "abstract": "This letter presents the first experimental demonstration of a new type of silicon-integrated sub-terahertz (THz) waveguide, based on porous silicon (PS). The waveguide (WG) is realized on an ultralow-resistivity (ULR) silicon substrate using a single-step electrochemical anodization that codefines material and geometry, eliminating deep reactive-ion etching (DRIE) and wafer bonding. A coplanar-waveguide-to-PS-WG transition enables direct on-wafer characterization. The fabricated PS WG is targeted for D-band operation and exhibits a measured attenuation loss of 0.7 dB/mm at 140 GHz, in excellent agreement with full-wave simulations. This confirms the validity of the codesign approach. Combining low loss, simplified fabrication, and inherent material tunability, the proposed PS WG offers a promising route toward highly integrated sub-terahertz passive components and enables future gas and biosensing applications."

We present a novel model predictive control (MPC) formulation based on the operation of four-quadrant charging stations and the behaviour of Electric Vehicle (EV) drivers. The presented approach enables V2G capable charging units to serve multiple functions, including voltage regulation, power loss reduction, and MES energy management. Thus, the proposed MPC approach reduces violations of operational limits and improves the efficient use of MES components, such as Photovoltaic systems and heat pumps. MPC with a V2G mode regulator is implemented to ensure efficient, real-time operation of the MES. The proposed strategy is evaluated using a realistic MES inspired by the Forschungszentrum Jülich campus. Further tests conducted on a modified version of the IEEE 123-bus system demonstrate the scalability of the proposed V2G algorithm."

    "abstract": "This paper deals with the problem of dynamic trajectory planning for a group of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in unknown environments. The existing methods often suffer from excessive computational burden, which creates the gap between theoretical approaches and practical swarm deployment. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a distributed cooperative planning system (DCPS). The system consists of two levels: a trajectory planning level and a cooperative trajectory planning level. On the trajectory planning level, a kinodynamic Gaussian potential B-spline (KGPB) approach is designed by combining the local kinodynamic-A-star method and the Gaussian potential field B-spline method. Specifically, in the front-end, a trajectory is first generated by using the local kinodynamic-A-star method based on kinematics-dynamics constraints. And then, in the back-end, the trajectory is further optimized by using the Gaussian potential B-spline (GPB) method. On the cooperative trajectory planning level, a back field neighbor replanning (BFNP) approach is proposed, where each UAV only needs to communicate with the nearest neighbors. According to the potential collision region of the front UAV, the trajectory of the current UAV is dynamically improved to ensure safe and stable flight such that communication costs are significantly improved. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DCPS achieves at least a 27% increase in average velocity and a 24% reduction in traversal time for the UAV swarm compared to prior methods. The experimental outcomes provide further validation that the proposed DCPS can generate efficient and safe trajectories. For particular cases, the UAV operates at 97% of its maximum possible velocity. The proposed DCPS provides a reliable solution for a group of unmanned aerial vehicles in unknown environments."

    "abstract": "In recent years, with the wide application of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in the field of artificial intelligence, the study of neural network bifurcation dynamics has received much attention and has achieved a large number of results, but the current research only focuses on the binary interactions between neurons and does not take into account the higher-order interactions (HOIs) that exist between neurons. Furthermore, most neural network models focus on ring, star and chain structures, but it is more practical to study multi-layer neural networks. For this reason, this paper develops a three-layer neural network with multiple time delays under HOIs. Firstly, the characteristic equation of network is obtained, and the time delay is selected as the bifurcation parameter. Subsequently, the stability of the neural network and the sufficient condition for the occurrence of Hopf bifurcation are established. Then, the correctness of the theoretical results is verified through numerical simulations. The simulation results demonstrate that the increase of the time delay leads to Hopf bifurcation, which consequently leads to the system oscillation and instability. In addition, the stability of the network is closely related to the higher-order coupling coefficient, self-feedback coefficient and unified connection weight. An increase in the higher-order coupling coefficient expands the stability domain of the network, an increase in the self-feedback coefficient enlarges the stability domain of the network, and an increase in the unified connection weight narrows the stability domain of the network. Finally, our model performs well in terms of function fitting, which also provides some insights into the subsequent modelling and analysis of higher-order neural networks."

Recently, regression-based DL approaches have been explored to overcome the limitations of classification-based methods; however, a comprehensive comparative analysis across diverse convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures under realistic conditions has been lacking. This study addresses this gap by comparing the performance of multiple CNN models, from lightweight MobileNetV2 to complex DenseNet-201, specifically formulated for SNR regression. Their generalization capabilities are comprehensively evaluated under SNR mismatched conditions across varying channel models, modulation schemes, and dataset distributions. Simulation results reveal that architectures incorporating advanced features, such as Xception’s depthwise separable convolutions and ResNet’s skip connections, demonstrate superior robustness and accuracy, significantly outperforming simpler CNN models across all evaluated scenarios. This analysis confirms that modern architectural innovations are key to achieving reliable and generalizable SNR estimation in non-ideal communication environments."

The proposed 2D-DPPM achieves a modulation order of 9-bit while eliminating the sync pulse required in conventional multipulse pulse position modulation (MPPM). By employing the TDM scheme, all data pulses are generated from a single delay-line-based digital-to-time converter (DTC), reducing power consumption and eliminating mismatch between two delay lines. The PG scheme further enhances power efficiency by dynamically deactivating unused delay cells according to real-time input data. Fabricated in 40 nm CMOS process, the transmitter delivers a data rate of 1.8 Gbps with an energy efficiency of 2.2 pJ/bit. A transcutaneous transmission distance of 11 cm is measured under the condition of applying 15-mm-thick pork tissue and a BER of less than 10-3."

    "abstract": "Flying ad hoc networks (FANETs) offer flexible, real-time wireless communication solutions for multi-drone systems by utilizing drones as network routers. However, FANETs’ unique characteristics, including high mobility, unstable network topology, and intermittent connectivity, pose significant challenges in designing efficient and reliable routing protocols. Traditional routing protocols for mobile ad hoc networks often fall short in highly dynamic airborne environments due to excessive control overhead, increased latency, and inefficient route maintenance. To address these issues, this paper proposes an enhanced on-demand predictive (EDP) routing protocol that integrates a neighbor coverage-based predictive flooding mechanism and an adaptive link quality-based route maintenance strategy. The flooding mechanism mitigates directional deafness by using a Kalman filter-based probabilistic forwarding model, while the route maintenance method optimizes path selection based on distance, traffic load, and link lifetime. Simulation results show that EDP significantly improves packet delivery rate, reduces network delay, and lowers overhead compared to benchmarks, making it well-suited for applications in FANETs."

    "abstract": "The rotor eccentricity fault is one of the weak links in the reliability chain of induction motors (IM), and the commercially available solutions for its detection are complex, costly, and, most importantly, require service interruption. Therefore, in real-world scenarios, measurements of rotor eccentricity are not common unless its effects become noticeable through increased noise, vibrations, or bearing failure. However, such practices exacerbate the severity of faults and can lead to catastrophic and cascading failures. In this work, the effects of various eccentricity faults are discussed in detail, and a search coil-based solution is explored for online detection of rotor eccentricity events without interrupting machine operation. The proposed method is based on the principle of induced voltage compensation, utilizing coils placed near the air gap to achieve better accuracy. Finite element analysis demonstrates that this technique not only quantifies the extent of eccentricity with reasonable precision but is also capable of generating metadata such as the type of eccentricity and residual bearing life. The effectiveness of the fault detection method is verified through experiments with different configurations of search coils, demonstrating their ability to identify bearing abnormalities and eccentricity faults early, proving its potential to prevent catastrophic failures, especially in critical applications such as nuclear power, chemical, aerospace, and defense."

However, the current works usually ignore the uncertainty of the users’ position, resulting in invalidity of the designed algorithms especially for ensuring the Quality of Service (QoS) of users. Considering this factor, we formulate a robust optimization problem with joint trajectory optimization, power allocation, and user scheduling to minimize the total energy consumption of UAV. To solve the robust problem, we first reformulate it as a deterministic form based on the Bernstein-type inequality and then design an iterative algorithm based on the block coordinate descent method. For the subproblems in the iterative algorithm, we analyze their characteristics to get the explicit expression of the optimal solutions or design efficient algorithms by sequential convex approximation. Simulation results indicate that our proposed algorithms exhibit good convergence performance and greatly outperform the existing algorithms in terms of energy consumption and QoS guarantee."

    "abstract": "Fine timing measurement (FTM) is a feature of the IEEE 802.11 standard that enables indoor positioning. Given the high availability of Wi-Fi devices and the increasing accuracy of positioning in subsequent standard releases, FTM is poised to become a ubiquitous solution in the field. However, the densification of Wi-Fi networks and increase in traffic volume have a deteriorating impact on FTM signaling. This problem can be countered by optimizing FTM parameters to significantly improve the performance of indoor localization in dense networks. After conducting experiments with Intel AC-8260 devices and observing limited control of FTM parameters, we study the impact of network densification on FTM’s ranging success probability by combining the ns-3 network simulator with the Optuna hyperparameter optimization framework to test a wide range of network scenarios and FTM configurations. We leverage the obtained knowledge to determine optimum FTM parameter settings, based on contention levels observed at access points. We show that our solution greatly outperforms static configurations in terms of FTM’s ranging success probability. These results impact both the future development of the FTM procedure and its forthcoming implementations in real-world devices."

    "abstract": "Frequency stability is becoming increasingly important in modern power systems due to high penetration levels of inverter-interfaced renewable energy sources (RES) and the resulting reduction in system inertia. To address this issue, battery energy storage systems have been proposed as fast-acting resources for frequency-related system support services. Respectively, this paper presents an experimental Power Hardware-in-the-Loop (PHIL) investigation of a Redox Flow battery’s frequency response in a low-inertia grid environment. A control scheme in which the battery state of charge is used as the primary control variable has been implemented. Virtual inertia and damping terms have been added to the battery control loop, so that the response to frequency deviations can be adjusted as required. The PHIL setup, comprising a real-time digital simulator, power amplifiers, a test grid platform, and a commercial Redox Flow battery, has been used to validate the proposed approach under a range of disturbance scenarios. The presented results show that although longer than usually expected response times are obtained, the emulation of inertia and damping in the BESS leads to reducing of the frequency nadir and shortening of the settling time. These results demonstrate that battery-based virtual inertia can effectively enhance frequency stability in low-inertia power systems, highlighting its potential role in future grids with high numbers of inverter-interfaced RESs."

    "abstract": "This work presents a new reinforcement learning framework for optimizing the design of irregular reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (IRIS) to enhance the downlink performance of 6G multiuser wireless systems. Unlike existing works that primarily target regular RIS architectures and rely on instantaneous channel state information (CSI), we develop an IRIS design optimization method based on statistical CSI, which is more reliable and much cheaper to acquire for large RIS deployments. With such limited CSI, we first derive a closed-form ergodic transmission rate under a total transmit power constraint at the base station. Building on this, we propose a novel reinforcement learning framework based on deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) that jointly optimizes the antenna element selection, phase shifts and precoding to maximize statistical CSI-based spectral efficiency (SE) or energy efficiency (EE) in IRIS-assisted communication systems. The proposed IRIS-DDPG framework effectively mitigates the computational challenges caused by the high-dimensional mixed-integer nature of IRIS optimization, while incorporates the transmit-power constraint into reinforcement learning for practical implementation. Extensive simulation results show that our IRIS-DDPG algorithm achieves high performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods assuming perfect instantaneous CSI, and even surpasses them in practical systems subject to CSI estimation errors."

    "abstract": "This study introduces a novel hybrid optimization approach to achieve optimal size, strategic placement of distributed energy generators, and improved performance assessment within radial distribution systems. The three goals are: (i) determining the best sizes for the system components of solar PV, wind turbines, and energy storage systems; (ii) determining where they would work best; and (iii) assessing the effectiveness of the suggested hybrid optimization algorithms. Our hybrid approach integrates the mechanisms of genetic algorithms within a particle swarm optimization framework to improve efficiency. By applying crossover and mutation to the particles after each particle swarm optimization iteration, we introduce diversity and mitigate premature convergence. This strategy utilizes a rapid global search for particle swarm optimization to identify promising regions, while the genetic algorithm fine-tunes solutions locally. Combining the speed of particle swarm optimization with the precision of the genetic algorithm, the algorithm excels at identifying optimal global solutions. This synergy optimizes exploration and exploitation, making it highly effective for complex optimization challenges. To assess the effectiveness of the hybrid particle swarm optimization genetic algorithm, a simulation environment and analysis were carried out using a 14, 39, and 118 bus DC microgrid with solar photovoltaic, wind turbine, and ESS simulated under different load profiles. The analysis of the IEEE 14, 39, and 118-bus systems reveals varying performance across PSOGA, MAJO, and MIWO algorithms in terms of power loss reduction, voltage stability index (VSI), and cost optimization. PSOGA consistently demonstrates superior power loss reduction, achieving 79.8-80.4% on the IEEE 14-bus, 0.97-2.16% on the 39-bus, and 79.8-88.5% on the 118-bus systems. Its voltage stability index (VSI) remained consistently low, ranging from 0.0027-0.00345% to 0.1147-0.1169%. MAJO also performs well in power loss reduction but shows a slightly wider range in VSI and comparable power loss reduction to PSOGA. MIWO, while offering remarkable cost optimization (91.93-96.76%) in the 14-bus system (outperforming PSOGA 4.49-24.24% and MAJO 0.0-23.65%), shows a more significant range in power loss reduction (1.19-29.71% in the 39-bus system) and a higher VSI (up to 0.0368%) across all systems, suggesting less consistent performance. PSOGA is the best-proposed system for most applications due to its consistent and superior performance across all key metrics. Overall, PSOGA appears to offer a more balanced and reliable performance for power loss reduction and voltage stability. The findings demonstrated notable gains in system efficiency, dependability, and sustainability, as well as advances in the integration of smart distributed energy generator planning into future-ready power systems. Significant reductions in power loss and improvements in VSI and total cost across all load conditions were shown by analyzing voltage profiles, power loss, voltage stability index, cost, and key metrics across the IEEE14, 39, and 118bus systems. The suggested hybrid optimization method successfully overcomes the difficulties of sizing and placing DC microgrids, making it a flexible and resilient option for contemporary energy systems."

Moreover, the lack of integrated solutions capable of simultaneously monitoring motor recovery and providing intelligent assistance in home environments hampers rehabilitation outcomes. Here, we present a multimodal smart home platform designed for continuous, at-home rehabilitation of post-stroke patients, integrating wearable sensing, ambient monitoring, and adaptive automation. A plantar pressure insole equipped with a machine learning pipeline classifies users into motor recovery stages with up to 94% accuracy, enabling quantitative tracking of walking patterns during daily activities. An optional head-mounted eye-tracking module, together with ambient sensors such as cameras and microphones, supports seamless hands-free control of household devices with an average latency under 1 s with consistent operation. These data streams are fused locally via a hierarchical Internet of Things (IoT) architecture, ensuring low latency and data privacy. An embedded large language model (LLM) agent, Auto-Care, continuously interprets multimodal data to provide real-time interventions—issuing personalized reminders, adjusting environmental conditions, and notifying caregivers. Implemented in a post-stroke context, this integrated smart home platform increased mean user satisfaction from 3.9 ± 0.8 in conventional home environments to 8.4 ± 0.6 with the full system (n = 20).

    "abstract": "Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) being able to provide novel view synthesis has been intensively introduced into Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) for 3D representations. However, such combination significantly increases the non-linearity and optimization burdens of SLAM, since millions of Gaussian primitives to be optimized are involved and play dominate roles for determining system performance. In this paper, we alleviate this problem through prompting map initialization quality using depth regularization and exploiting more constraints from sparse observations by proposing virtual supervision viewpoints. Specifically, based on the knowledge that good initialization of map can effectively avoid local minimal trap, Gaussian primitives are accurately and hierarchically initialised using our smoothed depth image, in which Gaussian primitives’ shapes are guided based on curvature and normal vectors, and hierarchical mechanism is proposed for efficiency. Furthermore, to avoid over-fitting to sparse observations, fixed virtual supervision viewpoints are constructed to augment viewpoints, which are used to generate consistent multi-view constraints for map optimization. Experimental results show advanced results in tracking and mapping performance compared to baseline methods."

    "abstract": "Improving energy efficiency (EE) and mass connectivity is an essential component of 6G networks. To address these challenges, there is a need for AI-driven approaches to energy efficiency, that can also account for the possible coexistence of cell-free (CF) and holographic MIMO (HM)-enabled base stations (HM BSs). Those BSs must distribute their power to the users by accumulating power from the serving HM BSs, taking into account the age of services (AoS) of the HM BSs. For such a network, in this paper, an optimization problem is designed to maximize EE by considering total power consumption and achievable rate, which results in maximizing the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the obtained signal, ensuring effective power distribution. A transformer-aided AI scheme is developed to solve the designed NP-hard problem by allocating the necessary power through aggregation from the desired serving HM BSs, guided by their AoS information, thereby serving users in both HM and CF networks. Simulation results show that the proposed transformer-aided AI scheme achieves aggregated power savings of 6.4% and 9%, aggregated SINR improvements of 8.36 dB and 8.37 dB, aggregated achievable rate enhancements of 5.67 bps/Hz and 5.69 bps/Hz, and aggregated EE improvements of 12.2% and 7.8%, in comparison to the long short-term memory and gated recurrent unit-based methods, correspondingly."

In this study, we present a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates the performance, fairness, and interpretability of foundation models, both as unimodal encoders and as multimodal learners, using the publicly available MIMIC-IV database. To support consistent and reproducible evaluation, we developed a standardized data processing pipeline that harmonizes heterogeneous clinical records into an analysis-ready format. We systematically compared twelve foundation models, encompassing both unimodal and multimodal models, as well as domain-specific and general-purpose variants. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating multiple data modalities generally improves predictive performance without introducing additional bias. While domain-specific fine-tuning offers a cost-effective solution for unimodal foundation models, this effectiveness does not translate well to multimodal scenarios. Additionally, our experiments reveal limited task generalizability in current large vision-language models (LVLMs), emphasizing the need for more versatile and robust medical LVLMs. Through this benchmark, we aim to support the development of effective and trustworthy multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) systems for real-world clinical applications."

    "abstract": "To cope with the challenges of multi-timescale coordination of energy storage and coupled scheduling of multiple energy with a high proportion of renewable energy penetration, this paper proposes a multi-timescale hierarchical rolling scheduling framework for electric-hydrogen-ammonia integrated energy system (EHA-IES). In the upper layer, a fuzzy forecast method based on climate weights fusion generates annual renewable energy generation to drive yearly ammonia scheduling. In the middle layer, after receiving decisions from the upper layer, information gap decision theory (IGDT) is applied for weekly hydrogen scheduling, which balances the robustness and economy of hydrogen scheduling. In the lower layer, with the upper and middle layers transferring the results as boundary relaxations, daily electric scheduling is achieved by model predictive control (MPC). Then, the feedback mechanism of rolling dynamic corrections is proposed to re-execute hydrogen and ammonia scheduling decisions. The simulation analysis demonstrates that the hierarchical rolling scheduling framework facilitates multi-timescale energy transfer, enhancing the system's robustness in response to fluctuations in renewable energy. Furthermore, the economy of full-period multiple energy operation improves by 7.30% and 14.28% compared to the electric-hydrogen hierarchical scheduling and the electric-ammonia hierarchical scheduling, respectively."

However, reliance on single-task learning (STL) models for INI faces limitations in meeting this demand. To address these challenges, we develop a multi-task-aware low-overhead in-network inference (MALOI) scheme. MALOI makes multiple tasks share the parameters in hidden layers by leveraging a multitask learning (MTL) model, which allows a few number of layers to carry out numerous inference tasks at once. Furthermore, MALOI selects a part of essential features and compresses the inference model accordingly. Evaluation results demonstrate that MALOI reduces memory usage by 48.8% and shortens inference processing delay by 91.5% compared to the STL model, while maintaining sufficiently high classification performance."

Modifying sabotage games into dynamic network security problems successfully captures the nuanced interplay of strategy and uncertainty in dynamic network security. Theoretically, we extend sabotage games to model network security contexts and thoroughly explore if the additional restrictions raise their computational complexity, often the bottleneck of game theory in practical contexts.

    "abstract": "The Linux kernel offers nearly 20,000 configuration options, making it highly customizable but also extremely challenging to manually optimize for performance. The diversity of operating environments and workloads further limits the effectiveness of static or expert-crafted configurations. This paper introduces KconfigTune, an automated tuning system that jointly optimizes Linux kernel configuration options and system-level parameters (e.g., procfs entries). We propose extconfig to expand the parameter search space and, for the first time, address configuration dependencies that arise during automated tuning. To ensure valid and bootable kernels, we design a dependency automatic fix tool and a GRUB-based mechanism. KconfigTune models the tuning process as a machine learning problem and applies Bayesian optimization with a random forest model to efficiently explore the vast and interdependent configuration space. Unlike prior approaches that focus solely on either kernel options or system parameters, KconfigTune achieves deeper integration by jointly tuning both compile-time and runtime behaviors. Experimental results show significant performance improvements, with gains of 18.62% and 19.92% over the default configuration in UnixBench and LEBench tests, respectively. Compared to the state-of-the-art, KconfigTune outperforms by 2.9% and 12.69% in these benchmarks. Ablation studies further confirm that these gains primarily stem from the combined tuning of kernel configurations and system-level parameters."

This paper introduces a grid-connected multiple MGs optimization system coordinated by an energy router (ER), which dynamically regulates power flows among MGs to enable fast and efficient energy allocation. To maximize the utilization of DGs and the mutual balance of MGs, a hierarchical optimal scheduling scheme is developed for MGs in distribution networks (DNs) under ER control. Compared to direct power supply from the DN, inter-MG power exchange is prioritized to minimize transmission losses. The proposed strategy adopts a hierarchical optimization framework, simultaneously minimizing power losses and maximizing economic benefits. The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is improved to solve the hierarchical optimization problem with binary variables, achieving decentralized collaborative control. Finally, the proposed strategy is simulated on the modified IEEE 33-node system. The results show that this strategy can improve the voltage quality of the DNs, reduce reliance of the multiple MGs on the DNs, and improve resource scheduling efficiency through inter-MG coordination."

Belief formation takes place by means of an iterative two-step procedure where: <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i</i>) the agents update locally their beliefs by using some likelihood models; and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ii</i>) the updated beliefs are combined with the beliefs of the neighboring agents, using a pooling rule. This procedure can fail to perform well in the presence of dynamic drifts, leading the agents to incorrect decision making. Here, we focus on the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">fully online</i> setting where both the true hypothesis and the likelihood models can change over time.

These stages are controlled by two adaptation parameters that govern the evolution of the error probability for each agent. We show that all agents learn consistently for sufficiently small adaptation parameters, in the sense that they ultimately place all their belief mass on the true hypothesis. In particular, the probability of choosing the wrong hypothesis converges to values on the order of the adaptation parameters. The theoretical analysis is illustrated both on synthetic data and by applying the A<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> SL strategy to a social learning problem in the online setting using real data."

An energy-based performance index dynamically balances tracking accuracy with minimal robotic intervention to encourage active human participation. Furthermore, a modified virtual energy tank approach is introduced to preserve system passivity, preventing unsafe behaviors. Experimental results underscore the algorithm’s adaptability, ensuring compliant behavior as evidenced by a notable 83% reduction in average stiffness, reflecting a corresponding decrease in robotic intervention, due to detection of active human participation. Moreover, the algorithm ensures safe interaction and effective task completion.

Existing algorithms for extracting HR from visible light cameras can be divided into two categories: classical rPPG algorithms, known for their computational efficiency but limited HR accuracy, and state-of-the-art deep learning methods, which offer high HR accuracy but lack computational efficiency on low-end hardwares. To address these challenges, we proposed two models: 3D-CXNet and 1D-CXNet. 3D-CXNet is optimized for low-end GPU environments, while 1D-CXNet is designed for low-end CPU settings. Both models were evaluated against six classical rPPG algorithms and six state-of-the-art deep learning methods across three scenarios: motion, minimal motion, and low skin-tone conditions. Results demonstrated that both 3D-CXNet and 1D-CXNet consistently outperformed classical rPPG algorithms. 3D-CXNet matched the performance of advanced deep learning methods with a minimal computational time of 64ms on low-end GPUs. Meanwhile, 1D-CXNet showed competitive performance with a MAE difference of less than 2 compared to the best model and achieved a impressive computational time of 25ms on low-end CPUs, comparable to classical rPPG algorithms."

    "abstract": "Superconducting coils in nuclear fusion reactors store exceptionally high energy, making insulation breakdown due to quenching a significant concern. When designing an insulation system for these coils, engineers evaluate the discharge characteristics using Paschen’s test or optical observation. These tests are conducted on various insulation systems, including film-shaped and coil-shaped systems. They help identify voids in the insulation and optimize the material composition based on observed discharge characteristics. However, the weak points of the insulation system in the superconducting coil are usually the insulation surface or the interface between dissimilar insulators. Glass cloth and polyimide film, frequently used in nuclear fusion reactors, are optically opaque materials. Therefore, optical observation of discharges progressing through such interfaces between dissimilar materials is hard to apply. The discharge voltage from Paschen’s test alone does not provide enough information to evaluate the condition of the superconducting coil insulation system. In this study, we propose a technique for measuring surface discharges using an array-type coaxial probe system. This method is beneficial for insulating systems where optical measurements are challenging. In addition, analysis of the probe potential profile using an equivalent-circuit model demonstrates the feasibility of the measurement system."

Most memory testing is primarily based on March algorithms. However, as memory undergoes thorough testing during component manufacturing, repeating similar tests at the system level is not expected to be efficient. This work examined the effectiveness of March tests at the system level and experimentally demonstrated their limitations. Cisco Systems’ C480 M5 server was used as the target system, with memory errors collected from a memory module. A total of 23 March algorithms, covering most of the commonly used ones, were performed. To explore the correlation between system memory errors and the fault models (FMs) targeted by these algorithms, inductive fault analysis (IFA) was employed. A newly proposed metric, the FM correlation probability, was introduced to quantify this correlation. This metric was used to evaluate the correlation of 8 faulty system addresses (FSAs) against the 62 fault primitives (FPs) across the 9 FMs. No FSA exhibited a FM correlation probability greater than 30%, and none achieved 100% correlation with all 62 FPs. Additionally, March tests were also performed in different socket positions to see whether the observed trends are similar in a different system environment."

We report a classroom-based quasi-experiment in an introductory C++ course comparing two sections taught by the same instructor with identical syllabi, assessments, and assignments. One section completed all projects in teams; the other worked individually. We analyzed achievement indicators, the spread of scores across students, end-of-semester surveys of satisfaction and project-format preference. Results show a consistent divergence: the team-project section achieved higher performance with a narrower spread of scores, whereas the individual-project section trended toward lower performance with a wider spread. Despite this, students expressed a strong preference for individual projects and reported higher satisfaction with the individual format, suggesting that coordination costs and equity concerns may dampen perceived enjoyment of teamwork even when learning benefits accrue. Alignment between a student’s stated preference and the format they experienced showed little association with achievement in this sample. By holding instructor, materials, and assessments constant, this study isolates the effect of project format and foregrounds stability alongside mean performance."

The monitoring parameters includes the cell temperature, current and voltage from PV panel, and the meteorological parameters such as solar radiation, ambient temperature, water temperature, wind speed, wind direction, humidity and rainfall. The system uses a novel relay switch strategy to measure the raw current and voltage of the FPV under no-load condition and uses an algorithm to trace the I-V curve maximum power point and transmits the data online to a remote site. An empirical study with an FPV system was carried out to test the performance of the proposed remote weather and energy data acquisition system. The result showed reliable data measurement with a success rate of 91.20% data reception with a common discrepancy of signal loss and surrounding interference. The four-day FPV panel characterization test finds a significant cooling effect in the maximum power point based on ambient conditions with an average temperature reduction of 0.23°C corresponding to a relative yield difference of of 9.82% in favor of floating photovoltaics compared to a traditional ground-mounted system."

    "abstract": "This study presents the development and experimental validation of a physics-based dynamic model for a Grab-Type Ship Unloader (GTSU) system, implemented using the Modelica modeling language. The model implements the main mechanical components and dynamic interactions of the GTSU, including the trolley, hoist, grab, and wire rope dynamics, through a series of nonlinear differential equations. Experimental data were collected from an on-site GTSU system equipped with an absolute encoder sensor to verify the model’s accuracy. The results of the comparison for position, velocity, and dynamic characteristics show a high degree of consistency between the model’s predictions and the experimentally observed system operation results. This validation confirms the model’s capability to capture the complex dynamics of the GTSU system realistically and provides a reliable foundation for further research on control strategies and the design of automated systems based on operational predictions. The proposed Modelica-based dynamic model thus serves as a robust tool for enhancing the design and operational efficiency of grab-type ship unloader systems."

Most existing PLA schemes have relied on real-valued neural networks, where complex-valued channel impulse response (CIR) is processed by separating the real and imaginary components into dual-channel inputs. This conversion disrupts the inherent coupling between magnitude and phase, thereby constraining authentication accuracy. Importantly, the spatial position of each user inherently serves as a reliable identity fingerprint. In this letter, a complex-valued network-based multi-task learning (CVN-MTL) model is proposed for multi-user authentication. By leveraging the spatiotemporal characteristics of both CIR and position, the CVN-MTL model simultaneously performs user authentication and fine-grained localization. Experiment results show that the CVN-MTL model performs superiority on authentication performance and is robust to different communication scenarios."

Knowledge-enhanced multimodal VQA offers transformative potential across computer vision applications, including accessibility, healthcare, security and education. Existing VQA techniques often neglect rich semantic and relational information about image content or rely on potentially biased knowledge sources with limited coverage. Our Neurosymbolic Visual Question Answering (NeSyVQA) framework addresses this by enriching scene graphs with rich background knowledge from a heterogeneous knowledge graph and employing the enriched scene graphs in an attention-based scene graph reasoning network. The framework employs a cascade of deep neural networks, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks, for object detection and predicate classification within Scene Graph Generation (SGG). The initial scene graph is semantically enriched for improved expressiveness using background knowledge and related facts extracted from a heterogeneous knowledge graph. The enriched scene graphs are then employed for downstream VQA using an attention-based scene graph reasoning network. Promising evaluation results were obtained for SGG and VQA tasks on the General Question Answering (GQA) and Visual Genome (VG) benchmark datasets using their standard evaluation metrics. The proposed NeSyVQA framework outperformed the existing state-of-the-art SGG and VQA techniques with over 13% higher relationship recall rates in SGG and a 4% higher accuracy on open-ended questions in VQA, which underscores the efficacy of leveraging multimodal features and heterogeneous knowledge for complex visual reasoning.

    "abstract": "Self-supervised monocular depth estimation has achieved notable success under daytime conditions. However, its performance deteriorates markedly at night due to low visibility and varying illumination, e.g., insufficient light causes textureless areas, and moving objects bring blurry regions. To this end, we propose a self-supervised framework named DASP that leverages spatiotemporal priors for nighttime depth estimation. Specifically, DASP consists of an adversarial branch for extracting spatiotemporal priors and a self-supervised branch for learning. In the adversarial branch, we first design an adversarial network where the discriminator is composed of four devised spatiotemporal priors learning blocks (SPLB) to exploit the daytime priors. In particular, the SPLB contains a spatial-based temporal learning module (STLM) that uses orthogonal differencing to extract motion-related variations along the time axis and an axial spatial learning module (ASLM) that adopts local asymmetric convolutions with global axial attention to capture the multiscale structural information. By combining STLM and ASLM, our model can acquire sufficient spatiotemporal features to restore textureless areas and estimate the blurry regions caused by dynamic objects. In the self-supervised branch, we propose a 3D consistency projection loss to bilaterally project the target frame and source frame into a shared 3D space, and calculate the 3D discrepancy between the two projected frames as a loss to optimize the 3D structural consistency and daytime priors. Extensive experiments on the Oxford RobotCar and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance for nighttime depth estimation. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each component."

    "abstract": "XinMultimodal remote sensing data always comprise hyperspectral image, light detection and ranging data, and synthetic-aperture radar. Different modalities supply complementary information that improve accuracy for multimodal remote sensing classification. Although deep learning-based methods have been a mainstream, they also introduce high computational and energy cost. Unlike existing models, spiking neural network (SNN) is intrinsically energy-efficient, which reduces computation cost and energy expenditure with only a small subset of neurons. However, SNN extracts spatial and channel features without considering the redundancy among different remote sensing modalities. To reduce cross-modal redundancy while retaining important features, this paper proposes an efficient spatial-channel spiking neural network for multimodal remote sensing data classification. Firstly, in the modality fusion step, considering the quality of different modalities is various (i.e., HSI is impaired by cloud), an energy-guided multimodal remote sensing fusion strategy is proposed, which allocates the high weight for the informative single modality suppressing less-informative ones by optimizing the generation bound. Secondly, we leverage information from the high-quality modality. In the spatial feature learning step, an efficient spatial SNN is proposed. It transforms the spatial features to the frequency domain, which shares parameters across different time steps in the spatial dimension to reduce spatial feature redundancy. Finally, to further reduce the redundancy, an efficient channel SNN is explored, it focuses on learning important spike representations in the channel dimension by learning learnable parameters. Experimental results on the three multimodal remote sensing datasets indicate that the proposed methods are competitive compared to the state-of-the-art models."

However, existing image DeepSC methods, frequently encounter challenges in balancing rate-distortion performance and computational complexity, and often exhibit inferior performance compared to traditional schemes, especially on high-resolution datasets. To address these limitations, we propose a novel image DeepSC system, using quadtree partition-based joint semantic-channel coding, named Quad-DeepSC, which maintains low complexity while achieving state-of-the-art transmission performance. Based on maturing learned image compression technologies, we establish a unified DeepSC system design and training pipeline. The proposed Quad-DeepSC integrates quadtree partition-based entropy estimation and feature coding modules with lightweight feature extraction and reconstruction networks to form an end-to-end architecture. During training, all components except the feature coding modules are jointly optimized as a compact learned image codec, Quad-LIC, for source compression tasks. The pretrained Quad-LIC is then embedded into Quad-DeepSC and fine-tuned end-to-end over wireless channels. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Quad-DeepSC is the first DeepSC system to surpass conventional communication systems, which employ VTM for source coding and adopt the optimal MCS index under 3GPP standards for channel coding and digital modulation, in performance across datasets of varying resolutions. Notably, both Quad-DeepSC and Quad-LIC exhibit minimal latency, rendering them well-suited for deployment in real-time wireless communication systems."

In particular, edge-device co-inference, which jointly executes LAIM inference across edge devices and servers, has emerged as a promising strategy for resource-efficient LAIM execution in wireless networks. In this paper, we investigate a pruning-aware LAIM co-inference scheme, where a pre-trained LAIM is pruned and partitioned into on-device and on-server sub-models for deployment. For analysis, we first prove that the LAIM output distortion is upper bounded by its parameter distortion. Then, we derive a lower bound on the parameter distortion via rate-distortion theory, analytically capturing the relationship between pruning ratio and co-inference performance. Next, based on the analytical results, we formulate an LAIM co-inference distortion bound minimization problem by jointly optimizing the pruning ratio, split point, transmit power, and computation frequency under system latency, energy, and available resource constraints. Moreover, we propose an efficient algorithm to tackle the considered highly non-convex problem. Finally, extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design. In particular, model parameter distortion is shown to provide a reliable bound on output distortion. Also, the proposed joint design achieves superior performance in balancing trade-offs among inference performance, system latency, and energy consumption compared with various benchmark schemes."

This paper presents an enhanced three-level operational optimization (ETLOM) framework that leverages refined IDR and coordinates three key agents-independent system operators (ISOs), energy service providers (ESPs), and demand-side users (DSUs)-to support low-carbon MES operation. At the system level, a dynamic optimal energy flow module for ISOs is developed with enhanced dynamic energy-carbon signals (DECSs) to simultaneously track energy usage and carbon emissions. At the aggregation level, multi-hub optimization modules for ESPs are constructed to capture inter-hub coupling and operational constraints. At the user level, a refined IDR responsiveness module is proposed, which accounts for the spatio-temporal heterogeneous characteristics (STHCs) of diverse DSUs. The STHC matrix is extracted and trained through a data-driven approach to reflect realistic behavioral and load variation patterns. For the first time, DECSs are embedded into both the refined IDR formulation and the objective functions of ESPs, enabling carbon-aware and responsiveness-enhanced scheduling. Case studies validate that the proposed ETLOM significantly outperforms conventional models in economic efficiency, carbon footprint reduction, and demand-side flexibility responsiveness."

Multiply-accumulate (MAC) is considered a <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">de</i> facto unit operation in NNs. By leveraging the inherent parallel processing capabilities of CiM, NNs that require numerous MAC operations can be executed more efficiently. This is further facilitated by storing the weights in SRAM, reducing the need for extensive data movement and enhancing overall computational speed and efficiency. Traditional CiM architectures execute MAC operations in the analog domain, employing an Analog-to-Digital converter (ADC) to convert the analog MAC values into digital outputs. However, these ADCs introduce a significant increase in area and power consumption, as well as introduce non-linearities. This work proposes a resonant time-domain compute-in-memory (TDC-CiM) architecture that eliminates the need for an ADC by using a time-to-digital converter (TDC) to digitize analog MAC results with lower power and area cost. A dedicated 8T SRAM cell enables reliable bitwise MAC operations, while the readout uses a 4-bit TDC with pulse-shrinking delay elements, achieving 1 GS/s sampling with a power consumption of only 1.25 mW. In addition, a weight-stationary data mapping strategy combined with an automated SRAM macro selection algorithm enables scalable and energy-efficient deployment across CNN workloads. Evaluation across six CNN models shows that the algorithm reduces inference energy consumption by up to 8× when scaling SRAM size from 32 KB to 256 KB, while maintaining minimal accuracy loss after quantization. The feasibility of the proposed architecture is validated on an 8 KB SRAM memory array using TSMC 28 nm technology. The proposed TDC-CiM architecture demonstrates a throughput of 320 GOPS with an energy efficiency of 38.46 TOPS/W."

A parallel multi-attention module (PMAM) is introduced in the improved YOLOv10 framework to enhance computational efficiency and detection performance. To reconstruct HDR images, we enhance the Asynchronous Kalman Filtering (AKF) algorithm to improve image detail quality. We introduce BNN and CVAE into the AKF algorithm to reduce noise effects and improve the logarithmic intensity of the reconstructed image. The BNN estimates noise covariance, thereby reducing its impact during the reconstruction process. Simultaneously, the CVAE leverages polarity as a conditional input, and uses spatial and temporal information through a CVAE to generate more accurate logarithmic image intensities. In the object detection stage, we integrate a parallel module combining the self-attention mechanism and the ECA module to improve training efficiency without increasing the number of parameters. This PMAM module, based on improved YOLOv10, strengthens the model’s ability to capture global and channel-specific features. Finally, the proposed method’s accuracy and robustness are validated through extensive simulations and comparative experiments.

However, due to the characteristics of high dimensionality, non-stationarity, and complex cross-variable and cross-scale features of time series data, existing deep learning methods have problems such as insufficient modelling capabilities and complex calculations in the field of time series prediction. In order to address the aforementioned issues, this paper puts forward the Dynamic Inverted Transformer with Mamba-Cross-Variable Linear Attention (DIMformer), a dynamic inverted Transformer that introduces Mamba-Cross-Variable Linear Attention (MCLA) and DynamicTanh (DYT). DIMformer is a method that embeds each sequence independently as a token. It enhances the model’s long-range dependency modelling capability through the MCLA module while reducing the model’s computational complexity. At the same time, the learnable DynamicTanh scaling is used in the encoder to normalize the input dynamics, accelerate model convergence, suppress time series noise, and improve the stability of model training and prediction accuracy. Concurrently, experimental findings with DIMformer on seven authentic multivariate data sets demonstrate its superiority to prevailing advanced time series prediction models. This is evidenced by the model’s stable and efficient prediction capabilities, which offer an effective solution for non-stationary multivariate time series prediction. Moreover, these results provide novel insights for future research on Transformer models of complex time series."

Rare-earth permanent magnets enable compact and high-performance designs but face issues of high cost and supply-chain vulnerability, motivating research on magnet-saving structures. One candidate is the consequent-pole topology, which significantly lowers magnet usage but inherently suffers from asymmetric magnetic fields that cause back-EMF distortion, torque pulsation, and demagnetization concerns. To address these drawbacks, this study introduces an intersect-type rotor configuration in which N and S poles are arranged symmetrically along the axial direction. While this configuration improves magnetic balance and suppresses torque ripple and cogging, it introduces axial leakage that reduces average torque and increases eddy-current losses. A dedicated rotor-gap design and a three-dimensional magnetic equivalent-circuit model are therefore developed to accurately capture axial flux paths with drastically lower computational burden compared to full 3-D finite-element analysis. Optimization of magnet geometry, demagnetization assessment, and loss evaluation are performed, followed by fabrication and testing of a V-shaped prototype. The proposed configuration achieves a 31.8% reduction in magnet material, a 51.3% decrease in cogging torque, and a 3.41%p reduction in torque ripple while maintaining the same output characteristics as a conventional design, demonstrating its potential as a high-efficiency and cost-effective alternative.

For this system, a dynamic user-centric task offloading scheme is designed to provide seamless and efficient computation services for users. Based on this scheme, the joint optimization of user-centric AP clustering, edge server selection, communication and computation resources is formulated as a long-term problem to minimize the average energy consumption. The formulated problem is complicated non-convex due to the highly coupled time-varying discrete and continuous variables, resulting in high complexity and non-real-time to obtain the optimal solution. To tackle this challenging problem, we propose a multi-layer hierarchical multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (ML-HMADRL) based resource allocation algorithm. Specifically, the proposed algorithm incorporates a hierarchical structure with high, middle, and low-level agents that iteratively train the actor-critic networks to obtain discrete and continuous variables of the formulated problem. To further enhance the training effectiveness by leveraging the CF-MEC system, we design distinct actor-critic networks for the agents at different levels to facilitate centralized training and distributed execution. Simulation results validate the training stability of the proposed algorithm at each level, and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over benchmark schemes in terms of the average energy consumption, providing a stable distributed framework for practical implementation in dynamic environments."

Federated learning (FL) offers a promising solution by enabling distributed model training across multiple nodes, aligning well with the decentralized nature of modern networks. However, applying FL to spatiotemporal cellular traffic prediction is challenging due to the substantial communication overhead in distributed learning. To address this, we propose LFedSG, a lightweight FL framework incorporating subgraph partitioning for spatiotemporal traffic prediction. LFedSG supports collaborative training while preserving inter-client dependencies critical for accurate prediction. Communication efficiency is achieved by focusing on essential model parameters, while subgraph partitioning and spatiotemporal graph convolutional networks (STGCN) enhance spatial and temporal correlation modeling. An adaptive transmission weight pruning strategy further reduces communication and computation costs. Extensive experiments on the Telecom Italia and Pems07 datasets demonstrate that LFedSG achieves higher predictive accuracy than traditional methods, with significant reductions in communication overhead and training time, validating its effectiveness and scalability for large-scale mobile network environments."

    "abstract": "Vision transformer (ViT) has recently demonstrated remarkable performance in fine-grained visual classification (FGVC). However, most existing ViT-based methods often overlook the varied focus of different attention heads, in which heads that attend to nondiscriminative regions would dilute the discriminative signal crucial for FGVC. To address such issues, we propose a novel adaptive attention quantization transformer (A<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>QTrans) for FGVC to select the key discriminative features by analyzing the heads’ attention, which comprises three key modules: the adaptive quantization selection (AQS) module, the background elimination (BE) module, and the dynamic hybrid optimization (DHO) module. Specifically, the AQS module dynamically selects the most discriminative features in a data-driven manner by quantizing the attention scores across multiple attention heads with a global, learnable threshold. This process effectively filters out generally irrelevant information from nondiscriminative tokens, thus concentrating attention on important regions. To address the nondifferentiability inherent in updating this threshold during binarization, our AQS module employs a straight-through estimator (STE) for discrete optimization, enabling end-to-end gradient backpropagation. In addition, we utilize the prior that background regions usually do not contain meaningful information, and design the BE module to further calibrate the focus of the attention heads to the main objects in images. Finally, the DHO module adaptively optimizes and integrates the attentive results of the AQS and BE modules to achieve optimal classification performance. Extensive experiments conducted on four challenging FGVC benchmark datasets and three ViT variants demonstrate A<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>QTrans’s superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results.

    "abstract": "As the brain-like intelligence develops rapidly, it is urgent to design a more convenient and efficient control framework to cope with the challenge of processing multisensory signals in parallel. Therefore, a multisensory memristive circuit with dual adaptive, parallel processing, and multilevel reinforcement features is proposed. The circuit is mainly composed of modules for receptors, STM and LTM, attention, environmental monitoring and mutual associative memory. Automatic encoding of different sensorial signals is realised by the receptor modules. Dual adaptive regulation of the internal associative memory and external environmental changes on the circuit is implemented by modules of attention and environmental monitoring. Multilevel reinforcement memory is achieved through the interconnection of multiple dimensional features of the same objects. The process of encoding transformation of stimuli, experience memory, and feedback learning is automatically achieved in the brain-inspired neural network structure, which avoids the problems such as encoding difficulties during the conversion of the operating objects, and enables the realization of more brain-like intelligence. The circuit is applied to gripping and recognizing in robotic arms and the scenario memory of different production lines is simulated, which is promising for application in automated factories."

    "abstract": "Autonomous racing requires fast, anticipatory, and interaction-aware trajectory planning, where the ego vehicle must interpret complex track geometries while reasoning about the future behavior of multiple competitive agents. Existing approaches typically treat static and dynamic obstacles separately or rely heavily on global perception, limiting their robustness and scalability in realistic multi-agent racing environments. This work presents a unified prediction–planning framework that jointly addresses static and dynamic challenges through three key mechanisms. First, a grid-based track discretization and static risk field are constructed to model proximity to boundaries and fixed obstacles through smooth spatial potentials, enabling efficient safety-aware path shaping. Second, an interaction-aware prediction module based on Mean Field Games (MFG) captures the collective, density-driven behavior of surrounding vehicles, providing anticipatory and rational multi-agent motion forecasts. Third, these components are integrated into a hierarchical trajectory optimizer using piecewise-jerk quadratic programming (PJPO) for path and speed planning, followed by spline smoothing to ensure continuity and dynamic feasibility. Extensive evaluations across nine racetrack segments and diverse dynamic obstacle configurations demonstrate that the proposed planner achieves superior collision avoidance, smoother trajectories, and improved lap times compared to MPC, RRT*, and A*+Profiling baselines. The results confirm the framework’s strong generalization to both static and multi-agent dynamic environments, highlighting its suitability for real-time, high-speed autonomous racing."

    "abstract": "The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources and the integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) have significantly increased the stochastic nature of modern industrial smart grids (ISG). Efficient demand-side management requires a robust and adaptive approach to dynamically respond to uncertainties in the energy supply and demand. This study introduces a Demand Follower Model (DFM) tailored for stochastic ISG environments, leveraging a Quantum-Enhanced Proximal Policy Optimization (Q-PPO) algorithm on a simulated, noise-free ibmq_qasm_simulator environment to achieve optimal energy management. Unlike conventional demand response mechanisms, the proposed model operates in real-time and, continuously adapts to volatile network conditions and stochastic load variations. The Q-PPO algorithm improves the learning efficiency and decision-making by integrating quantum-inspired principles, leading to a fast convergence rate and reduced computational complexity. The proposed model was tested on various stochastic grid scenarios, considering network uncertainties, dynamic pricing, and fluctuating generation. The experimental results demonstrated that Q-PPO significantly outperforms classical reinforcement learning (RL) methods in achieving efficient supply-demand variations control, voltage profile enhancement, frequency control, minimizing energy costs, and maintaining grid stability. This study provides a novel framework for next-generation ISGs, enabling intelligent and efficient energy utilization in highly uncertain environments."

    "abstract": "Navigating in environments with both static obstacles and dense crowds of pedestrians using low-cost sensors and lightweight controllers is crucial for the widespread application of mobile robots, where the key challenge is the localization and tracking of dynamic obstacles using only sensor readings. To address this, a lightweight encoder architecture based only on 2D LiDAR and with a spatiotemporal representation, namely spatiotemporal Dynamic Augmented LiDAR Encoder(DARE), is presented to detect and encode dynamic obstacles for obstacle avoidance. Spatially, we use supervised signals of collision risk in simulation to augment the identification and risk estimation of dynamic obstacles in reality. Temporally, we establish a comprehension of state transition dynamics and implicit dynamic obstacle tracking via predictions of future states and rewards. This architecture can be conveniently integrated into existing reinforcement learning frameworks such as SAC as a plug-in for holistic navigation policy optimization. Extensive experiments across a variety of dynamic scenarios, including real-world deployments, demonstrate our method's robustness and outstanding performance in dynamic and crowded environments compared to state-of-the-art approaches."

In this paper, we propose BVSR-EvD, leveraging event cameras and diffusion models to boost blurry video space-time super-resolution. Specifically, we identify three distinct data priors from event-video dual modalities: motion prior from events, content prior from videos, and physical prior from their integration, contributing to temporal stability, content preservation, and detail enhancement respectively. To effectively utilize these data priors, BVSR-EvD creates the Trident Diffusion Model (Trident-DM), which decomposes each denoising step into trident decoupling and adaptive self-composition stages. The former employs single-modal and dual-modal meta-networks to extract the three unique data priors, while the latter dynamically integrates them through learned prior-aware weight maps. BVSR-EvD achieves up to ×8 spatial super-resolution and ×64 temporal super-resolution from blurry videos, surpassing existing methods on public video datasets."

However, the integration of wideband THz signals with ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (UM-MIMO) arrays introduces dual wideband effects (delay squint and beam squint) and spatial non-stationarity (SNS) alongside challenges such as line-of-sight (LoS) blockage, which degrade channel estimation accuracy and system performance. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">gridless iterative atomic norm minimization</i> (GI-ANM)-based channel estimator (CE), formulating a convex optimization framework that operates in the continuous parameter space, enabling joint estimation of delays, frequency-dependent gains, and angular variations, effectively handles dual wideband effects and SNS. By eliminating grid mismatch errors inherent in conventional compressed sensing methods, such as orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP), generalized simultaneous OMP, and sparse Bayesian learning, the proposed CE achieves superior accuracy and robustness under 100% LoS blockage, SNS, and dual wideband effects, even in low signal-to-noise ratio environments. Simulation results demonstrate significant improvements in normalized mean square error (NMSE) and bit error rate (BER) performance for THz UM-MIMO systems compared to state-of-the-art methods, including in joint subcarrier correlation and the near-field scenario. The proposed GI-ANM-based CE offers a scalable, high-performance solution for advancing reliable and efficient ultra-wideband THz UM-MIMO systems in 6G networks."

To exploit this characteristic, this paper proposes a dual-mode fast charger for supercapacitors that utilizes both continuous and fine-tuned pulse currents by modifying the conventional forward converter. Specifically, the proposed charger introduces two energy storage capacitors to tune the rising and falling edges of the pulse current, respectively. By establishing and maintaining relatively high voltages on the two capacitors, the pulse rising and falling processes are significantly accelerated and the charging time is shortened. To evaluate the proposed charger, a prototype is designed and implemented, which is then used to charge a 12 V/1.5 F supercapacitor module from 4 to 8 V. The charging times are 1.68 and 2.04 s when the prototype is configured to operate in the dual-mode and the continuous current mode, respectively. Therefore, the charging time is reduced by 17.6%.

    "abstract": "An open question recently posed by Fawzi and Ferme [IEEE Transactions on Information Theory 2024], asks whether non-signaling (NS) assistance can increase the capacity of a broadcast channel (BC). We answer this question in the affirmative, by showing that for a certain <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">K</i>-receiver BC model, called Coordinated Multipoint broadcast (CoMP BC) that arises naturally in wireless networks, NS-assistance provides multiplicative gains in both capacity and degrees of freedom (DoF), even achieving <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">K</i>-fold improvements in extremal cases. Somewhat surprisingly, this is shown to be true even for 2-receiver broadcast channels that are semi-deterministic and/or degraded.

A fixed and globally known connectivity matrix specifies for each transmit antenna, the subset of receivers that are connected to (have a non-zero channel coefficient to) that antenna. Besides the connectivity, there is no channel state information at the transmitter. The receivers have perfect channel knowledge. We show that NS-assistance has no DoF advantage in a fully connected CoMP BC. The DoF region is fully characterized for a class of connectivity patterns associated with tree graphs, for which the classical sum-DoF value is shown to be the number of leaf nodes, while the NS-assisted sum-DoF value is the total number of all (non-root) nodes. For arbitrary connectivity patterns, the sum-capacity with NS-assistance is bounded above and below by the min-rank and triangle number of the connectivity matrix, respectively, leading to matching bounds in many cases, e.g., if min(<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">B</i>,<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">K</i>) ≤ 6. While translations to Gaussian settings are demonstrated, for simplicity most of our results are presented under noise-free, finite-field (F<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><i>q</i></sub>) models. Converse proofs for classical DoF are found by adapting the Aligned Images bounds to the finite field model. Converse bounds for NS-assisted DoF/capacity extend the same-marginals property to the BC with NS-assistance available to all parties. Beyond the BC setting, even stronger (unbounded) gains in capacity due to NS-assistance are established for certain ‘communication with side-information’ settings, such as the fading dirty paper channel."

    "abstract": "This study investigates the impact of extreme heat on corporate social responsibility (CSR) performance. Drawing on firm-level panel data of Chinese A-share listed firms from 2010 to 2019, we employ a two-way fixed-effects model to empirically test our hypotheses, complemented by robustness checks using alternative extreme heat definitions, extended samples with multiple CSR measures, and instrumental-variable (IV) estimation to ensure the rigor of our results. The analysis yields four key findings. First, extreme heat significantly reduces overall CSR performance, with the impact concentrated in environmental, employee, and supply-chain responsibilities, whereas shareholder and social-contribution dimensions remain largely unaffected. Second, the reduction in CSR is more pronounced among state-owned enterprises (SOEs) than non-SOEs, likely reflecting their broader social obligations that divert resources away from CSR under climate stress. Third, the mediation analysis indicates that this reduction is driven primarily by extreme heat's adverse effect on financial performance, which forces firms to reallocate resources toward short-term survival rather than CSR. Finally, organizational slack and stronger environmental regulation mitigate the negative impact of extreme heat, while green innovation alleviates these effects only when pursued through sustained, long-term efforts, highlighting the importance of cumulative investment in innovation-driven resilience. These findings contribute to the understanding of how persistent climate shocks reshape corporate responsibility strategies and provide actionable insights for policymakers and firms to balance financial pressures with sustainability goals."

The relay is oblivious, in the sense that it has no knowledge of the channel codebook used in transmission. Previous works on oblivious relaying focus on characterizing achievable rates. In this work, we study error exponents and explore connections to lossless source coding with a helper, also known as the Wyner-Ahlswede-Körner (WAK) problem. We first establish an achievable error exponent for oblivious relaying under constant compositions codes. A key feature of our analysis is the use of the type covering lemma to design the relay’s compress-forward scheme. We then show that employing constant composition code ensembles does not improve the rates achieved with their IID counterparts. We also derive a sphere packing upper bound for the error exponent. In the second part of this paper, we establish a connection between the information bottleneck channel and the WAK problem. We show that good codes for the latter can be produced through permuting codes designed for the former. This is accomplished by revisiting Ahlswede’s covering lemma, and extending it to achieve simultaneous covering of a type class by several distinct sets using the same sequence of permutations. We then apply our approach to attain the best known achievable error exponent for the WAK problem, previously established by Kelly and Wagner. As a byproduct of our derivations, we also establish error exponents and achievable rates under mismatched decoding rules."

    "abstract": "Scatterplots are widely used across various domains to identify anomalies in datasets, particularly in multi-class settings, such as detecting misclassified or mislabeled data. However, scatterplot effectiveness often declines with large datasets due to limited display resolution. This paper introduces a novel Visual Quality Measure (VQM) – OM4AnI (Overlap Measure for Anomaly Identification) – which quantifies the degree of overlap for identifying anomalies, helping users estimate how effectively anomalies can be observed in multi-class scatterplots. OM4AnI begins by computing anomaly index based on each data point's position relative to its class cluster. The scatterplot is then discretized into a matrix representation by binning the display space into cell-level (pixel-level) grids and computing the coverage for each pixel. It takes into account the anomaly index of data points covering these pixels and visual features (marker shapes, marker sizes, and rendering orders). Building on this foundation, we sum all the coverage information in each cell (pixel) of matrix representation to obtain the final quality score with respect to anomaly identification. We conducted an evaluation to analyze the efficiency, effectiveness, sensitivity of OM4AnI in comparison with six representative baseline methods that are based on different computation granularity levels: data level, marker level, and pixel level. The results show that OM4AnI outperforms baseline methods by exhibiting more monotonic trends against the ground truth and greater sensitivity to rendering order, unlike the baseline methods. It confirms that OM4AnI can inform users about how effectively their scatterplots support anomaly identification. Overall, OM4AnI shows strong potential as an evaluation metric and for optimizing scatterplots through automatic adjustment of visual parameters."

    "abstract": "Lysine crotonylation (Kcr) is an important protein modification occurring after translation in biology, serving an essential function in a range of biological processes in both plants and animals, including the regulation of gene expression, the maintenance of cellular metabolic balance, and the enhancement of photosynthesis. Exploring the detection of Kcr sites is essential for uncovering their biological functions. Nonetheless, conventional experimental approaches for detection are often time-consuming, expensive, and hindered by various technical constraints, making the precise identification of Kcr sites a significant challenge. This study seeks to develop a computational approach for the rapid and accurate prediction of Kcr sites in plant non-histone proteins. We introduce a novel deep learning framework named DeepNhKcr, which integrates the protein language model (ESM2) with a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network. To address the challenge of data imbalance, the model replaces the conventional cross-entropy loss with the focal loss function. In addition, DeepNhKcr combines advanced deep learning approaches with traditional protein encoding strategies to enable effective feature extraction and integration. This method not only significantly boosts the accuracy of predicting Kcr sites in non-histone proteins of plants. but also provides interpretability, shedding light on the potential links between key sequence characteristics and their biological roles. DeepNhKcr delivers outstanding results, surpassing existing machine learning and deep learning models, and demonstrating excellent performance in both five-fold cross-validation and independent test experiments. Moreover, the model integrates interpretability analysis techniques to investigate the connections between important sequence features and their biological roles. DeepNhKcr acts as a powerful method for detecting Kcr sites in plant non-histone proteins and is anticipated to greatly advance future studies in plant Kcr site prediction.

Past methods for fluoride detection have largely been labor-intensive, time-consuming, and incapable of being monitored in real time. Current development in this area has now led to the evolution of IoT-integrated smart sensors that aid real-time, accurate, and efficient monitoring of fluoride levels in water. This review covers their features in extensive detail, regarding integration in optical sensing mechanisms of nanomaterials and applying sensor fusion techniques for improving detection accuracy and sensitivity. This paper presents an analysis of some aspects, such as sensor calibration methods, wireless data transmission techniques, and power efficiency. Standards like water quality index, wireless sensor networks, and water quality monitoring systems have also been discussed in-depth, security protocols and encryption methods also discussed to safeguard data integrity and reliability. In addressing existing technical challenges, this review aims to provide in water quality monitoring with motives to produce more advanced and useful smart sensing solutions. Their integration into Internet of Things(IoT) platforms renders these sensors as highly promising for real-time monitoring and data analytics, thereby piloting in a vast change in the water quality management scenario.

    "abstract": "Multimodal transport refers to multiple transportation means (e.g., car, plane) that can be used to transport people or goods. Classifying the mode of transportation can have multiple usages towards sustainable transport solutions, such as optimizing routes, reducing transit times, having efficient logistics operations, reducing transportation costs by strategically combining different modes, or understanding how people move within cities for migration studies. Multimodal transport classification has traditionally relied on data collected from various movement sensors (e.g., accelerometers, pedometers, gyroscopes); yet, with the opening of the access to raw Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) data on mobile devices, new avenues of multimodal analysis have been created, when GNSS signals alone (without additional sensors) could be used to classify the mode of transport. This paper introduces a novel RINEX-based framework for multimodal transport classification that operates exclusively on instantaneous raw GNSS observables, without relying on position estimates or auxiliary motion sensors. Unlike traditional approaches that require at least four satellites for positioning, the proposed method achieves classification using data from as little as one strongest satellite in view. By leveraging machine -learning algorithms, transportation modes are inferred directly from single differences and double differences of pseudorange, Doppler, and carrier-to-noise ratio features extracted from raw RINEX data. The framework was validated using an extensive dataset collected from 18 volunteers across five European countries, using 409 tracks and ten transportation modes. The results show that accurate and stable classification is possible even with limited satellite visibility, demonstrating the feasibility of low-power, privacy-preserving, and geometry-aware mobility analytics based solely on raw GNSS measurements."

    "abstract": "Most existing studies lack a comprehensive comparison and evaluation of different energy management strategies (EMS) in real-world driving scenarios. To address this, an integrated optimization approach is proposed that combines lane-change strategies with EMSs for hydrogen fuel cell hybrid electric vehicles in complex traffic environments. First, a lane-change model based on the λ-Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm is constructed, incorporating safety constraints to improve driving safety and efficiency. Second, an EMS based on the Multi-Agent Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm is designed, achieving coordinated optimization control between the fuel cell system and the battery system using the developed Fuel Cell Hybrid Electric Vehicles (FCHEVs) model. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed optimization method outperforms traditional methods in driving safety, energy efficiency, and system stability. The proposed lane-change strategy reduces the collision rate to 2.0%, and the EMS excels in power distribution, reducing equivalent hydrogen consumption by an average of 1.01% compared to other strategies, significantly enhancing the economy of FCHEVs. Furthermore, additional comparative simulations conducted between scenarios with and without lane-changing behavior indicate that the proposed collaborative strategy improves overall traffic efficiency by 10.96%, with only a marginal 1.08% increase in hydrogen consumption."

    "abstract": "Eye-tracking technology provides an estimate of where a person is looking and is essential for understanding individual attention and the psychological functions within the cognitive system. It can aid in understanding neurodevelopmental disorders and tracing a person’s identity. However, this technology poses a significant privacy risk, as it captures sensitive information about individuals and increases the likelihood that their data can be traced back to them. This paper proposes a human-centered two-phased framework to prevent identity backtracking while preserving the pedagogical benefits of AI-powered eye-tracking in interactive learning environments. We first demonstrate the potential for backtracking student IDs and diagnoses in various scenarios using serious game-based eye-tracking data. We then provide a two-stage privacy-preserving framework that prevents participants from being tracked while still enabling diagnostic classification. The first phase covers four scenarios: I) predicting disorder diagnoses based on different game levels, II) predicting student IDs based on different game levels, III) predicting student IDs based on randomized data, and IV) utilizing K-Means for out-of-sample data. In the second phase, we present a two-phase framework that preserves privacy. We also employ Federated Learning (FL) across multiple clients, incorporating a secure identity management system with dummy IDs and administrator-only access controls. In the first phase, the proposed framework achieved 99.3% accuracy in scenario 1, 63% in scenario 2, and 99.7% in scenario 3, and successfully identified and assigned a new student ID in scenario 4. In phase 2, we effectively prevented backtracking and established a secure identity management system with dummy IDs and administrator-only access controls, achieving an overall accuracy of 99.40%. Our dual-layer anonymization scheme aligns with the GDPR’s principles of data minimization and purpose limitation, providing a foundational privacy protection mechanism for federated learning in educational settings. While it does not ensure full regulatory compliance, our approach illustrates how federated architectures can incorporate privacy-by-design principles to limit re-identification risks. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the architectural feasibility of our framework, achieving accuracy rates ranging from 63.03% to 99.73% across various scenarios. However, the extreme variability in performance and a small sample size (n=9) suggest significant overfitting. Consequently, the findings need large-scale validation to confirm their generalizability."

    "abstract": "Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved remarkable progress in the field of medical image segmentation (MIS), but it still faces two main challenges. First, the consistency learning employed in existing semi-supervised MIS (SSMIS) methods is mainly restricted to a single perturbation or a simple combination of multiple perturbations, which limits their abilities to effectively exploit the potential information from unlabeled medical images. Second, although some SSMIS methods make full use of the significant structural differences between CNN and Transformer networks for model perturbation, which causes a new conflict in that a Transformer network usually requires a large amount of labeled data for model training but only a small amount of labeled data is provided to SSMIS. In this paper, a novel fully perturbed self-ensemble framework (FPSE) using cascaded parallel CNN-Transformer is proposed to address the aforementioned problems. First, we present a fully perturbed consistency learning strategy that empowers the framework to handle complex variations through the skillful synergy of data, model, and feature perturbations, effectively exploring the potential information from unlabeled medical images. Second, we design a novel strategy of model perturbation based on the cascaded parallel CNN-Transformer structure, which maximizes the efficacy of Transformer under limited labeled data since Transformer is operated on the shallow local features extracted by CNN, thus effectively alleviating the requirement of a large number of labeled data for the proposed network architecture. Experiments demonstrate that our FPSE framework achieves remarkable results, outperforming the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by 11.5%, 0.7% and 2.4% in Dice score when labeled data accounts for only 5% (ACDC), 5% (AbdomenCT-1K) and 1% (ISIC2018), respectively.

Existing methods often rely on dense fusion or naive feature stacking, inflating compute and memory, yielding poorly calibrated probabilities, and training brittleness under occlusion and long-tail categories. We propose PRISM-Occ, a dual-level sparse Mixture-of-Experts framework for multi-modal BEV occupancy. A path-routed hierarchical router (PRHR) with Sparse Top-K activates only a compact set of experts within and across modalities, reducing parameter count while sharpening specialization. A heteroscedastic occupancy head predicts a spatial temperature map to improve calibration, and a simple prior adjustment with a staged hard-sample schedule stabilizes training under occlusion and rare classes. On Occ3D-nuScenes and SurroundOcc, PRISM-Occ achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and better-calibrated probabilities using single-scale 256× 704 inputs and fixed, lower-resolution backbones, delivering a stronger accuracy–efficiency trade-off with reduced parameters and comparable runtime memory."

    "abstract": "Monitoring grasslands over the phenological season in the alpine environment using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) backscatter data requires innovative approaches that can combine domain-specific ancillary information with advanced deep learning techniques. Alpine grasslands are characterized by complex topography, seasonal variations, and heterogeneous agricultural management, making traditional monitoring methods less effective. The Leaf Area Index (LAI) can generally be used to study the above ground biomass of grasslands, which is estimated rapidly and accurately from the Sentinel-2 multispectral data. However, the frequent unavailability of cloud-free imagery poses a significant challenge, creating temporal gaps. To address this limitation, there is growing interest in incorporating Sentinel-1 SAR backscatter data to perform temporal gap-filling, enhancing the temporal resolution of grassland LAI derived from Sentinel-2 and enabling continuous monitoring of grasslands throughout the growing season. In this paper, we propose a domain-specific transformer-based convolutional network that extracts features from SAR data and its derivatives to capture long-range dependencies, and we preliminarily investigate its application to temporal gap-filling of Sentinel-2 LAI. The effectiveness of the proposed method for predicting LAI has been validated by testing it against Sentinel-2-derived LAI. In the results, we achieved an <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R</i><sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> around 0.59 on the test sets, between the related predicted LAI and Sentinel-2 LAI."

    "abstract": "This letter focuses on a formulation of Model Predictive Control (MPC) with an optimal control problem (OCP) defined by hard input constraints and soft state and terminal set constraints. The soft constraints are accounted for as relaxed barrier function terms in the objective function. The proposed MPC is feasible for any state vector and, assuming the input constraint set is simple (e.g. a hyperrectangle), leads to anytime feasible formulations. A theoretical description of the MPC scheme is conducted. Among other results, asymptotic stability of the proposed MPC is proven and a region of attraction (RoA) estimate is derived. Moreover, stability guarantees when performing a limited number of optimization iterations are also derived. Numerical results showcase the benefit of considering the input constraints directly in the OCP instead of saturating the output of an unconstrained OCP with relaxed barrier functions, as was previously done in the literature."

In this work, a differential 3-transistor–2-resistor (3T2R) PCM cell is evaluated, which enhances read robustness through differential comparison while maintaining a compact layout.

By appropriately combining matrix blocks from small CDCs and rank-metric codes, we introduce three inserting constructions based on the mixed dimension construction. Furthermore, the mixed dimension construction and these inserting constructions are improved by the multilevel construction that is based on lifting rank-restricted Ferrers diagram rank-metric codes. Our constructions yield some new lower bounds for CDCs, which are superior to the previously best-known ones."

    "abstract": "The graph neural networks (GNNs) have drawn much attention for predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) due to their excellent performance in processing correlation relationship among data. Spatio-temporal evolution information and spatial correlation are key factors in the bearing degradation process. Multi–graph structures can comprehensively leverage the spatial correlation and temporal evolution characteristics inherent in different graph topologies to extract multi–scale spatio–temporal information. In this paper, a new graph isomorphism network (GIN-GIG) based on graph framework in graph is proposed to predict bearing RUL. Firstly, the feature spatial graph is constructed according to the correlation coefficients between the optimal features. Its output is used as the node feature of the new temporal path graph. The graph-in-graph (GIG) framework is constructed by embedding and fusing the feature spatial graphs and the temporal path graphs. Then, the graph isomorphism network (GIN) is established to capture the spatial information in the first-hierarchy spatial graph and the local temporal information in the second-hierarchy temporal path graph. Meanwhile, the self-attention mechanism is introduced to achieve adaptive hierarchical fusion of GIN output, so as to enrich the feature information. Finally, the time convolution network (TCN) is established to further extract the global temporal information for performing the RUL prediction. The effectiveness and superiority of the GIN-GIG method is validated using the PHM2012 and IMS bearing datasets, and some comparative experiments have been performed to show its advantage for the RUL prediction."

The model integrates photovoltaic (PV), wind, and battery energy storage system (BESS) plants to ensure stable and reliable electrolyzer (ELY) operation under variable RE generation conditions. A new degradation model for lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries that incorporates both cycling and calendar aging mechanisms is proposed. The model is specifically tailored to high-power industrial BESS containers using real-world data from manufacturers. This model improves the accuracy of BESS lifecycle evaluation over the entire operational period of the project. In addition, an ELY degradation model is incorporated into the PtX operational framework. Sensitivity analysis of RE plant sizing shows that the plants must be oversized to minimize the levelized cost of H<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub> (LCOH), which can result in a substantial amount of curtailed RE power. The study further examines various BESS operating philosophies and grid connection modes to assess their effects on system performance, component lifecycles, and the LCOH. The results indicate that adopting different BESS operating philosophies can reduce the LCOH by 1.60% and 1.28% in on-grid and off-grid modes, respectively. The findings offer valuable insights and a simulation framework for the techno-economic feasibility, scheduling, operation, and long-term planning of large-scale PtX projects."

However, higher speed poses a challenge to the structural integrity of the rotor, as the centrifugal force acting on the rotor increases quadratically with speed. This high stress may lead to failure in the rotor ribs and bridges of an Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine (IPMSM). This paper presents a high-speed rotor strain measurement experimental setup that uses strain gauges and a telemetry system to measure strain at critical locations of the IPMSM rotor up to 18,000 rpm. Strain measurements are conducted at both room and high temperature to emulate the operating conditions of a high-speed machine. The measured strain is then correlated with the results of the finite element analysis strain to evaluate the fidelity of the rotor stress model. Also, the effect of anisotropic mechanical properties of electric steel on rotor strain is investigated."

However, their large-scale deployment in distributed power systems with high renewable energy penetration is constrained by high capital costs and maintenance complexity. To address this limitation, a virtual synchronous condenser control strategy is proposed for grid-connected renewable energy inverters. The method enables these inverters to emulate the field-forcing characteristics of SCs, thereby providing effective transient voltage support at the point of common coupling (PCC) during the fault recovery period phase, while simultaneously suppressing transient overvoltage at the onset of recovery. A mathematical model capturing the internal electromotive force (EMF) dynamics of SCs is developed, and practical control laws are derived for direct implementation in inverters. Through phasor-domain analysis, the transient voltage support capability is analytically characterized, and the physical significance of key control parameters is elucidated. Experimental validation under various grid fault scenarios is conducted, confirming the effectiveness and safety of the proposed strategy."

For example, in biomedical research, uncovering meaningful patterns in physiological signals can improve diagnosis, risk assessment, and patient outcomes. However, existing methods for time series pattern discovery face major challenges, including high computational complexity, limited interpretability, and difficulty in capturing meaningful temporal structures. To address these gaps, we introduce a novel learning framework that jointly trains two Transformer models using complementary time series representations: shapelet-based representations to capture localized temporal structures and traditional feature engineering to encode statistical properties. The learned shapelets serve as interpretable signatures that differentiate time series across classification labels. Additionally, we develop a visual analytics system-SigTime-with coordinated views to facilitate exploration of time series signatures from multiple perspectives, aiding in useful insights generation. We quantitatively evaluate our learning framework on eight publicly available datasets and one proprietary clinical dataset. Additionally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our system through two usage scenarios along with the domain experts: one involving public ECG data and the other focused on preterm labor analysis."

However, the integration of these technologies in the context of UE mobility requires further investigation. This study optimizes CF mMIMO deployment in O-RAN by proposing a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach to maximize throughput while balancing the competing constraints of latency and handover costs. Compared to cellular, fixed, and ubiquitous baselines, the DRL model achieves 30% and 45% higher spectral efficiency, respectively. Furthermore, a 22% reduction in unnecessary handovers has been achieved by deploying the proposed DRL model. The results highlight significant implications for consumer electronics, enabling reliable connectivity in dense Internet of Things (IoT) and Augmented Reality (AR) environments through enhanced Quality of Experience (QoE)."

In this context, the influence maximization (IM) problem consists of identifying the most influential nodes in a given network, i.e., those able to spread information most effectively. This problem has practical relevance in a wide range of applications, and despite its underlying computational complexity, several solution techniques have been presented in the related literature. Nonetheless, bringing together technical feasibility and achieving satisfactory accuracy is still a challenging open research issue. This work addresses the IM problem through two complementary contributions. First, it analyzes two well-known influence diffusion models (DMs)—namely, the independent cascade (IC) and the linear threshold (LT) models—and introduces a new methodology for computing the influence spread (IS) within a given network. In addition, a novel approach is proposed for selecting an initial set of nodes that optimizes the spread of influence in large-scale scenarios. These techniques are applied to large-scale experiments in real-world scenarios, yielding results comparable to those of the best-performing state-of-the-art algorithms in a significantly shorter computational time."

This paper proposes a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that formulates the dynamic UAV deployment task as a centralized multi-input multi-output policy. Our method employs sequential action masking to guarantee multi-hop connectivity and enforce minimum distance constraints during UAV placement. The policy network integrates graph neural networks, residual convolutional layers, and feature-wise linear modulation to effectively capture spatial relations, inter-UAV interactions, and global and local network states. We validate our approach through extensive simulations across various user density scenarios, demonstrating significant improvements in coverage efficiency, fairness of coverage distribution, and flight energy reduction compared to strong baseline algorithms. Our proposed framework provides a comprehensive solution that simultaneously addresses dynamic user mobility, multi-hop connectivity, interference mitigation, and energy efficiency in UAV-assisted cellular networks."

    "abstract": "Expensive optimization problems (EOPs) present significant challenges for traditional evolutionary optimization due to their limited evaluation calls. Although surrogate-assisted search (SAS) has become a popular paradigm for addressing EOPs, it still suffers from the cold-start issue. In response to this challenge, knowledge transfer has been gaining popularity for its ability to leverage search experience from potentially related instances, ultimately facilitating head-start optimization for more efficient decision-making. However, the curse of negative transfer persists when applying knowledge transfer to EOPs, primarily due to the inherent limitations of existing methods in assessing knowledge transferability. On the one hand, a priori transferability assessment criteria are intrinsically inaccurate due to their imprecise understandings. On the other hand, a posteriori methods often necessitate sufficient observations to make correct inferences, rendering them inefficient when applied to EOPs. Considering the above, this paper introduces a Bayesian competitive knowledge transfer (BCKT) method developed to improve multi-task SAS (MSAS) when addressing multiple EOPs simultaneously. Specifically, the transferability of knowledge is estimated from a Bayesian perspective that accommodates both prior beliefs and empirical evidence, enabling accurate competition between inner-task and inter-task solutions, ultimately leading to the adaptive use of promising solutions while effectively suppressing inferior ones. The effectiveness of our method in boosting various SAS algorithms for both multi-task and many-task problems is empirically validated, complemented by comparative studies that demonstrate its superiority over peer algorithms and its applicability to real-world scenarios.

Robotic systems have emerged as transformative solutions to mitigate these inherent limitations. A crucial moment has arrived, where a confluence of pressing clinical needs and breakthroughs in AI creates an opportunity for a paradigm shift toward Embodied Intelligence (EI), enabling robots to navigate complex vascular networks and adapt to dynamic physiological conditions. Data-driven approaches, leveraging advanced computer vision, medical image analysis, and machine learning, drive this evolution by enabling real-time vessel segmentation, device tracking, and anatomical landmark detection. Reinforcement learning and imitation learning further improve navigation strategies and replicate expert techniques. This review systematically analyzes the integration of EI into endovascular robotics, identifying challenges such as the heterogeneity in validation standards and the gap between human mimicry and machine-native capabilities. Based on this analysis, a conceptual roadmap is proposed that reframes the ultimate objective away from systems that supplant clinical decision-making.

Existing PV power prediction methods based on satellite observation data face the following challenges: 1) The cloud occlusion model lacks sufficient refinement. 2) Quantifying the degree of interference of cloud in different regions on PV power generation is difficult. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a PV power prediction method based on cloud spatial position correction and occlusion potential evaluation. Initially, satellite-observed cloud height data are introduced, followed by the development of an end-to-end model to predict the spatial distribution of clouds. Next, a cloud spatial position correction model is proposed to adjust the position of clouds in the local spatial coordinate system, enabling the construction of a refined cloud occlusion model. Then, a cloud occlusion potential evaluation model is developed to quantify the degree of cloud occlusion in different regions. Clouds with lowocclusion potential are removed. The remaining clouds form a disordered point cloud set, which is processed by parallel PointNet to extract occlusion features and generate an occlusion factor. This factor, combined with other variables forms a multivariate time series, enabling the accurate power prediction using a neural network. Verification results show that the proposed method can effectively reduce prediction error."

The second stage introduces a quantum-classical reinforcement learning framework, where a learnable measurement-based CNN-ResVQC architecture is developed to effectively reduce the input dimension for quantum processing, mitigate vanishing gradients, and enhance trainability while improving the quantum circuit's flexibility in modeling complex decision policies for MO-TS. Numerical studies on IEEE 14-bus, 57-bus, and 118-bus systems demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves superior training stability and faster convergence with approximately 1% of the network parameters required by classical algorithms, highlighting its effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability. Furthermore, the practicality is validated through its stable convergence under three common quantum noise channels."

    "abstract": "To address the issues of weak correlation between multi-view features, low recognition accuracy of small-scale targets, and insufficient robustness in complex scenarios in underground pipeline detection using three-dimensional ground penetrating radar (3D GPR), this paper proposes a three-dimensional pipeline intelligent detection framework that integrates multi-strategy improved deep learning technology. This paper explores a novel pathway to achieve accurate 3D localization through lightweight joint analysis of multi-view 2D GPR images. First, based on a B/C/D-Scan three-view joint analysis strategy, a three-dimensional pipeline three-view feature evaluation method is established by cross-validating forward simulation results obtained using time-domain finite difference (FDTD) methods with actual measurement data. Second, the DCO-YOLO framework is proposed, which integrates DySample dynamic upsampling, Convolutional gate linear unit (CGLU), and OutlookAttention cross-dimensional correlation mechanisms into the original YOLOv11 algorithm, significantly improving the small-scale pipeline edge feature extraction capability. Furthermore, a 3D-DIoU spatial feature matching algorithm is proposed, which integrates three-dimensional geometric constraints and center distance penalty terms to achieve automated association of multi-view annotations. The three-view fusion strategy resolves inherent ambiguities in single-view detection. Experiments based on 100 kilometers of real urban underground pipeline data show that the proposed method achieves accuracy, recall, and mean average precision of 96.2%, 93.3%, and 96.7%, respectively, in complex multi-pipeline scenarios, which are 2.0%, 2.1%, and 0.9% higher than the baseline model. Ablation experiments validated the synergistic optimization effect of the dynamic feature enhancement module, and Grad-CAM++ heatmap visualization demonstrated that the improved model significantly enhanced its ability to focus on pipeline geometric features. This study integrates deep learning optimization strategies with the physical characteristics of 3D GPR, offering an efficient and reliable novel technical framework for the intelligent recognition and localization of underground pipelines."

The proposed D2S model employed the ResNet9-based generator and PatchGAN-based discriminator, with a compositve loss function synergizing mean squared error and L1 losses, similar to the Pix2Pix architecture. Training, validation, and testing were conducted using paired datasets of polarized TBs from SMAP (1.41 GHz) and DMSP (19.35 GHz) collected between July 2015 and June 2022, followed by application to historical data spanning from September 1987 to June 2015. The D2S model demonstrated robust performance in generating both SMAP TBv and TBh, achieving test set average correlation coefficients of 0.994 and 0.992, biases of 0.150 K and -0.259 K, root-mean-square errors of 6.463 K and 9.011 K, and mean absolute errors of 3.883 K and 5.518 K, respectively. Furthermore, this study showed reasonable agreement between the D2S-generated SMAP TBs and SMOS TBs and provided preliminary results of thin sea ice thickness retrievals, which were further used for evaluating the limitations of the D2S approach in specific sea ice regions. Consequently, the D2S model can provide empirically consistent SMAP-like polarized TB estimates over the Arctic, including periods prior to the L-band operational era. The D2S framework offers significant potential to enhance the reconstruction of historical Arctic sea ice conditions and to support climate change studies by providing surrogate L-band–equivalent information extending back to 1987."

    "abstract": "Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) aims to predict the future states of ongoing process instances. A primary objective is to accurately predict process outcomes while ensuring decision transparency, which is critical for enhancing process efficiency and reducing operational risk. Existing interpretable approaches to process monitoring often struggle with balancing transparency and reliability. Specifically, approaches that prioritize transparency often fall short in predictive accuracy and generalization, while those that achieve higher prediction performance often provide less reliable explanations. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Transparent Process Outcome Prediction framework (TPOP) using a graph neural network with stochastic attention. We begin by applying a SHAP-based feature selection technique to identify and extract the most relevant attributes from the log, thereby improving the quality of graph-based process representations. Next, we introduce a graph stochastic attention mechanism, which helps the model in concentrate on key paths and activities during training, leading to transparent and trustworthy predictions. Experimental evaluations on ten real-life event logs demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both predictive performance and interpretability. Furthermore, by visualizing how specific activities influence process outcomes across various cases, we confirm the reliability of the explanations generated by our approach."

    "abstract": "Converter power sharing and DC voltage regulation are critical control objectives in voltage source converter-based multi-terminal high-voltage DC (VSC-MTDC) systems, particularly when incorporating massive offshore wind farms (OWFs). However, the inherent variability and intermittency of OWFs pose significant challenges to conventional model-based and optimization-based control methods, which often rely on accurate system modeling and extensive computation. Moreover, traditional heuristic optimization approaches are prone to local optima, limiting their ability to handle rapidly fluctuating wind power conditions effectively. Reinforcement Learning (RL), with its capability to adaptively optimize control policies through continuous interaction with dynamic environments, presents a promising alternative. This paper proposes a novel RL-based control strategy for DC voltage regulation and proportional power sharing, leveraging an adaptive droop control mechanism. The Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm is employed to dynamically adjust local droop coefficients, benefiting from its robustness in continuous action spaces and its ability to mitigate the effects of OWF power fluctuations. To enhance optimization efficiency and accelerate convergence, a combined MTDC system pre-evaluation and PPO initialization method is introduced. The proposed RL-based control strategy is validated through dynamic simulations of a five-terminal MTDC grid in MATLAB/Simulink, demonstrating superior performance in handling various disturbances and contingencies associated with OWF integration."

    "abstract": "Medical image segmentation is an important analysis task in clinical practice and research. Deep learning has massively advanced the field, but current approaches are mostly based on models trained for a specific task. Training such models or adapting them to a new condition is costly due to the need for labeled data. The emergence of vision foundation models, especially Segment Anything Model (SAM), offers a path to universal segmentation for medical images, overcoming these issues. Here, we study how to improve SAM for medical images by comparing different finetuning strategies on a large and diverse dataset. We evaluate the finetuned models on a wide range of interactive and automatic semantic segmentation tasks. We find that performance clearly improves given the correct choice of finetuning strategies. This improvement is especially pronounced for interactive segmentation. Semantic segmentation also benefits, but the advantage over traditional segmentation approaches is inconsistent. Our best model, MedicoSAM, is publicly available. We show that it is compatible with existing tools for data annotation and believe that it will be of great practical value."

While existing automated methods for selecting, tuning, and creating EAs mainly rely on existing operators connected in sequence, they can hardly surpass the performance thresholds of existing EAs across various problems. To break through the shackles of existing EAs, this work proposes a universal framework to automatically create EAs from scratch: First, a series of building blocks are designed without using existing operators, and thus offer the potential to exceed the performance thresholds of existing EAs. Second, these blocks are connected like the layers of deep neural networks, which can form non-sequential architectures to pursue good performance. Third, these blocks are parameterized and can be trained like neural networks, able to exhibit better performance on given problems. Using the proposed framework, non-sequential EAs characterized by dozens of parameters are trained on a few problems, which outperform 36 existing algorithms on more than 200 single-and multi-objective problem instances. Particularly, the non-sequential EAs without surrogate demonstrate superior convergence over surrogate-assisted EAs on expensive problems, and outperform gradient methods on unimodal problems."

This removes the need for strong convexity, a condition traditionally required in optimization methods to guarantee global convergence. Instead, our methods ensure global convergence in non-convex settings, such as portfolio optimization on the sphere manifold. The proposed methods generate search directions that inherently satisfy a sufficient descent property, independent of Riemannian line search conditions. Furthermore, our convergence analysis provides greater flexibility regarding the CG parameter βk+1. Unlike many existing methods, which require β<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><i>k</i>+1</sub> to be explicitly bounded by a fixed formula (e.g., |β<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><i>k</i>+1</sub>| ≤ β<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><i>k</i>+1</sub><sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><i>FR</i></sup>), our framework introduces an adaptive min(max) strategy.

We also generalize classical CG portfolio optimization approaches by formulating the problem on the sphere manifold. This geometric framework inherently satisfies the budget constraint, ensuring independent portfolio weights and enhancing robustness. Numerical experiments demonstrate that all proposed Riemannian CG methods reliably converge to the same high-performing portfolio, with one method emerging as the fastest for practical use. Additionally, experiments on the doubly stochastic matrix approximation problem show that our methods outperform classical approaches in both iteration count and computational time, exhibiting superior efficiency for large-scale matrices."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the cognitive radio satellite-UAV downlink communication system, which leverages cognitive radio technology to optimize spectrum utilization. Specifically, this scenario involves a low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite sharing the spectrum with a UAV swarm, where both systems communicate with ground users simultaneously. The co-existence of satellite and UAV downlink channels introduces significant interference, leading to challenges in maintaining communication efficiency and energy efficiency. We formulate this as a multi objective optimization problem (MOP), which aims to maximize the total transmission rates of both satellite and UAV users while minimizing the energy consumption of the UAV swarm. However, this MOP is NP-hard due to its complex nature involving large scale decision variables and conflicting objectives such as interference mitigation and energy efficiency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a generative chaotic hybrid multi-objective hiking optimization algorithm (GCHMHOA). The algorithm includes several enhancements, which are chaos-based population initialization for better global exploration, a generative population evolution using diffusion models to maintain diversity, and genetic operators to handle sequentially encoded decision variables. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed GCHMHOA outperforms various state-of-the-art benchmark algorithms and achieves superior convergence and solution diversity. Specifically, the proposed GCHMHOA achieves approximately 48% higher satellite transmission rate, 11% higher UAV swarm transmission rate, and 4% lower energy consumption compared to the best baseline algorithm."

On the other hand, magnetic sensitive direction adjustment method was introduced to suppress the strand signal. Based on the finite element simulation and experimental research results, the optimal direction adjustment angle of the magnetic sensitive direction was set. Based on the above design, a combined weak signal processing method based on morphological filtering, circumferential wavelet, and morphological reconstruction was further designed. The experimental results show that the proposed method of using magnetic sensitive direction adjustment to suppress strand signals combined with weak signal filtering can effectively enhance the quality of weak signals and improve the identifiability of defects. Both multi-case and comparative experiments have proved that the proposed method has good performance and effectively improves the detection rate of weak signal defects."

In this context, the grid-forming (GFM) control has been explored to establish a stable voltage reference for the grid with a high proportion of inverter-based resources (IBRs). Although specific requirements for GFM controls have been released, a unified and comprehensive benchmarking method is still missing. Thus, in this paper, a characterization framework is proposed, where the characteristics of the GFM control are extended seen from the perspective of AC power supplies, to assist the unification of GFM technologies. The proposed framework comprises key functions, test bench configuration, critical index selection, and comprehensive evaluation to characterize different GFM controls, namely, the droop, virtual synchronous generator, matching, and virtual oscillator controls. Based on the proposed framework, the performance of these GFM controls is characterized on a hardware-in-loop (HIL) platform. The results show that the distinguishable differences, including the rate of change of frequency (RoCoF), power overshoot, and voltage settling time, can be acquired from the proposed framework as key indices. Meanwhile, the proposed framework demonstrates robust extensibility, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of various GFM schemes based on information about the point of common coupling."

    "abstract": "Light field (LF) imaging is inherently constrained by the trade-off between spatial resolution and angular sampling density. To overcome this obstacle, spatial-angular super-resolution (SR) methods have been developed to achieve concurrent enhancement in both dimensions. Traditional spatial-angular SR methods treat spatial and angular SR as separate tasks, resulting in parameter redundancy and error accumulation. While recent end-to-end approaches attempt joint processing, their uniform treatment of these distinct problems overlooks critical domain-specific requirements. To address these challenges, we propose a domain-specialized framework that deploys stage-tailored strategies to satisfy domain-specific demands. Specifically, in the angular SR stage, we introduce a cross-view consistency modulation module that enhances inter-view coherence through long-range dependency modeling of angular features. In the spatial SR stage, we propose a detail-aware state space model to reconstruct fine-grained detail. Finally, we develop a cross-domain integration module that explores spatial-angular correlations by fusing multi-representational features from both domains to foster synergistic optimization. Experimental results on public LF datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative comparisons, with approximately 50% fewer model parameters compared to competing methods."

Analysis of the literature helps us conclude that most of the work in the field supports healthcare institutions improve in terms of responsiveness and resilience, but more focus is needed to help systems restore to normalcy. We identify research gaps such as the development of robust disease surveillance tools based on novel technologies like AI, evaluating the benefits of coordinating limited resources within regional healthcare systems, and reducing risk within the complex healthcare supply chain. Moreover, based on our findings and interactions with practitioners we identify the need to channel more efforts on developing research that supports healthcare institutions as they seek to return to normalcy in the post pandemic world. Health systems are now operating with fewer resources while dealing with an increased number of patients who present multiple comorbidities, while dealing with ongoing shortages of critical supplies. These challenging conditions have resulted in significant financial losses for several healthcare systems post-pandemic. We propose future research directions that can provide a research agenda to scholars in our field seeking to enhance the responsiveness, resilience, and restoration of healthcare systems in preparation for future disease outbreaks."

This sensor reduces interference from the excitation magnetic field on detection signals, thereby improving the signal-to-noise ratio(SNR). This coil sensor employs harmonic magnetic field excitation (HMFE), utilizing a high-sensitivity pickup coil to receive magnetic field signals. The HMFE technique effectively enhances magnetic field penetration depth by modulating the pipeline's magnetic permeability. Both finite element simulations and experiments demonstrate that HMFE improves the distribution of induced currents within the pipe body, increasing detection depth and accuracy. The proposed differential magnetic field coil sensor enables noncontact inspection of insulated pipelines. Under HMFE, the detection signal contains rich defect characteristic signals. It can effectively detect typical pipeline defects beneath 100 mm thick insulation layers, capable of identifying corrosion pits as small as 3 cm² at a depth of 2 mm and through-holes with diameters as small as 10 mm. It also demonstrates excellent detection performance for circumferential scratches on pipelines. Even when defects are oriented at a 45° angle relative to the inspection position, the method maintains reliable identification capabilities."

The sinusoidal property of current is employed to achieve CP radiation by feeding the four U-shaped dipole arms with 0°, 270°, 90° and 0° phases in accordance with the counterclockwise direction. The U-shaped dipole arm allows for the distribution of current over a longer radiating path, thereby enhancing the axial-ratio bandwidth (ARBW).

Meanwhile, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms are increasingly deployed in dynamic, safety-critical missions that demand rapid situational awareness and autonomous adaptation. This paper explores potential solutions for integrating MLLMs with UAV swarms to enhance intelligence and adaptability across diverse tasks. Specifically, we first outline the fundamental architectures and functions of UAVs and MLLMs. Then, we present a comprehensive framework for an MLLM-enabled UAV swarm system and discuss the opportunities it offers. Next, we demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed framework through a forest firefighting case study that includes both simulation and real-world experiments. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future research directions for MLLM-enabled UAV swarms.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the resilience of max-plus linear systems (MPLS) against a class of deception attacks on sensor readings. We refer to this class as timestamp-delay deception attacks, in which an attacker deliberately delays the timestamps of event firings transmitted from sensors to the controller. Unlike denial-of-service or disruption attacks, these manipulations do not suppress or block data but instead mislead the controller into acting on outdated information, potentially causing violations of synchronization constraints. In the max-plus algebra framework, such attacks are modeled as perturbations of the state vector by a diagonal delay matrix. We formally define this attack and introduce a minimal consistency test, which enables the system to promptly refute less sophisticated manipulations by the attacker that violate the system’s internal structure, and propose an innocuity test that guarantees resilience. Based on this criterion, we derive the maximal admissible delay matrix that ensures closed-loop behavior remains unaffected under the considered timestamp-delay deception attack. Furthermore, we present a numerical synthesis method for static state-feedback controllers that achieve specified levels of resilience. An application example illustrates the effectiveness and limitations of the proposed approach. This work represents the first step toward a systematic theory of resilient control for MPLS under cyber-physical attacks."

The demonstrated width-extensional (WE) mode resonator is designed and fabricated on a thin-film piezoelectric-on-silicon (TPoS) platform. By strategically tuning the crystal orientation of the bulky single-crystal silicon device body, Duffing nonlinearity is systematically mitigated, thereby enhancing the dynamic range of the resonator. Experimental characterization confirms that the resonator with a crystal orientation of 30° from the <100> direction exhibits the optimal dynamic range performance. When integrated into a closed-loop oscillation system, this optimized resonator achieves exceptional phase noise metrics of −124.25dBc/Hz at 1 kHz offset and −164.30dBc/Hz at 1MHz offset. Itprovides a novel solution for suppressing Duffing nonlinearity in piezoelectric MEMS resonators, addressing critical challenges in precision timing and frequency control applications.[2025-0110]"

    "abstract": "In this work, we propose a signal integrity and power efficiency optimization framework for high-speed I/O equalizer systems using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based on a deep double Q-network. Although equalizer techniques have long existed, few studies have systematically optimized the feed-forward equalizer (FFE), decision feedback equalizer (DFE), and continuous-time linear equalizer (CTLE) together, including the high-speed channel properties. This framework determines the parameters of the equalizer architecture to optimize performance metrics such as eye height, eye width, and power consumption. It offers three key advantages: (1) a framework with a scalable deep neural network (DNN) to efficiently model complex design challenges; (2) a future-state technique that mitigates design-space expansion with a minimum number of output neurons; and (3) simultaneous evaluation of power efficiency, unachievable with conventional methods. As a proof of concept, we present the optimization of equalizer architecture using the proposed approach across different high-speed channels, including a backplane and an interference-tolerant channel. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves signal and power performance significantly compared to those from conventional methods (e.g., minimum-mean squared error, least-mean squared) and converges much faster than genetic, particle swarm, and Bayesian optimization algorithms."

    "abstract": "Transmission image reconstruction is a fundamental step in Tomographic Gamma Scanning (TGS) for nuclear waste drum inspection. Conventional reconstruction algorithms, such as Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (ART) and Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization (MLEM), often suffer from artifacts and limited accuracy when applied to sparse-angle projection data in TGS. On the other hand, deep learning-based approaches typically require large-scale, task-specific datasets, which poses significant challenges for practical deployment in industrial settings. To address these issues, we propose the Physics-Informed Deep Image Prior with 3D Total Variation (PhysDIP-TV) model for 3D transmission image reconstruction in TGS applications. The method integrates a Deep Image Prior (DIP) network with a Beer-Lambert law-informed loss and 3D TV regularization to enforce both data fidelity and volumetric smoothness, without relying on external training data. In the experiment, PhysDIP-TV reduces the mean squared error (MSE) by more than 13.49% compared to benchmark algorithms, while improving the structural similarity index (SSIM) by more than 6.61%. These results demonstrate that the combination of physics-informed loss and 3D TV regularization enables robust, high-fidelity reconstructions from severely under-sampled projections. The training-free and lightweight nature of PhysDIP-TV makes it well-suited for industrial TGS applications with limited data, scanning time, and computational resources."

    "abstract": "Single-cell multimodal data can simultaneously provide cellular features at different levels, such as gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and spatial location. The integration of multimodal data can efficiently utilize the information from various views, thereby enhancing the reliability and accuracy of cellular research. The current integration methods mainly focus on obtaining the representation of cells but neglect the representation of genes, not beneficial to cell typespecific gene module analyses. Besides, some integration algorithms only can integrate multi-omics data and cannot be applied to spatial transcriptome data for integrating transcriptomic data and spatial location. To this end, we propose MISF, a Multimodal data Integration algorithm based on adaptive Similarity network learning and matrix Factorization. MISF integrates multimodal data and learns the lower-dimensional representations of cells and genes. We validate the feasibility of MISF on multiple single-cell multi-omics data and spatial transcriptome data and compare it with the existing multi-omics data integration methods as well as spatial transcriptome data analysis algorithms. The results demonstrate that MISF can effectively integrate multimodal data, localize different types of cell clusters, and outline cellular spatial distribution pattern. Furthermore, MISF facilitates cell clustering and cell type-specific gene module analyses, providing new insights for the study of cellular heterogeneity."

    "abstract": "Global warming has become an increasingly critical global challenge in recent years, necessitating the widespread deployment of renewable energy resources to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. Among various renewable energy sources, solar photovoltaic (PV) systems have gained significant popularity. However, their inherent intermittency, driven by weather-dependent fluctuations, poses substantial challenges for grid stability. Consequently, accurate PV power generation forecasting is essential for ensuring the reliable operation of power systems. Traditional deterministic forecasting methods, which provide only a single-point estimate, are insufficient for practical industrial applications as they fail to quantify forecasting uncertainty. To address this limitation, this study proposes a comprehensive PV forecasting framework that integrates both deterministic and probabilistic forecasting techniques, facilitating a more robust uncertainty analysis. The proposed probabilistic forecasting approach leverages advanced concepts from probability theory, including quantile regression, interval prediction, and density forecasting, to enhance predictive accuracy. Furthermore, this study introduces an innovative probabilistic forecasting technique capable of dynamically detecting data variations across multiple sites and autonomously selecting the optimal forecasting model. The proposed method constructs adaptive upper and lower prediction bounds by incorporating weighted error adjustments, thereby refining the bandwidth of confidence intervals for different levels of forecast uncertainty. Additionally, the framework achieves high predictive accuracy while significantly reducing computational complexity, making it well-suited for large-scale industrial applications."

    "abstract": "Temporal sentence grounding aims to localize moments corresponding to language queries from videos. As labeling the temporal boundaries is cumbersome and subjective, the weakly-supervised methods have received increasing attention. Most of the existing weakly-supervised methods generate proposals by sliding windows, which are content-independent and of low quality. Besides, they train their model to distinguish positive visual-language pairs from negative ones randomly collected from other videos, ignoring the highly confusing video segments within the same video. In this paper, we propose Contrastive Proposal Learning (CPL) to overcome the above limitations. Specifically, we use multiple learnable asymmetric Gaussian functions to generate both positive and negative proposals within the same video. Then, we propose a controllable, easy-to-hard negative proposal mining strategy to collect negative samples within the same video, which enables CPL to distinguish highly confusing scenes. Finally, we propose an extension of the proposal generation algorithm to explore the use of low-cost single-frame annotation and achieve a balance between annotation burden and grounding performance. Our CPL can be applied to both MIL-based and reconstruction-based mainstream frameworks and achieves state-of-the-art performance on Charades-STA, ActivityNet Captions, and DiDeMo datasets."

    "abstract": "The multiple agent reinforcement learning systems (MARL) based on the Markov Game (MG) have emerged in many critical applications. To improve the robustness/defense of MARL systems against adversaries, studying various adversarial attacks on reinforcement learning systems is very important. Previous works on adversarial attacks considered some possible features to attack in the MG, such as action poisoning attacks, reward poisoning attacks, and state perception attacks. In this paper, we propose a new form of perception attack, called the camouflage attack in MARL systems. In the camouflage attack, the attackers change the appearances of some objects in the environment but without changing the actual objects; and the camouflaged appearances may look the same to all the targeted recipient (victim) agents. The camouflaged appearances can mislead the recipient agents to follow misguided policies. We evaluate the effect of camouflage attacks in two different scenarios: Camouflage attacks were performed during the learning (training-time attacks) and were performed during the test of agents' policies (test-time attacks). Our numerical and theoretical results show that camouflage attacks can rival the more conventional, but likely more difficult state perception attacks, by comparing their effect on reducing agents' global benefits. We also investigated cost-constrained camouflage attacks, compared them with cost-constrained state perception attacks, and showed how cost budgets affect attack performance numerically."

Consequently, reducing transformer failure rates is vital, with insulation failures being the primary cause of these faults. Insulating materials, particularly insulating oils in oil-filled transformers, are of significant interest as they provide electrical insulation and facilitate heat dissipation. Various types of oils, notably mineral and ester oils, are employed for this purpose, each exhibiting unique electrical and chemical properties. This study aims to evaluate the performance of these oils under different electrical stresses, including high-density electrical discharge and partial discharge faults. Four different dielectric oils were prepared and subjected to controlled laboratory tests simulating these fault conditions using specifically designed test cells. Dissolved gas concentrations in each oil are measured and analyzed to establish distinct gas generation patterns under different fault conditions. Additionally, the dielectric dissipation factor is measured for each oil, providing a comparative assessment of oil performance under stress. The findings contribute to understanding the quality and reliability of various insulating oils under fault conditions, supporting effective condition monitoring of power transformers."

    "abstract": "Developing scalable and generalizable reward engineering for reinforcement learning (RL) is crucial for creating general-purpose agents, especially in the challenging domain of robotic manipulation. While recent advances in reward engineering with vision–language models (VLMs) have shown promise, their sparse reward nature significantly limits sample efficiency. This article introduces text-to-video reward (TeViR), a novel method that leverages a pretrained text-to-video diffusion model to generate dense rewards by comparing the predicted image sequence with current observations. Experimental results across 13 simulation and real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that TeViR outperforms traditional methods leveraging sparse rewards and other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, achieving better sample efficiency and performance without ground truth environmental rewards. TeViR’s ability to efficiently guide agents in complex environments highlights its potential to advance RL applications in robotic manipulation."

    "abstract": "Plenty of grid-connected power electronic devices may significantly weaken the voltage/frequency stability of microgrid system. The system employing a motor/generator pair (MGP) can effectively improve stability. However, the MGP is composed of two machines, the integration is insufficient. In addition, when the generator is connected with load, the output voltage will drop due to the reason of voltage regulation rate. This paper proposes a novel permanent magnet synchronous machine with integrated motoring and generating windings (PMSM-IMGW) and applies it to microgrid system. The PMSM-IMGW has the advantages of lower voltage regulation rate and higher integration. The topology, operational principles, and control system are presented. The steady-state voltage equations are employed to investigate the d- and q-axis armature effects under strong magnetic coupling between the motoring windings (MWs) and generating windings (GWs), revealing the reason of achieving low voltage regulation rate. A 7.4kW prototype is designed and analyzed by finite element analysis (FEA). Simulation results show that compared to the voltage regulation rate of the generator (Δ<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">u</i> = 4.35%), the voltage regulation rate of the PMSM-IMGW (Δ<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">u</i> =1.86%) decreases by 57.24%.

Users can input vague story ideas through prompts, which are automatically decomposed into storyboards with characters and actions, and then iteratively refine them through intuitive interfaces. An exploratory user study with 12 participants showed that ShadowTale could act as a catalyst for accessible storytelling, enabling users to balance AI-driven support with personal expression, and opening avenues for broader cultural applications.

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of Low-Altitude Intelligent Internet of Things (LAI-IoT), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become critical assistants for urban traffic management systems to acquire real-time data. They are widely deployed in key scenarios such as traffic accident scene image collection and dynamic traffic flow monitoring, providing essential data support for traffic scheduling and emergency response. Beyond the risk of raw data leakage, derivative information (including dataset cardinality, retrieval requests, and UAV communication trajectories) may also disclose sensitive situational information. If the urban planning brain repeatedly makes large requests for a specific intersection, the server may infer an upcoming major project, while disclosing the UAV provider’s total data volume reveals its operational scale and costs, disadvantaging it in future negotiations. Existing LAI-IoT communication schemes primarily focus on protecting users’ direct privacy, often overlooking the privacy of derivative data (e.g., dataset cardinality and communication trajectories), which can be exploited and misused by AGI models. Therefore, a privacy-preserving collaborative communication protocol for distributed UAVs based on a hierarchical key encapsulation mechanism is proposed. The protocol enables UAV datasets to accurately identify accident scenes while preserving multiple dimensions of privacy, including dataset cardinality at the UAV side, retrieval tag sets and their cardinalities at base stations, and UAV communication trajectories, without compromising communication efficiency. Theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation demonstrate that the proposed protocol maintains strong scalability and practicality while significantly reducing the success rate of cardinality and trajectory inference attacks, thereby enhancing the security of data communications in LAI-IoT scenarios."

While advanced machine learning models can significantly improve accuracy, their full potential is often underused due to challenges in identifying which external (exogenous) factors matter most. This paper's main contribution is the introduction of a practical, exogeneity-aware forecasting framework designed for sales and operations planning (S&OP) that guides managers in systematically selecting, evaluating, and applying external variables such as economic indicators, weather data, and market trends. The framework is validated through a three-and-a-half-year case study with a major European online retailer, where machine learning models incorporating targeted exogenous features reduced forecast error by up to 22% compared to traditional methods. The findings highlight the importance of robust feature selection processes in enhancing forecast accuracy and offer practical guidance for industry experts seeking to refine their demand forecasting strategies."

    "abstract": "Endovascular procedures have revolutionized vascular disease treatment, yet their manual execution is challenged by the demands for high precision, operator fatigue, and radiation exposure. Robotic systems have emerged as transformative solutions to mitigate these inherent limitations. A crucial moment has arrived, where a confluence of pressing clinical needs and breakthroughs in AI creates an opportunity for a paradigm shift toward Embodied Intelligence (EI), enabling robots to navigate complex vascular networks and adapt to dynamic physiological conditions. Data-driven approaches, leveraging advanced computer vision, medical image analysis, and machine learning, drive this evolution by enabling real-time vessel segmentation, device tracking, and anatomical landmark detection. Reinforcement learning and imitation learning further improve navigation strategies and replicate expert techniques. This review systematically analyzes the integration of EI into endovascular robotics, identifying challenges such as the heterogeneity in validation standards and the gap between human mimicry and machine-native capabilities. Based on this analysis, a conceptual roadmap is proposed that reframes the ultimate objective away from systems that supplant clinical decision-making. This vision of augmented intelligence, where the clinician's role evolves into that of a high-level supervisor, provides a principled foundation for the future of the field."

    "abstract": "Interference widely exists in communication systems and is often not optimally treated at the receivers due to limited knowledge and/or computational burden. Evolutions of receivers have been proposed to balance complexity and spectral efficiency, for example, for 6G, while commonly used performance metrics, such as capacity and mutual information (MI), fail to capture the suboptimal treatment of interference, leading to potentially inaccurate performance evaluations. Mismatched decoding is an information-theoretic tool for analyzing communications with suboptimal decoders. In this work, we use mismatched decoding to analyze communications with decoders that treat interference suboptimally, aiming at more accurate performance metrics. Specifically, we consider a finite-alphabet input Gaussian channel under interference, representative of modern systems, where the decoder can be matched (optimal) or mismatched (suboptimal) to the channel. The matched capacity is derived using MI, while a lower bound on the mismatched capacity under various decoding metrics is derived using generalized mutual information (GMI). We show that the decoding metric in the proposed channel model is closely related to the behavior of the demodulator in bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) systems. Simulations illustrate that GMI/MI accurately predicts the throughput of BICM-type systems with various demodulators. Finally, we extend the channel model and the GMI to multiple antenna cases, with an example of multi-user multiple-input-single-output (MU-MISO) precoder optimization problem considering GMI under different decoding strategies. In short, this work discovers new insights about the impact of interference, proposes novel receivers, and introduces a new design and performance evaluation framework that more accurately captures the effect of interference."

To address these limitations, we developed PCCSegNet (Potato green Canopy Cover Segmentation Network), a deep learning-based model for segmenting green canopy and determining CC% from visual imagery. PCCSegNet consists of two modules: a Canopy Segmentation Module (CSM) and a Canopy Percentage Module (CPM). The CSM uses an attention-enhanced U-Net architecture with both channel and spatial attention mechanisms to improve feature learning and segmentation robustness. PCCSegNet achieved 97.59% Precision, 97.03% Accuracy, 96.40% IoU, and 98.10% F<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>-score for canopy segmentation.

    "abstract": "Cardiac auscultation is a key non-invasive heart disease diagnostic method, but traditional heart sound diagnosis depends highly on physicians' experience, with subjective bias. Deep learning can extract heart sound features, reducing reliance on professionals and improving the objectivity and efficiency of cardiovascular disease (CVD) diagnosis. However, traditional research still has the following issues: (1) Single convolution kernels or fixed receptive fields cannot fully capture the multi-scale time-frequency features of heart sounds, risking loss of key pathological features; (2) class imbalance in real data and information dilution by global average pooling limit diagnosis model accuracy and clinical applicability. Therefore, this paper proposes MST-ResFLNet, an improved ResNet18-based heart sound classification model. It employs a multi-branch pyramid spectrum stem instead of the traditional conv1 layer, and enhances low-level feature representation via convolutional branches and the Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) attention module. Moreover, a temporal attention pooling module is designed: it averages the frequency dimension first, then uses an attention module to predict time-frame weights and feeds the weighted sum to the classifier. In addition, Focal Loss is added to cross-entropy to suppress easy samples' gradients and adjust weights according to label frequency. Experiments on two datasets verify its effectiveness. Results show 99.7% accuracy, 99.69% F1 score, 99.7% specificity in binary classification, and 100% accuracy,100% F1 score, 100% specificity in five-classification, outperforming traditional methods. This work provides a robust technical solution for automated heart sound diagnosis, facilitating its clinical application in resource-constrained settings."

    "abstract": "Differential-neural cryptanalysis has become a frontier method for evaluating the security of block ciphers. This optimizes the security boundaries of embedded devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) more effectively. However, it is challenging to construct an effective dataset for the differential neural distinguisher. The main challenge lies in that when expanding to deep rounds, the distribution of data features becomes scattered and a computational complexity disaster arises. Therefore, this paper proposes a dual coupling optimization model called the Normality Test Search Dataset Model (NTSD). The model achieves synergistic breakthroughs in search dataset enhancement and search efficiency. First, we propose a differential-key constraint mechanism. The mechanism enhances the anti-decay capability of the dataset by constraining the number of random keys and the form of ciphertexts in the dataset. This makes the probability of collision higher and also strengthens the overall features. Additionally, the distribution features of the enhanced dataset in high rounds are significantly different from those of random datasets. Second, we propose a more efficient dual evaluation strategy. This strategy employs a dual normality distribution detection method to reduce the complexity of searching input differences. Experiments show that the execution time of the NTSD model is approximately 80% less than that of Seok’s method. Finally, the NTSD model is also used in a variety of ciphers. For instance, GIFT-COFB has advanced from round 4 to round 6. The accuracy of ASCON-PERMUTATION in four rounds has increased from 50.69% to 58.23%."

    "abstract": "Urban rail transit trains play a crucial role in urban transportation systems, and their operational reliability is directly related to passenger safety. Bolt connection is one of the main connection methods in trains, and bolts are prone to loosening under long-term high temperature and high load conditions, making accurate detection of bolt loosening status crucial. Currently, most bolt loosening detection methods primarily rely on deep learning technology to extract key information for determining bolt loosening conditions. However, in actual train scenarios, deep learning-based methods face challenges in extracting target features: urban rail transit train bolts occupy a small proportion in images with low resolution, making it difficult to accurately extract target boundary regions, thereby affecting detection accuracy. To improve bolt detection performance, DSRB-Net—a multi-task semantic segmentation method based on super-resolution and boundary constraints—is proposed. Specifically, we design a shared encoder architecture that jointly optimizes super-resolution reconstruction and semantic segmentation branches, effectively utilizing the detailed information recovered by super-resolution to guide the semantic segmentation task. We innovatively design a Shared Feature Guidance Module (SFGM) that enhances feature interaction and fusion capabilities between different tasks through multi-branch progressive fusion structure and attention mechanisms. Meanwhile, we propose Boundary Constraint Loss (BCL) to optimize feature representation in boundary regions, significantly improving the segmentation accuracy of target boundaries. Extensive experimental results on real-scene data demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms other classic semantic segmentation algorithms, achieving excellent mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) scores of 84.06% and 85.38% on the DQM4T and DQM6T datasets, respectively. Furthermore, during inference, this method only requires the semantic segmentation branch to obtain final results, making it suitable for practical deployment in urban rail transit systems."

However, most existing research on parameter estimation using sparse polarimetric arrays only considers statistical information in the covariance domain. In reality, the statistical information in the conjugate augmented covariance (CAC) domain plays an important role in enhancing degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) and estimation accuracy, especially in the presence of widely encountered uncorrelated noncircular impinging sources. To fully leverage the CAC, a unified framework encompassing sparse polarimetric array design, CAC fitting (CACF) in the joint spatial and polarimetric domain, and closed-form multi-parameter estimation is presented with low computational complexity via eliminating the need for multi-dimensional spectral searching procedures. The proposed sparse polarimetric array achieves increased DoFs provided by leveraging both <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">sum</i> and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">difference</i> co-arrays, compared to its counterpart that utilizes only the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">difference</i> co-array.

It is also easy to implement and requires less electromagnetic isolation. The CACF and its associated closed-form multi-parameter estimation approaches require no iterative, pair matching, or spectral searching procedures, implying great potential in reducing computational complexity. Numerical simulation examples are provided to verify the advantages of the proposed framework, including less mutual coupling effects, enhanced DoFs, effectiveness for different signal cases, and improved estimation performance."

    "abstract": "This study proposes an innovative design approach for an ultra-compact RF rectifier, emphasizing high power conversion efficiency (PCE). The rectifier design employs a dual-branch cell configuration, labeled as Section-1 (S1) and Section-2 (S2), to enhance its performance characteristics. To support biomedical implant applications, these branches are incorporated with a meandered line network, designated as (ML1 and ML2). A radial stub is employed in the S1 structure, while series inductors are additionally connected to S1 and S2 to achieve improved performance characteristics. To improve power delivery performance, the proposed rectifier is specifically optimized for enhanced transfer efficiency within the frequency range of 1.28 GHz to 1.52 GHz. This makes it highly suitable for integration into wireless power transfer systems (WPTs) designed for biomedical implants. Both the simulated (experimental) results confirmed a maximum RF-to-DC PCE of 78.80% (77.7%), achieved at an input power <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">P<sub>in</sub></i> level of 4 dBm.

The rectifier is fabricated on an RT/Duroid substrate, resulting in a compact footprint measuring 7.8 mm by 9.3 mm. A single-series diode (SSrd) configuration is employed to achieve the desired rectification performance. To ensure a wide impedance bandwidth, a sequential matching technique is applied, effectively optimizing the device’s performance throughout the specified frequency spectrum. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed rectifier in enabling WPT for biomedical implant applications, with particular emphasis on scenarios that demand efficient harvesting of ambient energy."

    "abstract": "With the rapid growth of the elderly population, fall accidents have received increasing attention due to their serious health hazards. Pre-impact fall detection (PIFD) based on wearable sensors emerges as a promising approach for proactive fall prevention in healthcare monitoring. In this research, based on Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs), we construct and publicly provide a large-scale motion dataset named FallTL, which includes falls and activities of daily living (ADLs) collected from multiple body segments. Furthermore, we develop STA-Net, a novel Spatial-Temporal Attention Network to perform PIFD based on IMU data from a single body segment. STA-Net incorporates a dual-branch architecture: a temporal attention branch that models temporal signal dependencies and a spatial attention branch that captures cross-modality feature interactions, enabling robust representation learning from sensor data. We evaluate STA-Net across three datasets and it achieves advantageous performance and comparable lead time under cross-subject validation, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. In addition, our analysis further investigates the influence of sensor placement and data modality on detection performance. These results indicate that accurate and robust PIFD is feasible with minimally obtrusive, single-location sensor setups, offering practical implications for wearable fall monitoring systems."

    "abstract": "The growing integration of non-terrestrial networks (NTNs), particularly low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations, has significantly extended the reach of maritime connectivity, supporting critical applications such as vessel monitoring, navigation safety, and maritime surveillance in remote and oceanic regions. Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, increasingly collected through a combination of satellite and terrestrial infrastructures, provide a rich source of spatiotemporal vessel information. However, accurate trajectory prediction in maritime domains remains challenging due to irregular sampling rates, dynamic environmental conditions, and heterogeneous vessel behaviors. This study proposes a velocity-based trajectory prediction framework that leverages AIS data collected from integrated satellite–terrestrial networks. Rather than directly predicting absolute positions (latitude and longitude), our model predicts vessel motion in the form of latitude and longitude velocities. This formulation simplifies the learning task, enhances temporal continuity, and improves scalability, making it well-suited for resource-constrained NTN environments. The predictive architecture is built upon a Long Short-Term Memory network enhanced with attention mechanisms and residual connections (LSTM-RA), enabling it to capture complex temporal dependencies and adapt to noise in real-world AIS data. Extensive experiments on two maritime datasets validate the robustness and accuracy of our framework, demonstrating clear improvements over state-of-the-art baselines."

    "abstract": "Vertical farming offers a controlled environment for food production in regions where land scarcity and environmental stress are prevalent. This study presents a bio-inspired optimization strategy for refining the spectral composition of red, green, and blue (RGB) light from LED to enhance crop performance. A genetic algorithm (GA) was employed to iteratively adjust spectral ratios in 2.5-day intervals over a single 25-day practical growth cycle. The algorithm employed selection, crossover, and mutation operators, targeting a weighted-sum fitness function based on key morphological traits, including fresh weight, height, width, and number of leaves. A experimental trial were conducted under controlled conditions, with identical light intensity and photoperiod for both RGB treatments and a cold white LED reference. The primary finding is that the optimization process successfully converged on a stable composition of approximately 67% red, 13% green, and 20% blue, which is consistent with prior studies on photosynthetic efficiency. This convergence validates the GA’s ability to autonomously discover a scientifically backed recipe from a neutral baseline. A final statistical analysis of the individual plant traits revealed a complex, multi-objective response, with plant height being the most statistically responsive parameter, while differences in the final biomass and leaf count were not statistically significant under the tested conditions. These findings demonstrate the potential of evolutionary algorithms for solving complex, multi-objective optimization problems in vertical farming, supporting the development of adaptive lighting strategies."

    "abstract": "Faced with high-dimensional expensive optimization problems (HEOPs), existing high-dimensional expensive optimization algorithms (HEOAs) struggle to locate promising areas quickly due to a dramatically expanded search space. Besides, slow convergence is a critical issue causing inefficiency of HEOAs. To address these issues, we propose a multispace dimensionality reduction-based HEOA (MDR-HEOA) where two extreme learning machine-assisted autoencoders (ELM-AEs) are devised. Specifically, an autoencoder with online sequential learning ELM (OSL-ELM-AE) builds a compressed space, where individuals of low quality explore expecting to locate promising areas quickly. Afterwards, the individuals’ positions are reconstructed to the original space by the output layer of OSL-ELM-AE. Online sequential learning ELM continuously updates OSL-ELM-AE’s parameters whenever new individuals arrive, ensuring high generalization performance in reconstructing the positions that approximate the related target ones. In contrast, ELM-AE with an equal number of hidden nodes and the individuals input each time (ELM-EAE) compresses the search space, where medium-quality individuals exploit aiming to expedite convergence. Based on the universal approximation theorem, ELM-EAE can learn these input individuals with zero error, demonstrating high reconstruction capability. Thus, the individuals’ positions with small offsets caused by exploitation can be reconstructed to closely approximate their target ones. Besides, high-quality individuals conduct a refined search in the original space to find the optimal solution of a HEOP. Our experimental results, particularly comprehensive comparisons with nine state-of-the-art HEOAs, validate that MDR-HEOA significantly improves the performance in handling HEOPs."

    "abstract": "The emergence of live streaming has revolutionized retail, altering how e-tailers engage with their customers. However, incorporating a live streaming channel may intensify channel competition and profit-sharing losses, potentially eroding the e-tailer's overall profitability. A streamer faces a trade-off in contract provision: it must balance maximizing its profits with expanding its market. This paper investigates a streamer's contract offering decisions and an e-tailer's channel selection strategy. We analyze two types of contracts that a streamer can offer—agency and reselling contracts—and three channel strategies for an e-tailer: not adopting live streaming, self-streaming, and third-party streaming. Our findings reveal that the streamer offers contracts aligned with its profit preferences only when the network effect is strong and the hassle cost is low. Otherwise, the streamer may deviate from its preferred contract and choose a suboptimal strategy. From the e-tailer's perspective, no single strategy dominates all scenarios. The e-tailer should avoid opening a live-streaming channel when the hassle cost is very high. If the network effect is low and the hassle cost is moderately high, the e-tailer should choose self-streaming; otherwise, it should opt for third-party streaming. Interestingly, our research also shows that neither the e-tailer nor the streamer necessarily has to lower the live streaming channel price. Furthermore, implementing live-streaming does not always cannibalize the traditional channel demand or lead to an expansion of total market demand. This paper provides practical guidance for both streamers and e-tailers in making strategic contract and channel decisions in the live-streaming retail landscape."

IoT and edge intelligence have enabled the deployment of real-time fault diagnosis systems for connected industrial and consumer devices. However, the accuracy of such a system is a real challenge due to the presence of the strong and complex background noise that comes along with the data. This work focuses on bearing fault classification under strong noise through a novel enhanced exponential linear unit activation function. An improved end-to-end enhanced convolutional-long short-term memory deep learning model is proposed. The proposed network uses a novel activation function in a convolutional neural network to improve the network’s adaptability against various noise levels. Finally, Case Western Reserve University benchmark data is utilized to assess the model’s performance. Results prove that the proposed model has anti-noise adaptability under strong noises and has a significant advantage in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall over existing methods."

However, existing MFS methods usually constrain the feature selection matrix through regularization parameters, which does not explicitly determine the number of features to be retained. Moreover, conventional MFS methods only consider local pairwise structures and ignore the high-order structural information of the multi-label data. To address the above-mentioned problems, we present a novel MFS method, named learning high-order structure information for efficient multi-label feature selection. Specifically, we first design a regression model based on ℓ<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2,0</sub> norm constraint, which can effectively avoid the search for regularization parameter. Second, adaptive diffusion graph are introduced to learn high-order structural information, which can be fully exploited in global multi-label data. Finally, the well-defined objective function with an efficient optimization solution is constructed to perform the MFS based on the above two-step instructions. Experiments on real datasets and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods clearly validate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "Remote sensing change detection (RSCD) provides indispensable technical support for urban dynamic monitoring. However, fully supervised methods remain limited by costly manual annotation. In such a context, weakly supervised learning (WSL) based on image-level labels has attracted increasing attention among change detection (CD) community. The main challenge of WSL lies in the limited prior information obtained from coarse-grained annotations, making it difficult to capture the target semantics and boundaries. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Semantically guided and SAM-refined weakly supervised CD method (SemSAM-CD) by integrating the superior localization capability of Class Activation Maps (CAMs) with the segmentation advantages of Segment Anything Model (SAM). Specifically, in the semantic guidance stage, we implement a multi-stage knowledge distillation framework. First, the “unchanged” features with pixel-level supervision are converted into semantic priors in the feature space, providing global guidance for optimizing the recognition of “changed” features. Simultaneously, we model the “changed” image pairs independently to refine boundary information at a local scale, enhancing the localization accuracy of CAMs. For the SAM refinement stage, a novel prompt generation module is employed to convert CAMs into SAM-compatible prompts, whereby guiding the generation of pixel-level pseudo-labels. Finally, a DeepLabV3+ detector is employed to generate change maps. Extensive experiments on three high-resolution CD datasets confirm the superior performance of SemSAM-CD, which significantly outperforms existing weakly-supervised change detection (WSCD) methods.

Theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that low-resistivity silicon pillars (<0.01 Ω·cm) reduce the series resistance to 51.3 Ω, lowering the electrical damping coefficient and boosting the quality factor (Q-factor) by over 100% (from 16,539 to 33,269). The sensor exhibits a sensitivity of 44.17 Hz/kPa, frequency stability of 0.035 Hz at 1 s integration time, and accuracy better than 0.027% full-scale output (FSO) over -45°C to 45°C, outperforming state-of-the-art designs and validating TGV as a superior solution for advanced MEMS resonators."

In this article, a discharge experiment of live-line work combined air gap was carried out under low air pressure (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</i> = 79.8 kPa) to observe the physical processes at each stage of the discharge. The results indicate that within the two subgaps separated by the floating rod, the discharge processes do not occur sequentially or independently but at different physical stages, developing simultaneously under mutual influence. The initiation time and development duration of each discharge stage in the two subgaps are influenced by the location of floating rod. There are also some fixed sequential laws in the development process of two subgaps. The discharge process of the live-line work combined air gap in a low air pressure environment is slower compared to standard conditions, but the final jump height remains approximately the same as that in standard pressure."

To address these issues, this article proposes a multi-source fusion-based intelligent diagnosis method leveraging time-frequency images of acoustic-vibration signals and a dual-branch depthwise separable convolutional neural network (DB-DSCNN). The proposed method establishes a comprehensive diagnostic framework encompassing signal acquisition, dynamic fusion, feature extraction, and classification. At the signal fusion stage, a dynamic entropy weight method is introduced to achieve adaptive weighted integration of vibration and acoustic signals, effectively overcoming the limitations of conventional fixed-weight strategies. For feature extraction, a combination of short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and Mel spectrogram is employed to capture wide-band fault characteristics, thereby enhancing the representation capability for non-stationary signals. At the network architecture level, a lightweight dual-branch depthwise separable convolution (DB-DSC) structure is implemented, which maintains high recognition accuracy while substantially reducing computational complexity. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior fault identification performance and robustness across ablation studies, signal-to-noise ratio tests under varying noise conditions, and comparative evaluations against representative existing methods."

To solve above issues, this article proposes a hierarchical optimal CFR control (HOCFR) scheme to improve the CFR capability for heterogeneous WFs. Considering the difference in CFR response between GFL and GFM WTs, a hierarchical CFR controller is designed to achieve optimal CRT performance by enhancing the CFR capability of GFL and GFM WTs. In the first-layer controller, the output power reference is optimized to suppresses the terminal voltage fluctuation of WTs, which is used as input to the second-layer controller. In the second-layer controller, the virtual impedance, virtual inertia, voltage loop integral parameters, and weak magnetic current (WMC) are regulated to suppress output frequency fluctuations and improve the voltage support capacity by fully utilizing the kinetic energy storage capability for GFM WTs. For GFL WTs, active power, reactive power (Var), and WMC are regulated optimized to minimizing the voltage deviation while fully utilizing the kinetic energy storage capability. The simulations in MATLAB prove the superiority of the proposed HOCFR method than other existing control schemes."

Specifically, for unlabeled RS images, a multi-domain CutMix hybrid strong augmentation strategy (MCS) is proposed. This strategy performs adaptive region masking operations, based on the traditional CutMix strategy, to enlarge the model’s perturbation space. In addition, considering that single weak-to-strong consistency learning is not enough to help the model capture richer contextual information, this study introduces prototype-based prediction result consistency (PBC) to reduce the model’s dependence on weak-to-strong consistency. Finally, a class-adaptive entropy mapping (CAEM) method is proposed to refine noise filtering for each type of result and guide the model to optimize in the right direction. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing advanced methods on six mainstream RS image datasets: Vaihingen, MER, MSL, GID-15, iSAID, and DFC22.

    "abstract": "In recent years, with the explosive growth of terminal-side data, semantic communication (SemCom) has emerged as a promising solution to reduce the volume of transmitted data. However, the performance of deep learning(DL)-based semantic communication systems heavily relies on the computational capabilities of intelligent devices. Motivated by this, this letter proposes a lightweight Prompt-based Deep Separable Convolution Semantic Communication model (PDSC-SemCom). Specifically, PDSC-SemCom constructs a semantic decoder based on prompt learning with deep separable convolution (DS-Conv1D) and introduces a degradation-aware clustering routing mechanism. By integrating image degradation information with semantic information, it reorders the feature sequences accordingly. Subsequently, prompts guide the lightweight DS-Conv1D to focus on processing sequence segments that are both heavily degraded and semantically rich. Experimental results demonstrate that, for both image and text transmission tasks, PDSC-SemCom achieves competitive recovery performance while maintaining low computational overhead."

A bidirectional DC-DC converter supports regenerative braking and stabilizes the DC link voltage. Motor control is achieved through a lookup table-based vector control strategy that adapts to inverter constraints. Rotor position is estimated using a hybrid approach combining a hyperbolic function-based super-twisting sliding mode observer, a hybrid second-third-order generalized integrator, and a pseudo-linear enhanced phase-locked loop. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed method reduces chattering, eliminates DC offsets, and ensures accurate rotor position detection across varying back EMF levels, enhancing the drive system's efficiency and performance."

While prior visualization research has explored data and task abstractions for genomics, the design space for depicting these three-dimensional (3D) genome models—and associated genome mapped data—remains unclear. In this paper, we investigate the visualization of genomic data with a spatial component. First, we systematically survey how 3D genome models are used and depicted in computational biology. We analyze over 300 papers with figures that visualize 3D genomic data and categorize the methods for visual representation. From this survey, we derive a design space for visualizing 3D genome data, identifying common patterns and key properties such as representation, visual channels, and composition. We position these findings within an existing genomics visualization taxonomy, refining and extending existing classifications. Second, we augment Gosling, a declarative visualization grammar for genomics, to support 3D genomic data. Our integration enables expressive authoring of visualizations that connect traditional genome-mapped information with 3D genome models, emphasizing their spatial characteristics. To demonstrate its utility, we employ our extended grammar to recreate interactive examples, showcasing its ability to represent complex visual designs. Comprehensive examples and an interactive editor are available at 3d.gosling-lang.org."

Since such band structures are not well-defined in silicon nanosheets, we should continue a modern fashioned investigation with no effective masses for near future."

    "abstract": "Sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) is an advanced statistical framework that dominantly enhances the sparse features of targets of interest in radar imagery. A widely adopted strategy for posterior approximation in SBL is the variational Bayesian (VB) inference, which circumvents the intractable high-dimensional integrals involved in direct posterior computation and yields closed-form expressions for the posterior moments. However, conventional VB inference suffers from computationally expensive matrix inversions, particularly in high-resolution radar imaging scenarios. To this end, a matrix-inversion-free SBL (MIF-SBL) method via improved VB inference is proposed. Within this framework, the sparsity-inducing hierarchical scheme based on the scaled Gaussian mixture model is retained, while explicit matrix inversion is replaced by solving a series of linear problems, which are efficiently handled via matrix–matrix multiplications. The proposed method reduces the computational cost by eliminating the need for direct matrix inversion, especially for the reconstruction of high-resolution radar imagery. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real radar datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves improved computational efficiency while maintaining reconstruction accuracy comparable to conventional SBL."

    "abstract": "As intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has emerged as a new and promising technology capable of configuring the wireless environment favorably, channel estimation for IRS-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems has garnered extensive attention in recent years. Despite the development of numerous algorithms to address this challenge, a comprehensive theoretical characterization of the optimal recovery error is still lacking. This paper aims to address this gap by providing theoretical guarantees in terms of stable recovery of channel matrices for noisy measurements. We begin by establishing the equivalence between IRS-assisted MIMO systems in the uplink scenario and a compact tensor train (TT)-based tensor-on-tensor (ToT) regression. Building on this equivalence, we then investigate the restricted isometry property (RIP) for complex-valued subgaussian measurements. Our analysis reveals that successful recovery hinges on the relationship between the number of user terminals and the number of time slots during which channel matrices remain invariant. Utilizing the RIP condition, we establish a theoretical upper bound on the recovery error for solutions to the constrained least-squares optimization problem, as well as a minimax lower bound for the considered model. Our analysis demonstrates that the recovery error decreases inversely with the number of time slots, and increases proportionally with the total number of unknown entries in the channel matrices, thereby quantifying the fundamental trade-offs in channel estimation accuracy. In addition, we explore a multi-hop IRS scheme and analyze the corresponding recovery errors. Finally, we have performed numerical experiments to support our theoretical findings."

The MLA architecture extends the aperture length of a standard ULA without adding additional antennas, thereby enabling near-field beamfocusing without increasing processing complexity. Unlike conventional far-field beamforming, near-field beamfocusing enables simultaneous data transmission to multiple users at different distances in the same angular interval, offering significant multiplexing gains. We present a detailed mathematical analysis of the beamwidth and beamdepth achievable with the MLA and show that by appropriately selecting the number of antennas in each constituent ULA, ideal near-field beamfocusing can be realized. In addition, we propose a computationally efficient localization method that fuses estimates from each ULA, enabling efficient parametric channel estimation. Simulation results confirm the accuracy of the analytical expressions and that MLAs achieve near-field beamfocusing with a limited number of antennas, making them a promising solution for next-generation wireless systems."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel generative artificial intelligence (GAI)-aided approach to address the quality of experience (QoE)-aware resource allocation for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted digital twin (DT) interactions with uncertain evolutions. In the considered system, mobile users interact with a DT model, referring to the high-fidelity and interactive virtual counterpart of a physical entity, hosted by a DT server deployed on a wireless base station via the assistance of an RIS, for gaining DT services, such as real-time monitoring and predictive analytics. Noted that DT interactions involve round-trip communications with both uplink and downlink, and concern not only objective performance but also subjective experience. As such, we formulate an optimization problem for RIS-assisted DT interactions, aiming to maximize the sum of all mobile users' mixed objective and subjective QoE, by jointly determining the phase shift marix, receive/transmit beamforming matrices, feedback signal rendering resolution and computing resource configuration. Further taking into account the DT model's uncertain evolutions and the resulted variations of the DT scene that mobile users engage in, we extend the resource allocation problem to a series of scene-specific ones. To obtain a generalized approach with low complexity, avoiding to re-solve each scene-specific problem whenever the engaged DT scene changes, we develop a GAI-aided approach, called prompt-guided decision transformer integrated with zero-forcing optimization (PG-ZFO). Specifically, in PG-ZFO, we first reformulate each scene-specific problem into a Markov decision process (MDP). Then, we design a “decision-making trajectory” based prompt to capture the scene-specific information and extend the traditional decision transformer to a prompt-guided decision transformer with strong generalization. On top of that, a zero-forcing (ZF)-based optimization algorithm is integrated to help derive high-dimensional decisions, i.e., beamforming matrix, along with the offline training and online execution of PG-ZFO. Simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, and demonstrate its superiority over counterparts, i.e., rigid optimization method and decision transformer without prompt."

    "abstract": "Low-altitude economy (LAE) is an emerging technological paradigm that enables continuous airspace coverage at multiple altitudes by providing highly reliable data connectivity for numerous low-altitude applications. However, existing networks cannot sufficiently support LAE development, as current base stations (BSs) are primarily designed for terrestrial users and lack the capability to provide continuous coverage at low altitudes. To overcome these challenges, rotatable antenna system (RAS) is introduced in LAE, enabling flexible beamforming by dynamically adjusting the boresight of directional antennas to extend low-altitude coverage and enhance the stability of data transmission. In this article, we first provide an overview of RAS-empowered LAE applications, including low-altitude communication, sensing, control, and computation. Then, we present two practical RAS deployment strategies for LAE scenarios, namely RAS-aided multi-BS and multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) cooperative coverages, as well as provide detailed discussions on their system architectures and performance benefits. Additionally, key design issues of RAS in LAE are discussed, including channel modeling and estimation, cellular access and interference cancellation, as well as RAS configuration and boresight optimization. Finally, we demonstrate the performance gains of RAS in LAE networks through experimental and simulation results."

    "abstract": "The rapid proliferation of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices has created unprecedented demands for reliable, low-latency, and high-bandwidth communication networks in healthcare environments. Traditional networking approaches struggle to meet the diverse quality of service requirements of medical applications, ranging from real-time patient monitoring to large-scale medical imaging transfers. Intent-based networking (IBN) emerges as a promising paradigm that translates high-level healthcare network intentions into automated network policies, enabling self-managing and self-optimizing networks. This paper presents a novel intelligent routing framework for IoMT communications based on IBN principles, utilizing a dueling double deep Q-network (DDQN) approach to optimize network resource allocation and routing decisions. The proposed method addresses the multi-objective optimization problem of simultaneously satisfying bandwidth, latency, and reliability requirements for heterogeneous medical traffic flows. We model the IBN routing problem as a reinforcement learning task and develop a dueling DDQN algorithm that learns optimal routing policies through interaction with a network environment model. Comparative analysis against baseline methods reveals 12-42% improvements in medical intent satisfaction across application categories. The framework exhibits robust convergence and maintains advantages across network scales from clinics to enterprise systems. Sensitivity analysis validates optimal bandwidth discretization, balancing efficiency with clinical requirements. Results confirm practical applicability for IoMT deployments where network reliability impacts patient care."

We systematically categorize the enabling technologies—including IoT platforms, edge–cloud orchestration, and cyber–physical system (CPS) integration—and analyze their roles across the DT lifecycle. Furthermore, case-driven evaluations illustrate practical implementation challenges, performance metrics, and deployment strategies. The proposed framework offers a scalable and interoperable blueprint to guide the development of intelligent DT infrastructures for next-generation solar energy systems."

    "abstract": "Mobile Crowd-Sensing (MCS) has emerged as a promising solution for large-scale data collection in Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios. However, the malicious behavior of smart terminals, such as providing corrupted and falsified data or deliberately spreading false data, poses a significant threat to the credibility of MCS services. At present the mainstream trust evaluation schemes evaluate its trust value through the accumulation of terminal interaction experience, but the inherent defects of these schemes will make MCS service suffer serious trust-decaying destruction. And the current trust computing methods do not yet take into account the balance between the quality of service completion and the crowd-sensing collaboration experience of the terminal. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a novel general grey buffer trust evaluation framework (TrustGrey), which is used to evaluate the trust relationship of smart terminals. Specially, we construct the trust value calculation model of grey trust state for smart terminal to make up for the inherent defects of normal trust value calculation model. The grey buffer of sudden drop is designed in the trust value calculation model to avoid trust-decaying destruction. And we design a quick recovery mechanism of grey buffer to avoid detecting false alarm caused by the sudden drop of trust, as well as avoiding the loss of multiple damage of intelligent malicious terminal by an irreversible black value reduction mechanism. Then, we design a supply-demand equilibrium based dynamic recruitment mechanism to dynamically coordinate the recruitment process of service requests by comprehensively considering the importance level of service requests and the credibility of terminals, so as to balance the experience of service originators and completion parties. Experiments on real word datasets highlight the advantages of our proposed framework TrustGrey. And, the experiments also show that TrustGrey has considerable versatility."

    "abstract": "Diffusion Tensor Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DTI) is a non-invasive technique for studying brain structure in vivo by measuring the diffusion properties of water molecules. Unlike conventional medical imaging that captures scalar intensity data, DTI data is typically stored as a 4D volume, where each voxel in 3D space is a 3×3 Cartesian tensor. DTI characterizes tensor-based diffusion profiles and captures information about the orientation of fiber bundles. During the alignment process, voxels need to be spatially transformed while maintaining the correspondence of tensor orientations, which leads to complex computations. Traditional DTI registration methods often suffer from slow iteration speed and low accuracy, posing challenges for clinical applications. In this paper, a novel DTI Registration method Based on Parallel Dual-channel Voxel Morph (DTI-RBPDV) is proposed. The core of the method is a two-branch convolutional neural network architecture. With a view to enhancing the alignment performance, it processes two input patterns simultaneously: (1) fractional anisotropy (FA) images and (2) principal eigenvectors from to-be-aligned and fixed DTI volumes to enhance the accuracy of deformation field prediction. In the network decoder layer, integration of attention mechanisms has also been implemented. These channel space attention modules dynamically highlight salient anatomical features and orientation consistency, improving the model's sensitivity to key structural alignments. Experimental results show that DTI-RBPDV effectively addresses the limitations of slow iterative computation and the challenges of applying deep learning to high-dimensional DTI data by significantly improving the registration accuracy and computational speed."

    "abstract": "LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO) has demonstrated robust real-time capability and efficient mapping performance compared to traditional terrestrial laser scanners. Although recent advances driven by public datasets have improved LIO stability under certain degraded conditions, existing studies still lack systematic validation in real-world scenarios. Key challenges include long-duration sequences, combined degradation factors, and seamless indoor-outdoor transitions. This gap limits their applicability to general-purpose, high-precision mapping. To bridge this gap, we present a large-scale, high-precision LIO dataset collected in four diverse real-world environments, covering areas ranging from 60,000 to 750,000 m2. The dataset was collected with a custom backpack-mounted platform equipped with two multi-beam rotating LiDAR sensors, an industrial-grade IMU, and RTK-GNSS modules, achieving precise spatiotemporal alignment via hardware-level synchronization and rigorous calibration. The dataset encompasses a variety of environments, including structured buildings, tunnels, slopes, and urban scenes, to support seamless indoor-outdoor mapping. Each sequence has an average length of 1,500 m and comprises over 15,000 frames per sequence, exceeding the scale of most public LiDAR-IMU datasets. We also propose a 6-DoF ground-truth generation pipeline that fuses SLAM-based optimization with RTK-GNSS anchoring. Using oblique photogrammetry integrated with RTKGNSS measurements, we obtain georeferenced maps at a realworld scale. These maps are then used to align the LiDAR reconstructions and to validate the centimeter-level accuracy (< 3 cm) of the generated trajectories. This dataset advances the state of the art in trajectory length, scene complexity, and ground-truth precision, providing a comprehensive dataset for evaluating LIO systems and improving their generalization to practical high-precision mapping scenarios. We release the dataset, which can be obtained from the following link: https: //github.com/CNITECH-CV-LAB/Backpack2025"

    "abstract": "Quadruped robots have received increasing attention in recent years. Most existing trajectory planning algorithms for quadruped robots focus on how to avoid obstacles and achieve shortest trajectory or time, which is similar to the planning algorithms for mobile robots. These algorithms could not take full advantage of the agility and flexibility of quadruped robots. This letter designs a trajectory planner by taking advantage of the agility and flexibility of quadruped robots. With our trajectory, quadruped robots could navigate through complex terrains with more stability (e.g., less momentum variations along Z-axis). To achieve this goal, we use ground features at the landing point of the feet end to construct objective function, rather than using the center point of the robot body. Current discrete map representations, such as grid map or cost map, are difficult for optimization algorithms to introduce environment constraints. So, we use the Sparse Variational Gaussian Process (SVGP) to predict terrain features with point-cloud data as input, so that the environment constraints can be introduced into the optimization problem. Experimental results in both simulation and real-world environments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."

    "abstract": "Dynamic many-objective optimization problems (DMaOPs) are a class of problems involving more than three objectives. Their objective functions, search space, or constraints may change over time. Dynamic many-objective evolutionary algorithms (DMaOEAs) are typically used to solve DMaOPs and primarily consist of a static optimizer, a change detection mechanism, and a change response mechanism. In this paper, a new hybrid DMaOEA based on the reference vector guided evolutionary algorithm (RVEA) and the grid-based evolutionary algorithm (GrEA), called the dynamic reference vector and grid-based evolutionary algorithm (DRVGrEA), is proposed. In the selection stage of DRVGrEA, a new dynamic angle-penalized distance (DAPD) is introduced to balance convergence and diversity uniformly across all dynamic environments of the problem. At this stage, the GrEA grid-based indicators are still used as a secondary selection mechanism. These mechanisms are applied to different parts of the solutions. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, several experiments were conducted that compared DRVGrEA with six DMaOEAs, including five based on classical algorithms from the literature and one recently proposed method. The experiments used the SDP1–15 benchmark with 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 15 objectives. The results demonstrate that DRVGrEA outperforms or at least matches the performance of the other DMaOEAs. Furthermore, DRVGrEA was also applied to a real-world control problem, namely the PID tuning of an Automatic Voltage Regulator system, where it achieved superior performance compared to all competing algorithms."

Factors limiting the measurement accuracy are discussed. The first of them is a low class of the EMF standards applied for the meter calibration. A block diagram of a typical meter is presented and the significance of the separate blocks in the accuracy budget is discussed. The measurement accuracy may be limited by the susceptibility of those blocks to the EMF. Problems with the experience of measuring person (-s) are mentioned. An accuracy budget is estimated, indicating an uncertainty (RMSE) of about ±17%, while monochromatic field intensity is measured.

The B-H curve of the core material is known to change significantly due to various manufacturing processes such as laser cutting, machining and annealing. The air-gap, which is only a few hundreds of microns and the smallest among geometric parameters, is susceptible to manufacturing errors, tolerances and surface roughness. This paper proposes an analytical method to estimate the effective air-gap length using the measured aligned inductance and an analytical expression for the air-gap permeance at this rotor position. The air-gap estimate could be improved with knowledge of the unsaturated relative permeability of the core material. With this estimated aligned inductance and measured flux-linkage characteristics of the SRM at the fully aligned position, the B-H characteristic of the core material, post the manufacturing processes, could be obtained. The proposed estimation methods are validated on a 7.5 kW, 30,000 rpm, 6/4-pole, 3-phase SRM prototype. The inductance profile, predicted by FEA with the estimated air-gap agrees well with the measured inductance profile. The FEA-predicted static torque characteristics using the estimated air-gap and B-H curve tallies reasonably well the experimentally obtained torque characteristics, confirming the accuracy of the estimates."

The DE strategy enhances population diversity and global search capability, while the GD strategy improves local search efficiency and solution accuracy. Experimental evaluations on the CEC2005 test set (18 functions) and CEC2022 benchmark functions indicate that DGAHA achieves an average solution accuracy improvement of 20%-35% over other algorithms. Applied to the multi-UAV path planning task, the proposed DGAHA method effectively generates feasible and smooth flight paths, reducing path length by 28.5%-44.4% and improving trajectory smoothness by 30.2%-46.3%, with smaller standard deviations and faster convergence speeds, demonstrating significant potential for practical applications."

This paper provides an answer by introducing a new framework called <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Actor-Critic Model Predictive Control</i>. The key idea is to embed a differentiable MPC within an actor-critic RL framework. This integration allows for short-term predictive optimization of control actions through MPC, while leveraging RL for end-to-end learning and exploration over longer horizons. Through various ablation studies, conducted in the context of agile quadrotor racing, we expose the benefits of the proposed approach: it achieves better out-of-distribution behaviour, better robustness to changes in the quadrotor's dynamics and improved sample efficiency. Additionally, we conduct an empirical analysis using a quadrotor platform that reveals a relationship between the critic's learned value function and the cost function of the differentiable MPC, providing a deeper understanding of the interplay between the critic's value and the MPC cost functions. Finally, we validate our method in a drone racing task on different tracks, in both simulation and the real world. Our method achieves the same superhuman performance as state-of-the-art model-free RL, showcasing speeds of up to 21 m/s. We show that the proposed architecture can achieve real-time control performance, learn complex behaviors via trial and error, and retain the predictive properties of the MPC to better handle out-of-distribution behavior."

    "abstract": "This paper studies a heterogeneous three-agent pursuit-evasion scenario in which a sensor–attacker team attempts to capture an active target capable of changing its heading at fixed time intervals. The sensor has a limited sensing range, and the attacker must intercept the target before it escapes sensing. We formulate this problem as a game of kind and extend the optimal sensor and attacker strategies from prior work on passive targets to the active target setting. The sensor updates its heading in each interval by assuming that the target will keep its heading fixed for the rest of the engagement, while the attacker uses an Apollonius circle-based approach for minimum-time interception and updating its heading corresponding to the target heading in every interval. We show that the conditions for capture or escape of a passive target also extend to the case of an active target. In particular, if the speed of the active target is less than a critical value identified for passive targets in our prior work, then capture is guaranteed."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose UniqueSplat, a view-conditioned feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting model to reconstruct customized 3D radiance fields for each view query. Existing feed-forward methods such as pixelSplat and MVS-plat aim to generate fixed Gaussians across all views of each scene by minimizing the error between rendered views and ground-truth images. However, such fixed Gaussians generally render images from all views and lack the ability to adapt to specific viewpoints, as they do not incorporate target view information when predicting Gaussians. To address this, our UniqueSplat learns the view-conditioned information as a prior and incorporates this knowledge into network parameters, so that Gaussians are dynamically adjusted in accordance with different views. Specifically, we propose a two-branch view-conditioned hyperNetwork to simultaneously learn view-agnostic embeddings and view-specific knowledge, which not only explores the shareable knowledge from various views, but also adapts the model to specific views at test time. Extensive experiments on widely-used datasets including RealEstate10K, ACID and DTU demonstrate the superiority of UniqueSplat over the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, UniqueSplat encouragingly outperforms existing methods in cross-dataset evaluation, showing its notable generalization ability."

    "abstract": "Pathological tremor affects over 40 million people worldwide, significantly impairing daily activities and quality of life. Pharmacological treatments show limited efficacy, with up to 30% discontinuation rates, while surgical interventions like deep brain stimulation achieve significant tremor reduction but are often unsuitable due to age, comorbidities, or personal preference. Recently, the need for safe and effective alternatives has led to the development of innovative, noninvasive, and patient-friendly technologies for tremor management. This clinical application review analyzed 134 studies (1969-2025), categorizing them into three major modalities, focusing on their underlying neurophysiological mechanisms, with a special emphasis on the clinical perspective. The three considered modalities were force-controlling (orthoses and functional electrical stimulation), central neuromodulation (transcranial magnetic stimulation, transcranial electrical stimulation, low-intensity focused ultrasound, and transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation), and peripheral neuromodulation (afferent stimulation and vibration). Force-controlling strategies showed promising acute effects, though clinical translation remains limited by poor wearability and the development of muscle fatigue. Central neuromodulation produced moderate effects, while peripheral neuromodulation has gained clinical traction, with several devices now being commercially available. However, heterogeneity in study design, patient populations, and technology maturity remain the main obstacles for the direct comparison of techniques. Future research should prioritize larger multicenter trials, standardized outcome measures, and accessibility considerations to enable personalized, evidence-based treatment selection for diverse tremor populations."

A voltage-tunable spectral range with a wavelength shift of 1 nm, corresponding to EO tuning efficiency of 0.5 nm/V is reported.

The current P2P energy trading solutions have performance limitations in supporting trading among large-scale prosumers. This paper proposes a new P2P energy trading system that features a multi-layer holonic structure. Based on the real-time operational condition, the system dynamically forms prosumer coalitions at different scales in a bottom-up manner, supporting on-demand P2P energy trading among prosumers in different geographical locations in an urban system. A multi-level coalition formation scheme and a peer-matching scheme are proposed to facilitate this process, and an incentive communication-enabled deep reinforcement learning-based approach is developed to enable individual prosumers to make energy trading decisions that account for multifaceted influencing factors. Besides, a power flow-aware energy trading adjustment scheme is integrated to ensure the settlement feasibility of the energy trading transactions. Numerical simulations are conducted on an IEEE benchmark system and real-world datasets to validate the proposed system."

Unlike conventional lightning surge studies based on generic thunderstorm conditions, this study develops a novel modeling framework rooted in atmospheric pyroCb thundercloud dynamics. A numerical model is employed to simulate downward leader propagation in pyroCb lightning via the dielectric breakdown model, explicitly coupling charge structure, wind-shear-driven displacement, and leader dynamics with surge analysis. Results show wind shear extensions of 0–12 km significantly influence charge distribution and lightning type, shifting from intracloud to negative cloud-to-ground (–CG) discharges as initiation potential changes from 49.34 MV (4 km extension) to –450.69 MV (12 km extension). Findings indicate that CG flashes predominantly strike within 26–27 km, emphasizing charge density variations in leader development. The extracted return stroke current, peaking at 350 kA, is modeled as a MATLAB time-series function and applied to a grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) system to analyze surge effects. Results show pyroCb lightning surges propagate through electrical networks, causing extreme overvoltages, equipment failure, and operational disruptions. By directly linking pyroCb atmospheric processes with renewable energy infrastructure response, this study makes the first integrated assessment of bushfire-driven lightning surges on PV systems. These findings emphasize the need to assess renewable energy infrastructure vulnerabilities to extreme weather-driven lightning events. By clarifying leader dynamics and surge impacts, this study advances lightning protection research and highlights the importance of robust mitigation strategies to safeguard electrical systems against pyroCb lightning hazards."

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of remote sensing technology, effectively managing and retrieving vast quantities of remote sensing images has become an urgent challenge. For complex remote sensing images, multi-label annotation provides more precise scene characterization. However, existing methods inadequately model inter-label dependencies, suffer from computationally intensive feature extraction, and scale poorly to large-scale datasets, which collectively hinders their real-world deployment. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel hashing method for multi-label remote sensing image retrieval, which introduces a structured semantic dictionary to guide both feature extraction and hash code learning. The proposed framework features three dedicated components that work synergistically: a label dependency modeling module that constructs a semantic dictionary to explicitly capture inter-label correlations; a spatial-aware feature extractor based on an enhanced FasterNet, which dynamically balances local and global feature representation; and a semantic-dictionary guided joint loss function that aligns image representations with the semantic dictionary while ensuring hash code compactness and discreteness. By integrating structured semantic knowledge directly into the optimization process, our method learns highly discriminative hash codes. Extensive validation on the UCMD, AID, and MLRSNet multi-label datasets demonstrates the method's effectiveness in retrieving images with diverse and complex label combinations. Through unified feature-semantic optimization, this work provides a practical and effective solution for high-precision retrieval in large-scale remote sensing images."

    "abstract": "Transcranial AC stimulation (tACS) of the cerebellum can entrain spiking activity in the Purkinje cells (PCs) of the cerebellar cortex and, through their projections, the cells in the cerebellar nuclei (CN). In this paper, we investigated if the cells in the motor thalamus (Mthal) can also be modulated (i.e. spikes entrained) via the CN-Mthal projections in rodents. A total of 82 thalamic cells were found, presumably in the Mthal by their stereotaxic coordinates, that were modulated by tACS of the cerebellum. Out of the 346 cells isolated, the thalamic cells with shorter action potentials and regular firing patterns had a higher probability of modulation by cerebellar stimulation than the cells with wider action potentials. The modulation level had a tuning curve with a maximum around 100-200 Hz. Spike histograms over the stimulation cycle transitioned between unimodal and bimodal distributions depending on the frequency. Most cells had a unimodal distribution at low frequencies, a bimodal distribution for frequencies between 80-125 Hz, and then a unimodal one for frequencies above 150 Hz. In addition, tACS of the motor cortex (MC) was also tested in a subset of thalamic cells. Unlike cerebellar stimulation, modulation levels peaked at two distinct frequencies, presumably due to entrainment through multiple MC-Mthal pathways with different preferred frequencies. The results demonstrate the feasibility of modulating a deep brain structure such as the thalamus through multi-synaptic pathways by stimulation of the cerebellar cortex (and the motor cortex) using a non-invasive neuromodulation method."

    "abstract": "Wireless sensing has recently found widespread applications in diverse environments, including homes, offices, and public spaces. By analyzing patterns in channel state information (CSI), it is possible to infer human actions for tasks such as person identification, gesture recognition, and fall detection. However, CSI is highly sensitive to environmental changes, where even minor alterations can significantly distort the CSI patterns. This sensitivity often leads to performance degradation or outright failure when applying wireless sensing models trained in one environment to another. To address this challenge, Domain Alignment Learning (DAL) has been widely adopted for cross-domain classification tasks, as it focuses on aligning the global distributions of the source and target domains in feature space. Despite its popularity, DAL often neglects inter-category relationships, which can lead to misalignment between categories across domains, even when global alignment is achieved. To overcome these limitations, we propose K-Nearest Neighbors Maximum Mean Discrepancy (KNN-MMD), a novel few-shot method for cross-domain wireless sensing. Our approach begins by constructing a “help set” using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) from the target domain, enabling local alignment between the source and target domains within each category using Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). Additionally, we address a key instability issue commonly observed in cross-domain methods, where model performance fluctuates sharply between epochs. Further, most existing methods struggle to determine an optimal stopping point during training due to the absence of labeled data from the target domain. Our method resolves this by excluding the support set from the target domain during training and employing it as a validation set to determine the stopping criterion. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method across several cross-domain Wi-Fi sensing tasks, including gesture recognition, person identification, fall detection, and action recognition, using both a public dataset and a self-collected dataset. In a one-shot scenario, our method achieves accuracy rates of 93.26%, 81.84%, 77.62%, and 75.30% for the respective tasks.

This paper presents a segmentation-based approach for detecting unmarked road boundaries using a YOLOv8 model trained on custom dash-camera footage captured in varied daytime lighting conditions. The dataset is manually annotated with polygon-based segmentation using the computer vision annotation tool to capture the diverse appearances of rural road edges, including irregular terrains and undefined boundaries. These annotations were initially exported in common-objects-in-context segmentation format and later converted to the YOLOv8 segmentation format. A medium-sized YOLOv8 segmentation model was trained locally on this dataset. The objective is to build a system that could work in real-time and accurately present the unmarked road boundaries in unpredictable rural terrains. The model showed promising results on the validation set, performing consistently even in unpredictable terrains and uneven road surfaces, and a real-time prototype was also developed to test the model live, using phone-camera video as input for inference and visualization. This approach demonstrates the potential for a lightweight deep learning model to support real-time road boundary detection in unstructured, low-infrastructure driving environments."

These methods assign weights inversely proportional to the estimated mean squared error (MSE), thereby minimizing both error variance and squared bias simultaneously. We further present a theoretical analysis of the root mean squared error (RMSE) associated with the proposed methods. Additionally, the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is derived using a one-hot encoding framework tailored for the mixed LOS/NLOS noise model. Simulation results demonstrate that all three methods outperform conventional techniques in terms of RMSE, confirming their effectiveness in mixed LOS/NLOS environments."

Fabrication of the F–P microcavity array involves only film deposition and UV photolithography techniques in an elaborately designed multiple–step processing flow.

This paper proposes an active learning–based corpus construction method for multi-speaker TTS. The proposed framework automatically acquires and selects additional data based on the training and evaluation results of the TTS model, enabling efficient corpus expansion. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model-aware corpus construction approach outperforms conventional static sampling and evaluation-in-the-loop methods, achieving consistent improvements in both naturalness and recognition accuracy. Step-wise analysis further reveals that quality filtering and data acquisition contribute to learning improvements in complementary ways. Overall, this study advances TTS corpus construction from a static preparation process to a model-evolving learning process, laying the foundation for data-efficient and self-improving speech synthesis systems."

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed learning framework that enables collaborative training of a global model across multiple IoT devices while preserving the privacy of local data. However, this collaborative paradigm also introduces security challenges to the global model. Compromised IoT devices can carry out data poisoning attacks on their local data, uploading malicious model gradients to the cloud server and ultimately degrading the global model performance. Most existing data poisoning methods focus primarily on maximizing attack effectiveness, causing a significant drop in global model accuracy, while often neglecting the stealthiness of the attack. This leads to malicious updates being easily detected and filtered, reducing their threat in IoT deployments. To fill this gap, we propose a stealthy data poisoning method based on a dynamic generator. The approach dynamically generates perturbations with gradient-level stealthiness, achieving a trade-off between poisoning effectiveness and stealthiness in realistic IoT settings. We conducted comprehensive experiments on 3 public IoT datasets: with 30% malicious clients, our attack reduces global accuracy by 10.78% on DeepHealth, 6.07% on ChestMNIST and 7.81% on SVHN, achieving degradation comparable to baselines while preserving stealthiness at the gradient level. To counter this threat, We propose PCATrace, a trajectory-based defense that consistently detects and removes malicious clients across different attack ratios, effectively preventing poisoned updates from degrading the global model."

    "abstract": "Wireless sensor networks (WSN) are essential for monitoring operations, environmental conditions, and ensuring worker safety in underground mining environments. A key challenge in deploying these networks lies in achieving sufficient sensor coverage and reliable connectivity to enable early incident detection and timely response. While existing approaches primarily focus on deployment efficiency, this paper introduces a safety-driven optimization model that accounts for the complete underground mine structure and its specific operational conditions. The proposed algorithm minimizes the number of deployed nodes—reducing capital expenditure (CAPEX)—while meeting occupational safety standards by ensuring sensor coverage at critical points of interest and maintaining network connectivity. Compared to existing models, our method reduces the number of required nodes by up to 82%, while satisfying both k-coverage and k-connectivity requirements. Unlike conventional strategies based on idealized assumptions, our approach is tailored to the real-world conditions of Colombian underground mines. Simulation results demonstrate that achieving connectivity demands more nodes than coverage when both are evaluated under equivalent conditions. The algorithm was validated in two prototype mines, achieving <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</i> = 2 for both coverage and connectivity—ensuring that each point of interest is monitored by at least two sensors and connected via two link-disjoint communication paths. This redundancy enhances fault tolerance by providing backup for both sensing and communication. Finally, we introduce two new metrics for evaluating k-coverage and k-connectivity, designed to assess the robustness of WSN in underground mining and tunnel environments."

Despite notable progress, existing methods often struggle to capture both the fine-grained spatial details and the complex temporal dynamics of sign gestures, especially under rapid motion and subtle inter-class variations. To address these challenges, we propose Hybrid Attention Guided Framewise Temporal Reasoning for Sign Language Recognition (HAFTR-SLR), a tri-modal framework that jointly leverages RGB, skeleton, and optical flow modalities through a hybrid attention guided architecture. The RGB and optical flow streams capture appearance and motion cues, while the skeleton stream models structural hand–body dynamics. A Cross-Transformer Fusion mechanism aligns inter-modal dependencies, and a hybrid attention-based fusion emphasizes complementary features across modalities. Furthermore, an adaptive crucial frame selection strategy minimizes temporal redundancy while preserving salient motion information. Experimental evaluations on Include-50 and SMILE-DSGS-50-50 datasets demonstrate that HAFTR-SLR consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art models across multiple metrics, confirming its robustness and efficiency in modeling multimodal gesture semantics."

While state-of-the-art solutions mitigate this by adding complexity around the amplifier—such as active reset, blanking, or digital cancellation—they introduce trade-offs like data loss or computational overhead. In a distinct departure from these approaches, this paper solves the problem at its root by introducing a state-aware feedback element: a self-adaptive pseudo-resistor (A-PR). The A-PR architecture integrates two key innovations: an adaptive Floating Power Supply (FPS) that senses DC errors and autonomously collapses the feedback resistance for rapid recovery, and a process-insensitive Self-Biased Current Source (SBCS) that ensures robust, uniform performance against PVT variations. A complete neural recording front-end featuring the A-PR was fabricated in a 40-nm CMOS process.

Furthermore, the workload intensity within the model varies based on the target mechanism, making it difficult to build an optimized recommendation system. In this paper, we propose SCRec, a scalable computational storage recommendation system that can handle TB-scale industrial DLRMs while guaranteeing high bandwidth requirements. SCRec utilizes a software framework that features a mixed-integer programming (MIP)-based cost model, efficiently fetching data based on data access patterns and adaptively configuring memory-centric and compute-centric cores. Additionally, SCRec integrates hardware acceleration cores to enhance DLRM computations, particularly allowing for the high-performance reconstruction of approximated embedding vectors from extremely compressed tensor-train (TT) format. By combining its software framework and hardware accelerators, while eliminating data communication overhead by being implemented on a single server, SCRec achieves substantial improvements in DLRM inference performance. It delivers up to 55.77× speedup compared to a CPU-DRAM system with no loss in accuracy and up to 13.35× energy efficiency gains over a multi-GPU system."

    "abstract": "Sequential change detection is a fundamental problem in statistics and signal processing, with the CUSUM procedure widely used to achieve minimax detection delay under a prescribed false-alarm rate when pre- and post-change distributions are fully known. However, releasing CUSUM statistics and the corresponding stopping time directly can compromise individual data privacy. We therefore introduce a differentially private (DP) variant, called DP-CUSUM, that injects calibrated Laplace noise into both the vanilla CUSUM statistics and the detection threshold, preserving the recursive simplicity of the classical CUSUM statistics while ensuring per-sample differential privacy. We derive closed-form bounds on the average run length to false alarm and on the worst-case average detection delay, explicitly characterizing the trade-off among privacy level, false-alarm rate, and detection efficiency. Our theoretical results imply that under a weak privacy constraint, our proposed DP-CUSUM procedure achieves the same first-order asymptotic optimality as the classical, non-private CUSUM procedure. Numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the detection efficiency of our proposed DP-CUSUM under different privacy constraints, and the results are consistent with our theoretical findings."

Unlike previous studies, we reduce the voltage charged in the capacitor according to the status of the volatile contents to be protected. The proposed method is implemented in an SSD platform prototype. We successfully verified the feasibility of synchronized control of the capacitor voltage and volatile contents. The experimental result shows that the proposed method can reduce the capacitor voltage by 33% on average, corresponding to a 2.27 times longer lifetime and 41% reduction of leakage-induced energy loss. Finally, we can reduce the over-design factor by 36% of the fixed voltage setup."

    "abstract": "Decoding fine motor movements, such as finger trajectories, from brain signals poses a critical challenge for brain-computer interface (BCI) systems, particularly when employing electrocorticography (ECoG) because of its inherent signal complexity and inter-subject variability. Although traditional machine learning and deep learning methods have advanced coarse motor control, they often fall short in capturing and generalizing. To address these limitations, we propose DeepFingerNet– a novel architecture based on nested U-Nets designed specifically for ECoG-based finger trajectory prediction. DeepFingerNet enhances feature extraction and fusion by leveraging nested skip connections, which effectively integrate low-level spatial details with high-level abstract representations. We employ a hybrid loss function, combining cosine similarity and mean squared error, to optimize the direction and magnitude of the decoded trajectories. Evaluations on two publicly available ECoG datasets demonstrate the model’s effectiveness, achieving correlation coefficients of 0.69 (a 17% improvement over baseline methods) on BCI Competition IV Dataset 4 and 0.54 (a 5% improvement) on the Stanford University dataset, respectively. These results underscore DeepFingerNet’s potential to significantly improve the reliability and precision of fine finger predictions from ECoG measurements, thereby supporting advanced applications in neuroprosthetics and human-machine interaction."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "In the field of rotating machinery fault diagnosis, the strong external interference and scarce fault data are the two major challenges that make the accurate fault diagnosis is complex. Due to the short service life of faulty components and harsh industrial environments, collecting fault data is difficult and fault data samples are scarce. Moreover, the strong external interference limits the availability of fault data, making it difficult to extract different fault features. The key time-frequency features are masked by the strong external interference, and leading to feature blurring. Therefore, A Domain Adversarial Transfer Diagnosis Method under Strong External Interference Based on Dual-Channel Smoothed Wavelet Network with Dynamic Adaptive Threshold (DCSWN-DATN) is proposed. The adaptive smooth wavelet feature extraction module is designed to solve the ambiguity of time-frequency characteristics by dynamically optimizing the wavelet core parameters. The core is that the module can perform adaptive scale adjustment according to the local characteristics of the signal, and the fault transient state can be captured accurately. The smooth compensation balance is used to suppress the energy leakage of the feature in the time-frequency plane, so as to jointly ensure the continuity and definition of the fault feature and eliminate the ambiguity. In order to solve feature submergence, the median correlation nonlinear adaptive threshold module is proposed by dynamically adjusting the soft and hard threshold boundaries. The importance of signal components can be judged intelligently according to the correlation of features, and the irrelevant noise can be filtered out by the nonlinear adaptive functions, while selectively retaining the potential fault features. This distinguished noise reduction mechanism ensures that the weak but critical fault features are effectively extracted from the strong external interference, thus overcoming feature flooding. In addition, combined with the domain adversarial transfer learning network, the model guided by non-interference data is used to diagnose the strong interference data, which solves the problem of insufficient model performance caused by data scarcity under strong external interference. The strong external interference is suppressed through the parameter adjustable wavelet core, and the cross-interference domain feature distribution is aligned in combination with domain adversarial training to form a collaborative optimization mechanism. A simulation test bench for strong external interference conditions was built to carry out experimental verification. The experimental results show that the proposed method not only solves the problem of fault diagnosis from noninterference data to the fault data with strong interference, but also significantly improves the accuracy and generalization of fault diagnosis of rotating machinery in strong interference environment."

To deal with this issue, we propose a deep learning-enabled pilot-free transmission scheme to increase the throughput of vehicular communications. In our approach, an asymmetrically -shaped constellation enabled by a bit-to-symbol mapper is employed at the transmitter, and a neural network (NN) based two-stage receiver is adopted to reconstruct the transmitted payload data without relying on pilots. In the first stage, by exploiting the asymmetric nature of the constellation, the channel matrix is estimated from the distribution information of received signals, which facilitates preliminary equalization and signal detection. In the second stage, a decision feedback mechanism is applied to refine the estimated channel matrix, thus further improving the accuracy of signal detection. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach compared with traditional pilot-based solutions and existing pilot-free methods in terms of bit error rate and throughput."

Nevertheless, this shift introduces significant security challenges due to the heterogeneity of communications protocols and the vulnerabilities of edge devices. To effectively secure these distributed networks, it is essential to perform multiple traffic analysis tasks, e.g. Network Intrusion Detection, Encrypted Traffic Classification, and Application Traffic Classification. However, existing methods have limited generic feature extraction and require the deployment of multiple models to solve multiple tasks, which exceeds the resource capacity of edge nodes. To address these challenges, we introduce a Lightweight Multitask Traffic Analysis Framework LiMTa, which novelly proposes a traffic pre-training method, FreqRec, and a lightweight multi-task model fine-tune method, MT-Adapter. FreqRec enables high-level semantic feature extraction by reconstructing the frequency features of traffic samples, and MT-Adapter efficiently performs multiple tasks by computing the pre-trained model only once. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on six traffic analysis tasks. Moreover, the MT-Adapter module only fine-tunes a small number of parameters, accounting for only 6.37% of the pre-trained model’s parameters, and achieves the same result as the full fine-tuning. Compared to full fine-tuning, LiMTa reduces the time cost by 50.9% and the space cost by 57.4% in six edge traffic analysis tasks."

However, training DFR models is an arduous task in terms of computational cost, which incurs limitations for practical industrial applications, such as soft measurement models of difficult-to-measure key process indices. Therefore, we propose a lightweight and high-precision DFR (LHDFR) algorithm to (1) shrink model size, (2) reduce computation cost, and (3) improve modeling accuracy simultaneously without increasing calculation operations. This algorithm is implemented simply and effectively in a deep ensemble structure. In particular, we utilize an unbiased estimation to weaken the swamping effect of representation features among cascade layers. Furthermore, two different types of decision tree algorithms are applied to the forest algorithms in each layer. Then, we present a gradient enhancement strategy with a step factor among layers to enhance the accuracy of the model. The shrinking layer-by-layer method is employed to take advantage of the depth of the decision tree. The comparative results based on six benmark datasets and an actual dioxin soft sensing application case on municipal solid waste incineration process demonstrate the superior performance of our LHDFR model."

    "abstract": "Ultrasound imaging is a pivotal diagnostic tool in medical practice due to its non-invasive nature, low cost, and real-time imaging capabilities. However, the images are often affected by various types of noise, significantly degrading image quality and hindering accurate diagnosis. Traditional filtering methods struggle to preserve fine image details, while machine learning and deep learning-based models often lack adaptability to different ultrasound instruments and transducer configurations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep learning-based ultrasound image denoising model. Our model uses a multi-branch convolutional neural network (CNN) structure to configure metadata based on sensor configuration Center Frequency, Element Kerf, Element Width, and Imaging Depth adaptively adjusts the noise level and denoising intensity, effectively suppressing speckle noise and preserving texture details in images from different ultrasound instruments. It is trained and evaluated primarily on ultrasound images synthesized using Coherent Plane Wave Compounding (CPWC), chosen for its standardized and reproducible framework. Despite being trained on CPWC data, our model demonstrates competitive denoising performance for non-CPWC-based ultrasound images, attributing to the shared physical factors influencing speckle generation. The results demonstrate that our model outperforms existing denoising methods, with average SSIM, PSNR and EI values increased by 1.67%, 1.28% and 1.04%, respectively. Additionally, when applied to real breast ultrasound images, our denoising method achieves state-of-the-art results in downstream image classification tasks, significantly improving both accuracy and AUC values. This study holds practical significance in enhancing the quality of ultrasound images for improved clinical diagnosis."

    "abstract": "With the growing demand for dynamic reactive power support in ultra-high-voltage direct current (UHVDC) systems, synchronous condensers play a vital role in grid stability. This study presents a non-intrusive acoustic method for detecting rotor winding inter-turn short-circuit (ITSC) faults. A coupled electromagnetic – structural – acoustic model of a TTS-300-2 condenser is developed to analyze electromagnetic noise under normal, over-, and under-excitation. Both simulation and experiments reveal that ITSC faults generate distinct d/p-order harmonic components and reduce the second-harmonic amplitude, consistent with theoretical predictions of magnetic asymmetry. The proposed approach enables contactless fault detection and offers a practical solution for online condition monitoring of large synchronous condensers."

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenge of multi-object shadow tracking in video synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery, a task complicated by weak texture regions and strong interference. Conventional tracking methods suffer from significant accuracy degradation when dealing with intra-frame shadow disappearance and intersecting trajectories of multiple objects. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel spatiotemporal representation strategy. We first extract spatiotemporal points of shadows from video-SAR images and construct a 3D point cloud in the (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">x</i>, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">y</i>, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t</i>) domain that reflects the spatiotemporal relationships of multiple objects. This representation fundamentally avoids the trajectory intersection issues inherent in traditional track-before-detect (TBD) models. Our method, the ‌spatiotemporal segmentation-based curve-detection neural networks (SS-CDNets), introduces the concept of 3D point cloud segmentation into video-SAR tracking for the first time. The framework consists of two key components: (1) an efficient lightweight weak-texture segmentation network (using MobileNetv2 as the backbone) that converts weakly textured SAR frames into a structured 3D spatiotemporal feature space. Our framework exhibits high tolerance to extraction errors in this stage, allowing for a significant reduction in front-end network complexity without compromising final accuracy. (2) A dynamic graph convolutional neural network (i.e., our curve detection network) is employed to detect and analyze trajectory curves in the (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">x</i>, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">y</i>, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t</i>) point cloud. The EdgeConv operation in this network explicitly constructs local graph structures, models the “line features\" of trajectories and their motion trends, thereby effectively distinguishing neighboring point clusters even at trajectory intersections. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SS-CDNets significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, our approach achieves a MOTA (multi-object tracking accuracy) of 87.26% and an IDF1 (identity F1 score) of 98.10% on the benchmark SNL dataset, surpassing baseline methods such as FairMOT, ByteTrack, and OC-Sort by over 31% and 16%, respectively. These results confirm the effectiveness of our spatiotemporal representation strategy, which integrates a lightweight front-end processing module with a curve detection back-end, in effectively mitigating shadow disappearance effects and enhancing tracking precision in complex SAR operational scenarios."

However, hand-crafting action models for complex problems is often challenging and cumbersome even for experts. To address this, we present Lifted Action Model Learning (LAML), a novel approach for learning planning domains from plan traces obtained by noisy observations of environment states. LAML integrates data lifting, decision-tree learning, and logic induction to derive abstract action models and generate planning domain representations. We evaluate our approach on 23 benchmark domains from the International Planning Competition, comparing its performance to state-of-the-art methods. Our evaluation considers multiple criteria, including domain reconstruction through comparison with reference domains, plan generation feasibility, comparison with historical plans, and plan validation success rate. Experimental results demonstrate that LAML not only reconstructs more accurate action models but also exhibits strong robustness to noise."

In parallel robots, this link between intention and mechanics becomes particularly challenging due to their nonlinear, over-constrained kinematics and the absence of intuitive motor primitives. This letter introduces a passive motion paradigm for parallel robots using self-supervised physics-informed neural networks, which reformulates motion generation as the dynamic unfolding of motor primitives driven by attractor fields in actuator space. Unlike traditional forward or optimization-based formulations, the framework integrates analytical kinematics with neural fields to ensure both physical consistency and adaptive motion generation. The method estimates the Jacobian matrix as a physically constrained neural field, merging analytical structure with data-driven learning to achieve robust and interpretable behavior without relying on iterative numerical solvers. Theoretical analysis, simulations, and physical experiments demonstrate the framework's accuracy, stability, and adaptability across different parallel mechanisms."

Intent-Based Networking (IBN) powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) enables natural language intent translation into executable policies, yet struggles with accuracy in few-shot In-Context Learning (ICL) due to inefficient example retrieval for multi-intent scenarios. To address this issue, we propose SubmodICL, a submodular optimization-based method that retrieves contextual examples to maximize query-guided mutual information, thereby ensuring both coverage and representativeness. Integrated with LLMs, SubmodICL significantly improves intent translation performance. We validate our approach through a use case translating flow-table operation intents into API calls, and evaluate LLMs across different parameter scales. Experiments demonstrate that SubmodICL outperforms baselines by 9.121%–12.377% in accuracy for resource-constrained settings (small LLMs, limited examples, or multi-intent tasks). The proposed method provides a generalizable framework for enhancing intent translation in network automation, with potential applicability to IIoT systems."

Imbalances in cortisol levels can lead to severe health complications, emphasizing the need for continuous monitoring. This paper presents a novel, portable sensing platform for affordable and selective cortisol detection in artificial saliva. The system utilizes cost-effective, wax-printed micro-pads on paper-based substrates, forming a compact colorimetric sensor. By leveraging the blue tetrazolium (BT) reagent, it detects cortisol through a distinct and quantifiable color change. A 3D-printed black box serves as a controlled detection chamber, eliminating the need for bulky traditional devices. An ESP32 microcontroller processes data from an RGB sensor, precisely analyzing color changes on reagent-coated micropads for accurate cortisol quantification. A deep learning regression model deployed directly on the microcontroller, enhances detection accuracy by correlating color intensity with cortisol concentration. The detected cortisol levels are displayed on an OLED screen and sent to a smartphone via bluetooth for seamless storage, stress monitoring, and advanced analysis. Additionally, the system securely stores recorded data for long-term reference. Offering rapid detection within 10 minutes, the system achieves a detection limit (LOD) of 1 ng/mL, a wide detection range of 1– 800 ng/mL, and an R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> value of 0.96, ensuring high precision.

It also supports heterogeneous utility types, including logarithmic utilities common in NUM, and does not assume strict concavity. We implement our method in PyTorch and demonstrate its performance on problems with tens of millions of variables and constraints, achieving 4× to 20× speedups over existing CPU and GPU solvers and solving problem sizes that exhaust the memory of baseline methods. Additionally, our algorithm is robust to congestion and capacity degradation. A time-expanded transit seat allocation case study illustrates how our approach yields interpretable allocations in realistic networks."

    "abstract": "Advances in integrated circuit (IC) technology have amplified the effects of process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations, particularly dynamic IR drop, which severely affects timing. Post-silicon IR drop monitoring circuits are lacking, forcing designers to reserve substantial static guard bands for worst-case scenarios, compromising energy efficiency. Inspired by biomimetics, this paper proposes an Actiniaria-shaped structure for distributed monitoring of multiple IR drop hotspots without invading critical paths (CPs). It comprises “lightweight tentacles + central monitor”. The tentacles use voltage-sensitive cells to sense the impact of IR drop on timing, while also supporting adaptive tuning for global variations. By using on-chip PVT sensors, Actiniaria tracks the timing characteristics of the longest CP in real time under PVT variations. A two-stage pre-warning timing monitor captures timing margins and employs adaptive voltage/frequency scaling (AVFS) strategies to compress redundant guard bands. When applied to an open-source multi-core RISC-V processor fabricated in 22-nm CMOS, Actiniaria achieves a 40.6% reduction in power consumption through non-invasive dynamic IR drop monitoring while having only 0.08% area overhead."

Simulations confirmed that the stacked geometry reduced higher-order dispersion terms and provided an extended anomalous dispersion window compared with conventional single-layer waveguides.

Under 1550 nm femtosecond excitation, the stacked waveguide produced a broadband spectrum spanning ∼1.3 octaves at the 30 dB energy level—the widest SCG bandwidth reported from a stacked geometry to date. These findings establish that stacked dispersion engineering not only enhances spectral flatness but also maximizes usable bandwidth, demonstrating a scalable and CMOS-compatible route toward compact broadband light sources for high-speed optical communication and integrated photonics."

    "abstract": "Ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) is one of the main requirements of fifth-generation (5G) mobile communication systems intended to realize time-sensitive use cases such as autonomous driving, augmented reality, and telemedicine. Extensions to URLLC are currently being considered in 5G-Advanced for the realization of hyper-RLLC (HRLLC) in 6G. Hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) retransmission control based on acknowledgment/negative acknowledgment (ACK/NACK) feedback is widely used to increase transmission reliability in mobile communication. However, conventional HARQ consumes retransmission process times, and the delay time exceeds the latency requirement of URLLC. Therefore, we propose an early retransmission control method based on channel state information, which is suitable for time-division duplex-based URLLC. In addition, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed early HARQ over conventional closed-loop HARQ in freeway-model analyses via numerical simulations. Finally, we show that the proposed method can improve the outage probability of URLLC with a subcarrier spacing of 15, 30, and 60 kHz without increasing the transmission delay time, which is a significant problem with the conventional methods."

    "abstract": "Reliable acoustic instrumentation and measurement in disaster environments is challenging because structure-borne signals from survivors are often masked by highly nonstationary noise from machinery, sirens, and impacts. In particular, phase distortion severely degrades the accuracy of time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) measurements used for source localization. To enhance measurement robustness, this paper introduces Dual-objective Ultra-lightweight Audio Low-power — Rescue-recognition & Enhancement System (DUAL–RES), a lightweight, phase-aware framework for real-time acoustic denoising and event detection. The system operates in the complex short-time Fourier transform (STFT) domain, estimating gain masks for both magnitude and phase components and applying waveform-domain refinement, while an integrated convolutional classifier enables simultaneous detection and characterization of structurally relevant acoustic events. Comprehensive evaluation across three datasets shows that DUAL–RES improves measurement reliability under noise: (1) on VoiceBank + DEMAND, it achieves competitive perceptual metrics with a compact 0.81M-parameter profile; (2) in controlled simulations, it increases classification accuracy at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and reduces phase distortion relative to representative baselines; and (3) on real microphone-array recordings, it preserves localization accuracy close to the unprocessed mixture, avoiding the degradation commonly observed with other denoisers. With real-time inference on embedded platforms such as the Jetson Nano, DUAL–RES provides a practical instrumentation framework for deployable acoustic measurement, monitoring, and event-based detection in disaster scenarios."

    "abstract": "Convergence of nonlinear circuits towards equilibrium points (EPs) is one of the most basic properties both from a theoretic and a practical viewpoint. It is especially relevant for nonlinear circuits modeling neural networks, since a convergent network with multiple stable EPs is tailor made to implement content addressable memories (CAMs) storing multiple patterns as stable EPs or to solve combinatorial optimization problems in real time. Convergence has been widely investigated in the last few decades. By far, the available convergence results can be applied to circuits without memristors, while the study of convergence in presence of memristors is only in its infancy. In this paper, a class of nonlinear circuits containing memristors, capacitors, passive or active resistors and independent sources, is considered. Active resistors are crucial, since they permit to obtain circuits with multiple stable EPs. A number of basic results on convergence are obtained via the flux-charge analysis method (FCAM) and a fundamental reciprocity principle for the considered class of circuits. The conditions for convergence are robust, i.e., they hold also for perturbations of the circuit parameters and memristor nonlinearities involved. The results are illustrated via selected examples where use is made of the celebrated HP memristor model."

In this study, fluorinated polyimide (FPI) films with different fluorine contents were prepared, and a vacuum high-frequency surface discharge testing platform was established to systematically investigate their discharge characteristics. The results show that the introduction of fluorinated groups increases the surface electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity of the films. The discharge inception voltage increased from 1.88 kV for pure PI to 2.38 kV for 50% FPI, with a 26.6% increase. In addition, a non-equilibrium plasma model was constructed to dynamically simulate the formation process of discharge channels and the multiphysical evolution mechanisms. The results reveal that the front region of the discharge channel exhibits a coupled feature of “high density-low temperature-high reaction rate,” with significant electric field shielding and energy dissipation observed at the electron avalanche position. Fluorinated groups effectively suppress the establishment of surface discharge channels by reducing the secondary electron emission yield (SEEY) and dielectric constant, thereby weakening the electron multiplication effect and space charge accumulation. This study, from the perspectives of material regulation and physical mechanisms, provides theoretical support for optimizing the insulation performance of polyimide materials under vacuum high-frequency conditions."

To solve the DF-TDQP problem, a novel direct discretization approach is introduced. Based on this approach, the corresponding discrete-form recurrent neurodynamics (DFRN) model is developed. Furthermore, on this basis, a novel enhanced discrete-form recurrent neurodynamics (E-DFRN) model is further established to obtain high-accuracy optimal solutions for such DF-TDQP problems. The accuracy and convergence of both the DFRN model and E-DFRN model are explained through theoretical analysis, and their effectiveness and superiority are validated based on numerical experiments. Finally, the applicability of these models to the tracking tasks of planar manipulators is verified."

In addition, this paper adopts the INN to implement watermarking, which supports forward encoding and backward decoding, and the watermark extraction is completely dependent on the embedding algorithm without the need for the original network flow. This feature enables both the embedding and the blind extraction of watermarks simultaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed IFW method achieves a watermark extraction accuracy exceeding 96.6% and maintains a stable K-S test p-value above 0.85 in both simulated and real-world Tor traffic environments. These results indicate a clear advantage over mainstream baselines, highlighting the methods ability to jointly ensure robustness and invisibility, as well as its strong potential for real-world deployment."

Experiments done on public real-world driving datasets, nuScenes and RADIATE, demonstrate that our approach achieves better target detection and scatter noise reduction than the state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Color cast is a novel challenge in underwater image enhancement (UIE) tasks. In this study, an innovative enhancement method, named AIUIE-Net, that is specifically designed to address the color cast problems that are commonly found in underwater images is proposed. AIUIE-Net integrates two key components: a water depth-based color cast correction and channel compensation network (WDC-Net) that uses quasilinear water depth parameters for adaptive color cast correction and compensation and an optical particle-based high-fidelity restoration network (OP-HFRNet) that is a physics-informed deep learning backbone that simulates the propagation of light particles in underwater environments. WDC-Net leverages water depth information to perform precise color correction, and OP-HFRNet enhances the realism of underwater scenes by modeling the physical behavior of optical particles. To the best of our knowledge, AIUIE-Net is the first UIE framework to integrate color cast correction and optical particle-based high-fidelity restoration. Experimental results demonstrate that AIUIE-Net outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across multiple evaluation metrics. It produces enhanced images with high fidelity, clarity, vividness, and saturation, thus effectively restoring the stunning authenticity and visual quality of the underwater world."

    "abstract": "Large-Scale multi-UAV systems have significant advantages in enhancing the coverage and reliability of communication networks due to their flexible deployment capabilities. However, existing strategies in UAV-assisted communications primarily optimize bit-level throughput and energy efficiency, making it difficult to ensure effective information transmission under low SINR or complex channel conditions. To address issue, we introduce a new paradigm by incorporating semantic communication into UAV networks, and formulate the 3D UAV-BSs deployment problem with the goal of enhancing semantic fidelity. Furthermore, to tackle the challenges of large-scale multi-agent collaborative decision-making, this paper proposes a novel method which improves the traditional mean-field multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MF-MADDPG), by combining with kernel density estimation (KDE) to model the neighborhood action distribution, enhancing the stability of the policy in continuous action spaces. A semantic-aware reward function is designed based on a representative metric of semantic fidelity, which guides the UAVs toward regions of higher semantic significance. Simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms existing strategies in terms of semantic transmission quality and training stability, demonstrating its application potential in large-scale semantic communication environments."

This paper presents Niagara, a new single-view 3D scene reconstruction framework that can faithfully reconstruct challenging outdoor scenes from a single input image for the first time. Our approach integrates monocular depth and normal estimation as input, which substantially improves its ability to capture fine details, mitigating common issues like geometric detail loss and deformation. Additionally, we introduce a geometric affine field (GAF) and 3D self-attention as geometry-constraint, which combines the structural properties of explicit geometry with the adaptability of implicit feature fields, striking a balance between efficient rendering and high-fidelity reconstruction. Our framework finally proposes a specialized encoder-decoder architecture, where a depth-based 3D Gaussian decoder is proposed to predict 3D Gaussian parameters, which can be used for novel view synthesis. Extensive results and analyses suggest that our Niagara surpasses prior SoTA approaches such as Flash3D in both single-view and dual-view settings, significantly enhancing the geometric accuracy and visual fidelity, especially in outdoor scenes.

    "abstract": "Speech emotion recognition (SER) involves identifying a speaker’s emotional state from their speech utterance. Prior research has explored various cepstral features for developing SER systems. Among these, Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and gammatone cepstral coefficients (GTCC) are widely used. MFCCs and GTCCs are extracted using Mel filter banks and gammatone filter banks (GTFB), respectively. Traditionally, GTFBs are designed based on the equivalent rectangular bandwidth scale. Alternative frequency scales can be employed to design different variants of GTFBs, yielding distinct GTCC feature variants. In this paper, a novel Mel-scale-based GTFB (GTFB-M) is introduced to extract a novel variant of GTCC features, termed GTCC-M. The mathematical framework for designing GTFB-M is presented. The proposed GTFB-M together with the conventional Mel and gammatone filter banks are used to extract three types of cepstral features from emotional speech signals in the Berlin Database of Emotional Speech (Emo-DB) and the Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (RAVDESS). To evaluate SER performance, speaker-dependent (SD) and speaker-independent (SI) SER systems are developed using support vector machines with one-versus-one and one-versus-all strategies. The effectiveness of individual and combined cepstral features is analyzed. Experimental results show that the GTCC-M features derived from GTFB-M perform comparably to traditional MFCCs and GTCCs in emotion recognition. Moreover, combining the proposed features with the conventional cepstral features enhances the overall SER performance. In the case of the Emo-DB database, standalone GTCC-M features achieves recognition (testing) accuracies of 80.12% (SD) and 63.03% (SI). The best recognition (testing) accuracies of 88.82% (SD) and 79.17% (SI) are achieved using an optimal feature combination, i.e., MFCC + GTCC + GTCC-M, when compared to the independent use of MFCC and GTCC features. Similarly, for the RAVDESS database, standalone GTCC-M features achieves recognition (testing) accuracies of 61.84% (SD) and 40.83% (SI). The best recognition (testing) accuracies of 78.62% (SD) and 46.88% (SI) are achieved using an optimal feature combination, i.e., MFCC + GTCC + GTCC-M, when compared to the independent use of MFCC and GTCC features. These findings underscore the potential of GTCC-M features to improve the SER performance when integrated with the MFCC and GTCC features."

Considering the switching weighting factor and the neutral point voltage weighting factor as inputs, and the average switching frequency within a fixed sliding window time and the maximum value of the neutral point voltage within another fixed sliding window time as outputs, a compact form dynamic linearization (CFDL) method is employed to construct an equivalent dynamic linearized data model at each dynamic operating point of the closed-loop system. Building upon this data-driven model, a meticulously crafted controller is devised to precisely regulate both the switching frequency and the peak deviation of the neutral-point potential. The simulation and experimental results validate the correctness and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed control approach."

    "abstract": "The rapid development of intelligent transportation systems has led to the generation of massive vehicular data from onboard sensors, GPS devices, and driving logs, paving the way for advanced driver behavior profiling. To extract insights from such data, clustering techniques, particularly k-means, are widely employed. However, traditional centralized k-means clustering for driving behavior analysis poses potential privacy leakage, as raw features are transmitted to the cloud server in plaintext. Existing privacy-preserving k-means schemes either rely on interactive homomorphic encryption protocols, which incur significant communication overhead, or adopt differential privacy, which reduces accuracy due to noise injection. To address these challenges, we propose <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">PPKC</b>, a non-interactive privacy-preserving k-means clustering framework tailored for vehicular driving behavior analysis. PPKC leverages an improved Paillier cryptosystem with a three- modulus construction, enabling secure Euclidean distance computation and cluster center updates directly over ciphertexts without decryption or repeated interaction with data owners. Each vehicle only uploads a single round of encrypted feature vectors, after which the cloud server can independently execute the complete k-means clustering process. We rigorously analyze the security of PPKC, proving its semantic security and indistinguishability under the IND-CCA assumption with unforgeable digital signatures. Extensive experiments on the highD dataset demonstrate that PPKC achieves high clustering accuracy with significantly lower communication and computation overhead than existing protocols."

    "abstract": "The advancement of autonomous driving technology has brought significant benefits to modern transportation systems. However, individual autonomous vehicles face challenges such as limited perception range and insufficient autonomous capabilities. Cooperative groups of autonomous vehicles, enabled by advanced communication technologies, can enhance traffic efficiency through information exchange. Existing research primarily focuses on centralized autonomous vehicle groups, where the leading node suffers from weak resilience and high computational load, making it difficult to maintain group collaboration over time. To address these issues, this article proposes a decentralized formation and self-adaptation method for autonomous vehicle social groups based on consensus resistance in closed scenes. First, we introduce <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">consensus resistance</i> as a metric to evaluate social group and member consistency, and develop a decentralized formation approach. Second, we present a self-adaption model for autonomous vehicle social groups, incorporating four evolutionary events: 1) expansion; 2) merging; 3) reduction; and 4) splitting, to ensure the stability of moving social groups. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed method effectively constructs social groups in both real-world and simulated environments, exhibiting robust consistency throughout the self-adaption process."

    "abstract": "Emergency medical transportation systems require intelligent network management where high-level user intents can be automatically translated into operational policies. To address this need within intent-based networking frameworks for intelligent transportation systems, we propose SDAETC-Med, a novel architecture combining stacked denoising auto-encoders, transformers, and convolutional long short-term memory networks for medical transport trajectory classification. Our approach enables intent-based automation by providing accurate vehicle type identification that supports policy refinement and network resource allocation. The architecture addresses three core challenges: reducing noise in GPS trajectory data from emergency vehicles, extracting temporal patterns across different emergency response phases, and capturing spatiotemporal features of various medical transport modes. By integrating with intent-based networking architectures, SDAETC-Med enables natural language intent expression, such as \"prioritize ambulance connectivity during emergency responses,\" to be automatically translated into network policies through accurate vehicle classification. Experiments on GeoLife and SHL datasets demonstrate that SDAETC-Med achieves superior classification accuracy (92.3% and 92.8%, respectively), outperforming six baseline methods by margins of 0.4-24.1 percentage points. The framework provides a foundation for intent-driven medical resource scheduling and route optimization within intelligent transportation systems, ultimately enabling autonomous network management that improves patient outcomes in time-critical emergency scenarios."

To address the challenges of high labor intensity and the susceptibility of inspection results to human factors in traditional manual substation inspections, this paper proposes a dynamic path planning method for inspection robots based on multi-sensor fusion. An improved Hybrid A* algorithm is designed by constructing a 2D SLAM grid map is constructed via the perception of LiDAR and visual sensors.Within this algorithm, the search module generates the look-up table using Dubins and Reeds-Shepp curves. Next, the conjugate gradient method is employed to smooth the planned path, ensuring stable task execution of the robot and reducing sensor data noise. This approach effectively solves the issues of path redundancy and local oscillation that plague traditional algorithms in complex scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the 2D SLAM grid map obtains dense, clear point clouds of local distribution for boxes and walls. The movement trajectory error of the inspection robot is strictly controlled within the 0.05m positioning error threshold, and the average error does not exceed 2.5% of the path planned in a single time. Therefore, the path planning method proposed in this study can significantly improve the navigation efficiency of substation inspection robots. It provides valuable insights for the development of path planning methods for inspection robots in complex environments."

    "abstract": "Fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) consume significant energy during inter-regional transitions, yet existing trajectory-optimization and DRL controllers struggle in realistic wind-shear environments: they typically assume idealized wind fields, cannot reliably satisfy strict terminal altitude and heading constraints, and frequently fail when turbulence or wind-direction shifts occur. This study reframes vertical wind shear as a harvestable energy source and introduces a dynamic-soaring DRL framework specifically designed to address these limitations through dual-objective learning and a stability-oriented replay mechanism. The proposed method maintains terminal-feasible, low-loss flight under varying wind speeds, wind angles, and Dryden turbulence—conditions in which direct collocation (DC) and prior DRL methods exhibit large errors or fail to converge. Compared with DC, the framework reduces directional and altitude errors by up to 67% and 89%, keeps terminal errors within 0.5 m and 0.075 rad, and increases minimum obstacle clearance by up to 4.7× while requiring over 93% less computation time. Despite prioritizing safety, it retains high efficiency, achieving up to 5.2% more harvested wind energy and reducing thrust power by up to 3.8%. These results demonstrate a robust real-time solution capable of reliably executing dynamic soaring in realistic, variable wind-shear environments."

In this article, the prescribed-time (PT) formation control of nonholonomic mobile robots (NMRs) with uncertainties is investigated under the leader-follower architecture. First, the nonholonomic constraints of the mobile robots are sufficiently considered, and a transformation method is presented to convert the original nonholonomic system into an easy-to-handle Euler-Lagrange (EL) system. In addition, fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) and adaptive techniques are employed to deal with uncertainties, such as the damping matrix, so that the negative effects of approximation errors can be eliminated. By applying the sliding mode control (SMC) technique and PT stability theory, a sliding mode protocol is proposed to ensure that all states of the mobile robots can be driven onto the sliding surface and the formation errors converge within the prescribed time. Finally, simulations and experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "Ensuring traffic safety in autonomous vehicles requires accurate weather and severity recognition, especially when operating within a defined operational design domain (ODD). However, most existing studies focus on single-label weather recognition and largely overlook weather severity classification. This gap in severity annotation limits the adaptability of autonomous systems under varied weather conditions. Current datasets are typically single-labeled and lack severity annotations, which are crucial for autonomous driving systems to adjust appropriately based on weather intensity. To address this data scarcity, we created a comprehensive multi-label weather dataset with light, moderate, and heavy severity levels based on quantitative visibility thresholds aligned with operational design domains (ODDs). We constructed this dataset by prompting multiple vision-language models (VLMs) to apply these criteria, then validated annotation quality against a human-labeled gold standard. This approach overcomes the limitations of existing datasets. On this new dataset, we introduce the Multi-Weather and Severity Classifier (MWSC), a novel multi-modal framework that simultaneously handles weather recognition and severity classification. MWSC employs a combination of cross-attention mechanisms to extract global and local image features and integrates them with text captions generated from a standardized, closed-vocabulary template for weather and severity to create robust feature associations for classifier training. Our experiments establish a new benchmark for environment perception in autonomous driving, where MWSC significantly outperforms widely-used baseline models across key metrics including mAP, accuracy, and F1-score, advancing vision-based techniques for safer and more reliable autonomous navigation in complex weather scenarios. The full dataset and code are publicly available in our repository at https://github.com/Yonsei-STL/MWSC.git, including licenses of all sources, human-annotated gold set, image lists and splits, prompts, and trained weights for reproducibility."

    "abstract": "Resistive MEMS sensors have become increasingly significant in biomedical and bioenvironmental monitoring due to their compact dimensions, low energy demand, and high sensitivity. Despite structural simplicity and integration benefits, these sensors face performance constraints arising from intrinsic nonidealities such as nonlinearity, thermal drift, parasitic interactions, and process mismatches. These limitations intensify at micro and nanoscale dimensions and generate substantial DC offset in the output. This review presents a systematic analysis of resistive sensor architectures, including single resistor, half bridge, and full bridge configurations, and evaluates their susceptibility to distortion and noise through analytical modeling. Comparative assessment reveals tradeoffs in sensitivity, linearity, noise resilience, and thermal stability. The paper also examines advanced readout methodologies designed for precision measurement, low power operation, and compact integration, including voltage to voltage, voltage to frequency, resistance to digital, and RC delay based interfaces. Particular emphasis is placed on DC offset compensation strategies that address sensor nonidealities, such as resistive, current driven, and capacitive DAC techniques, implemented across different stages of the signal chain. These approaches are critically appraised for their effectiveness in extending dynamic range, reducing energy consumption, and preserving signal fidelity in implantable and wearable platforms. The survey synthesizes recent designs and proposes a classification framework to guide the selection of interface and compensation strategies designed to sensor topology and application constraints. By integrating theoretical insights with practical design considerations, this work provides a comprehensive reference for developing robust, precise, and energy efficient resistive sensor interfaces."

Pharmacological treatments show limited efficacy, with up to 30% discontinuation rates, while surgical interventions like deep brain stimulation achieve significant tremor reduction but are often unsuitable due to age, comorbidities, or personal preference. Recently, the need for safe and effective alternatives has led to the development of innovative, noninvasive, and patient-friendly technologies for tremor management. This clinical application review analyzed 134 studies (1969-2025), categorizing them into three major modalities, focusing on their underlying neurophysiological mechanisms, with a special emphasis on the clinical perspective. The three considered modalities were force-controlling (orthoses and functional electrical stimulation), central neuromodulation (transcranial magnetic stimulation, transcranial electrical stimulation, low-intensity focused ultrasound, and transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation), and peripheral neuromodulation (afferent stimulation and vibration). Force-controlling strategies showed promising acute effects, though clinical translation remains limited by poor wearability and the development of muscle fatigue. Central neuromodulation produced moderate effects, while peripheral neuromodulation has gained clinical traction, with several devices now being commercially available. However, heterogeneity in study design, patient populations, and technology maturity remain the main obstacles for the direct comparison of techniques. Future research should prioritize larger multicenter trials, standardized outcome measures, and accessibility considerations to enable personalized, evidence-based treatment selection for diverse tremor populations."

However, the uncertainty and high dynamic of dogfights pose significant challenges for existing flight trajectory prediction methods to achieve satisfactory accuracy, real-time performance, and robustness. To address the above issues, this work proposes the Confrontational Flight Transformer (CFT) for predicting combatant parties' short-term and long-term trajectories in dogfights. A bi-level optimized confrontational encoder is designed to extract spatiotemporal features from trajectories. At the inner level, we proposed the Minimum Information Entropy Sparse (MIES) self-attention mechanism to select the dominant features via the lens of information entropy. At the upper level, we designed a dual-channel encoder block to process the trajectories of both parties separately. A Situation Attention (SA) module is developed to establish a point- wise linkage between trajectories to highlight the relevance in dogfight interactions. We recorded simulated flight trajectories of both parties in dogfights to establish the dataset for training the CFT. Multiple experimental results show that CFT exhibits excellent robustness and real-time performance and outperforms other advanced neural network-based models. We believe the proposed method enables efficient and viable trajectory prediction in air combat and further assists pilots in making better decisions."

Pruning methods have been proven effective in compressing discriminative models relying on the correlation between training losses and model performances. However, diffusion models employ an iterative process for generating high-quality images, leading to a breakdown of such connections. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective method, named NiCI-Pruning (Noise in Clean Image Pruning), for the compression of diffusion models. NiCI-Pruning capitalizes the noise predicted by the model based on clean image inputs, favoring it as a feature for establishing reconstruction losses. Accordingly, Taylor expansion is employed for the proposed reconstruction loss to evaluate the parameter importance effectively. Moreover, we propose an interval sampling strategy that incorporates a timestep-weighted schema, alleviating the risk of misleading information obtained at later timesteps. We provide comprehensive experimental results to affirm the superiority of our proposed approach. Notably, our method achieves a remarkable average reduction of 30.4% in FID score increase across five different datasets compared to the state-of-the-art diffusion pruning method at equivalent pruning rates.

These methods perform well by leveraging their semantic reasoning capabilities but often assume full environment understanding, which can lead to unreliable planning in complex scenes lacking explicit structural modeling. To address these limitations, we propose a novel multi-view scene understanding framework that explicitly models object-level relationships, enabling failure detection and effective task replanning. Our approach first captures multi-view images for comprehensive coverage, and generates local 2D scene graphs encoding object identities and relational information. Building on this, we introduce a model based on a graph neural network that merges the local 2D scene graphs into a unified representation. This process results in the unified scene graph, used to detect task success and identify failure causes. For each sub-task, our framework compares the unified scene graph with the expected scene graph predicted by the LLM during the task planning stage, identifying potential failure causes based on their deviations. These causes are then fed back into the LLM to facilitate effective replanning, thereby reducing repetitive failures and enhancing adaptability. We evaluate our framework on five real-world benchmark tasks to demonstrate its applicability. Separately, we compare failure detection and reasoning performance with other methods, showing the benefits of combining multi-view perception with explicit graph-based reasoning.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a real-time control framework for nonlinear pure-feedback systems with unknown dynamics to satisfy reach-avoid-stay tasks within a prescribed time in dynamic environments. To achieve this, we introduce a real-time spatiotemporal tube (STT) framework. An STT is defined as a time-varying ball in the state space whose center and radius adapt online using only real-time sensory input. A closed-form, approximation-free control law is then derived to constrain the system output within the STT, ensuring safety and task satisfaction. We provide formal guarantees for obstacle avoidance and on-time task completion. The effectiveness and scalability of the framework are demonstrated through simulations and hardware experiments on a mobile robot and an aerial vehicle, navigating in cluttered dynamic environments."

    "abstract": "In pin-hole assembly processes, precise alignment or compliance mechanisms are typically required. This paper proposes a method for connecting objects by utilizing caging to constrain their motion, enabling the insertion of a pin into a hole to adjust the allowable relative pose for assembly. This approach eliminates the need for force control, even with low-degree-of-freedom manipulators, and reduces deflection caused by misalignment during connection. Although previous research has extensively studied appropriate finger configurations for caging, the behavior of caged objects under external forces remains insufficiently investigated. Furthermore, when connecting caged objects by contact, pose estimation often requires complex collision computations that account for intricate object geometries, which are computationally expensive and may fail to converge when small gaps are present. To address this issue, we propose a geometric method that approximates pose changes of caged three-dimensional objects under external forces as rotations about contact points. As a representative case, we focus on objects composed of cuboid elements. The estimated results for simple objects, including caged objects with small clearances, were consistent with geometrically derived theoretical solutions, and are obtained within 0.6 seconds, indicating a practical computation time."

To get a clear understanding of their individual strengths and weaknesses and their applicability in real-world robotic scenarios, it is important to benchmark and compare their performances not only in a simulation but also on real hardware. The second AI Olympics with RealAIGym competition was held at the 2024 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2024) to contribute to this cause and evaluate different controllers according to their ability to solve a dynamic control problem on an underactuated double-pendulum system (Figure 1) with chaotic dynamics. This article describes the four different RL methods submitted by the participating teams; presents their performance in the swing-up task on a real double pendulum, measured against various criteria; and discusses their transferability from simulation to real (sim-to-real) hardware and their robustness to external disturbances."

While prior visualization research has explored data and task abstractions for genomics, the design space for depicting these three-dimensional (3D) genome models—and associated genome mapped data—remains unclear. In this paper, we investigate the visualization of genomic data with a spatial component. First, we systematically survey how 3D genome models are used and depicted in computational biology. We analyze over 300 papers with figures that visualize 3D genomic data and categorize the methods for visual representation. From this survey, we derive a design space for visualizing 3D genome data, identifying common patterns and key properties such as representation, visual channels, and composition. We position these findings within an existing genomics visualization taxonomy, refining and extending existing classifications. Second, we augment Gosling, a declarative visualization grammar for genomics, to support 3D genomic data. Our integration enables expressive authoring of visualizations that connect traditional genome-mapped information with 3D genome models, emphasizing their spatial characteristics. To demonstrate its utility, we employ our extended grammar to recreate interactive examples, showcasing its ability to represent complex visual designs.

DARNet integrates complex-valued convolutional layers with a native sparse attention mechanism to extract and fuse time–frequency features for accurate bit recovery. Using datasets generated from 3GPP CDL channel models via the Sionna platform, evaluations show that DARNet surpasses traditional methods, achieving notable BER gains under complex channel conditions."

    "abstract": "Vessel wall volume (VWV) is a critical three dimensional ultrasound metric used to assess the progression and regression of carotid atherosclerosis. Ac curate measurement of VWV requires the segmentation of the media-adventitia boundary (MAB) and the lumen intima boundary (LIB) of the carotid arteries. Although deep learning methods can automatically segment the MAB and LIB and quantify VWV, they rely heavily on a large dataset with annotated images for training, which is time consuming and labor-intensive. Self-supervised learning (SSL) provides a possible solution to this challenge. However, existing SSL methods do not consider the similarities in the image sequences of 3D ultrasound. This paper proposes a novel SSL algorithm, named VWV-SSL, for 3D carotid ultrasound (3DUS) image segmentation to generate VWV measurement. VWV-SSL utilizes the sequence structural similarity and strong-weak augmented feature consistency of carotid ultrasound images to conduct the self-supervised task, which enables the networks to better learn the feature presentations of the vessel in the self-supervised task training. We applied VWV-SSL on the widely used 3D U-Net and evaluated it on 1158 3D US (579 of the common carotid artery and 579 of the bifurcation) from250subjects.Comparedtobaselinenetworks,our SSL method showed a significant improvement in segmentation performance when trained on a small number of labeled images (n = 15, 45 and 75 subjects). Moreover, the performance of VWV-SSL was superior to that of state-of-art SSL algorithms. These results indicate that our method can improve the performance of 3D U-Net when trained on a small number of labeled images, suggesting that VWV SSL could be applied in clinical practice to monitor the progression of atherosclerosis."

Site diversity has proven to be an effective technique for mitigating these impairments and guarantees high link reliability. In this letter, we present a three-site diversity configuration involving Alphasat satellite and ground stations located in Ljubljana (Slovenia), Graz (Austria), and Budapest (Hungary). Long-term slant-path rain attenuation time series, acquired from the beacon measurements of satellite at each ground stations, are statistically analyzed to evaluate individual site performance and joint diversity gains. Statistical data are subsequently compared with representative prediction models for three-site diversity scenario."

The design utilizes a coplanar waveguide (CPW)–fed configuration integrated with a modified ground structure (MGS) to suppress surface wave propagation and enhance impedance bandwidth (IBW). To reduce mutual coupling between closely spaced elements, a chip resistor is inserted into the decoupling path to form a hybrid isolation mechanism based on MGS and resistive decoupling. The MGS reduces surface ground current coupling while the resistor absorbs residual energy, thereby achieving high isolation. The antenna's electromagnetic behavior is analyzed using an equivalent circuit model (ECM). The proposed antenna achieves an IBW of 2.01 GHz (26.84–28.85 GHz), a low mutual coupling, and a peak gain of 7.1 dBic at 28 GHz. The envelope correlation coefficient (ECC) remains below 0.04, demonstrating excellent diversity performance. Due to its low profile and strong polarization performance, the antenna is an excellent candidate for integration into 5 G mmWave systems, such as smart devices, IoT terminals, wearables, and compact base stations."

    "abstract": "With the rapid proliferation of edge computing, Radio Frequency Fingerprint Identification (RFFI) has become increasingly important for secure device authentication. However, practical deployment of deep learning-based RFFI models is hindered by a critical challenge: their performance often degrades significantly when applied across receivers with different hardware characteristics due to distribution shifts introduced by receiver variation. To address this, we investigate the source-data-free cross-receiver RFFI (SCRFFI) problem, where a model pretrained on labeled signals from a source receiver must adapt to unlabeled signals from a target receiver, without access to any source-domain data during adaptation. We first formulate a novel constrained pseudo-labeling–based SCRFFI adaptation framework, and provide a theoretical analysis of its generalization performance. Our analysis highlights a key insight: the target-domain performance is highly sensitive to the quality of the pseudo-labels generated during adaptation. Motivated by this, we propose Momentum Soft pseudo-label Source Hypothesis Transfer (MS-SHOT), a new method for SCRFFI that incorporates momentum-center-guided soft pseudo-labeling and enforces global structural constraints to encourage confident and diverse predictions. Notably, MS-SHOT effectively addresses scenarios involving label shift or unknown, non-uniform class distributions in the target domain—a significant limitation of prior methods. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that MS-SHOT consistently outperforms existing approaches in both accuracy and robustness, offering a practical and scalable solution for source-data-free cross-receiver adaptation in RFFI."

    "abstract": "Ultra-wideband (UWB) based positioning with fewer anchors has attracted significant research interest in recent years, especially under energy-constrained conditions. However, most existing methods rely on discrete-time representations and smoothness priors to infer a robot's motion states, which often struggle with ensuring multi-sensor data synchronization. In this article, we present a continuous-time UWB-Inertial-Odometer localization system (CT-UIO), utilizing a non-uniform B-spline framework with fewer anchors. Unlike traditional uniform B-spline-based continuous-time methods, we introduce an adaptive knot-span adjustment strategy for non-uniform continuous-time trajectory representation. This is accomplished by adjusting control points dynamically based on movement speed. To enable efficient fusion of inertial measurement unit (IMU) and odometer data, we propose an improved extended kalman filter (EKF) with innovation-based adaptive estimation to provide short-term accurate motion prior. Furthermore, to address the challenge of achieving a fully observable UWB localization system under few-anchor conditions, the virtual anchor (VA) generation method based on multiple hypotheses is proposed. At the backend, we propose an adaptive sliding window strategy for global trajectory estimation. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on three self-collect datasets with different UWB anchor numbers and motion modes.

    "abstract": "The synergistic effect of AC electric fields and moisture in transformer oil causes insulation degradation, but quantitative methods for dynamic oil-water interfaces remain lacking. This research uses colloid chemistry theory modeling, molecular dynamics simulation, and laser scattering technologies to study the microstructural development of the transformer oil-water interface under an AC electric field. It establishes a quantitative relationship between the grayscale value of the Tyndall Effect, electric field strength, and moisture content, as well as an analysis of the oil expansion phenomenon in high-moisture oil samples caused by high electric fields and the coupling of oil flow fluctuations and localized glow phenomenon. Simulations reveal that an AC electric field can increase the diffusion depth of the water phase and cause uneven thickening of the transition layer. Experimental results reveal that within the range of 0-6 kV, the grayscale value exhibits a linear correlation with the electric field strength. Furthermore, the higher the moisture content, the more electric field-induced scattering occurs. For the first time, the electric field-induced oil swelling lens effect is observed, where localized glow phenomenon migrates with oil flow. The proposed non-intrusive method surpasses traditional techniques, enabling real-time monitoring of interface dynamics for transformer insulation assessment."

    "abstract": "Inspired by soft creatures and structures in nature, continuum robots exhibit remarkable flexibility, safe interaction, and ease of miniaturization, showcasing vast application potential. However, their flexible structure renders analytical methods inadequate for precise modeling and control, while existing data-driven approaches suffer from low data efficiency and unproven theoretical control performance. This paper aims to achieve data-efficient modeling and reliable control of continuum robots through innovative algorithms, exploring the performance of the new method from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. Specifically, we utilize neural ordinary differential equations (NODE) to achieve data-efficient modeling of continuum robots and investigate the performance of the modeling method. Then, we propose a novel predefined-time-synchronized stable zeroing neurodynamics (PTSS-ZND) model. By combining the NODE method and the PTSS-ZND method, we propose a reliable data-driven control system. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we prove the stability and predefined-time convergence of the data-driven control system. Finally, through simulations and physical experiments, we validate the feasibility and convergence of the novel method and its advantages over existing data-driven methods. Experiments on one- and three-segment continuum robots indicate that the proposed method achieves a root mean square position error (e.g., 2.5 mm for the three-segment robot) of less than 1% of the robot length using fewer than 100 data samples. Our method also demonstrates robust performance under various external and internal disturbances. In addition, it can potentially be extended for end-effector pose control."

While secure CNN inference techniques are employed to protect images in image classification, they are not applicable to the unique challenges posed by image SR: the output resolution is significantly higher than that of the input image. In this paper, we present a secure CNN inference scheme for image SR by employing a multiple ciphertext encapsulation method. We begin by designing fundamental homomorphic operations, including addition, multiplication, and rotation across ciphertexts. Recognizing that image SR typically involves an upsampling layer—unlike image classification—we propose a fast algorithm for secure upsampling. This technique leverages pre-weight block masking and cross-ciphertext rotation, resulting in a significant speedup compared to direct homomorphic upsampling. We then present an efficient batched homomorphic two-dimensional convolution method across ciphertexts, incorporating kernel rearrangement and merging strategies. We also design a polynomial activation function specifically optimized for image SR, further enhancing performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our HE-friendly SR network outperforms existing secure solutions, while the proposed multiple ciphertext encapsulation technique achieves at least a 2x improvement in both computational efficiency and memory usage."

    "abstract": "In the past few decades, several methods, ranging from statistical algorithms to deep learning models, have been proposed for driver gene identification. Although recent graph neural network-based methods have achieved progress using biological networks, the static and incomplete nature of networks can compromise the predictive power of the models. Here, we introduce a multimodal approach for driver gene prediction called DriverMONI that leverages pairs of complementary information from multiomics data and biological networks. In particular, DriverMONI utilizes condition-specific subnetworks of protein-protein interaction for generating input graphs and node attributes for graph attention network, which makes the model condition-specific and improves prediction accuracy. Weempirically show the importance of multimodality and the ability of DriverMONI to mitigate the incompleteness of protein-protein interaction networks. In addition, comparative analysis showed that DriverMONI achieved the best performance among competing methods including graph neural network-based models using The Cancer Genome Atlas data, while having a strong consensus with other methods. The source code of DriverMONI is available at https://github.com/BML-cbnu/DriverMONI."

    "abstract": "State of charge (SOC) is a critical parameter for the efficient and safe operation of lithium-ion batteries (LiBs). Currently, accurate SOC estimation heavily relies on battery open-circuit voltage (OCV) characteristics and its steepness relative to SOC. However, challenges arise when the electrical model is inaccurate or the OCV-SOC curve exhibits a flat region. To address these issues, mechanical properties have been widely integrated with traditional electrical characteristics to enhance SOC estimation accuracy. Nevertheless, the shape of the expansion force-SOC curve directly influences the estimation accuracy. This study provides a detailed analysis of the adverse effect of the plateau region and nonmonotonicity in the force-SOC curve on SOC estimation, and proposes a novel electrical-mechanical hybrid SOC estimation method. The online identified OCV is employed to determine the relative positions of the true SOC and estimated SOC, thereby guiding the direction of SOC feedback correction and the adjustment of the weighting coefficients for the electrical and mechanical estimators to achieve more accurate and robust SOC estimation. Experimental results of ternary and lithium iron phosphate batteries under dynamic operating conditions show that the adverse effects of the plateau region and nonmonotonicity in the force-SOC curve are effectively eliminated, and the maximum absolute error, root mean square error and mean absolute error are all below 2%."

These two constraints work collaboratively to enhance feature extraction capability. An optimization algorithm is developed to directly solve the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">l</i><sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub>-constrained optimization problem while preserving signal amplitude. Extensive simulations and two experimental cases based on vibration acceleration sensors were conducted, one with an outer-race defect and the other with an inner-race defect.

    "abstract": "This article reports a comprehensive investigation into the failure behavior and underlying mechanisms of a gallium nitride (GaN)-based low-noise amplifier (LNA) induced by high-power microwave (HPM) pulses. A dual-layer failure analysis framework (spanning system and device levels) is proposed to address a critical gap in existing literature: most studies focus on individual GaN high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs) rather than GaN-integrated LNAs under high-power electromagnetic stress. Moreover, the existing research progress on LNA reliability under HPM injection conditions is mostly about gallium arsenide (GaAs)-based LNA, such as GaAs heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) LNA. First, a custom-designed test system was employed to monitor the electrical performance of the GaN LNA while systematically stepped HPM pulses were injected, enabling the determination of the failure threshold. Second, the failure mechanism of the entire LNA was analyzed at the system level, and the primary failure cause of key components was identified. Obvious damage morphology was detected on one of the first-stage GaN HEMTs and a nearby resistor. Microscopic morphological analysis revealed that the GaN HEMT first undergoes breakdown, followed by a global current increase in the LNA, and ultimately the melting of the resistor—thus clarifying the cascading failure path: from HEMT breakdown to overall current rise, and finally to resistor melting. Finally, the failure mechanism on the transistor level was investigated. Via focused ion beam (FIB) etching and microscopic observation, it was found that the failure originates from electrothermally induced melting in two regions: the gate area near the HEMT input terminal and the region adjacent to the gate–source interface. Furthermore, simulations were conducted to investigate the evlution of internal electrical and thermal characteristics within the GaN HEMT. The simulation results demonstrate that the concentrated electric field and increased current density in the gate–source region lead to a rise in local lattice temperature—consistent with the damage morphology observed in experiments. These simulation results provide detailed insights into the internal evolution process of the failure and strongly support the aforementioned conclusions."

The position of the charged trap is varied between the gate dielectric and the buried oxide to determine its effect on the current variation. To perform this analysis, a quantum-corrected Monte Carlo (MC) device simulator calibrated with experimental data is used. The results show that a charged trap reduces the number of electrons in the channel, degrading the transistor <sc xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">on</small>-current. The maximum current variation is observed when the charged trap is placed in the buried oxide and closer to the middle of the channel. For this case, the variation is 10.16% with respect to the nominal current. It is observed that current variation is dominated by electron-number fluctuations rather than mobility fluctuations."

    "abstract": "Accurate and stable in-line inspection is essential for ensuring pipeline safety, yet the complex and unpredictable dynamic environments inside pipelines make detector operation highly unstable. To address this challenge, we propose a Dynamic N-Level Hierarchy Optimization (DNLHO) framework specifically tailored for measurement stability in pipeline detectors. The framework integrates an environment change sensing (ENCS) sublevel, which provides a gradient-free and statistically adaptive criterion to detect environmental changes, and a hierarchical memory mechanism, which enhances global convergence and robustness by reusing elite solutions across dynamic conditions. The proposed method is extensively evaluated on the Generalized Moving Peaks Benchmark (GMPB) and further validated in a flux leakage detector speed control experiment. Results demonstrate that DNLHO significantly reduces detector speed variance, accelerates stabilization time, and improves success rates in ε-band recovery compared with state-of-the-art methods. These findings confirm the effectiveness and practical utility of DNLHO in real-time measurement tasks, providing a novel and reliable approach to adaptive in-line inspection under dynamic operating environments."

    "abstract": "Consumer electronics (CE) in Internet of Things (IoT)-based smart home applications are rapidly growing and used as a daily life part. Authentication has been utilized for decades to secure wireless communication between CE and their interconnected devices. However, the traditional authentication models depend on the user's physiological biometrics, including passwords and fingerprints. These protocols suffers from various attacks, including side-channel attacks, such as shoulder surfing, smudge, and heat-based attacks, due to their limited verification in login sessions only. Particularly in heat-based attacks, such as thermal attacks, where an adversary uses thermal cameras to capture the temperature gradient caused by a thermal energy exchange at a contact point on user interfaces, such as keyboards and mobile phones. This vulnerability poses a security concern in smart homes and results in the leakage of user confidential information and bypassing initial authentication. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of IoT-based applications, highlighting the security concerns, existing technologies and their approaches, and their performance measurements. Next, we propose a novel Continuous Authentication (CA) protocol for CE devices in smart applications for user remote access. We utilize a user behavioral biometrics template for CA using the vector similarity search (VSS) technique. This model ensures smooth CA without breaking the ongoing sessions and offers uninterrupted user authentication. This protocol is validated with proof of concept of VSS; a comprehensive performance analysis, testbed experiment, security analysis, and VSS validation prove its efficiency, scalability, and effectiveness in real-world application. Finally, a FastAPI is designed to demonstrate the novelty of the proposed scheme."

Based on series-series (S-S) compensation topology, a general mathematical model considering the imaginary part and equivalent series resistance (ESR) has been derived. Subsequently, the output power, primary current, and transmission efficiency against mutual inductance under various frequencies are numerically analyzed. A modified transmission model with higher calculation accuracy, considering the inductance change, is proposed. Systematic design procedures and operation principles of detuned S-S IPT systems are presented, which showcase highly flexible design freedom with any output fluctuation requirements. Finally, an IPT system with adjustable working frequencies is built to verify the theoretical analysis. The experimental results show appealing advantages over other methods, with the minimized power fluctuation of 1.63% when the coupling coefficient changes from 0.53 to 0.22. The IPT system realizes 300 W output with a maximum transmission efficiency of 94.9%."

Our analysis identifies trends such as the widespread adoption of embedding-based retrieval methods (e.g., CLIP, BLIP), increased integration of large language models (LLMs) for conversational retrieval, and continued innovation in multimodal and collaborative search interfaces. We further discuss how specific retrieval techniques and user interface (UI) designs have impacted system performance, emphasizing the importance of balancing retrieval complexity with usability. Our findings indicate that embedding-driven approaches combined with LLMs show promise for lifelog retrieval systems. Likewise, improving UI design can enhance usability and efficiency.

    "abstract": "In this article, a novel hybrid angular–linear displacement sensor (HALDS) for simultaneous angular and linear displacement sensing is proposed. A hybrid series–parallel wing (HSW) structure, consisting of a pair of transmission lines and a pair of open-ended stub sections, is employed as the fundamental structure. By leveraging multilayer circuit technology, the transmission lines and open-ended stubs were innovatively implemented as slider and rotor structures, respectively, while the stator of the angular part was monolithically integrated into the slider structure. The sensor ingeniously achieves synergistic operation of angular and linear displacement sensing and inherent decoupling of sensing parameters, enabling 2-D displacement sensing. The linear displacement is detected based on insertion phase shift (<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\angle S_{21}$</tex-math> </inline-formula>) at the center frequency, while the angular displacement is determined by the frequency difference (<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\Delta f_{\\text {TZ}}$</tex-math> </inline-formula>) between two transmission zeros (TZs). Comprehensive theoretical analysis and design procedures are presented. To validate the proposed method, a 2-D microwave displacement sensor prototype was designed, fabricated, and experimentally characterized. The results demonstrate a satisfactory performance, achieving an average sensitivity of 4.5 MHz/° for angular displacement and 10.4°/mm for linear displacement."

    "abstract": "A decentralized storage network (DSN) collects idle storage resources from Internet nodes for low-cost rental to users, and its scale has grown exponentially. In a DSN, most users rely on a centralized third-party service provider (SP) to process userside data and interact with decentralized storage nodes (SNs), making users suffer from a single point of failure. Additionally, since both SP and SNs may offer malicious services, enabling fault tolerance, data confidentiality, and availability guarantee with public verifiability is crucial in the presence of such threats. In this paper, we propose TolerStore, a completely decentralized service framework for DSNs with decentralized SPs and SNs, which can tolerate Byzantine SPs and malicious SNs. To the best of our knowledge, TolerStore is the first to develop a blockchain with multiple SPs for privacy-aware data processing in DSNs, which is formally proven to ensure Byzantine fault tolerance, data confidentiality, public verification, and data availability. Furthermore, we propose an optimized Byzantine Fault-Tolerant consensus with an adaptive leader rotation, incorporating homomorphic fingerprints to verify privacy-aware data processing with enhanced performance. We implement a TolerStore prototype over Hyperledger Fabric, and extensive experiments show that it tolerates [<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\frac{N-1}{3}$</tex-math></inline-formula>] Byzantine SPs and 50% malicious SNs with up to 99.99% data availability."

    "abstract": "Multi-target transcranial magnetic stimulation overcomes the limitations of single-coil physical movement by enabling collaborative stimulation with multiple coils, which has become a key trend in neural modulation research. However, however, current regulation and synchronization challenges arising from multi-coil coupling remain unresolved. This paper takes a three-coil coupled system as the research object and proposes a complete solution from underlying modeling to experimental verification: Using Kirchhoff’s laws, transient expressions for capacitor voltage and coil current under coupling are derived, a circuit-electromagnetic field coupled model is established, and an accurate expression of the current waveform is provided. This approach determines the capacitance values and precise voltages for different modes and achieves improved synchronization of coil current waveforms by combining capacitor switching and voltage regulation. Circuit simulation verification using Simulink shows that the cosine similarity of current synchronization reaches over 0.9. Further verification is conducted through circuit experiments, and the magnetic field distribution driven by current waveforms is simulated in COMSOL, successfully achieving effective stimulation with electric field strength greater than 100 V/m and mode switching under Mode 1 (1.3 cm shallow double targets) and Mode 2 (2.2 cm deep single target). The research indicates that precise control based on circuit coupled modeling can effectively enhance the current synchronization of multi-coil coupled system, providing a theoretical basis and engineering practice paradigm for the clinical application of multi-target switching TMS."

While many intelligent algorithms have been applied to reduce high SLL, they have problems with sensitive parameters, poor exploration-exploitation balance in complex optimization, and a tendency to get stuck in local optima, resulting in low optimization efficiency. To solve these issues, this article proposes a biogeography-based optimization with a hybrid migration and mutation (BBOHMM) algorithm. The algorithm dynamically adjusts population migration rates based on fitness and iterative process. It also uses a hybrid migration strategy to better select elite solutions. Besides, an adaptive mutation weight is introduced to balance Gaussian and uniform mutation, accelerating early convergence and keeping stability later on. Experimental results demonstrate that BBOHMM achieves lower SLL than the existing BBO variants and other swarm intelligence methods. Additionally, it converges faster than other methods, demonstrating superior computational efficiency across diverse array configurations."

    "abstract": "Although great progress has been made in Salient Object Detection (SOD) in Optical Remote Sensing Images (ORSIs), it still faces critical challenges, particularly in dealing with irregular topological structures and complex contextual relationships. To address these issues, we propose a Progressive Interaction and Saliency-guided Enhancement Network (PISENet). Specifically, a Progressive Interaction Encoder (PIE) is proposed, which adopts a dual-path heterogeneous fusion architecture and a hierarchical progressive interaction mechanism to capture global irregular topological structures and local fine-grained image details. Meanwhile, it mitigates semantic gaps across multi-scale features and achieves effective cross-level feature fusion. Subsequently, a Global Context Enhancement Module (GCEM) is designed, which incorporates non-local blocks to enhance spatial correlations among features. A parallel multi-branch structure is further utilized to capture multi-level contextual information ranging from local details to long-range semantics, thereby strengthening the modeling of global context. Finally, a Multi-scale Progressive Attention Enhancement Decoder (MPAED) is devised, which adopts a saliency-guided attention mechanism to jointly model spatial and channel-wise dependencies, enhance responses in salient regions and boundaries, and progressively decode and aggregate deep semantic and shallow detailed features. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant superiority over state-of-the-art approaches."

    "abstract": "In this work, the relationship between Lyapunov exponents, used to estimate the effects of process variability, and the standard deviation obtained through the Monte Carlo method was established analytically, demonstrating that the Lyapunov exponents characterize a metric for estimating such effects. Based on this, a new metric for estimating the effects of process variability, based on Lyapunov exponents, was developed. The Sum-Power-Delay (SPD) was analytically defined, and its application was verified in the design of an inverter using 180nm technology. The SPD was applied to compare two sets of twenty cells designed in 180nm and 180nm-RH, a radiation-tolerant cell library developed at the Santa Maria Design House (SMDH), affiliated with the Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM), demonstrating that circuits designed with Enclosed Layout-Transistor (ELT) are more robust against process variability. These results were obtained by analyzing circuits from the ISCAS85 benchmarks, as well as twenty circuits synthesized with our library. The same analysis was performed for matrix multiplication, aiming to evaluate the impact of process variability on this fundamental operation in space-grade digital systems. Finally, the 180nm-RH library was used to estimate the effects of process variability on circuits designed for space-oriented applications, including neural networks, filters, image compression, edge detection, and RISC-V microcontroller core modules. Key circuits for space applications, including image compressors, digital filters, and edge detection modules, were synthesized using a radiation-hardened standard cell library, enabling comparative evaluation of their robustness to process variability. The analysis provides valuable guidance for selecting circuits suitable for radiation-prone environments. Extension to RISC-V cores with 180 nm radiation-hardened transistors showed that Pico32 had the highest tolerance to process variability, confirming the practical effectiveness of the SPD metric in predicting and mitigating variability effects across designs."

In this paper, we propose an efficient BIQA method, called the Meta-learning Convolution Transformer Integration Network (MCTINet). MCTINet integrates a convolution-based ResNet and a transformer-based Pyramid Vision Transformer (PVT) that conducts BIQA. We train these two backbone networks and integrate the two sets of output features on the support set and query set in the meta-learning training process to construct the meta-knowledge model. Given the meta-knowledge model about various distortions, fine-tuning is conducted on a target dataset with unknown distorted images as transfer learning. By integrating ResNet and PVT backbone networks within the meta-learning framework, our proposed model is able to conduct rapid and efficient learning across various types of unknown distortions. Extensive experiments are conducted on multiple real-world authentic and synthetic distortion databases to compare the performance of MCTINet with conventional and recent deep learning-based BIQA methods. These include experiments on individual databases, experiments on individual distortion types, cross database evaluation, cross distortion type evaluation, and ablation study. The experimental results show that MCTINet outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods for BIQA. The code of MCTINet is available at https://github.com/KU-IIPL/MCTIN."

    "abstract": "Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation of highly correlated or coherent sources remains a challenging problem, particularly for subspace-based methods such as MUSIC and Root-MUSIC, which require spatial smoothing or eigenvalue decomposition. This work introduces a decomposition-free DOA estimation algorithm that exploits the inherent Toeplitz structure of uniform linear arrays (ULAs). The method constructs a structured Toeplitz matrix directly from the received data vector, forms a real, symmetric compound matrix to enable real-valued processing, and extracts structured sub-blocks without matrix decomposition. A polynomial matrix is then generated, and the DOAs are obtained by solving its roots, thereby bypassing covariance decomposition entirely. This design reduces computational burden, improves numerical stability, and inherently accommodates coherent sources without the need for spatial smoothing. Computational complexity analysis shows significant savings compared to subspace methods, while MATLAB simulations across various SNR, snapshot, and array size conditions validate estimation accuracy. Furthermore, a hardware realization on the NI PXIe-7993 FPGA platform demonstrates that the decomposition-free structure requires minimal hardware resources and execution cycles, making the algorithm highly suitable for real-time embedded applications."

    "abstract": "We propose a novel method for the efficient and accurate iterative solution of frequency domain integral equations (IEs) used for large/multi-scale electromagnetic scattering problems. The proposed method uses a novel group-by-group interaction strategy to accurately evaluate far-zone interactions, defined within the framework of the one-box-buffer scheme, during the matrix-vector multiplication at each iteration of the matrix solution. Briefly, subdomain basis functions that are used to model the scatterer at each box are represented by a fixed number of uniformly distributed and arbitrarily oriented Hertzian dipoles (referred to as uniform basis functions). Then, the dipole-to-dipole interactions are predicted in a group-wise manner by employing machine learning (ML) algorithms. Consequently, the proposed method is efficient, strongly scalable for parallelization, accurate, and does not exhibit the low-frequency breakdown (LFB) problem that is inherent to the conventional multilevel fast multipole algorithm (MLFMA). Since the dipole representation is independent of the underlying material properties of the scatterer, the proposed method is valid for all types of IEs (surface or volume) as well as the corresponding subdomain expansion functions. Moreover, because the training is performed offline, the resulting ML networks can be used for any scatterer under any IE without extra training, as long as the sizes and the relative distances among the boxes are preserved. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method are assessed by comparing its results with those obtained from the conventional MLFMA for various scattering problems. The proposed method’s parallelization performance is showcased through scalability tests, and its resilience to LFB is demonstrated."

    "abstract": "In some scenarios, such as e-commerce, users typically purchase multiple items in a single transaction, rather than just one item. Recommender systems for such scenarios are expected to recommend multiple items in a single step (also known as next basket/set recommendation). This makes user interest modeling more complex than in the normal recommendation. In this paper, we find that existing methods suffer from insufficient information mining, including ignoring item transition patterns and limited local information modeling, resulting in incomplete and inaccurate representations of user interest learning, which ultimately affects performance.

Specifically, BAGE constructs two graphs, the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">transition graph</i> and the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">exploratory graph</i>, to learn structural and contextual information globally. Each graph contains multiplexed information representing different dependencies within item relations. A behavior-aware representation learning is proposed to extract user preferences from the two graphs. The dynamic behavior encoder integrates the graphical and sequential behavior information. To capture inherent characteristics and capture the correlations of user preferences across different graphs while maintaining their inherent characteristics, a contrastive cross-information learning module guides the learning process of user interests. An adaptive gating fusion module fuses sequential and graphical information by incorporating sequential patterns, item transitions, and contextual influences to produce a comprehensive representation of user interests. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the advantages of BAGE over existing state-of-the-art methods."

Furthermore, UAVs typically provide communication services to MUs under partial observation, leading to challenges in achieving optimal service performance due to information loss. Moreover, although existing solutions can readily reach optimal, restriction-fulfilling strategies, they frequently breach restrictions during intermediate iterations. To address these issues, we present a fully decentralized JUATC algorithm based on the Communication and Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) Lagrangian-based Multi-Agent Actor-Critic (CPID-MAAC). First, to improve communication efficiency, we consider that each MU can be associated with a different UAV or BS in the uplink and downlink. Second, we establish a messaging mechanism between UAVs based on autoencoding UAV’s observations to handle the information loss. Finally, to alleviate constraint-violating behavior, we incorporate the PID Lagrangian algorithm. The experiments show that CPID-MAAC improves data rate by 7.88%~16.03% and drastically reduces the number of constraint violations during UAV agent training."

    "abstract": "Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) receivers are vulnerable to serious intentional jamming, leading to a loss of positioning capability. Interference recognition technology can assist receivers in selecting appropriate mitigation algorithms. However, traditional interference detection techniques are limited by their reliance on statistical assumptions and fixed parameter settings, resulting in poor adaptability when facing multiple types of interference. Recently, deep learning (DL) has made progress in interference recognition. However, most existing deep networks achieve higher accuracy at the cost of increased complexity, limiting their practical deployment. Moreover, existing methods mainly rely on single-domain frequency features and pay inadequate attention to local texture features, leading to insufficient feature representation and limited recognition performance under low interference power conditions. To this end, we propose an Angle-Optimized aided Dual-stream Harmonized Network (AO-DSHN) for interference recognition. Specifically, AO-DSHN introduces discriminative time-domain autocorrelation features and frequency-domain features to enhance classification performance. Meanwhile, a Dual-Stream Time/frequency Feature Co-operative Learning Network is designed to capture the fundamental shared features across time and frequency domain features. Furthermore, a novel Dual-domain Angle-optimized Loss is proposed to strengthen the intra-class compactness and interclass separability. Experimental results on simulated, real-world, and public datasets demonstrate that AO-DSHN outperforms several other state-of-the-art methods in terms of recognition accuracy, complexity, and real-time performance, demonstrating its application potential."

However, compared with detailed models, conventional average-value models (AVMs) result in reduced accuracy due to the neglect of switching harmonics, making it challenging to meet the accuracy requirements when focusing on transient responses or harmonic dynamics. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a system-level converter model called the harmonic-preserved AVM (HP-AVM). This time-domain-based model integrates AVM computation with harmonic component calculation into a unified simulation framework, enabling precision comparable to that of switching-function models (SFMs) for system-level simulation, while avoiding the high computational burden of detailed models. By leveraging AVMs as the backbone and preserving harmonic details, HP-AVM achieves both high computational efficiency and accurate harmonic representation in system-level simulations. Furthermore, HP-AVM demonstrates broad applicability across various converter topologies, including rectifiers, inverters, and choppers. Both simulation and experimental results validate the effectiveness of HP-AVM, demonstrating its high accuracy and computational efficiency."

An attacker can (i) corrupt sensor measurements (deception attacks) and (ii) perturb the control channel (actuation attacks). To address the lack of model knowledge, we adapt the Data-enabled Predictive Control (DeePC) framework, which constructs predictors directly from input–output data with bounded disturbance. We formulate a finite-horizon open-loop control problem as a two-player zero-sum game with asymmetric information: the defender selects control inputs based on measured data and only knows an upper bound on disturbances, whereas the attacker has access to the true disturbance realization and can remain stealthy by hiding within this uncertainty set. The main contributions are (i) sufficient conditions for the existence of a Nash equilibrium corresponding to saddle-point policies for this game, and (ii) an analysis of the defender’s security strategy against deception and actuation attacks. Simulation studies on finite-horizon control demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

Besides, along with energy and peak-to-average ratio (PAR) constraints to comply with the hardware realization, let us minimize the weighted peak sidelobe level (WPSL) or maximize the signal-to-interference and noise ratio (SINR) of the IRAJ system for the detection performance according to the delay structure of reflected echoes. To tackle the resulting nonconvex multi-objective optimization problems, iterative fractional programming algorithms (IFPA) leveraging cyclic algorithmnew (CAN) and alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) are proposed, respectively.

    "abstract": "Micro-expressions can reveal genuine emotions that are not easily concealed, making them invaluable in fields such as psychotherapy and criminal interrogation. However, existing pseudo-labeling-based methods for micro-expression analysis have two major limitations. First, pseudo-labels generated by the sliding window do not account for the actual proportion of micro-expressions in the video, which leads to inaccurate labeling. Second, they predominantly focus on overall features, thereby neglecting subtle features. In this paper, we propose a micro-expression analysis method called Spot-Then-Recognize Method (STRM), which integrates spotting and recognition tasks. To address the first limitation, we propose a Self-Adaptive Pseudo-labeling Method (SAPM) that dynamically assigns pseudo-labels to micro-expression frames according to their actual proportion in the video sequence, thereby improving labeling accuracy. To address second limitation, we design a Multi-Scale Residual Channel Attention Network (MSRCAN) to effectively extract subtle micro-expression features. The MSRCAN comprises three modules: Multi-Scale Shared Network (MSSN), Spotting Network, and Recognition Network. The MSSN initially extracts micro-expression features by performing multi-scale feature extraction with Residual Connected Channel Attention Modules (RCCAM), which are then refined in the spotting and recognition networks. We conducted comprehensive experiments on three short video datasets (CASME II, SMIC-E-HS, SMIC-E-NIR) and two long video datasets (CAS(ME)<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>, SAMMLV).

    "abstract": "The remote sensing semantic segmentation task for offshore floating aquaculture (OFA) areas faces several challenges, including dense spatial distribution of aquaculture facilities, class imbalance, omission of small targets, and limited computational efficiency. To address these issues, this study constructs an NDVI-GB dataset based on the Optimum Index Factor (OIF) and proposes a Vision Transformer with Multi-scale Feature enhancement and Dynamic Attention fusion (ViT-MFDA). Based on the Swin Transformer framework, the model designs a Spatially Separable Self-Attention Vision Transformer (SSAVT) as the backbone network. By incorporating the Spatially Separable Self-Attention (SSSA) mechanism from Twins-SVT to optimize both local and global feature extraction, and integrating Conditional Positional Encoding (CPE) to enhance positional awareness, the model achieves efficient extraction of global context and local detailed information. Additionally, a Multi-scale Dynamic Weighted Attention Decoder (MDWAD) module is designed. This module integrates multi-scale contextual information through the Pyramid Pooling Module (PPM) and the Feature Pyramid Network (FPN), and introduces a dual channel-spatial attention mechanism to adaptively calibrate target features, which effectively mitigates false and missed detection in complex marine environments. Furthermore, ViT-MFDA employs a weighted joint loss function to alleviate class imbalance issues, improving the completeness and accuracy of segmentation results. Experimental results demonstrate that ViT-MFDA achieves mIoU, mF1-score, and mPrecision scores of 90.51%, 94.95%, and 95.34%, respectively, outperforming mainstream CNN and Transformer models in comprehensive performance, particularly excelling in dense target segmentation and model generalization. The method advances efficient large-scale aquaculture monitoring with real-world applicability."

It aids in land use and land cover classification, crop and vegetation classification, change detection, and classification of coastal and aerial regions. Many advanced techniques were introduced based on some substantial modifications in the models; however, this resulted in a complex framework that is difficult to adapt. In this work, we proposed a novel Lightweight Dense Mixture of Experts (LiteDenseMoe) model for aerial and coastal regions classification using remote sensing images. The proposed model initially incorporates light, dense blocks with lightweight dense layers, as well as channel and spatial attention mechanisms. The resulting model is further fused with an Mixture of Experts block that extracted more relevant and essential features for the accurate prediction of complex aerial scenes. In the training process of the proposed model, a Hyperband Optimization technique is employed for hyperparameter initialization, rather than manual selection. After training the proposed model, classification was performed, along with output interpretation. The proposed LiteDenseMoe architecture is evaluated on three datasets and achieved an accuracy of 93.25% on MLRSNet, 92.56% on NWPU-RESISC45, and 96.54% on the EuroSAT dataset with only 0.3 million parameters. Expert allocation and their confidence per class, Expert disagreement Network, and t-SNE visualization are also observed to interpret the Moe results.

However, existing intelligent spectrum management methods, typically based on small-scale models, suffer from notable limitations in recognition accuracy, convergence speed, and generalization, particularly in the complex and dynamic spectrum environments. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel spectrum foundation model, termed SpectrumFM, establishing a new paradigm for spectrum management. SpectrumFM features an innovative encoder architecture that synergistically exploits the convolutional neural networks and the multi-head self-attention mechanisms to enhance feature extraction and enable robust representation learning. The model is pre-trained via two novel self-supervised learning tasks, namely masked reconstruction and next-slot signal prediction, which leverage large-scale in-phase and quadrature (IQ) data to achieve comprehensive and transferable spectrum representations. Furthermore, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy is proposed to enable SpectrumFM to adapt to various downstream spectrum management tasks, including automatic modulation classification (AMC), wireless technology classification (WTC), spectrum sensing (SS), and anomaly detection (AD). Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpectrumFM achieves superior performance in terms of accuracy, robustness, adaptability, few-shot learning efficiency, and convergence speed, consistently outperforming conventional methods across multiple benchmarks. Specifically, SpectrumFM improves AMC accuracy by up to 12.1% and WTC accuracy by 9.3%, achieves an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.97 in SS at -4 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and enhances AD performance by over 10%."

    "abstract": "Low vibration is a critical performance metric for high-speed electrical machines, particularly in applications requiring stringent acoustic compliance. For integer-slot PM synchronous machines, the main sources of vibration under different speed are the radial electromagnetic force harmonics of different frequencies which are related to the rotor pole pairs and stator slots. In this paper, a novel vibration suppression method concerning a vibration-reducing winding is proposed. The vibration-reducing winding injected with specific harmonic current can produce flux density of specific spatial-temporal properties which interact with that from the armature winding and PMs, producing the radial force which could offset the primary vibration-induced radial force harmonics. Compared with the conventional harmonic-current injection method, the proposed method effectively suppresses the primary radial electromagnetic force of different frequency over a wide speed range with small electric load. Finally, the proposed method is verified to reduce the vibration acceleration by over 60% via both FEA and experimental method, while the electric load of the vibration-reducing winding is only 5.6% that of the armature winding."

Recognizing that appropriate testing is a critical component of software architecture processes, this paper proposes an assessment model that incorporates testing into architecture review processes, effectively bridging this gap. Our approach integrates widely used methods, such as the lightweight Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method (ATAM), into our model to assess architectural quality in an easy and pragmatic manner. By integrating risk-based architectural testing review, this model ensures monitoring and improvement of architectural quality throughout the software development lifecycle, aids in early risk identification and mitigation, and ensures the final product meets high standards of quality in terms of quality attributes and non-functional requirements (NFR)."

In this context, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) can serve as an important building block; however, integrating MFA into vehicular environments is nontrivial. Traditional MFA verifies digital credentials but typically does not confirm physical presence. In ITS, authentication often requires binding digital identities to a vehicle’s actual position and timing. To address this gap, this work presents CARBUROS, an MFA protocol specifically designed for ITS scenarios. It introduces a dual-channel mechanism that combines a standard digital communication channel with a physical proximity-based channel, ensuring that authentication reflects real-world co-location in space and time. This approach strengthens security by linking digital credentials to physical context. CARBUROS was formally modeled and verified using ProVerif, an automatic cryptographic protocol verifier. The analysis shows that the protocol withstands threats such as unauthorized access, identity spoofing, and functional disruption. The results confirm that CARBUROS preserves authentication and confidentiality under the modeled adversarial conditions while maintaining lightweight communication and computational overhead suitable for deployment in ITS environments."

    "abstract": "Learning-based online adaptive driving policies hold considerable promise for enabling human-preferred autonomous driving or advanced driver assistance systems. However, existing personalization approaches often rely on limited style definitions or behavior cloning, requiring extensive data and placing cognitive burdens on users. To address these limitations, an Online Personalized Policy Adaptation (OPPA) framework is proposed based on direct driver interventions, where real-time corrective actions on the steering wheel and pedals are treated as implicit feedback reflecting individual driving preferences. A hybrid learning strategy integrates reinforcement learning with intervention-guided updates, enabling efficient online adaptation. To mitigate overfitting and prevent catastrophic forgetting during long-term personalization, the Memory Aware Synapses (MAS) regularization technique is selectively activated based on detected shifts in driver preferences. The framework is initialized from a generalized policy pretrained using the TD3 algorithm and a composite reward function that captures perceived risk, comfort, and efficiency. Driver-in-the-loop experiments incorporating subjective evaluations are conducted with 21 drivers across four representative curved-lane scenarios to assess the effectiveness of the personalization. Results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves rapid and effective personalization, typically needing fewer than two intervention episodes. Subjective satisfaction improves by 18.9% over the baseline. The average adaptation time per intervention ranges from 0.75 to 1.04 seconds, depending on MAS activation, confirming the effectiveness and responsiveness of the OPPA framework in aligning driving policies with individual preferences."

Unlike conventional monopulse beamforming that suffers from limited resolution and interference in multi-target environments, the proposed method formulates a constrained convex optimization problem to design sum and difference beams with precise control over mainlobe gain, sidelobe suppression, and monopulse slope. To further improve robustness against closely spaced targets, we introduce a nulling method followed by an iterative refinement algorithm that alternately updates beamformers while incorporating interference suppression constraints. Additionally, we develop a low-complexity iterative nulling algorithm based on orthogonal projection with slope and bias calibration to reduce computational complexity, making it suitable for resource-constrained IoT devices. Both computer simulations and laboratory experiments using commercial radar modules demonstrate that our proposed methods significantly outperform conventional monopulse techniques, particularly when targets are closely spaced. The iterative nulling approach achieves up to 70% reduction in mean square error (MSE) compared to conventional methods across various signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels, making it highly suitable for IoT-based drone detection and tracking applications."

    "abstract": "In the topic dissemination space, various types of messages interact and collectively influence the propagation trends of derivative topics. To address this, a prediction model for group behavior in hotspot topics is proposed based on multitype complex messages. First, considering the complexity and high-dimensional nature of data in the topic feature space, sparse representation is employed to extract key user attributes in the derivative topic space and to calculate sparse vectors. Based on these sparse vectors, a node feature prediction submodel is subsequently constructed using regression algorithms. Second, considering the cooperative and competitive relationships between different message types, evolutionary game theory is applied to transform the dynamic interactions between messages into psychological games among users. By reflecting the optimal benefits of user strategies, it captures the driving forces of derivative messages and establishes a dynamic topic dissemination network. Additionally, a graph convolutional network is employed to extract user structural features, constructing a structure attribute prediction submodel. Finally, to overcome the limitations of individual submodels, the node feature and structure attribute prediction submodels are integrated to form a group behavior prediction model based on multitype message interactions. The input data is discretized using time slicing to enhance the model’s generalization ability. Experiments show that the proposed model accurately captures the complex interactions among multitype messages in the derivative topic space and effectively predicts group behavior and hotspot topic propagation trends."

    "abstract": "The perception of hydrodynamics renders underwater robots with a sixth sense, enabling them to navigate challenging environments such as turbid waters. Traditional differential pressure sensors used for hydrodynamic monitoring often struggle with flexibility and sensitivity constraints, limiting their practical utility. Drawing inspiration from fish canal lateral line systems, we have engineered a bio-inspired differential pressure sensor (BioDPS) by integrating thermal flow sensors into a flexible PDMS canal punctuated with a series of micropores. The performance of the BioDPS in detecting pressure differences was meticulously evaluated under both static and dynamic conditions. Our BioDPS device achieved an impressive static pressure difference resolution of 50 mPa and a dynamic pressure difference detection limit of 6.9 mPa. Leveraging its adaptable design and high sensitivity in monitoring hydrodynamic pressure differences, an array of BioDPS sensors integrated into an airfoil model successfully localized vortices. The compelling performance of our BioDPS, validated across static and dynamic pressure differentials, underscores its immense potential in hydrodynamic monitoring and advanced underwater exploration endeavors."

Existing zero-shot methods, effective for natural images, struggle with remote sensing’s complex semantics and spatial relationships, lacking category modeling and geospatial awareness. Therefore, we propose EKP-HRM, a novel zero-shot RRSIS framework integrating Expert Knowledge Priors (EKP) and Hierarchical Relational Matching (HRM). EKP enhances unseen category generalization through structured categorical semantics, while HRM decomposes scene descriptions for attribute-specific matching and contextual reasoning. Experiments on RRSIS-D show EKP-HRM outperforms prior methods."

In this letter, we propose FGDiff, a framework that integrates fixation prediction (FP) prior with a conditional diffusion model. Firstly, FP maps from a lightweight FP network are utilized to identify the potential object regions. Secondly, a lightweight hybrid backbone encoder then couples FP priors with multi-scale features. It incorporates the feature spatial-directional enhancement (FSDE) module to strengthen spatial and directional awareness, while integrating the time steps and FP priors prompts for dynamic spatial perception. The pyramid feature aggregation (PFA) module recursively aggregates contextual multi-scale information. Finally, the spatial perception fusion (SPF) module within the denoising decoder jointly optimizes image and mask features in a spatially adaptive manner, enabling iterative fine-grained refinement of salient objects. Comparison experiments on ORSSD, EORSSD and ORSI-4199 datasets demonstrate that FGDiff outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in detection accuracy and edge preservation, validating its effectiveness for RSI-SOD.

While traditional sensors rely on single-frequency measurements, this study introduces a multi-frequency approach by identifying the frequencies most sensitive to variations in salinity and moisture, demonstrating that using more measurement frequencies increases predictive accuracy. The dataset consisted of twenty soil samples prepared with five salinity levels (0–2 g/kg) and four VWC levels (1–15%). Measurements were conducted using a DAK (Dielectric Assessment Kit) system coupled with a vector network analyzer (VNA). To expand the dataset for neural network training, empirical models were employed to generate additional samples, increasing the total dataset size to over 3000. By analyzing EC and permittivity across the 10–295 MHz range, six optimal frequencies were identified as primary candidates. These six frequencies were used to form 57 combinations, including single, dual, triple, four-frequency, and six-frequency sets. In total, 57 neural network models were trained to evaluate each frequency’s contribution to prediction accuracy. The results show that single-frequency models exhibited average prediction errors of approximately 30% for VWC and 15% for salinity, whereas two-frequency models reduced these errors to about 10% and 5%. Three-frequency combinations achieved nearly zero prediction errors (<1%) for both parameters. These findings show that only a few strategically selected frequencies are sufficient to capture the key electromagnetic behavior of soil and significantly enhance prediction performance."

The cold atom interferometer gyroscope (CAIG) has no mechanical wear and can achieve a better angular random walk (ARW). Therefore, the CAIG has received wide attention in recent years. Typically, the CAIG has a complex structure, large volume, and heavy weight, especially for the CAIG based on an atomic fountain realized with four Raman pulses. Previously, we have implemented a compact CAIG and carried out the transportable experiments. In this paper, the phase shifts induced by the main noises are analyzed, including the vibration noise, the Raman phase noise, and the detection noise, which significantly limit the sensitivity of our CAIG. The vibration compensation algorithm has been utilized to suppress the vibration noise. Besides, the phase noise has been reduced with the parameter optimization of the PID controller. The polarization purification for the detection beam has been implemented by two Glan-Taylor prisms to reduce the influence of detection noise. Finally, the comprehensive analysis of these noises has been carried out so that a CAIG with a total interrogation time of 4<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">T</i>=400 ms and a Sagnac area of 2.27 cm<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> has been achieved.

While centralized verification introduces bottlenecks and single points of failure, existing decentralized alternatives suffer from inefficiency due to their lack of batch verification capabilities. This limitation leads to prohibitive communication and computational overheads that scale poorly as data volume grows. This paper introduces EdgeBatch, the first decentralized protocol designed for efficient batch integrity verification, reducing communication rounds from <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathcal {O}(n)$</tex-math></inline-formula> to <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathcal {O}(1)$</tex-math></inline-formula>a small, constant number. At its core is a reputation-aware Combination Selection Algorithm (CSA), a polynomial-time heuristic that identifies near-optimal peer server combinations, balancing verifier group size against servers' historical trustworthiness through intelligent pruning strategies. This process is orchestrated through distributed ledger technology and smart contracts, ensuring a secure, transparent, and trustless verification environment. The protocol's design is underpinned by rigorous theoretical analysis, including formal proofs of security and correctness, and a probabilistic model for optimizing key system parameters. Extensive simulations show that EdgeBatch drastically outperforms state-of-the-art methods; it improves computational efficiency by an average of 518.60× over EdgeWatch and 1030.93× over CooperEDI, while also reducing communication overhead by 296.68× and 62.66×, respectively. A concluding ablation study confirms the vital role of our reputation mechanism, demonstrating it reduces the required verification rounds by 73% and is the key to the protocol's efficiency."

Automating this process using advanced AI/ML techniques can reduce the burden on experts, be a training resource, and make diagnosis accessible and affordable to a larger population. However, models developed using imaging data have not achieved acceptable accuracy levels. One reason for this is the limited number of data points available and artifacts in the data capture mechanism of the available datasets. There is a need to develop a generalized model that can take as input diverse images with multiple conditions, which predicts epilepsy and identifies the impacted brain regions. In this work, we present the design of deep-learning models capable of predicting epilepsy using 3D brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. Five deep learning models were developed to classify 3D MRI scans to identify specific brain regions involved in Hippocampal Sclerosis, Dysembryoplastic Neuroepithelial Tumors, Cavernomas, Focal Cortical Dysplasia, and other epileptic-related conditions. We find that our trained models predict epilepsy with over 91% accuracy on FLAIR images and nearly 100% accuracy on T1-weighted (T1-w) images. Our results show that deep learning architectures in 3D are highly effective in detecting epilepsy and identifying relevant pathological regions. These findings highlight not only the diagnostic accuracy of the models but also their potential utility in aiding clinical decision-making."

    "abstract": "The high prevalence of problems related to lordosis/kyphosis among weightlifters, athletes, wrestlers, and IT professionals highlights the need for effective posture monitoring solutions. Common sensors used for posture monitoring include accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometer, inertial sensors, tilt sensors, flexible pressure sensors and flexible strain sensors. Due to constraints such as sensitivity to environmental factors, power consumption, patient comfort, and bulkiness, a flexible adhesive capacitance-based superstrate infused complimentary ring resonator (CSRR) based antenna sensor, which uses both the antenna’s electromagnetic field and sensor’s transducing property is proposed. The proposed printed antenna sensor is polyimide based with compact dimensions of 35 * 36 * 0.13 mm<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>. Fractal structures are incorporated for better coverage of the posture changes in the spine region with multi-directional antenna pattern avoiding the usage of antenna array structures. Capacitive Sensing is preferred to monitor physical structure changes as it is insensitive to environmental factors. When the person’s posture at kyphosis/lordosis changes beyond normal angular limits (Kyphosis-20° to 45°-Outward/Lordosis-20° to 40°-Inward), the resonant frequency of the antenna sensor changes and thereby translated as abnormal curvatures of the spine region (Thoracic/Lumbar). In Heterogeneous medium, Particle Swarm Optimization is applied to the initial antenna sensor design in simulation using fractal structures, yielding performance characteristics which has a good reflection coefficient of –14.48 dB with good impedance matching of 53 ohms and a directional gain of 1.3 dBi at the resonant frequency of 6.66 GHz for Lordosis (Inward curvature of above 45 ° between L3 and L4) and reflection coefficient of –17.16dB with good impedance matching of 47 ohms and a directional gain of 0.33 dBi at the resonant frequency of 6.74 GHz for Kyphosis (Outward curvature of above 40 ° between T7 and T8). The proposed antenna sensor is also validated in real time environment using Vector Network Analyzer for performance characteristics measurement on few human subjects. This proposed wearable antenna sensor offers a non-invasive and efficient approach to real-time posture monitoring, contributing to spinal health improvement for individuals prone to problems related to lordosis/kyphosis, thereby enhancing the ergonomic aspects in healthcare."

    "abstract": "This study aimed to develop and validate a novel autonomous slip-prevention grip force controller for a robotic prosthetic hand. The controller utilized an optical flow sensor to detect object slippage events, which triggered increases in the desired gripping force within a closed-loop force control system. We first validated the slip-prevention functionality on a bench test platform. Subsequently, the controller was integrated into a simple shared control framework to demonstrate its feasibility in enhancing the grasping function for prosthesis users. In this shared control framework, myoelectric position control (i.e., user control) was employed when the hand was not engaged in a grasp, while the intelligent autonomous grip force control was activated during contact with an object. The feasibility of the shared control was tested with human participants performing tasks involving the grasping, transferring, and releasing of various objects while using and wearing the prosthetic hand. Additionally, we compared the shared control to a myoelectric-only controller (without the autonomous grip force control) in the object manipulation task combined with a secondary cognitive task. The results demonstrated that the proposed automatic grip force controller effectively prevented slips and improved grasping stability under various perturbations. Compared to myoelectric-only control, the shared control reduced the user’s cognitive effort required for object manipulation and lead to increased task success. While our designed slip-prevention grip force controller shows significant potential to assist the prosthesis users in improving grasping functionality, further exploration of other shared control paradigms is necessary to maximize user performance and acceptance in the future."

    "abstract": "This letter presents a reinforcement learning (RL)-based trajectory optimization scheme for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in underwater acoustic-optical hybrid communication systems, aiming to minimize the average age of information (AoI) and enhance AoI fairness. By modeling the AUV trajectory optimization problem as a continuousstate Markov Decision Process (MDP), the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) and soft actor-critic (SAC) are employed to learn adaptive trajectory optimization strategies. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme performs better than traditional schemes in convergence speed, average AoI, and AoI fairness. Compared to the baseline without fairness, the SAC algorithm enhances AoI fairness by 38%, while the TD3 algorithm improves it by 14%."

    "abstract": "Frequency synchronization and reciprocity calibration across base stations (BSs) are crucial for coherent transmission in distributed massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks, yet are often disrupted by carrier frequency offsets (CFOs) from distinct BS oscillators and phase offsets caused by radio frequency hardware impairments. Traditional approaches typically employ maximum likelihood or least squares estimation for CFOs and phase offsets, requiring additional estimation of inter-BS channels and resulting in high computational costs. This paper introduces an over-the-air protocol, named Sync4CT, which estimates and compensates CFOs and phase offsets to enable coherent transmission. Sync4CT estimates CFOs utilizing the autocorrelation matrices of the received pilot signals and assesses phase offsets in the frequency domain. Both procedures offer closed-form estimators without the need of inter-BS channel estimation, and are executed in parallel across BSs, thereby significantly reducing computational complexity. Theoretical analysis shows that, for Sync4CT, the mean square error (MSE) of CFO estimation approaches the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB), while the MSE of phase offset estimation achieves the CRB in narrowband systems. Simulations further validate the substantial performance improvements of Sync4CT for coherent transmission in distributed MIMO networks."

    "abstract": "The performance of intensity modulation and direct detection (IM-DD) systems is often significantly degraded by optical multipath interference (MPI) noise. To this end, we propose a low-complexity MPI noise suppression scheme, termed the long-term memory postfilter (LTMPF), designed to spectrally whiten MPI noise. To further reduce implementation complexity, a clustered LTMPF based on k-means clustering is introduced, together with a low-complexity lookup table-based method to cancel the inter-symbol interference (ISI) induced by the LTMPF. The ISI-canceled signal can be either directly hard-decided or further processed by a designed short-term memory MLSE (STMMLSE) module for improved BER performance. The proposed scheme is experimentally validated in a 56 Gbaud four-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM-4) IM-DD system under severe MPI conditions. It consistently outperforms existing schemes in both direct-decision and STMMLSE modes. Notably, at the 7% hard-decision forward error correction threshold, the proposed scheme achieves a signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) tolerance improvement of over 4.6 dB and a receiver sensitivity gain of 1.8 dB in the direct-decision mode, while 0.67 dB and 0.84 dB are achieved in the STMMLSE mode. Benefiting from clustering and LUT techniques, the proposed scheme requires only a few multiplications and roughly a dozen additions per symbol, making it a promising solution for IM-DD systems."

By utilizing the existing telecom infrastructure, DAS facilitates self-monitoring of networks and external events observation, from human activities to large-scale geophysical phenomena.

Our analysis shows that nonlinear Kerr-induced modulation instability (MI) is the main impairment affecting IM-DD channels co-propagating with DAS. In this scenario, MI cannot be approximated as originating from a single frequency source, and the observed nonlinear impairments vary along the pulse with its sweeping central frequency. Numerical simulations validate the experimental results, showing close alignment."

    "abstract": "Channels with synchronization errors, exhibiting deletion and insertion errors, find practical applications in DNA storage, data reconstruction, and various other domains. The presence of insertions and deletions renders the channel with memory, complicating capacity analysis. For instance, despite the formulation of an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) deletion channel more than fifty years ago, and proof that the channel is information stable, hence its Shannon capacity exists, calculation of the capacity remained elusive. However, a relatively recent result establishes the capacity of the deletion channel in the asymptotic regime of small deletion probabilities by computing the dominant terms of its capacity expansion. This paper extends that result to binary insertion channels, determining the dominant terms of the channel capacity for small insertion probabilities and establishing capacity in this asymptotic regime. Specifically, we consider two i.i.d. insertion channel models: the simple insertion channel, where a random bit may be inserted after each transmitted bit, and the Gallager insertion model, for which a bit is replaced by two random bits with a certain probability. To prove our results, we build on methods used for the deletion channel, employing Bernoulli(1/2) inputs for achievability and coupling this with a converse using stationary and ergodic input processes, and show that the channel capacity differs only in the higher order terms from the achievable rates with i.i.d. inputs. The results, for instance, show that the capacity of the simple insertion channel is higher than that of the Gallager insertion channel, and quantify the difference in the asymptotic regime."

    "abstract": "Accurately simulating the dynamic output and maximum stroke of giant magnetostrictive transducers (GMTs) under complex working conditions is crucial for their design and applications. However, the dynamic output of GMT is susceptible to the coupling of multiple working conditions, which easily induces nonlinear output and consequent stroke reduction. Prevailing models rarely consider this coupled effects of multiple working conditions, making it difficult to fully utilize the linear region of the giant magnetostrictive rod (GMR) for output stroke enhancement. Therefore, this paper proposes a dynamic model for GMTs that incorporates the coupled effects of bias magnetic field, stress, temperature, and frequency. This model facilitates the simulation of the dynamic output under multiple working conditions, and enables the optimization of these conditions to maximize output stroke. The proposed theory develops a multiple working condition Jiles-Atherton-Sablik (J-A-S) model, which incorporates working conditions related nonlinear terms to calculate the dynamic magnetization of GMR and realizes the adaptive parameters modulation to working conditions through multiple custom fitting functions. In addition, a microelement-segmented mechanical dynamical model of GMT is constructed, which couples GMR’s magnetization to calculate the dynamic output. Finally, a measurement platform for GMT is established to measure the dynamic outputs of GMT under distinct multiple working conditions, and compared them with different models. The results demonstrate that the proposed model can accurately simulate the dynamic outputs of GMT under diverse multiple working conditions and proves instrumental in identifying the optimal working conditions that maximize the output stroke."

These two characteristics are significantly different from the legacy synchronous generator (SG)-based systems. Further, this work examines the impact of fault resistance, another inherent limitation affecting the performance of PSEs. The analyses show that modifying fault-type bands of the total quantity-based PSEs is both necessary and sufficient for their reliable operation. The theoretical findings are validated through simulations and controller hardware-in-the-loop (CHIL) tests."

    "abstract": "Asynchronous operation of a synchronous generator (SG) following a loss of field (LOF) incident can lead to potential mechanical damages, as well as overheating in the stator winding, rotor body and stator end core region. To protect SGs from being damaged, power plant protection codes recommend prompt LOF detection and tripping of SGs. This study quantitatively evaluates how the severity of LOF consequences depends on the SG's initial loading. Unlike the conventional LOF (ANSI 40) and loss of synchronism (ANSI 78) protections that immediately disconnect the SG, this paper introduces a remedial control action (RCA) that departs from the traditional “detect and-trip” approach. The RCA reduces the generator output after a fast LOF detection to achieve two objectives: 1) to prevent the SG from entering a hazardous state, and 2) to allow time for either restoring the excitation system or executing a controlled shutdown of the SG. LOF detection can be performed using a fast and readily available scheme that triggers the RA. The simulated case studies demonstrate that the proposed RA enables safe asynchronous operations of the SG after an LOF incident, and also provides an opportunity to either restore the SG's excitation system or initiate a planned outage."

A dual-polarization binary phase shift-keying (DP-BPSK) modulator is employed to construct orthogonal signal paths, with a dual-passband filter integrated into the OEO loop. Mutual injection locking enables stable dual-frequency oscillations with low phase noise and a high side-mode suppression ratio (SMSR). The generated dual-frequency signal serves as a local oscillator (LO) to modulate an externally injected baseband linear frequency-modulated (LFM) waveform, producing coherent dual-band dual-chirp LFM signals. The proof-of-concept experiments demonstrate waveform generation centered at 10 and 16 GHz with tunable bandwidths, duty cycles, and repetition periods. Compared to a free-running OEO, the proposed scheme improves the SMSR by 36 dB and enhances the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) of the generated LFM signals by 31 dB. Furthermore, relative to direct waveform synthesis using an arbitrary waveform generator (AWG), it achieves a 29-dB SIR improvement and significantly reduces spectral linewidth. The output bandwidth can be flexibly extended up to 12 GHz by adjusting the baseband chirp, demonstrating high configurability and spectral scalability. Owing to its compact architecture, high coherence, and excellent spectral purity, the proposed approach is well suited for advanced radar systems requiring high resolution and robust interference suppression."

    "abstract": "The D-region ionosphere is critical to radio wave propagation, communication and navigation, but remotely sensing this region is challenging due to its height and low electron density. The technique using measurements of Very-low-frequency (VLF) signals remains one of the most reliable methods to probe the D-region, and the Kalman filter has been utilized to measure the D-region ionosphere over large area. However, the inversion of D-region ionosphere using VLF measurements is inherently nonlinear, and the noise is distributed in a non-Gaussian manner. To overcome this limitation, in this study we have proposed a technique to image the D-region ionosphere over large area using the Gaussian mixture extension of local particle filter (LPFGM) algorithm with a network of VLF receivers. On basis of numerical experiments, we have examined the performance of different filters. For typical daytime experiments, the error in ionospheric reference height (h') is found to be 1.44 km and 1.18 km for the local ensemble transform Kalman filter (LETKF) and LPFGM, respectively. The corresponding error in the ionospheric sharpness parameter (β) is 0.036 km<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-1</sup> and 0.028 km<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-1</sup>. For typical nighttime experiments, the error in h' is 1.39 km and 0.90 km for LETKF and LPFGM, respectively, with the corresponding error in β as 0.031 km-1 and 0.026 km-1. Therefore, the particle filter can improve largely the accuracy in the inversion problem of D-region ionosphere using VLF measurements, since it is particularly designed for nonlinear problems and the Gaussian mixture helps resolve the issue of sparse measurements. Moreover, our proposed LPFGM method converges notably faster than LETKF, and thus has the potential to remotely sense the D-region ionosphere in real time."

In this paper, we propose an approach that integrates VLMs with traditional computer vision methods through explicit logic reasoning to enhance SA in three key ways: (a) extracting fine-grained event details, (b) employing an intelligent fine-tuning (FT) strategy that achieves substantially higher accuracy than uninformed selection, and (c) generating justifications for VLM outputs during inference. We demonstrate that our intelligent FT mechanism improves the accuracy and provides a valuable means, during inferencing, to either confirm the validity of the VLM output or indicate why it may be questionable."

    "abstract": "This paper goes one step forward in the life estimation of HVDC cable insulation under load cycles by introducing for the first time a microscopic model of charge conduction and transport – i.e., Bipolar Charge Transport BCT model – for electric field calculation inside the insulation thickness. The paper firstly includes the development and the validation of BCT model with that found in literature. Then, the parameters of the developed BCT model are optimized using Pulsed Electro-Acoustic (PEA) space charge measurements. Followed by the integration of the developed, validated and optimized model into the electric field calculation for life estimation of a 500 kV DC-XLPE insulated cable subjected to Type Test load cycles according to Cigrè Techical Brochure 852. The developed microscopic model is compared to the macroscopic models already found in the literature. The microscopic model shows a comparable electric field inversion similarly to macroscopic models. However, the behavior of the microscopic model is noticed to be different under heating and cooling load cycles. In hot cable, the maximum electric field stabilizes at different amplitude and position inside the insulation thickness in both models. This investigation has been carried out in the framework of the HEU-NEWGEN research project."

    "abstract": "Accident prediction and timely preventive actions improve road safety by reducing the risk of injury to road users and minimizing property damage. Hence, they are a critical component of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicles. While many existing systems depend on multiple sensors such as LiDAR, radar, and GPS, relying solely on dash-cam videos presents a more challenging, yet more cost-effective and easily deployable solution. In this work, we incorporate improved spatio-temporal features and aggregate them through a recurrent network to enhance state-of-the-art graph neural networks for predicting accidents from dash-cam videos. Experiments using three publicly available datasets (DAD, DoTA and DADA) show that our proposed STAGNet model achieves higher average precision and mean time-to-accident scores than previous methods, both when cross-validated on a given dataset and when trained and tested on different datasets."

    "abstract": "Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is a widely used non-destructive testing (NDT) technique for subsurface exploration, particularly in infrastructure inspection. However, traditional interpretation methods often struggle with noise sensitivity and limited structural awareness. We propose a novel framework that integrates shape-aware topological features, derived from B-scan GPR images using Topological Data Analysis (TDA), with the object detection capabilities of a YOLOv5-based deep neural network (DNN). This topological representation improves geometric salience, enhancing detection and localization of underground utilities, especially pipelines. To mitigate the scarcity of annotated real-world data, a Sim2Real strategy is employed. Synthetic datasets are generated to capture both diverse subsurface conditions and the essential hyperbolic reflection patterns of pipelines, enabling more effective knowledge transfer to real-world scenarios. Experimental results show consistent improvements in mean Average Precision (mAP), highlighting the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method. This work demonstrates the potential of TDA-enhanced deep learning for reliable subsurface object detection with broad implications in urban planning, safety inspection, and infrastructure management."

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a privacy-preserving paradigm for training machine learning models across distributed edge devices in the Internet of Things (IoT). By keeping data local and coordinating model training through a central server, FL effectively addresses privacy concerns and reduces communication overhead. However, the limited computational power, memory, and bandwidth of IoT edge devices pose significant challenges to the efficiency and scalability of FL, especially when training deep neural networks. Various FL frameworks have been proposed to reduce computation and communication overheads through dropout or layer freezing. However, these approaches often sacrifice accuracy or neglect memory constraints. To this end, in this work, we introduce Federated Learning with Ordered Layer Freezing (FedOLF). FedOLF consistently freezes layers in a predefined order before training, significantly mitigating computation and memory requirements. To further reduce communication and energy costs, we incorporate Tensor Operation Approximation (TOA), a lightweight alternative to conventional quantization that better preserves model accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that over non-iid data, FedOLF achieves at least 0.3%, 6.4%, 5.81%, 4.4%, 6.27% and 1.29% higher accuracy than existing works respectively on EMNIST (with CNN), CIFAR-10 (with AlexNet), CIFAR-100 (with ResNet20 and ResNet44), and CINIC-10 (with ResNet20 and ResNet44), along with higher energy efficiency and lower memory footprint."

The near-field propagation achieved by gMIMO introduces unique opportunities for energy-efficient, high-capacity communication systems that cater to the demands of 6G wireless networks. Exploiting spherical wave propagation, near-field SWIPT with gMIMO enables precise energy and data delivery, enhancing spectral efficiency through beamfocusing and massive spatial multiplexing. This paper discusses theoretical principles, design challenges, and enabling solutions, including advanced channel estimation techniques, precoding strategies, and dynamic array configurations such as sparse and modular arrays. Through analytical insights and a case study, this paper demonstrates the feasibility of achieving optimized energy harvesting and data throughput in dense and dynamic environments.

    "abstract": "This paper deals with the problem of dynamic trajectory planning for a group of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in unknown environments. The existing methods often suffer from excessive computational burden, which creates the gap between theoretical approaches and practical swarm deployment. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a distributed cooperative planning system (DCPS). The system consists of two levels: a trajectory planning level and a cooperative trajectory planning level. On the trajectory planning level, a kinodynamic Gaussian potential B-spline (KGPB) approach is designed by combining the local kinodynamic-A-star method and the Gaussian potential field B-spline method. Specifically, in the front-end, a trajectory is first generated by using the local kinodynamic-A-star method based on kinematics-dynamics constraints. And then, in the back-end, the trajectory is further optimized by using the Gaussian potential B-spline (GPB) method. On the cooperative trajectory planning level, a back field neighbor replanning (BFNP) approach is proposed, where each UAV only needs to communicate with the nearest neighbors. According to the potential collision region of the front UAV, the trajectory of the current UAV is dynamically improved to ensure safe and stable flight such that communication costs are significantly improved. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DCPS achieves at least a 27% increase in average velocity and a 24% reduction in traversal time for the UAV swarm compared to prior methods. The experimental outcomes provide further validation that the proposed DCPS can generate efficient and safe trajectories. For particular cases, the UAV operates at 97% of its maximum possible velocity. The proposed DCPS provides a reliable solution for a group of unmanned aerial vehicles in unknown environments."

    "abstract": "The dynamics coupling between motion and force subspaces in robotic control poses significant challenges to ensuring force control robustness, particularly under large external disturbances. While actively shaping the system inertia can eliminate this coupling, it introduces additional disturbances due to modeling uncertainties and force sensing errors. Inspired by how humans naturally adjust their elbow postures to facilitate motion force operations, we propose a quadratic programming-based nullspace optimization method that minimizes dynamics coupling for redundant torque-controlled robots. Integrated into an impedance motion force control framework, our approach minimizes an objective function defined by the Frobenius norm of the projection matrix representing inertia coupling in Cartesian space, yielding human-like postures that passively decouple task dynamics. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed nullspace optimization significantly improves force control stability and tracking performance under conditions of high friction and external disturbances, outperforming conventional motion force control with traditional nullspace tracking approaches."

    "abstract": "The generative priors of pre-trained latent diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated great potential to enhance the visual quality of image super-resolution (SR) results. However, the noise sampling process in DMs introduces randomness in the SR outputs, and the generated contents can differ a lot with different noise samples. The multi-step diffusion process can be accelerated by distilling methods, but the generative capacity is difficult to control. To address these issues, we analyze the respective advantages of DMs and generative adversarial networks (GANs) and propose to partition the generative SR process into two stages, where the DM is employed for reconstructing image structures and the GAN is employed for improving fine-grained details. Specifically, we propose a non-uniform timestep sampling strategy in the first stage. A single timestep sampling is first applied to extract the coarse information from the input image, then a few reverse steps are used to reconstruct the main structures. In the second stage, we finetune the decoder of the pre-trained variational auto-encoder by adversarial GAN training for deterministic detail enhancement. Once trained, our proposed method, namely content consistent super-resolution (CCSR), allows flexible use of different diffusion steps in the inference stage without re-training. Extensive experiments show that with 2 or even 1 diffusion step, CCSR can significantly improve the content consistency of SR outputs while keeping high perceptual quality.

However, due to the security issues arising from the inherently open nature of air to ground (A2G) links, the security of both communication behavior and information faces significant threat. To address this issue, we investigate a UAV-enabled covert and secure communication network against cooperative detection and eavesdropping from multiple illegal eves, which can share the intercepted signals with others. Specifically, from the perspective of secure communication considering channel uncertainty and cooperative eavesdropping, we characterize users' upload secure throughput by an ergodic integral expression, and formulate a max-min throughput optimization problem through joint design of UAV trajectory, user transmit power and segmentation ratio, under mobility, energy consumption and covertness constraints. Then, to address the problem with complicated covertness metric with no closed-form expression under cooperative detection, we derived closed form expressions of the covertness metric, by utilizing the Pinsker inequality along with properties of both Taylor series and the Digamma function. Subsequently, the monotonicity of the derived metric is analyzed and further utilized to simplify the covertness constraint into transmit power constraint equivalently. Afterward, a novel convex approximation method is introduced to construct a convex subproblem for the formulated highly complicated non-convex problem, enabling an efficient algorithm that delivers high-quality solutions for the formulated problem. Finally, the effectiveness and superior performance of proposed design are verified through simulations."

Since the 1970s, researchers have employed remote sensing technologies for wetland classification and mapping to elucidate the extent and variation of wetlands. Although several review articles have summarized developments in this field, a comprehensive and in-depth synthesis remains lacking. This review article aims to address the following key questions: 1) What is the scientific importance of wetlands? 2) What are the major data sources and methods used in wetland classification and mapping? 3) What are the driving factors behind wetland changes? 4) What are the prevailing research paradigms and their limitations? 5) What challenges and opportunities lie ahead in the context of technological innovation and global environmental change? To answer these questions, we conducted a meta-analysis of over 1,200 peer-reviewed publications, analyzing trends in wetland types, mapping methods, sensor usage, and geographic focus. We review and synthesize current knowledge of wetland features, data availability, and methodological advances. Furthermore, we examine typical wetland mapping products and explore intrinsic driving factors across various spatial and temporal scales. Finally, we discuss major research limitations and propose future directions to improve wetland classification and monitoring in the era of global change. This review consolidates current understanding in wetland remote sensing and provides actionable recommendations to promote scientific progress in wetland studies."

While the model accurately predicts average current, discrepancies in current ripple are observed, attributed to core-to-core variability in ferrite materials. The EBHM implementation offers a significant computational advantage, with simulation times remaining under 10 seconds even for highly saturated cases.

    "abstract": "Measuring the concentration of oil in aquatic environments is vital for assessing potential exposure levels, risks, and damages — particularly in the context of oil spill response efforts and evaluations of harm to natural resources. Traditional analytical chemistry methods require field sampling, followed by transporting these samples to laboratories for processing with specialized equipment, which is not only time-consuming and labor-intensive but also entails significant expenses. To address this problem, we have redefined the problem of estimating oil spill concentrations as one of concentration regression using extracted color images of oil samples and proposed a deep learning based oil spill concentration assessment method named Oilregressor using dual color space regression model, which integrates both RGB color space and HSV color space for efficient oil spill concentration regression. To our best knowledge, we are the first to use the deep learning based color regression model for oil spill concentration assessment. The Oilregressor is an end-to-end training model, which consists of three parts, namely a RGB feature extraction module, a HSV feature extraction module and an attention-based fusion module. It can assess the oil concentration by weight per volume using extracted color images. Furthermore, To train and evaluate the performance of our model, we meticulously prepared oil samples with varying concentration levels. The extracted color images are captured by these oil samples and served as two comprehensive datasets, enabling the model to learn and distinguish between different oil concentration scenarios in water. Finally, to make oil concentration measurement more suitable for on-site applications, we have developed a specialized oil spill measurement system using NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano with an easy-to-operate user interface, which employs a microscope to capture extracted color images of oil samples and runs our Oilregressor on NVIDIA Jetson Nano. Our model demonstrates sufficient accuracy in oil level prediction, rendering it applicable to the majority of environmental scenarios."

Data-driven FR IQA methods (DISTS, TOPIQ trained on PIPAL, LPIPS/LPIPS+/ST-LPIPS) exhibit the best correlation with human opinion on LiDAR-derived rasters, achieving absolute PLCC/SROCC values of around 0.85–0.86 on aggregate. A simple weighted sum–product fusion of five complementary metrics further increases alignment to PLCC/SROCC of 0.9221/0.9204 across all percentiles and modalities. Cross-modal consistency of the subjective scores is high (e.g., grayscale vs. pseudo-color for the same percentile), while pseudo-colored DTMs exhibit the most outliers, indicating colormap- and homogeneity-induced instability in some metrics. These findings enable practical QA for generative LiDAR reconstruction: the fused metric serves as a reliable MOS surrogate for evaluation and as a perceptual loss to regularize diffusion-based reconstructions. The released dataset and benchmarks provide a reference for future LiDAR-specific IQA and extensions to tensor-level HHDC assessment."

    "abstract": "Connectomics, a subfield of neuroscience, reconstructs structural and functional brain maps at synapse-level resolution. These complex spatial maps consist of tree-like neurons interconnected by synapses. Motif analysis is a widely used method for identifying recurring subgraph patterns in connectomes. These motifs, thus, potentially represent fundamental units of information processing. However, existing computational tools often oversimplify neurons as mere nodes in a graph, disregarding their intricate morphologies. In this paper, we introduce MoMo, a novel interactive visualization framework for analyzing neuron morphology-aware motifs in large connectome graphs. First, we propose an advanced graph data structure that integrates both neuronal morphology and synaptic connectivity. This enables highly efficient, parallel subgraph isomorphism searches, allowing for interactive morphological motif queries. Second, we develop a sketch-based interface that facilitates the intuitive exploration of morphology-based motifs within our new data structure. Users can conduct interactive motif searches on state-of-the-art connectomes and visualize results as interactive 3D renderings. We present a detailed goal and task analysis for motif exploration in connectomes, incorporating neuron morphology. Finally, we evaluate MoMo through case studies with four domain experts, who asses the tool's usefulness and effectiveness in motif exploration, and relevance to real-world neuroscience research. The source code for MoMo is available here."

To analyze and optimize the output voltage ripple, the working principle of the ZCS SCC is investigated, and a generalized step-down output model is proposed. Through mathematical analysis of the model, the expression of output voltage ripple is derived, accounting for dead time and the output filter capacitance. Furthermore, by extending the two phases topology, the optimal phase-shift angle design method for multi-phase staggered parallel connection is systematically derived under different uneven current sharing conditions, and the corresponding optimal phase-shift angle is quantified. The proposed method simultaneously reduces the output voltage ripple and minimizes the required output filter capacitor size. Finally, a 2-phase 2-to-1 SCC prototype is constructed and experimentally validated to verify the theoretical analysis. When the optimal phase shift angle is set to π/2 rad, the output voltage ripple of interleaved parallel configuration is reduced by approximately 89.6% compared with the direct parallel configuration. Additionally, the peak efficiency improves by at least 0.4%."

Although artificial intelligence has driven rapid ad vancements in pathology image analysis, the interpretation of ultra-large and multi-scale pathology images in clinical practice still heavily relies on physicians' experience. Clinicians need to repeatedly zoom in and out on individual slides to compare and assess pathological details — a process that is both time-consuming and prone to visual fatigue. The system first employs a diffusion model to perform tissue segmentation on pathology images, then calculates pathological tissue proportions and morphological metrics. Finally, through multi-scale dynamic comparison and multi-level visual evaluation, the system facilitates comprehensive and precise analysis of pathology images. The system provides clinicians with an intelligent and interactive tool for pathology image interpretation, enabling efficient visualization and precise analysis of pathological details, thereby reducing the effort require for detailed analysis"

    "abstract": "Very large scale integration (VLSI) circuits typically consist of millions of nets, posing significant challenges for efficient physical design. Interconnect delay has become a critical factor for timing performance in technology nodes at 5nm and beyond. Additionally, the coupling effect among the wires increases the complexity of delay optimization. Moreover, tapering constraints are essential in advanced technology nodes to ensure manufacturability. Furthermore, the ever-increasing scale of modern designs necessitates a high-performance computing (HPC) framework to accelerate delay-driven layer assignment in advanced technology nodes. To address these challenges, we propose ParDelay, a parallel delay-driven layer assignment leveraging hierarchical task graph modeling while considering tapering constraints for advanced technology nodes, which includes the following five key techniques: 1) A general deterministic parallel framework is proposed for delay-driven layer assignment, leveraging a hierarchical task graph to enable both internet and inter-node parallelism. 2) A delay- and overflow-driven tapering repairing strategy is proposed to eliminate tapering violations while further optimizing net delay. 3) A local delay-critical net filtering method is proposed to analyze local delay criticality to guide layer assignment, thereby minimizing delay while eliminating overflow. 4) To mitigate the coupling effect, we propose a net shielding algorithm that reduces wire density for maximum delay candidate nets to optimize maximum delay. 5) A delay-aware refinement strategy is proposed to classify nets by their delay rank and assign distinct non-default-rule (NDR) wire permissions and refinement objectives, thereby reducing delay. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to existing layer assignment algorithms and parallel routing frameworks, our approach effectively reduces delay, via count, and runtime under the tapering constraints."

    "abstract": "In the wideband communication field, multi-channel wideband acquisition systems (MCWBAS) are required to precisely measure timing relationships between multiple signals at GHz frequencies, so picosecond-level inter-channel synchronization accuracy (ICSA) is required. Restricted by the device characteristics and FPGA resources, MCWBAS uses the multi-ADC parallel sampling method to enhance the sample rate and multiple FPGAs to process the sample data, which brings new problems. First, temperature variations can significantly impact inter-board routing delays, causing metastability in control signals and resulting in ICSA in the nanosecond range, particularly in high-frequency MCWBAS systems with small steady-state intervals. Currently, no automatic calibration method can optimize the steady-state interval under varying temperatures. Second, device non-linearity causes phase-frequency errors, and as the system bandwidth increases, the range of ICSA variation with frequency increases drastically. Consequently, the existing ICSA for MCWBAS is limited to hundreds of picoseconds, insufficient for picosecond-level synchronization testing. To address these issues, a high-precision wideband synchronization method is proposed. First, a swept-window algorithm is proposed, leveraging the FPGA’s IDELAY units to train and identify the optimal steady-state interval based on test data. Second, a high-precision wideband synchronization calibration algorithm is proposed. The phase response calibration algorithm ensures consistent ICSA across all frequencies within the wideband range. Subsequently, sine fitting is used to estimate ICSA, and a Farrow filter is applied for calibration, which can be customized to accommodate different delays. The proposed method achieves ±5 ps ICSA across all frequencies within the 8 GHz bandwidth in a system with a 20 GSPS sampling rate, which is currently the highest precision within the 8 GHz bandwidth."

    "abstract": "Nowadays, companies face different challenges due to marketization, the global health crisis, and political instability. The environment is thus changing continually. Firms should be able to adapt to change and leverage it as a means of progress. Moreover, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming current jobs significantly and creating new ones. To survive in the long run, companies must be able to adopt and utilize AI effectively. In this paper, we explore the antecedents and outcomes of AI adoption at the firm level through a qualitative study based on semi-structured interviews with AI experts and field reports analysis. These experts' interviews and triangulated field evidence have allowed a high level of research rigor. Findings reveal that AI adoption is influenced by internal factors related to leadership and governance, innovation, data management, algorithmic depth, performance, and external ones, socially, ethically, and ecologically. Indeed, we've extended the TOE Framework as part of a theory elaboration approach by adding new antecedents of AI adoption and shedding light on its impact on organizational agility and sustainable performance. The paper provides engineering managers with best practices that can help when performing AI projects, and researchers with a theoretical Framework that can be studied in different contexts."

While prior SF and CP-based amplifiers suffer from poor linearity because the SF must drive large amplified signals, we propose a buffer-then-amplify (BTA) CP architecture that relocates the CP to the SF output. As a result, the SF only buffers unamplified small-swing residues, fully exploiting its intrinsic linearity and eliminating the need for high-order gain calibrations even in advanced process nodes. To further enhance robustness and efficiency, we introduce an adaptively biased class-AB SF. An integrated active-hold technique is also proposed to eliminate the timing and bandwidth mismatch between the first-pipeline-stage sampling capacitor and the sub-ADC by repurposing the SF as a hold buffer for the sub-ADC. The prototype 12-bit 800-MS/s pipelined time-interleaved successive approximation register (TI-SAR) ADC is fabricated in 12-nm FinFET technology. It achieves SNDR higher than 55.0 dB across the 4.2–373 K temperature range with 40-MHz input, and peak Walden figure-of-merit (FoM<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">W</sub>) of 9.2 fJ/c.-step at 4.2 K.

Subsequently, a compensation scheme of capacitance current using the phasor method is proposed. Next, as an alternative damping method, the capacitor-voltage feedback is used to suppress the LC resonance, and the influence of the feedback gains on the system's stability is discussed. Furthermore, the dynamic performance is further improved by adopting DC-side inductor-current feedback and a damping factor.

A customized LSTM model is implemented to improve forecasting, utilizing adaptable hyperparameters, lookback windows, and a 24-hour forecast horizon to accommodate individual building photovoltaic (PV) generation and load energy profiles. The system formulates the energy exchange between the buildings in a non-cooperative Stackelberg game. The proposed model is analyzed, and a comparison is carried out for a game theory-based model without a forecast, with an LSTM-based forecast, and with a perfect forecast, considering four buildings with PV generation and load profile measurements from Barcelona, Spain. The proposed model with an LSTM-based and perfect forecast has a percentage cost saving of 2.67 % to 28.63 % and 3.33 % to 58.82 %, respectively. The sensitivity of the proposed model to energy storage capacity change and utility grid price variations is also studied. The proposed model demonstrates scalability by efficiently optimizing energy exchange with a higher number of buildings with optimal execution times, showcasing its ability to handle larger, more complex networks while maintaining reasonable computational performance."

    "abstract": "Articulated-soft robots (ASRs) offer a promising framework for achieving safe and adaptable physical human–robot interaction. However, their intrinsic underactuation and complex coupled dynamics pose major challenges for control design, particularly when high-order derivatives or full dynamic models are required, which is often the case. This article presents a novel adaptive power-shaping-signal control strategy that achieves accurate and safe trajectory tracking without the need for complex dynamic modeling. The proposed approach relies solely on estimates of the gravitational torque, motor damping, and inertia base parameters, thereby eliminating dependence on the most error-prone terms—namely, link inertia and Coriolis/centrifugal dynamics—and substantially simplifying implementation. This method further permits stable modulation of the sliding vector gains, effectively enabling joint-level variable impedance control. For the first time, a noncollocated (link-side) sliding vector and direct gravity compensation are both stably incorporated in the motor-side torque input, enhancing tracking robustness and interaction performance. By omitting high-order terms, the proposed scheme improves safety and computational tractability, while maintaining strong global asymptotical stability guarantees. Experimental results procured from an ASR (Baxter) reveal that not only does the proposed scheme improve interactional performance, but that it also leads to a gradual diminution of the link-position tracking error/s."

TI is expected to revolutionize many industries, including healthcare, transportation, and manufacturing. Despite recent TI initiatives, security aspects remain largely unexplored. TI presents several security challenges due to the increased complexity of the network and the criticality of the applications it supports. Thus, security aspects must be carefully designed to ensure that the benefits of the TI are not outweighed by the risks. In this article, we will initially identify the leading factors that drive TI, with regard to their applications and related technological trends, with respect to ETSI's Zero-touch Service Management (ZSM) principles. Then, we shed light on the primary security challenges, the current missing building blocks toward secure TI, and propose some potential solutions. Finally, we conclude the article with several recommendations and observations for the roadmap toward secure TI.

The criteria are dependent on the local topology information but are independent of the update and stop time intervals. An estimation method is also presented to calculate the inter-layer error convergence region. Additionally, the proposed method is applied to homogeneous multi-layer networks, and it yields complete synchronization for both intra- and inter-layer networks.

A compensation function observer is thus introduced, based on which a sliding mode control strategy is developed to enhance the position tracking precision and the disturbance rejection capability for permanent magnet synchronous motors. It is demonstrated that under the proposed method, different time-varying disturbances can be accurately estimated and the chattering phenomenon of the controller is effectively alleviated. It is rigorously proved mathematically that the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable. Finally, simulations and experiments are carried out on a permanent magnet synchronous motor platform, which demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits significant advantages over the existing control methods in position tracking precision and disturbance rejection."

    "abstract": "Traditionally, venous stents have been employed to maintain vessel patency in cases of venous obstruction. Recent advancements in stent-electrode technology have broadened their application to include endovascular neural interfaces for neurotechnological purposes within cerebral veins. However, the effects of neointimal hyperplasia on large venous sinuses, particularly the superior sagittal sinus and jugular vein, remain poorly understood. Additionally, concerns such as thrombosis, chronic inflammation, and tissue overgrowth pose challenges for their long-term use as neural interfaces. Methods: To investigate the impact of venous stenting on blood flow and tissue growth, we utilized Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling and animal experiments, assessing blood flow and tissue responses over 28 days. Results: Our findings revealed a negative power law correlation, with low wall shear stress (WSS) identified as the primary driver of accelerated tissue growth. Unlike the focal narrowing typically observed in stented arteries, venous tissue growth exhibited greater variability. Additionally, the threshold for low WSS that triggered growth was smaller than previously reported in arteries. Conclusion: This study provides new insights into venous neointimal hyperplasia, emphasizing the need to consider venous-specific responses in stent-electrode design and clinical applications. Nonetheless, potential risks such as thrombosis and inflammatory responses should be further investigated to fully understand the long-term viability of these devices. Significance: Understanding the biomechanical environment of stents in cerebral veins can guide the development of next-generation neural interfaces and inform clinicians and device developers about potential impacts on long-term outcomes."

    "abstract": "Transient instability of grid-forming inverter (GFMI) under large disturbance has attracted much attention in recent years. Existing studies have carried out comprehensive transient analysis for single GFMI system, but the research on multi-paralleled GFMIs system with complex transient interaction remains limited, particularly regarding equivalent transient model and accurate stability prediction method. For this, taking the transient interaction into consideration, transient equivalent model of multi-paralleled GFMIs system is newly established, where the grid-interactive path and inverter-interactive path are intuitively presented. Based on the established model, novel path-independent Lyapunov function (LF) set considering the transient interaction, power coupling, and damping dissipation is constructed for quantitative stability region estimation, which can accurately predict transient stability via the position of fault clearance point within or outside the stability region. Compared with conventional LF, the conservatism of estimated stability region is significantly reduced. Subsequently, the impact of transient interaction, damping dissipation, voltage dynamic, and the index of stability margin is defined to quantitatively represent robustness and give the guide for the design of critical parameters. Finally, experiments are conducted to verify the accuracy of stability region and relevant analysis."

    "abstract": "The Moon, with its stable surface reflectance and absence of an atmosphere, is an optimal reference for radiometric calibration of satellite sensors. The Robotic Lunar Observatory (ROLO) model, commonly utilized for this purpose, demonstrates phase dependent imprecision, impacting its predictive accuracy at varying phase angles. This limitation is especially problematic for instruments that cannot select the lunar phase for calibration. This study employs multi-source observational data from ground-based and Himawari-8 sensors to correct the phase dependent imprecision in the ROLO model. Analytical results reveal phase dependent imprecision of 1.89–7.08% across 470–2255 nm in the original ROLO model. After correction, this dependence is reduced to 0.24-0.37%, with a corresponding uncertainty of 3.84%. Utilizing multi-phase-angle lunar observations from FY-2H, the ROLO-corrected model successfully tracked its on-orbit degradation. The results indicate a 6.33–8.64% decline in the radiometric response of FY-2H over 6.5 years, thereby validating the model’s effectiveness in multi-phase-angle calibration. This study presents a robust lunar irradiance reference, particularly suitable for calibrating sensors limited by lunar phase selection, which is critical for long-term monitoring of satellite sensor degradation and enhancing the reliability of quantitative Earth observations."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the strong potential to assist both clinicians and the general public with their extensive medical knowledge. However, their application in healthcare is constrained due to concerns about the privacy of data used in training, which prevents the integration of private and personal information because of security and ethical issues. Moreover, if their capabilities can be enhanced with information retrieval to access up-to-date knowledge, the current integration of LLMs with Information retrieval lacks robustness to imperfect retrieval, which can hinder their effectiveness and even reduce overall performance. In this work, we address this challenge by introducing the Retrieval-Augmented Thought Process (RATP). Given access to external knowledge, RATP formulates the thought generation of LLMs as a multiple-step decision process. To optimise such a thought process, RATP leverages Monte-Carlo Tree Search and learns a proxy reward function that permits cost-efficient inference. On a private dataset of electronic medical records, deliberately excluded from any LLM training set, RATP achieves 35% additional accuracy compared to in-context retrieval-augmented generation for the question-answering task."

However, accurately detecting logos in complex environments presents significant challenges due to issues such as widespread occlusion, rotation, and scale variations. To tackle these issues, we developed an efficient network for logo detection to enhance logo saliency in complex environments. Our approach employs intra-inter class enforcement, which refines the contrast between foreground and background by utilizing image details and a learnable external guidance vector to generate more effective feature proposals. Additionally, we decouple the classification and regression tasks to minimize interference. In the regression branch, we strategically adjust the weighting of the Region of Interest (ROI) by focusing on both intra-ROI and inter-ROI relationships, effectively emphasizing the regression target. Extensive experiments conducted on three widely used logo datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed network.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose, for the first time, a photoacoustic spectroscopy (PAS) methane (CH<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">4</sup>) sensing system based on a semi-ellipsoidal photoacoustic cell with a spherical buffer chamber (SBC-SEPAC) to enhance the photoacoustic (PA) signal. The flow noise of the system is further suppressed through integration with a spherical buffer chamber. In this study, we simulated and optimized the acoustic properties and flow velocity of the SBC-SEPAC to investigate the influence of its structural parameters and buffer chamber structure. Using COMSOL software, we compared the acoustic properties (including resonant frequency and acoustic pressure distribution) of cylindrical, all-ellipsoidal, and semi-ellipsoidal resonators. The results demonstrate that the semi-ellipsoidal resonator exhibits superior performance compared to both all-ellipsoidal and conventional cylindrical resonators. Furthermore, we compared the flow velocity distributions in spherical and cylindrical buffer chambers using the laminar flow module. The simulation results demonstrate that the spherical buffer chamber more effectively suppresses flow noise. For experimental validation, we employed the novel SBC-SEPAC for CH<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">4</sup> concentration detection. The experimental results reveal that the SBC-SEPAC achieves outstanding performance, demonstrating excellent linearity (R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> = 0.99920) across a concentration range of 1000-12000 ppm. The system exhibits a standard deviation (σ) of 0.391 mV and achieves a minimum detection limit (MDL) of 1.18 ppm at 3500 ppm. The experimental results demonstrate that the SBC-SEPAC offers distinct advantages for enhancing PA signals and achieving a lower MDL. Consequently, the combination of a semi-ellipsoidal resonator with a spherical buffer chamber shows significant potential for both signal enhancement and system noise reduction. This approach presents a novel design strategy for developing high-performance photoacoustic cells (PACs)."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the capabilities and effectiveness of backward localization centered on reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). In the backward sensing paradigm, the region of interest (RoI) is illuminated using a set of diverse radiation patterns. These patterns encode spatial information into a sequence of measurements, which are subsequently processed to reconstruct the RoI. We show that a single RIS can estimate the direction of arrival of incident waves by leveraging configurational diversity, and that the spatial diversity provided by multiple RISs further improves the accuracy of source localization and power estimation. The underlying structure of the sensing operator in the multi-snapshot measurement process is clarified. For single-RIS localization, the sensing operator is decomposed into a product of structured matrices, each corresponding to a specific physical process: wave propagation to and from the RIS, the relative phase offsets of elements with respect to the reference point, and the applied phase configuration of each element. A unified framework for identifying key performance indicators is established by analyzing the conditioning of the sensing operators. In the multi-RIS setting, we derive–via rank analysis–the governing law among the RoI size, the number of elements, and the number of measurements. Upper bounds on the relative error of the least squares reconstruction algorithm are derived. These bounds clarify how key performance indicators affect estimation error and provide valuable guidance for system-level optimization. Numerical experiments confirm that the trend of the relative error is consistent with the theoretical bounds. Finally, we develop a proof-of-concept prototype using universal software radio peripherals and employ a magnitude-only reconstruction algorithm tailored to the system. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first experimental demonstration of its kind."

When the SSCTC is excited at its resonant wavelength with arbitrary polarization, q-BIC will be excited and both the electromagnetic chirality gradient and electromagnetic density will be enhanced. This produces a chiral lateral force on a nanoparticle that is one order of magnitude stronger than non-lateral force, causing the sideways motion of paired enantiomers to exhibit different directions. Our comprehensive simulations demonstrate that the SSCTC will offer high efficiency for chiral particle separation with the consideration of Brownian motion and chiral gradient force. Furthermore, the relationships of separation efficiency and chirality or size of nanoparticles have been investigated. We believe that our research will move forward the techniques of chiral optical tweezers and all-optical enantioseparation in pharmaceutical industries."

The structure achieves reversed nonreciprocity depending on diode bias, and the behavior is accurately modeled using CST’s schematic-based circuit analysis. Performance was further improved by adopting a low-loss Rogers 5880LZ substrate, enabling dual-band and dual-polarization nonreciprocity. The proposed metasurface offers a practical and low-profile solution for actively controllable nonreciprocal devices compatible with standard PCB processes."

    "abstract": "Despite huge successes on a wide range of tasks, neural networks are known to sometimes struggle to generalise to unseen data. Many approaches have been proposed over the years to promote the generalisation ability of neural networks, collectively known as regularisation techniques. These are used as common practice under the assumption that any regularisation added to the pipeline would result in a performance improvement. In this study, we investigate whether this assumption holds in practice. First, we provide a broad review of regularisation techniques, including modern theories such as double descent.We propose a taxonomy of methods under four broad categories, namely: (1) data-based strategies, (2) architecture strategies, (3) training strategies, and (4) loss function strategies. Notably, we highlight the contradictions and correspondences between the approaches in these broad classes. Further, we perform an empirical comparison of the various regularisation techniques on classification tasks for ten numerical and image datasets applied to the multi-layer perceptron and convolutional neural network architectures. Results show that the efficacy of regularisation is dataset-dependent. For example, the use of a regularisation term only improved performance on numeric datasets, whereas batch normalisation improved performance on image datasets only. Generalisation is crucial to machine learning; thus, understanding the effects of applying regularisation techniques, and considering the connections between them is essential to the appropriate use of these methods in practice."

    "abstract": "While directly connecting gas-insulated switchgear (GIS) to a DC de-icing circuit improves operational efficiency, the subsequent power restoration process imposes coupled stresses from elevated temperature and DC-AC switching electric fields on the insulators, creating a significant risk of surface flashover. In this study, the influence of such coupled conditions on the surface flashover characteristics of epoxy (EP) insulators was investigated through a combination of experimental testing and multiphysics simulations. A coupled test platform incorporating DC-AC switching electric fields and thermal fields was established, and a transient simulation model of gas–solid composite insulation with temperature-dependent parameters was developed. The results show that high temperature and prolonged DC operation intensify the accumulation of homopolar surface charges. Upon switching to AC voltage, the residual charges interact with the applied field, leading to severe local electric field distortion, particularly when the AC field opposes the charges polarity. This effect, exacerbated by temperature-induced increases in material conductivity and carrier mobility, leads to a sharp rise in flashover probability. At 80 °C with 5 min of DC pre-charging, the flashover probability reaches up to 60%. This study reveals the underlying physical mechanisms of flashover under coupled thermal and DC-AC switching electric field conditions, providing critical theoretical guidance for insulation design and safety assessment in DC de-icing applications of GIS."

Merging these two functions results in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. In this context, bistatic ISAC appears as a possibility to exploit the distributed nature of cellular networks while avoiding highly demanding hardware requirements such as full-duplex operation. Recent studies have introduced strategies to perform required synchronization and data exchange between nodes for bistatic ISAC operation, based on orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM), however, only for single-input single-output architectures. In this article, a system concept for a bistatic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-OFDM-based ISAC system with beamforming at both transmitter and receiver is proposed, and a distributed synchronization concept to ensure coherence among the different receive channels for direction-of-arrival estimation is presented. After a discussion on the ISAC processing chain, including relevant aspects for practical deployments such as transmitter digital pre-distortion and receiver calibration, a 4 × 8 MIMO measurement setup at 27.5GHz and results are presented to validate the proposed system and distribution synchronization concepts."

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the vulnerabilities of global supply chains (SCs) and highlighted the urgent need for resilient supply chains, particularly in the face of disruptions like panic-buying. Despite its significance, the literature lacks resilient SC models specifically designed to address challenges posed by panic-buying in retail supply chain. This research aims to fill that gap by designing a resilient supply chain model that incorporates strategies to improve agility, resilience, and survivability, while minimizing panic-buying’s impact in retail SCs during disruptions. This paper formulates the resilient supply chain design problem as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model, capturing strategic and operational decisions such as multiple sourcing, flexible capacity, and revenue sharing. Given its complexity and two objective functions we propose an adaptive NSGA-II specifically tailored for solving this high-dimensional model. Our results show that the supplier grading strategy improves service level and fill rate by 4% and 23%, respectively, while the revenue sharing strategy further enhances these metrics by 18% and 23%. However, the capacity planning strategy yields the most substantial improvements, with increases of 28% in service level and 36% in fill rate. The implications of this research are substantial; it provides a comprehensive framework for designing resilient retail supply chains, offering robust solutions to the challenges of panic-buying during disruptions. By integrating multiple strategies, this research advances the field of supply chain resilience, with practical applications for maintaining stability, improving service levels, fill rate and managing demand surges during critical disruptions."

However, like the Thévenin equivalent circuit, the derived Hoashi-Millman equivalent circuit accurately represents the original circuit's behavior only from the perspective of the connected load, not allowing the determination of the internal active or reactive powers of the original circuit. This article proposes an equivalent circuit for a two-terminal electrical network formed by multiple parallel branches, each containing a voltage source and its own series impedance, which preserves the original circuit's active and reactive power. It is demonstrated that the Hoashi-Millman equivalent circuit is a particular case of the proposed equivalent circuit."

For time-invariant channels, we employ an encoder-only transformer with multi-head attention mechanisms that processes channel-gain-to-noise ratio matrices to generate optimal channel-assignment matrices. For time-varying channels, we develop a hierarchical temporal correlation transformer that models user-specific temporal patterns before capturing inter-user dependencies. The custom loss functions address channel assignment constraints and temporal stability requirements. Numerical results demonstrate our approach’s superiority over baseline neural networks, achieving 95% accuracy in identifying optimal channel assignments while offering polynomial time complexity compared to the factorial complexity of exhaustive search methods."

While previous research has focused mainly on the acoustic features of ASMR, its visual dimension remains critically understudied despite being central to the multisensory experience. This paper presents the first comprehensive computational investigation of key visual triggers in ASMR videos. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work has quantitatively analyzed visual features in ASMR; existing studies address only auditory triggers or offer only qualitative commentary. Using a multimodal framework that integrates temporal color variance, motion dynamics, and three-dimensional facial and hand landmark modeling, we identify the visual components that differentiate highly engaging ASMR content from less engaging material. Our results show that stable facial expressions and hand postures enhance social presence and emotional comfort, while dynamic variations in motion and color reflect stylistic differences across creators. These visual patterns shape viewer engagement in ways linked to both performer style and audience psychological preferences. More broadly, our findings offer a quantitative foundation for optimizing the visual design of ASMR and other calming audiovisual media used for relaxation and affective regulation."

    "abstract": "This letter presents the design of a broadband three-stage sequential Doherty power amplifier (DPA) with an octave bandwidth and a large high-efficiency range. The proposed DPA employs the sequential operation mode and a post-matching network (PMN) to expand the operating bandwidth and back-off range. Utilizing the three-stage sequential DPA structure, the design achieves broadband and high-efficiency performance at 10–12 dB output power backoff (OBO) across the entire 1.0–2.0 GHz band. A prototype of the three-stage sequential DPA has been fabricated using commercial gallium nitride (GaN) devices. Measurements demonstrate that the maximum output power ranges from 43.5 to 45.7 dBm, with drain efficiencies of 51.1%–67.1% at 10–12 dB OBO and 58.9%–72.9% at saturation throughout the design band, respectively. These results validate the effectiveness of the proposed circuit architecture and design strategy."

    "abstract": "Twisted String Actuators (TSAs) are promising alternatives to conventional gear-based transmissions due to their high reduction ratios and compact form factors. However, practical limitations such as nonlinear hysteresis, limited stroke, and inherently unidirectional motion hinder their deployment in robotic systems. In this work, we propose a novel bidirectional TSA mechanism that addresses all three limitations simultaneously through an antagonistic configuration, asymmetric axis shift (AAS), and pre-tension tuning. This mechanism enables reliable bidirectional actuation by compensating for asymmetric contraction-extension behavior, suppresses hysteresis via adaptive tensioning, and extends the effective stroke. We implement the proposed design in a continuum finger module and derive a compact kinematic model for control. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the approach, demonstrating the attenuation of the hysteresis, accurate bidirectional bending control across a wide range (±180°), and the feasibility of integration into multi-finger grippers for dexterous manipulation. The results suggest that the proposed actuator design serves as a practical and scalable solution for compact robotic systems requiring precise and reversible motion."

While model-free reinforcement learning methods such as Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) can achieve high performance when full state information is available, their effectiveness typically degrades under partial state measurement. This paper proposes a two-phase control framework that decouples dynamics representation learning from policy optimization. A key novelty of our approach is the explicit use of measurement history to learn a predictive model of system dynamics, enabling a compact, dynamics-aware embedding to be constructed offline. This learned representation is then used to augment the input to a DDPG agent, facilitating stable and sample-efficient control under partial measurement. We evaluate the proposed approach on a high speed trajectory tracking task for a nonlinear electrohydraulic system. Results show that the method achieves desired tracking and rapid convergence under partial state measurement, outperforming recurrent reinforcement learning approaches in both sample efficiency and final tracking performance."

    "abstract": "A compact tri-patch MIMO antenna for WiFi band applications is proposed in this article. Different from traditional patch decoupling methods, a novel low-loss decoupling approach for a tri-patch based on mode matching method is proposed. Three active modes, forming a full-rank 3×3 mode matrix, are utilized to match and decouple the three ports of the tri-patch antenna. Theoretical derivation reveals that mode matrix bridges the passive and active S-parameters matrices. The active impedance matching of all ports is achieved in a straightforward step-by-step process by exploiting the different modes of the tri-patch antenna. Notably, a low-loss patch mode is discovered during the process, avoiding the use of conventional high-loss slot mode for decoupling and improving the total efficiency of the tri-patch antenna system. A prototype is fabricated and measured to validate the low-loss characteristic and decoupling performance.

    "abstract": "Artifact remains a long-standing challenge in High Dynamic Range (HDR) reconstruction. Existing methods focus on model designs for artifact mitigation but ignore explicit detection and suppression strategies. Because artifact lacks clear boundaries, distinct shapes, and semantic consistency, and there is no existing dedicated dataset for HDR artifact, progress in direct artifact detection and recovery is impeded. To bridge the gap, we propose a unified HDR reconstruction framework that integrates artifact detection and model optimization. Firstly, we build the first HDR artifact dataset (HADataset), comprising 1,213 diverse multi-exposure Low Dynamic Range (LDR) image sets and 1,765 HDR image pairs with per-pixel artifact annotations. Secondly, we develop an effective HDR artifact detector (HADetector), a robust artifact detection model capable of accurately localizing HDR reconstruction artifact. HADetector plays two pivotal roles: (1) enhancing existing HDR reconstruction models through fine-tuning, and (2) serving as a non-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) metric, the Artifact Score (AS), which aligns closely with human visual perception for reliable quality evaluation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and generalizability of our framework, including the HADataset, HADetector, fine-tuning paradigm, and AS metric. All code and datasets will be publicly released to facilitate future research."

We refer to this configuration as a corner RIS (C-RIS). The study is framed within the concept of a smart radio environment (SRE), where efficient wave guidance and control around obstacles, such as corners, play a role in enhancing communication. We initially introduce two possible types of C-RIS: i) C-RIS using receiving and transmitting metasurface antennas based on cylindrical surface waves (SW), where the two metasurfaces are coupled at their feed points via a transmission line; ii) C-RIS based on planar SW coupling, where the transmission around the corner is ensured by the intrinsic properties of the metasurface impedance near the edge. The focus of the paper is on this second type of C-RIS, and in particular on the transmission coefficient across the corner. This is achieved using the exact solution of the impedance wedge problem, analytically extended to complex values of the incident plane wave parameters. The solution is validated through full-wave analysis even in presence of losses. The formulas presented in this work have significant implications for the design of surface-wave communication systems in SREs."

    "abstract": "Cross-chain technology, as a key driver for enhancing interoperability of blockchains, enables asset transfer and exchange between different blockchains. At present, cross-chain models based on light clients are widely adopted due to their fully decentralized nature and applicability to diverse scenarios. However, the rapid advancement of on-chain analysis techniques, such as address linkage and fund flow tracking, has significantly increased risks of de-anonymization in cross-chain transactions, posing serious privacy challenges. In this paper, we propose SharedRXC, a privacy-preserving asset cross-chain scheme for the light-client cross-chain model, which guarantees address unlinkability without extra privacy trust assumptions. First, to hide cross-chain addresses during interchain transmission, we propose the Ring Account (RA) to replace a single address for sending or receiving funds. In addition, we propose a zero-knowledge proof-based method to verify virtual identity ownership, allowing the virtual identity to track fund balances without exposing the addresses. Second, to prevent the exposure of the link between an address and its virtual identity caused by fund amount differences during deposits or withdrawals, which would compromise address unlinkability, we propose the Shared Burn/Mint method to obscure on chain fund change differences. Based on the liability equalization mechanism, we design two privacy-preserving cross-chain protocols: the cross-chain asset transfer (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">SharedRXC.T</i>) and exchange (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">SharedRXC.E</i>) protocols.

The novelty of the method is the use of a unique binary tree topology of the switching circuit, as well as the designed evolutionary algorithm optimized for the specific task of thermal-to electric-energy direct conversion control and regulation. Pairs of TEGs, which create terminal leaves of binary tree topology, or a combination of their sub-circuits, can be flexibly configured in series or in parallel by means of MOSFET relays representing nodes of the electric circuit tree structure. Each switching node of this connecting network is set independently by the microcontroller to ensure the best-matched configuration of the electricity generating circuit. This solution allows to maximize the production yield of electric energy, which is generated respectively to the actual temperature decomposition on hot and cold sides of thermoelectric modules as well as to the electric load power point. The high outcomes achieved by the approach were practically proven in a laboratory experiment on a testing set with a panel of 16 modules generating electricity, working under temperature conditions regulated by the climatic chamber. In addition, plenty of simulations were executed, and the computational performances achieved confirmed the good scalability of the proposed technique. The electric energy generated was stored in a super-capacitor magazine, for which the results obtained during the tests proved approximately 2 times the charging efficiency improvement, in contrast to the standard system with fixed electric wiring of TEG modules."

Using only nine metasurfaces of silicon nanowires on a calcium fluoride substrate in combination with compressed sensing and dictionary learning algorithms, the proposed spectrometer achieves a spectral resolution of 10 nm across the 3-5 μm wavelength range, leading to a large spectral channel density of up to 200, surpassing most reported MWIR computational spectrometers.

    "abstract": "Pneumatic soft robots are well-suited for minimally invasive surgery owing to their compliance and safe interaction with tissues. However, achieving highly adaptive control is difficult owing to modeling inaccuracies, inter-chamber coupling, and disturbances from surgical instruments. Non-learning adaptive methods depend on simplified models and perform poorly in unstructured settings. Conversely, learning-based methods often impose high computational costs in multi-degree-of-freedom (multi-DoF) pneumatic systems. A previous study proposed a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based proportional–integral–derivative (G-PID) controller that combined PID stability with learning-based adaptability by aligning system behavior with a reference model. However, its performance in highly coupled multi-DoF pneumatic soft robots was unverified, and its online adversarial training was computationally intensive. We addressed these limitations by developing an offline-trained G-PID controller, shifting adversarial training offline to reduce computational overhead, achieving 23-fold faster convergence, and enabling real-time, model-free control with balanced adaptability and efficiency. We evaluated three multi-DoF data fusion strategies, showing effective coordination of DoF coupling while maintaining individual control fidelity. Validation on a multi-DoF soft robotic mechatronic system for single-port transvesical prostatectomy revealed tip errors below 0.16 mm across surgical instruments. Proposed controller enhances scalability and adaptability and may generalize to other mechatronic systems with nonlinear, coupled dynamics."

    "abstract": "This paper deals with the problem of dynamic trajectory planning for a group of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in unknown environments. The existing methods often suffer from excessive computational burden, which creates the gap between theoretical approaches and practical swarm deployment. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a distributed cooperative planning system (DCPS). The system consists of two levels: a trajectory planning level and a cooperative trajectory planning level. On the trajectory planning level, a kinodynamic Gaussian potential B-spline (KGPB) approach is designed by combining the local kinodynamic-A-star method and the Gaussian potential field B-spline method. Specifically, in the front-end, a trajectory is first generated by using the local kinodynamic-A-star method based on kinematics-dynamics constraints. And then, in the back-end, the trajectory is further optimized by using the Gaussian potential B-spline (GPB) method. On the cooperative trajectory planning level, a back field neighbor replanning (BFNP) approach is proposed, where each UAV only needs to communicate with the nearest neighbors. According to the potential collision region of the front UAV, the trajectory of the current UAV is dynamically improved to ensure safe and stable flight such that communication costs are significantly improved. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DCPS achieves at least a 27% increase in average velocity and a 24% reduction in traversal time for the UAV swarm compared to prior methods. The experimental outcomes provide further validation that the proposed DCPS can generate efficient and safe trajectories. For particular cases, the UAV operates at 97% of its maximum possible velocity. The proposed DCPS provides a reliable solution for a group of unmanned aerial vehicles in unknown environments."

Our approach combines a Hard Layout Type Rules Module (H-LTRs) that establishes rigid type-aware constraints through spatial pattern mining with a Soft Layout Type Rule Reasoning Module (S-LTRs) that parameterizes rule inference via neural networks. Through a rule consistency loss function, S-LTRs learns under hard rule guidance, preventing incorrect rule acquisition.

To address this issue, this paper proposes a fluid antenna (FA)-assisted MEC-SAGIN system, which enhances channel transmission conditions and reduces uplink task offloading latency by flexibly adjusting the antenna ports of edge computing users equipped with FAs. Specifically, we aim to minimize the maximum total computational delay (TCD) of edge computing tasks for ground users (GUs) and the satellite user (SU) by jointly optimizing the task offloading strategies, computational resource allocation, FA port positions, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) location, and the receive beamforming matrix. To solve this non-convex problem, we employ the block coordinate descent (BCD) technique to decompose the original problem into four subproblems. The subproblems are optimized using a combination of low-complexity iterative algorithms and the projected gradient descent (PGD) method to refine communication and computation configurations as well as FA port selection. Simulation results demonstrate that the FA-assisted scheme significantly improves the TCD performance of the MEC-SAGIN system. It maintains transmission stability and reliability in dynamic environments while outperforming conventional fixed-position antennas (FPAs) and random-port antenna schemes."

However, scheduling data transmission in these dynamic networks is challenging due to rapidly changing satellite positions. This research introduces BoostRL (boosted reinforcement learning), a novel framework integrating large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) for efficient scheduling in LEO satellite constellations. BoostRL leverages LLM-generated initial policies to accelerate convergence, thereby guiding the early stages of policy learning while adapting swiftly to dynamic network conditions. It employs a hybrid policy approach which transitions smoothly from LLM recommendations to autonomous RL policies. A tailored initialization of Q-value parameters and an enhanced loss function further optimize learning efficiency, by aligning the initial learning phase with LLM-generated insights. Simulations using two-line element (TLE) orbital data demonstrate that BoostRL achieves rapid convergence and improved efficiency, thereby validating its potential as a scalable, adaptive solution for managing satellite communication networks."

    "abstract": "Recently, deep learning has advanced bearing fault diagnosis; however, most methods still model fault type or fault degree as a single task and tend to degrade under noise and changing operating conditions. To address this, we propose MT-SCGXNet, a multi-task framework that fuses spatial and temporal cues to perform Fault Type Diagnosis (FTD) and Fault Degree Diagnosis (FDD) simultaneously. The method employs a Swin Transformer combined with CBAM to extract spatial features from 2-D signal representations, uses a GRU to model temporal dependencies, and feeds the fused representation into an XGBoost classifier. We compare five spatial encodings (CWT, STFT, GADF, MTF, RP) and select STFT as the default representation because it consistently achieves higher accuracy in high-noise scenarios. On the CWRU and XJTU-SQ datasets, MT-SCGXNet attains ~100% accuracy without noise and remains >97% at −5 dB for both FTD and FDD, outperforming strong baseline models across noise levels; even at −8 to −10 dB, accuracy stays around 85–92%. Relative to the next-best model, the minimum accuracy under noise improves by +1.33% (FTD) and +7.53% (FDD). Ablations show that adding the GRU yields up to +6.71% improvement for FTD at −5 dB, and adding XGBoost yields up to +2.21% for FDD at −3 dB. These results demonstrate a robust, noise-resilient, and condition-invariant multi-task diagnostic capability.The source code is available at https://github.com/LI-Chunhui0219/MT-SCGXNet."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a new architecture for the low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite ground station aided by movable antenna (MA) array. Unlike conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA), the MA array can flexibly adjust antenna positions to reconfigure array geometry, for more effectively mitigating interference and improving communication performance in ultra-dense LEO satellite networks. To reduce movement overhead, we configure antenna positions at the antenna initialization stage, which remain unchanged during the whole communication period of the ground station. To this end, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the average achievable rate of the ground station by jointly optimizing its antenna position vector (APV) and time-varying beamforming weights, i.e., antenna weight vectors (AWVs). To solve the resulting non-convex optimization problem, we adopt the Lagrangian dual transformation and quadratic transformation to reformulate the objective function into a more tractable form. Then, we develop an efficient block coordinate descent-based iterative algorithm that alternately optimizes the APV and AWVs until convergence is reached. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed MA scheme significantly outperforms traditional FPA by increasing the achievable rate at ground stations under various system setups, thus providing an efficient solution for interference mitigation in future ultra-dense LEO satellite communication networks."

A correlation check module is introduced to handle scenarios where nodes outnumber or match sources. Furthermore, a temporal alignment module using two different strategies is designed to address time delays among nodes.

We investigate the potential mismatch between familiar visual encodings and tactile perception in an exploratory study into the strategies employed by BLV people to measure com mon graphical primitives converted to tactile representations. First, we replicate the Cleveland and McGill study on graphical perception using swell form printing with eleven BLV subjects. Then, we present results from a group interview in which we describe the strategies used by our subjects to read four common chart types. While our results suggest that familiar encodings based on visual perception studies can be useful in tactile graphics, our subjects also expressed a desire to use encodings designed explicitly for BLV people. Based on this study, we identify gaps between the perceptual expectations of common charts and the perceptual tools available in tactile perception. Then, we present a set of guidelines for the design of tactile graphics that accounts for these gaps.

    "abstract": "Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading represents a paradigm shift from traditional centralized energy transactions. Within the P2P energy trading, Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) energy trading emerges as a quintessential example, underscoring the significance of exploring P2P energy trading in dynamic contexts. The investigation into V2V energy trading gains profound importance due to electric vehicles (EVs) acting as dynamic nodes within the network. This dynamism adds a layer of complexity and universality to the research. Blockchain technology offers a seamless match for the distributed nature of V2V energy trading. However, the majority of existing studies on blockchain-based V2V overlook the highly dynamic nature of EV nodes. Moreover, there is a notable scarcity of research focusing on the scalability of blockchain within the context of V2V energy trading. To address these challenges, this paper introduces sharding technique to explore its advantages and necessity in applying blockchain sharding to V2V energy trading, proposing a dynamic node sharding (DNS) strategy. The focus of our proposed method lies in the selection of sharding mechanisms, addressing the additional latency caused by cross-shard transactions, and mitigating the security vulnerabilities introduced by shard boundaries. We test our proposed method on the advanced BlockEmulator platform and deploy the V2V energy trading blockchain (ETB) on Hyperledger Fabric. The experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms non-sharded V2V ETB approaches in terms of throughput and scalability. Furthermore, in comparison with other sharded V2V ETB frameworks, our method exhibits significant enhancements in both the management of cross-shard transaction validity and latency, and in the reinforcement of security protocols."

On ESP32, our device reduces encryption time by up to 42.4% compared to representative baselines; it achieves 28.57% at 100KB and 30% at 50 KB. Energy consumption decreases by 16.7%–28.57% across payloads, while throughput reaches 435 Mbps (about +3.57% over the strongest comparator at 500 KB). The one-time ECDH overhead is 8.1 ms/1.14 mJ and amortizes to <5% of total energy for payloads >100 KB. These results, obtained under rigorous experimental profiling, demonstrate that the proposed hardware–algorithm co-design delivers a secure, high-performance, and energy-efficient cryptographic substrate for diverse IoT deployments, strengthening both confidentiality and resilience while fitting tight resource budgets."

Previous backdoor detection methods primarily focus on the static features of backdoor samples. However, a vital property of diffusion models is their inherent dynamism. This study introduces a novel backdoor detection perspective named <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Dynamic Attention Analysis (DAA)</b>, showing that these dynamic characteristics serve as better indicators for backdoor detection.

    "abstract": "Very large scale integration (VLSI) circuits typically consist of millions of nets, posing significant challenges for efficient physical design. Interconnect delay has become a critical factor for timing performance in technology nodes at 5nm and beyond. Additionally, the coupling effect among the wires increases the complexity of delay optimization. Moreover, tapering constraints are essential in advanced technology nodes to ensure manufacturability. Furthermore, the ever-increasing scale of modern designs necessitates a high-performance computing (HPC) framework to accelerate delay-driven layer assignment in advanced technology nodes. To address these challenges, we propose ParDelay, a parallel delay-driven layer assignment leveraging hierarchical task graph modeling while considering tapering constraints for advanced technology nodes, which includes the following five key techniques: 1) A general deterministic parallel framework is proposed for delay-driven layer assignment, leveraging a hierarchical task graph to enable both internet and inter-node parallelism. 2) A delay- and overflow-driven tapering repairing strategy is proposed to eliminate tapering violations while further optimizing net delay. 3) A local delay-critical net filtering method is proposed to analyze local delay criticality to guide layer assignment, thereby minimizing delay while eliminating overflow. 4) To mitigate the coupling effect, we propose a net shielding algorithm that reduces wire density for maximum delay candidate nets to optimize maximum delay. 5) A delay-aware refinement strategy is proposed to classify nets by their delay rank and assign distinct non-default-rule (NDR) wire permissions and refinement objectives, thereby reducing delay. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to existing layer assignment algorithms and parallel routing frameworks, our approach effectively reduces delay, via count, and runtime under the tapering constraints."

The polynomial chirplet transform (PCT) can effectively highlight the time-varying characteristics of signals. However, PCT is limited by the uncertainty principle, resulting in lower TF resolution. At the same time, as a parameterized TFA method, PCT is unable to address multi-component signals. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel TFA method called polynomial-demodulated extracting transform (PDET). In this method, the instantaneous frequency (IF) trajectory of the signal is estimated by building the local maximum principle. Then, the TF coefficients are redistributed onto the retrieved IF, yielding satisfactory TFR and accurate IF estimation. Additionally, this study builds a separation strategy for multi-component signals by introducing binary graphs and connectivity structures from image processing technology, which solves the limitation of PDET in handling multi-component signals. The effectiveness of the proposed method in highlighting the time-varying features and noise robustness is verified by the simulated signals compared with advanced TFA methods. Finally, we apply PDET to real vibration data to further demonstrate the potential of PDET for bearing fault diagnosis."

At the 1550 nm operating wavelength, the structure exhibits a minimum confinement loss of 3.29×10-6 dB/km, which is two orders of magnitude lower than that of double-layer circular nested structures, and surface scattering loss of approximately 1.1×10-2 dB/km. At a 6 cm bending radius, the bending loss is below 5.8×10-3 dB/km. The low-loss performance of this fiber structure has potential applications including long-haul optical fiber communications, fiber gas lasers, and distributed sensing systems."

    "abstract": "Connectomics, a subfield of neuroscience, aims to map and analyze synapse-level wiring diagrams of the nervous system. While recent advances in deep learning have accelerated automated neuron and synapse segmentation, reconstructing accurate connectomes still demands extensive human proofreading to correct segmentation errors. We present SynAnno, an interactive tool designed to streamline and enhance the proofreading of synaptic annotations in large-scale connectomics datasets. SynAnno integrates into existing neuroscience workflows by enabling guided, neuron-centric proofreading. To address the challenges posed by the complex spatial branching of neurons, it introduces a structured workflow with an optimized traversal path and a 3D mini-map for tracking progress. In addition, SynAnno incorporates fine-tuned machine learning models to assist with error detection and correction, reducing the manual burden and increasing proofreading efficiency. We evaluate SynAnno through a user and case study involving seven neuroscience experts. Results show that SynAnno significantly accelerates synapse proofreading while reducing cognitive load and annotation errors through structured guidance and visualization support.

    "abstract": "With the increasing popularity of voice-centric applications, acoustic eavesdropping attacks pose a significant threat to user privacy. Although smartphones require explicit user permission to access the microphone, such attacks can bypass this restriction by exploiting power consumption data through compromised power supplies, such as USB adapters, public charging stations, and power banks. However, previous attempts can only recognize a limited set of hotwords or digits. To address this limitation, we introduce PowerEar, an acoustic eavesdropping attack that leverages the power side channel to reconstruct any audio reproduced by the built-in loudspeaker of a mobile device with an unconstrained vocabulary. Our approach relies on a combination of signal processing and generative techniques to learn the mapping between power consumption and audio playback, enabling the reconstruction of such audio through spectrogram enhancement. To validate the effectiveness of PowerEar attack, we carry out a comprehensive set of experiments using audio samples from various public personalities. Our results obtained through objective and subjective evaluations clearly demonstrate that PowerEar can successfully recover user speeches from power consumption data in comprehensive realistic settings, including speech utterances of individuals and different devices, mobile operating systems, activities, charging technology, battery and volume levels."

While integrated microwave photonic filters (IMPFs) offer a solution, existing application-specific (AS) photonic integrated circuits (PICs) lack programmability and require costly redesigns. Inspired by the hardware flexibility of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), this work demonstrates a field-programmable hexagonal mesh PIC that enables software-defined reconfiguration of microwave photonic filters (MPFs). By programming voltages across tunable basic units (TBUs), the IMPF achieves a dynamic tuning of notch frequency (132 GHz), with a rejection ratio (RR) of 27.28 dB, and a 3-dB bandwidth of 0.4 GHz. Experimental validation in 2-Gb/s quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) communications shows >40% error vector magnitude (EVM) improvement under strong interference, outperforming state-of-the-art ASICs. This platform bridges photonic integration with functional adaptability, providing a scalable foundation for future radio frequency (RF) systems."

    "abstract": "Large scale of distributed energy access makes the operation mode of the power system gradually change, and the volatility of new energy generation will also bring an impact to the power grid. In this context, the introduction of shared energy storage to participate in Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading can realize the independent energy management of power grid prosumers and eliminate the uncertainty brought by distributed energy. In order to strengthen the management of prosumers and shared energy storage, this paper proposes a shared energy storage leasing trading mechanism that is coordinated with P2P trading, and introduces conditional value at risk (CVaR) to measure the risk brought by the uncertainty of new energy output to prosumers. A two-layer game model based on Stackelberg game is constructed to maximize the economic benefits of each market player. Finally, through the example analysis, it is proved that this mechanism can not only effectively reduce both the impact of distributed energy generation on the grid side and the risk on the prosumer side, but also increase the income of prosumers and shared energy storage operators. Such that the mechanism can stimulate prosumers and third parties to participate in the P2P market."

    "abstract": "During power cycling tests, accurate online monitoring and identification of the aging state of SiC MOSFETs is crucial for failure precursor analysis and lifespan prediction of the devices. Due to the nonlinear voltage-current relationship of SiC MOSFETs and the effects of thermal-electrical coupling, the data obtained from online monitoring often fails to directly reflect their actual aging states. This paper proposes an adaptive sequential particle filtering method that takes into account the thermal-electrical coupling effects of SiC MOSFETs during power cycling tests, enabling accurate online identification and tracking of their aging process. The method extracts the aging state of the SiC MOSFET within a single power cycling test cycle using sequential particle filtering and achieves rapid tracking of the aging process by adaptively adjusting its noise. This paper validates that adaptive sequential particle filtering can accurately track changes in key aging parameters through power cycling tests on a commercial 1200V SiC MOSFET. This work enhances the richness of data from power cycling tests by real-time tracking of the aging state, which can effectively support online failure precursor analysis and the development of more accurate lifespan models for SiC MOSFETs."

    "abstract": "Recent datacenter network topologies are shifting towards heterogeneous and structured topologies for high throughput, low cost, and simple manageability. However, they rely on sub-optimal routing approaches that fail to achieve their designed capacity. This paper proposes a process for designing optimal oblivious routing that is programmed compactly on programmable switches. The process consists of three contributions in tandem. We first transform a robust optimization problem for designing oblivious routing into a linear program, which is solvable in polynomial time but cannot scale for datacenter topologies. We then prove that the repeated structures in a datacenter topology lead to a structured optimal solution. We use this insight to formulate a scalable linear program, so an optimal oblivious routing solution is obtained in polynomial time for large-scale topologies. For real-world deployment, the optimal solution is converted into forwarding rules for programmable switches with stringent memory. With this constraint, we utilize the repeated structures in the optimal solution to group the forwarding rules, resulting in compact forwarding rules with a much smaller memory requirement. Extensive evaluations show our process i) obtains optimal solutions faster and more scalable than a state-of-the-art technique and ii) reduces the memory requirement by no less than 90% for most considered topologies."

    "abstract": "Free-space optical (FSO) communications technology has been widely applied in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks to offer the ambitious large-capacity, high-security, and interference-immuned links. However, due to atmospheric disturbances at low-altitude airspace as well as flexible-mobility and jitter of the UAV platform, the FSO link between UAVs often suffers from frequent beam misalignment, leading to undesired interruption of communications. Therefore, in this letter, we conceive a UAV-to-UAV (U2U) FSO beam alignment system, where an adaptive exploration driven deep deterministic policy gradient (AED-DDPG) algorithm is proposed to enhance the FSO link quality. By jointly optimizing transmit power and divergence angle at the transmitter site, associated to the field-of-view (FoV) angle at the receiver site, the minimized outage probability can be consequently attained. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively improves the FSO beam alignment of the U2U link under dynamic conditions, which further enhances the robustness of the UAV-FSO system."

    "abstract": "Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) formulas play a significant role in treating epidemics and complex diseases. Existing models for TCM utilize traditional algorithms or deep learning techniques to analyze formula relationships, yet lack comprehensive results, such as complete formula compositions and detailed explanations. Although recent efforts have used TCM instruction datasets to fine-tune Large Language Models (LLMs) for explainable formula generation, existing datasets lack sufficient details, such as the roles of the formula's sovereign, minister, assistant, courier; efficacy; contraindications; tongue and pulse diagnosis——limiting the depth of model outputs. To address these challenges, we propose ZhiFang DanTai, a framework combining Graph-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) with LLM fine-tuning. ZhiFang DanTai uses GraphRAG to retrieve and synthesize structured TCM knowledge into concise summaries, while also constructing an enhanced instruction dataset to improve LLMs' ability to integrate retrieved information. Furthermore, we provide novel theoretical proofs demonstrating that integrating GraphRAG with fine-tuning techniques can reduce generalization error and hallucination rates in the TCM formula task. Experimental re sults on both collected and clinical datasets demonstrate that ZhiFang DanTai achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art models.

    "abstract": "Analyzing conflicts between multiple objects within fuzzy information systems (ISs) and providing effective conflict resolution are challenging tasks due to the complexity and uncertainty of the real world. This article proposes a three-way conflict analysis and resolution model for intuitionistic fuzzy ISs (IFISs) based on three-way concept analysis (3WCA). First, the straight and vertical distances between intuitionistic fuzzy values (IFVs) are defined to obtain an intuitionistic fuzzy probability–credibility distribution. Second, intuitionistic fuzzy optimistic and pessimistic formal contexts are proposed based on two novel binary relations of intuitionistic fuzzy information. Afterward, two intuitionistic fuzzy concept lattices are obtained to analyze the marginal conflict degrees among multiple objects via consistency, inconsistency, and uncertainty attribute sets. By introducing three pairs of thresholds, the trisections of object pairs, objects, and attributes are derived through the three-way decision (3WD) process. Specifically, the maximal alliance unit, minimal conflict unit, and feasible strategy set are identified according to the three-way conflict analysis results. Subsequently, the consistency measure extracted from the intuitionistic fuzzy distance matrix is utilized to rank all feasible strategies. Finally, the experimental results are conducted to verify the effectiveness, superiority, and feasibility of the proposed model."

    "abstract": "Conventional Cu-Sn bonding uses a thick Sn layer to adapt to bump nonplanarity as Sn melts as liquid. However, it is always squeezed to overflow by bonding force, limiting bump pitch reduction. This letter reports a Cu-Sn bonding method that is able to achieve ultra-fine bump pitches and ultra-thin intermetallic compounds (IMCs) using porous Cu and Cu-Sn bumps. The deformability of porous Cu gives it a certain degree of adaptability that thick Sn layers have, allowing to replace thick Sn layers with thin ones. Bonding force presses porous Cu into the Sn layer of Cu-Sn bumps, separating the continues Sn layer into small parts and forming a porous Cu-Sn mutual embedding structure. During bonding, porous Cu reacts and consumes the surrounding liquid Sn quickly, preventing it from forming large-volume liquid Sn. Cu-Sn bumps with a pitch of 1.5 μm have been bonded with porous Cu. A 250 nm thin IMC layer and a 77.9 mΩ low resistance have been achieved."

    "abstract": "The geometric growth trend of wireless communication traffic has imposed higher demands on the spectral efficiency of transmitters. To balance the trade-off between transmission power and spectrum emission in adjacent channels, the iterative learning control (ILC) technique has emerged as a solution for power amplifiers (PAs) with strong nonlinearity. In order to reproduce the predistorted signal obtained by ILC, cascaded structures are often employed in predistorters, offering a practical engineering solution with improved correction performance compared to single conventional models. However, such structures are relatively cumbersome and cannot efficiently extract the required inverse information of the PAs within a short time. This paper proposes a lightweight predistorter for strong distortion based on parameter pruning, which filters the model basis function to achieve more accurate predistortion signal generation within a limited frequency range. Experimental results demonstrate its stable performance in linearization and rapid adaptation capability under varying power levels and carrier frequencies."

Conventional methods often overlook nuanced propagation patterns and contextual interactions among services, and they are limited in leveraging multi-source observability data for comprehensive root cause identification. This study introduces CARE, a context-aware, spectrum-analysis-based approach that integrates multi-source observability data and employs network analysis to prioritize the contextual significance of components in propagating anomalies across individual services, service communities, and requests. CARE’s weighted spectrum analysis leverages these prioritized contexts to pinpoint underlying performance issues. Evaluations on 224 cases from the TrainTicket benchmark and a real-world Internet service provider’s production system demonstrate CARE’s substantial accuracy gains, with top-1 accuracy of 72%-89% and top-5 accuracy of 84%-99% for single root causes, outperforming baselines by 8%-41%. CARE also shows significant improvements in dual root cause identification, exceeding baseline performance by 18%-37%, all while maintaining efficient resource usage, establishing CARE as a robust and resource-effective solution for root cause localization in complex microservice environments."

    "abstract": "DECT NR+ is the new kid on the block in wireless technologies: it re-purposes the 1.9 GHz Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications (DECT) standard for IoT-type applications. How does DECT NR+ perform in practice and where should we be using it? The ambition of this article is to provide answers to those questions. We start by an overview of the fundamental principles of the physical layer. We then survey the DECT NR+ products on the market today. Using the nRF91 series from Nordic Semiconductor, we conduct a comprehensive set of hands-on power consumption and communication range measurements. Our results place DECT NR+ in a gap in-between existing technologies. Its range is comparable to long range standards such as IEEE 802.15.4g under certain parameter choices: 200 m in an urban setting, 6 km in the most favorable lineof- sight conditions. For higher order Modulation and Coding Schemes, range drops and is rather comparable to Wi-Fi. The nRF9161 draws significant power (at 3.7 V, 220 mA transmitting at +19 dBm, 45 mA receiving), approximately 10x higher than BLE radios. This is likely primarily due to earlystage design inefficiencies and the inherent complexity of the DECT NR+ physical layer, limiting its adoption in batterypowered applications. We conclude that DECT NR+ is particularly appropriate for applications that require a dynamic tradeoff between communication range and data rate, but are not cost-sensitive."

Most deep learning-based approaches for fake news detection yield accurate predictions but lack explainability. Existing models focusing on explainability visualize key components from results or generate surface causes via Large Language Models. However, they can hardly provide the deep rationale behind the fabrication of fake news, which is indispensable for misinformation mitigation. Thus, we approach explainability from a different perspective, focusing on explaining how fake news is fabricated, which we term deceptive patterns, at its very source. First, four types of deceptive patterns are pre-established, namely <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Image Manipulation</i>, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Cross-modal Inconsistency</i>, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Image Repurposing</i> and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Others</i>. Based on this, we propose GE-NSLM, a General Explainable Neuro-Symbolic Latent Model that integrates the power of Large Vision Language Models, which not only provides accurate judgments but also offers insights on deceptive patterns. Specifically, each deceptive pattern is represented as a binary learnable latent variable, obtained through amortized variational inference and weak supervision guided by logical rules. Experiments show GE-NSLM achieves competitive performance. More importantly, it provides interpretable insights into the underlying reasons why specific news items are fake.

After that, we propose AIF-D as an extension of AIF-B towards deeper emotional reflection, effectively leveraging generative priors from pre-trained large-scale diffusion models. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that AIF models achieve superior performance for both content consistency and emotional fidelity compared to state-of-the-art methods. Extensive user study experiments demonstrate that AIF models are significantly more effective at evoking specific emotions. Based on the presented results, we comprehensively discuss the value and potential of AIF models."

A voltage-equalizer circuit that uses a resonant structure to improve performance is proposed to address these issues. It includes a small optimal capacitor network, which transfers energy from any-cell-to-any-cell (AC2AC) in a battery pack, ensuring constant balancing speed, regardless of the number of cells or their initial voltage distribution. Additionally, soft-switching conditions are provided to reduce switching losses and EMI noise, which ultimately increase converter efficiency and make it possible to increase the switching frequency. Consequently, the passive-component volumes are effectively reduced and high power density is practically available. The proposed circuit has been mathematically analyzed and simulated using PSpice for six series-connected battery cells. Its prototype circuit has also been implemented to confirm the analyses and simulation results, which provides an efficiency of 94.6%. Finally, it has been compared with previously introduced structures, which clearly shows a significant improvement in balancing speed, for instance, 70% and 56% improvement as compared to the mesh and delta structures, respectively."

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in radiance field rendering show promising results in 3D scene representation, where Gaussian splatting-based techniques emerge as state-of-the-art due to their quality and efficiency. Gaussian splatting is widely used for various applications, including 3D human representation. However, previous 3D Gaussian splatting methods can not render RGB and human features simultaneously. Furthermore, these methods either use parametric body models as additional information or fail to provide any underlying structure, like human biomechanical features, which are essential for various applications such as medical diagnosis. In this paper, we present a novel approach called HFGaussian that can estimate novel views and human features, such as the 3D skeleton, 3D key points, and dense pose, from sparse input images simultaneously in real time at 25 FPS. The proposed method leverages the generalizable Gaussian splatting technique to represent the human subject and 3D consistent human features, enabling efficient and generalizable reconstruction. By incorporating a pose regression network and the feature splatting technique with Gaussian splatting, HFGaussian demonstrates improved capabilities over existing 3D human methods, showcasing the potential of 3D human representations with integrated biomechanics. We thoroughly evaluate our HFGaussian method against the latest state-of-the-art techniques in human Gaussian splatting methods, demonstrating its real-time, state-of-the-art performance.

The objective is to design bearing-only control laws that guide an autonomous robot to the point that minimizes the weighted sum of Euclidean distances to a set of beacons, known as the Fermat–Weber point. In contrast to previous studies that focus on simplified models such as single-or double-integrator dynamics, this work considers Euler–Lagrange systems, which offer a more realistic representation of physical robot dynamics. The physical parameters of the robot are considered unknown. For stationary beacons, we develop a bearing-only control law using an adaptive backstepping method to steer the robot to the Fermat–Weber point. We then extend the analysis to a case in which the beacons move with a constant velocity, and the dynamics of the robot is affected by disturbances. To address this scenario, we propose a novel robust adaptive bearing-only control law that allows the robot to track the moving Fermat–Weber point. Both proposed control laws guarantee asymptotic convergence, and simulation results are provided to validate the theoretical findings."

    "abstract": "Video-based visible-infrared person re-identification (VVI-ReID) aims to match target pedestrians between visible and infrared videos, which is significantly applied in 24-hour surveillance systems. The key of VVI-ReID is to learn modality invariant and spatio-temporal invariant sequence-level representation to solve the challenges such as modality differences, spatio-temporal misalignment, and domain shift noise. However, existing methods predominantly emphasize on reducing modality discrepancy while relatively neglect temporal misalignment and domain shift noise reduction. To this end, this paper proposes a VVI-ReID framework called Feature Alignment Network (FA-Net) from the perspective of feature alignment, aiming to mitigate temporal misalignment. FA-Net comprises two main alignment modules: Spatial-Temporal Alignment Module (STAM) and Modality Distribution Constraint (MDC). STAM integrates global and local features to ensure individuals’ spatial representation alignment. Additionally, STAM also establishes temporal relationships by exploring inter-frame features to address cross-frame person feature matching. Furthermore, we introduce the Modality Distribution Constraint (MDC), which utilizes a symmetric distribution loss to align the distributions of features from different modalities. Besides, the SAM Guidance Augmentation (SAM-GA) strategy is designed to transform the image space of RGB and IR frames to provide more informative and less noisy frame information. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods. Our code will be available at: https://github.com/code/FANet."

For security-critical applications, e.g., face recognition (FR), the importance of a theoretically robust defense against adversarial perturbations has been spotlighted. Certifiable robustness aims to defend against adversarial perturbations in a provable manner, and several studies have been conducted to achieve certifiable robustness in various domains. However, most existing studies for certifiable robustness are about classifiers, and adapting their techniques for FR is a non-trivial problem. In this study, we show that, similar to the image classifications, the 1-Lipschitz condition is sufficient for certifiable robustness of the face recognition system against any ℓ<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><i>p</i></sub> norm adversaries for <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</i> ∈ N∪{∞}.

    "abstract": "This paper develops a unified stochastic modelling framework to capture the uncertainty and variability of load-shedding events in electric power systems. The approach combines discrete and continuous stochastic processes by first formulating a discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC) from empirical load-shedding data, then extending it to a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) and finally approximating it through a diffusion process governed by a stochastic differential equation (SDE). This hybrid formulation bridges discrete reliability states with continuous dynamic behavior, enabling probabilistic representation of load-shedding frequency, duration, and severity. The paper evaluates the approximation accuracy between the CTMC and diffusion models using correlation, mean-squared error, total-variation distance, and Kullback–Leibler divergence. Analytical and Monte Carlo simulations confirm that the diffusion process accurately reproduces both the temporal and stationary characteristics of the CTMC. The framework is further validated against empirical industry data on national load-shedding behavior, showing strong agreement for the Loss of Load Expectation (LOLE) and Loss of Energy Expectation (LOEE) metrics. The proposed methodology offers a mathematically rigorous yet practical tool for probabilistic adequacy assessment and provides a foundation for future extensions involving non-Markovian models and physics-informed learning of power-system reliability dynamics."

    "abstract": "Modern vehicles generate high-frequency, multivariate data streams from the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus, the fundamental digital nervous system for in-vehicle communication. Although its primary role is real-time control of vehicle subsystems, the CAN bus also serves as a rich source of derived information on vehicle state and driver behavior. These data are particularly valuable for Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) applications such as driver identification, predictive maintenance, and cooperative perception. However, transmitting raw data is often impractical due to bandwidth limitations in wireless networks. To address this challenge, we propose BinaryCAN, a novel framework that learns compact latent representations directly from automotive time series using autoencoders with binary bottlenecks. Our approach leverages the Straight-Through Estimator (STE) to enforce discrete embeddings while preserving task-relevant semantics.We evaluated three architectures, including a new binary encoder based on the graph neural network (GNN), on downstream tasks such as fuel supplier classification, oil brand identification, speed regression, and driver fingerprinting. Experimental results demonstrate that our learned embeddings not only maintain strong performance in these tasks while achieving substantial compression compared to the raw data, but in some cases even surpass raw data performance. Our work suggests that learned binary embeddings can potentially complement or enhance traditional V2X messaging by enabling more efficient transmission of semantically rich information."

    "abstract": "In recent years, the evaluation of motion skills in fields such as dance and exercise has benefited from the proliferation of motion-capture technologies. This study proposes a computationally efficient method for segmenting and comparing time-series human motion data across individuals with varying skill levels. The method extends the Gaussian process hidden semi-Markov model (GP-HSMM) by incorporating random Fourier features (RFF), enabling motion segments to be modeled through linear regression and significantly reducing computational complexity. We also introduce sequential learning to support the incremental adaptation of the model to new individuals, which facilitates quantitative motion comparisons on a per-segment and per-joint basis. To preserve segmentation accuracy despite the approximation introduced by RFF, we optimize the kernel parameters using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm within a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework. Experiments on publicly available exercise and dance datasets show that the proposed method achieves segmentation performance similar to GP-HSMM while reducing training time from several days to minutes. Moreover, the method supports the quantitative visualization of motion-skill differences, illustrated through a joint-level analysis of choreographic elements performed by dancers with different skill levels."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we aim to estimate the relative pose and focal length between two views with known intrinsic parameters except for an unknown focal length from two affine correspondences (ACs). Cameras are commonly used in combination with inertial measurement units (IMUs) in applications such as self-driving cars, smartphones, and unmanned aerial vehicles. The vertical direction of camera views can be obtained by IMU measurements. The relative pose between two cameras is reduced from 5DOF to 3DOF. We propose a new solver to estimate the 3DOF relative pose and focal length. First, we establish constraint equations from two affine correspondences when the vertical direction is known. Then, based on the properties of the equation system with nontrivial solutions, four equations can be derived. These four equations only involve two parameters: the focal length and the relative rotation angle. Finally, the polynomial eigenvalue method is utilized to solve the problem of focal length and relative rotation angle. The proposed solver is evaluated using synthetic and real-world datasets. The results show that our solver performs better than the existing state-of-the-art solvers."

The proposed approach personalizes motion assistance by iteratively updating bell-shaped velocity profiles based on the subject's performance. Key parameters, including the maximum value axis (adjusted via a time shift function), total displacement, and time duration, are tuned using a discrete proportional derivative iterative learning controller (PD-ILC). The updated parameters generate optimized trajectories for subsequent training iterations. Two experiments validate the method: the first identifies the optimal time shift function, while the second evaluates the approach with subjects performing a predefined reaching motion using the TAMU CLEVERArm exoskeleton. The results show that iterative trajectory updating reduces both the number of iterations required to reach steady-state performance and the final tracking error, highlighting its potential to improve rehabilitation efficiency."

    "abstract": "Children with developmental coordination disorder(DCD) often experience difficulties with motor imagery (MI), the mental rehearsal of movement. This limitation presents an opportunity in which MI-based brain-computer interface (BCI) systems, which detect neural correlates of imagined movement, may serve as diagnostic tools for identifying motor planning deficits in children with DCD. However, the absence of behavioral confirmation during MI tasks often results in noisy EEG labels that complicate the development of accurate models. To address this challenge, we propose DualRefine, a novel semi-supervised dual-network framework designed to enhance model robustness in the presence of label noise. Built upon an EEGNet backbone, DualRefine consists of two peer networks with distinct classification heads that collaboratively perform data categorization, pseudo-labeling, and iterative model refinement through mutual supervision. Compared to existing learning-with-noisy-label (LNL) approaches, DualRefine introduces three major innovations: (1) a co-learning strategy that cross-validates peer models, (2) confidence-based filtering to isolate reliable data, and (3) a relabeling mechanism to recover mislabeled samples. Evaluated on EEG datasets from MI tasks, DualRefine achieved 71.6 ± 1.3% accuracy, significantly outperforming other LNL methods (approximately 50%). For DCD classification, it reached 76.0 ± 4.9%, markedly improving upon the 63% accuracy of baseline models. These results demonstrate the general applicability of DualRefine beyond a single dataset or condition, offering a scalable solution for EEG-based classification tasks where ground truth is limited or unreliable. This work is the first to explicitly integrate noisy-label countermeasures into EEG-based MI-BCI pipelines, paving the way for more robust BCI applications in both clinical and broader neurotechnology domains where unreliable EEG labels remain a key challenge."

For highway surveillance cameras, existing methods often rely on cumbersome procedures to extract limited priors (e.g., vanishing points or reference points) and provide incomplete estimations (e.g., roll angle). Therefore, we leverage the multilayered lane lines on highways, which offer rich priors such as segment lengths, intervals, and lane widths, to develop a novel camera calibration and vehicle speed estimation method. For camera calibration, our approach performs road instance segmentation and extracts <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">multilayered lane-line keypoints (MLK)</i> while mitigating environmental interference and dynamic vehicle occlusions.

For vehicle speed estimation, multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithms are integrated with the calibration model to infer the average speeds of all identified vehicles. We collected real highway video footage from four different camera setups in Chinese highways. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods across all setups. The impact of key parameters is evaluated to determine the optimal configuration. Lastly, its effectiveness in vehicle speed estimation is assessed based on advanced MOT algorithms."

This innovative approach is emerging as an exciting and potentially transformative technology for wireless communication systems. FAS encompasses any software-controlled fluidic, conductive, or dielectric structure capable of dynamically altering an antenna’s shape and position to modify critical parameters such as gain, radiation pattern, operating frequency, and other key characteristics. Given its unique capabilities, FAS is highly anticipated to play a significant role in shaping the upcoming sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. This article presents the first comprehensive classification framework for FAS technologies, systematically analyzing cutting-edge developments and demonstrating significant performance improvements over traditional fixed-position antennas through detailed case studies. Specifically, this article explores these contributions by addressing four major questions: 1) Is FAS crucial to 6G? 2) How can FAS be characterized? 3) What are the applications of FAS? 4) What challenges and future research directions are associated with FAS? In particular, five promising research directions that highlight FAS’s potential are examined. Finally, we conclude by demonstrating the impressive performance of FAS, reinforcing its relevance and promise in future networks."

    "abstract": "Shapley Values (SVs) are concepts established for explaining black-box machine learning models by quantifying feature contributions to model predictions. Since their computation has exponential complexity in the number of features, a variety of approximated approaches to SVs estimation have been proposed. The state-of-the-art neural SVs estimator, i.e., FastSHAP, advances sampling-based methods by first training a supervised surrogate model to learn the conditional expectation of the original model given every feature subset and then generating SVs estimates through a separate network using weighted least squares. While ensuring fast SVs inference, this approach requires a significant training time, thus becoming unsuitable for scenarios where the black-box model has to be frequently retrained. To address this limitation, we propose LIGHTNINGSHAP, a cost-effective neural network-based estimator that jointly computes conditional expectations and SVs estimations to reduce training cost. The unified network learning process minimizes feature-level estimation errors while preserving SVs efficiency. Experiments run on both dynamic and static tabular datasets show that LIGHTNINGSHAP achieves a 25%-60% speedup in overall computational time (i.e., the sum of training and inference times) on medium-large datasets compared to existing neural SVs estimators as well as lower or comparable estimation errors. Furthermore, the results obtained on image datasets indicate that LIGHTNINGSHAP yields a 30%-55% speedup while preserving explanation quality."

    "abstract": "Risk sensitivity has become a central theme in reinforcement learning (RL), where convex risk measures and robust formulations provide principled ways to model preferences beyond expected return. Recent extensions to multi-agent RL (MARL) have largely emphasized the risk-averse setting, prioritizing robustness to uncertainty. In cooperative MARL, however, such conservatism often leads to suboptimal equilibria, and a parallel line of work has shown that optimism can promote cooperation. Existing optimistic methods, though effective in practice, are typically heuristic and lack theoretical grounding. Building on the dual representation for convex risk measures, we propose a principled framework that interprets risk-seeking objectives as optimism. We introduce optimistic value functions, which formalize optimism as divergence-penalized risk-seeking evaluations. Building on this foundation, we derive a policy-gradient theorem for optimistic value functions, including explicit formulas for the entropic risk/KL-penalty setting, and develop decentralized optimistic actor-critic algorithms that implement these updates. Empirical results on cooperative benchmarks demonstrate that risk-seeking optimism consistently improves coordination over both risk-neutral baselines and heuristic optimistic methods. Our framework thus unifies risk-sensitive learning and optimism, offering a theoretically grounded and practically effective approach to cooperation in MARL."

The proposed controller utilizes a control barrier function (CBF) to enforce joint position and velocity constraints while simultaneously guaranteeing accurate trajectory tracking of the robot. In particular, we first map the constraints from the state space into the filtered-tracking error space. We demonstrate that maintaining forward invariance of the constrained error set guarantees constraint satisfaction in the state space. Additionally, we analytically establish that this transformation creates a boundary-to-boundary relationship between the two sets. The resulting NN-driven control torque ensures accurate trajectory tracking of the closed-loop robot manipulator while adhering to the prescribed state constraints even in the presence of uncertain dynamics. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme both analytically and numerically."

    "abstract": "The vast accessibility of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images through online portals has propelled the research across various fields. This widespread use and easy availability have unfortunately made SAR data susceptible to malicious alterations, such as local editing applied to the images for inserting or covering the presence of sensitive targets. To contrast malicious manipulations, in the last years the forensic community has begun to dig into the SAR manipulation issue, proposing detectors that effectively localize the tampering traces in amplitude images. Nonetheless, in this paper we demonstrate that an expert practitioner can exploit the complex nature of SAR data to obscure any signs of manipulation within a locally altered amplitude image. We refer to this approach as a counter-forensic attack. To achieve the concealment of manipulation traces, the attacker can simulate a re-acquisition of the manipulated scene by the SAR system that initially generated the pristine image. In doing so, the attacker can obscure any evidence of manipulation, making it appear as if the image was legitimately produced by the system. This attack has unique features that make it both highly generalizable and relatively easy to apply. First, it is a black-box attack, meaning it is not designed to deceive a specific forensic detector. Furthermore, it does not require a training phase and is not based on adversarial operations. We assess the effectiveness of the proposed counter-forensic approach across diverse scenarios, examining various manipulation operations. The obtained results indicate that our devised attack successfully eliminates traces of manipulation, deceiving even the most advanced forensic detectors."

The Controller Area Network (CAN) bus, along with its variants CAN-FD, CAN-XL, and complementary protocols such as LIN and FlexRay, remains the backbone of IVNs. However, these protocols (the CAN specifically) were not originally designed to meet the stringent security demands of emerging autonomous and electric vehicles. This survey critically examines existing IVN security literature with a particular focus on intrusion detection systems (IDS) developed for CAN-based architectures. Unlike prior reviews that emphasize algorithmic design or attack taxonomy, this survey provides a comparison of IDS approaches (typically CAN-based due to its dominance in industry and research domain) based on physical-layer features, statistical parameters, information theory, and learning-based methods. We highlight unresolved security limitations of the CAN bus, synthesize mitigation strategies across industrial domains (automotive, aerospace, marine, agricultural, and battery systems), and identify overlooked challenges. Finally, we outline key research frontiers, such as hardware-assisted protection, edge intelligence, blockchainbased authentication, generative AI-driven anomaly detection, and quantum-safe cryptography—toward building resilient next-generation IVNs."

This study addresses this limitation by presenting the first Arctic application of shipborne Global Navigation Satellite System Reflectometry (GNSS-R) for real-time detection of sea-ice transition zones. The method passively receives L1-band GNSS signals reflected from the sea surface, using power fluctuations—linked to changes in surface dielectric properties—as indicators of ice–water transitions. Two field experiments aboard the Chinese icebreaker <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Xuelong 2</i> demonstrate that GNSS-R can stably and repeatedly capture transition zone signatures with minute-level temporal resolution. Within each ~1 km experimental track, the retrieved sea ice concentration time series quantitatively reflects fluctuations corresponding to an effective spatial resolution of approximately 31 m, thereby enabling the detection of distinct signal characteristics between continuous ice edges and fragmented ice. Synchronized onboard video provides independent validation, showing overall detection accuracies exceeding 80%. This work establishes GNSS-R as a low-cost, passive, and high-resolution technique for operational monitoring of sea-ice transition zones, supporting safer navigation and improved understanding of polar processes."

We tackle the challenges caused by convolutional layers in the construction. We show that a differentiation of data samples is always possible somewhere in the feature maps, and despite network parameters being tied in each feature map, our perturbation scheme only affects the output of a single or a few neurons for a group of data samples. We then give an example of nontrivial spurious local minimum in which multiple activation patterns are explicitly constructed. Finally, based on our construction of spurious local minima, we design a deterministic optimization method to escape local minima that is applicable to CNNs, ResNets, MLPs, and transformers. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1k datasets verify our theoretical findings and show that our optimization method outperforms SGD or Adam in accuracy (by 0.27% on average) consistently on all these architectures and datasets."

Unlike conventional extended state observers with fixed bandwidth factors, which lack adaptability under varying conditions and introduce coordination difficulties between speed and current loops, the proposed method presents an observation-error-driven bandwidth adjustment mechanism. This method enables real-time and independent adjustment of the bandwidth factors for the lumped disturbance observers of speed and current, thereby dynamically balancing disturbance rejection and estimation accuracy under various operating conditions and enhancing the algorithm’s adaptability. To ensure theoretical stability, an integral-type Lyapunov function is constructed to guarantee the asymptotic convergence of the proposed adaptive bandwidth observer. Moreover, practical guidelines for parameter design principles are formulated to facilitate the implementation of the proposed method. Experimental results on a 750W SPMSM platform demonstrate that the proposed strategy significantly improves transient performance and adaptability compared to fixed-bandwidth observer-based approaches."

    "abstract": "Sleep plays a crucial role in cognitive, emotional, and physical health. Due to limitations in existing monitoring methods, less than 30% of people affected by sleep disorders receive proper care. However, sleep detection and monitoring require an efficient approach to improve sleep patterns. Wearable accelerometers are a widely used, cost-effective, and noninvasive method to track sleep through body movements. Detecting precise sleep-wake transitions remains challenging due to the lack of a proper existing pipeline. This article proposes a fog-cloud-assisted framework to detect and monitor sleep patterns. In the proposed approach, raw data from the wearable accelerometer collected in the data accumulation layer is preprocessed in the fog layer to extract meaningful features. Missing values are handled using KNN imputation and feature engineering is performed using temporal derivatives and power transformations. A random forest model is implemented in the cloud layer for sleep–wake classification, with its hyperparameters optimized through RandomizedSearchCV using 5-fold stratified cross-validation. The findings reveal that the model attained the best performance with an F1 score of 0.8846 and an accuracy of 0.8852. The performance analysis demonstrates the reliability and effectiveness of the proposed approach for real-world sleep tracking."

    "abstract": "A space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) for Internet of Things (IoT) network architecture is investigated, empowered by multi-functional reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (MF-RIS) capable of simultaneously reflecting, amplifying, and harvesting wireless energy. The MF-RIS plays a pivotal role in addressing the energy shortages of low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites operating in the shadowed regions, while accounting for both communication and computing energy consumption across the SAGIN nodes. To maximize the long-term energy efficiency (EE) of IoT devices, we formulate a joint optimization problem over the MF-RIS parameters, including signal amplification, phase-shifts, energy harvesting ratio, and active element selection as well as the SAGIN parameters of beamforming vectors, high-altitude platform station (HAPS) deployment, IoT device association, and computing capability. The formulated problem is highly non-convex and non-linear, which contains mixed discrete-continuous parameters. To tackle this, we conceive a compressed hybrid twin-model enhanced multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (CHIMERA) framework, which integrates semantic state-action compression and parametrized sharing under hybrid reinforcement learning to efficiently explore suitable complex actions. The simulation results have demonstrated that the proposed CHIMERA scheme substantially outperforms the conventional benchmarks, including fixed-configuration or non-harvesting MF-RIS, traditional RIS, and no-RIS cases, as well as centralized and multi-agent deep reinforcement learning baselines in terms of the highest EE. Moreover, the proposed SAGIN-MF-RIS architecture in IoT network achieves superior EE performance due to its complementary coverage, offering notable advantages over either standalone satellite, aerial, or ground-only deployments."

    "abstract": "Functional test sequences are important for the detection of defects that may escape scan-based tests but cause failures during functional operation. Sequential test generation can produce compact functional test sequences with a high fault coverage, but its computational complexity can be prohibitive unless carefully controlled. Preferred primary input cubes indicate which primary input values should be avoided, and which ones are preferred in a test sequence to achieve a high gate-level fault coverage. The use of preferred primary input cubes allows a random sequence to be modified into an effective test sequence without any simulation. In a design that consists of interconnected sequential logic blocks, each logic block has its own preferred primary input cube. This article suggests for the first time the use of the preferred primary input cubes of all the logic blocks in an interconnection for sequential test generation. The cubes are referred to as preferred interconnect cubes. The result is a low complexity sequential test generation procedure with improved fault coverage relative to a procedure that does not recognize the preferred interconnect cubes. The article also suggests a design-for-testability (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">DFT</i>) approach that changes the connections between logic blocks to increase the fault coverage.

However, current technologies rely on optical and magnetic tracking methods, which are costly and easily affected by environmental interference. In this research, we present a novel inertial-based navigation framework that enables real-time, millimeter-level incision depth estimation. Based on a single micro-electromechanical inertial measurement unit (MIMU) sensor and a constrained motion model, this framework can accurately track the incision depth of surgical scalpels. An optimized unit-quaternion-based square-root unscented Kalman filter (OUKF) method is proposed to enhance tracking robustness and precision. A low-cost navigation platform is developed and validated through simulation, phantom, and pre-clinical experiments. Results demonstrate that the system can provide accurate, real-time depth feedback and precise surgical guidance. With the integration of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the system successfully guided the surgeon to accurately expose the spinal cord of a rat. This research offers a promising technology for improving surgical precision, safety, and training across a wide range of clinical applications."

The proposed design consists of printed dipoles, parasitic monopole patches, feedline, multi-functional ground, and protective radome. Firstly, a dipole coupled with parasitic patch is analysed through characteristic mode analysis (CMA) and coupled mode theory (CMT), the mode coupling is analyzed and extracted through equivalent circuit model. Through detailed analysis and design, a wider operating band is realized with two resonances. Then, through the introduction of the multi-functional ground patch, another mode is generated at lower frequencies and the bandwidth is further expanded. Besides, the cross coupling between the printed dipole and ground generates radiation nulls at both lower and higher out-of-band frequencies. Through proper coupling design, both ultra-wide bandwidth and high out-of-band suppression are realized. Finally, antenna element and array are fabricated and verified. The simulated and measured results indicate the proposed antenna has a wide operating bandwidth of 103% from 1.7 GHz to 5.3 GHz, which covers most 4G (1.71-2.69 GHz) and 5G (3.3-4.2 GHz & 4.4-5 GHz) bands. Within the operating band, omnidirectional horizontal radiation pattern is maintained. Out of the operating band, radiation nulls are observed at both lower and higher ends, achieving high suppression with radiation efficiency lower than 17%. Considering the radome, the antenna maintains a compact size of 0.2 yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyL * 0.2 yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyL * 0.4 yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyL. The proposed design features wideband operation, filtering capacity, and omnidirectional radiation pattern, making it suitable for both vehicular and basestation applications."

    "abstract": "Optimal dead-time selection in switching converters is a critical design consideration for minimizing reverse conduction losses and enhancing output current quality. The minimum achievable dead time strongly depends on the device technology. In recent years, low-voltage AC motor drive applications, such as those in light e-mobility and humanoid robotics, have grown rapidly. While traditional Silicon (Si) MOSFETs remain widely used, they are increasingly being complemented or replaced by Gallium Nitride (GaN) devices, which continue to improve in performance and cost competitiveness. This paper deals with the comparison of the dead time requirements for GaN devices and Si MOSFETs used in inverter switching leg applications. The study focuses on low-voltage enhancement-mode GaN FETs and Si MOSFETs with similar current ratings, emphasizing the different reverse conduction mechanisms exhibited during dead time. The influence of dead time at different load currents, which are typical in inverter operation, is investigated through both simulations and experimental measurements. Additionally, device temperature measurements are used to assess the impact of dead time on the losses, further highlighting the differences between Si MOSFETs and GaN FETs from a thermal point of view. Based on the results, a methodology is proposed to select the optimal dead time duration to prevent cross-conduction, minimize power losses, and improve output current waveform quality."

    "abstract": "The integration of information and communication technologies into power systems has introduced new cyber vulnerabilities, particularly stealthy false data injection attacks (SFDIAs) targeting state estimation. These attacks can evade bad data detection mechanisms, leading to inefficient dispatch, line overloads, or cascading outages. Although most existing defense strategies focus on securing individual PMUs, they often overlook vulnerabilities at phasor data concentrators (PDCs), which aggregate measurements from multiple correlated PMUs. This risk is especially pronounced in conventional geography-based PMU-to-PDC assignments, in which neighboring and highly correlated PMUs are grouped under the same PDC. On this basis, this paper first demonstrates, using Bayesian attack graphs, that compromising PDCs poses a greater risk than targeting individual PMUs. Then, to mitigate this vulnerability, a tri-level defender-attacker-operator optimization model is proposed to identify optimal PMU-to-PDC mappings that minimize attack impact. Simulation results highlight the importance of data aggregation architecture in system vulnerability and demonstrate that optimized allocations significantly improve resilience against high-impact SFDIAs."

In this paper, we propose a quasi-Newton-based joint multipath optimization approach called Quasi-Newton Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (QNOMP) to address these problems. The algorithm comprises two stages for super-resolution recovery: first, we perform a computationally efficient on-grid OMP estimation of channel parameters in the sparsity domain (e.g., delay or angle); then, an off-grid optimization is carried out to achieve super-resolution. In the off-grid stage, we employ the quasi-Newton method to jointly estimate all multipath parameters, rather than optimizing them one at a time as in the Newtonized OMP approach. This joint estimation improves both computational efficiency and accuracy. Moreover, we derive an optimal extrapolation solution based on the linear minimum mean squared error criterion, establish its connection to the Slepian basis, and present a practical algorithm for extrapolation using the QNOMP results. We also propose a specialized approach that exploits the inherent block sparsity of the considered channels. Numerical experiments on simulated models and clustered delay line channels demonstrate the superior performance and low computational complexity of QNOMP."

    "abstract": "Organizations around the world are increasingly using multiple clouds for critical workloads, which makes the accurate prediction of cloud workload a collaborative task across multiple cloud providers. Our experimental studies on four large-scale cloud workload datasets demonstrate that the workloads are highly heterogeneous, and different cloud providers have highly heterogeneous model preferences, which makes the above task challenging. Accordingly, we propose a joint privacy-preserving cloud workload prediction framework based on Federated Learning (FL), which enables the collaborative training of a workload prediction model across cloud providers with heterogeneous workloads and model preferences without exposing private workload data. To handle workload heterogeneity without privacy leakage, we first design a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based virtual workload dataset generation method that incorporates workloads’ temporal and resource-usage-plan-related features via temporal-aware feature calibration. Then, to handle model heterogeneity, we design a FL approach based on a hybrid local model composed of a homogeneous public model and a heterogeneous personal model. Finally, we design a Knowledge Distillation (KD) based approach to post-train the personal model with both private workload knowledge and shared workload knowledge learned from the trained global public model. Extensive experiments on various real-world workloads and actual implementations demonstrate that compared with the state-of-the-art, our framework improves workload prediction accuracy by 57.7% in average over all cloud providers."

    "abstract": "Coordinated control of Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS) setpoints can significantly enhance power flow and voltage control. However, optimizing the setpoints of multiple FACTS devices in real-world systems remains uncommon, partly due to challenges in model-based control. Data-driven approaches, such as reinforcement learning (RL), offer a promising alternative for coordinated control. In this work, we address a setting where a useful real-time network model is unavailable. Recognizing the increasing deployment of Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) for advanced monitoring and control, we consider having access to a few but reliable measurements and a constraint violation signal. Under these assumptions, we demonstrate on several scenarios on the IEEE 14-bus and IEEE 57-bus systems that an RL-based optimization of FACTS setpoints can substantially reduce voltage deviations compared to a fixed-setpoint baseline. To improve robustness and prevent unobserved constraint violations, we show that a complete, albeit simple, constraint violation signal is necessary. As an alternative to relying on such a signal, Dynamic Mode Decomposition is proposed to determine new PMU placements, thereby reducing the risk of unobserved constraint violations. Finally, to assess the gap to an optimal policy, we benchmark the RL-based agent against a model-based optimal controller with perfect information."

Managing such large-scale, dynamic operations requires controlling robots under real-time constraints—posing practical challenges in path planning due to shifting locations, limited perception, and the need for coordinated execution between mobile chassis and manipulator. To tackle these demands, we present a Parallel Sampling Attention Model (PSAM), a deep learning architecture designed for high-throughput, real-time decision-making in industrial disassembly scenarios. PSAM introduces a parallel decoding mechanism that generates diverse candidate paths in a single forward pass, enabling efficient path planning. The solutions are segmented and optimized using a genetic-inspired refinement process, while a redundant decoding strategy enhances solution robustness by balancing quality and planning speed. We deploy PSAM on a real-world robotic disassembly platform, achieving a 37% improvement in operational efficiency and maintaining a 94% task success rate. This work contributes to scalable, intelligent automation for next-generation data center operations, with broad potential for real-time robotic path planning and scheduling in industrial environments."

    "abstract": "This paper develops an innovative event-triggered adaptive control scheme with guaranteed prescribed performance for nonlinear systems under simultaneous multiple faults, including actuator and external faults. The primary objective is to guarantee system stability and tracking performance despite the coexistence of these faults. In the backstepping design, multi-dimensional Taylor networks (MTNs) are employed to approximate the external fault function and other unknown nonlinear functions. To guarantee transient and steady-state performance, an asymmetric state transformation function is introduced, effectively constraining the tracking error within prescribed bounds. Moreover, to optimize network resource utilization, an event-triggered mechanism is incorporated, significantly reducing communication burden while maintaining system stability. Theoretical analysis proves that all signals in the system remain bounded, and the output tracks the reference signal under the proposed scheme. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed control scheme is rigorously validated through simulation examples."

    "abstract": "Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image change detection is a fundamental task in remote sensing image analysis. However, the poor discriminability of image change features and the low detectability in complex change regions, such as farmland, and riverbanks, are challenging for unsupervised learning methods. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel unsupervised learning network architecture based on Legendre Multi-wavelet theory and Depthwise Convolution with Channel Gating (LWDCG). In LWDCG, we first design an Legendre Wavelet Channel Attention module leveraging LW transform to decompose SAR image into multi-wavelet multi-scale representations and combining with a channel attention mechanism to enhance discriminative feature learning. Then, we employ a hierarchical strategy integrating with Possibilistic C-Means clustering to enhance clustering performance. Furthermore, we introduce a DCG module integrating depthwise separable convolution with a gating mechanism. This design enables both efficient feature extraction and dynamic filtering of change-sensitive features, significantly improving detection performance in complex regions. Finally, Extensive experiments on three public SAR datasets (Sulzberger, Ottawa, and Yellow River) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving percentage of correct classification (PCC) of 98.88%, 98.46%, and 95.73%, respectively. The results validate the rationality and superiority of the proposed network architecture in SAR change detection tasks."

The MTM comprises a 5 x 5 unit cell array of X-shaped MTM that works at 3.30 to 4.25 GHz to ensure the CPW antenna has better bandwidth and gain. The MTM-integrated antenna operates over a wide frequency range of 2.4 to 6.9 GHz, achieving a peak gain of 6.7 dBi and compact dimensions of 53 mm × 60 mm. Experiments were conducted using a rotating platform at 36-degree intervals to capture scattered data from a realized phantom representing a breast tumor model. The Delay-and-Sum (DAS) approach was employed to reconstruct a two-dimensional (2D) image from reflected and scattered signals obtained from ten different points around the phantom, both in the presence and absence of a 15 mm tumor. This wearable Microwave Imaging (MWI) device utilizes a single antenna and a monostatic radar-based approach. Correspondingly, results indicate that integrating MTMs markedly enhances imaging precision by reducing the displacement of tumor images. The proposed design demonstrates promising results and is adaptable for tumor sensing. Additionally, the design exhibits potential for wearable applications such as MWI and on-body communications."

    "abstract": "In the rapidly evolving field of autonomous driving, vehicles are increasingly equipped with multiple sensors such as LiDAR, millimeter-wave radar, and cameras to exploit their complementary advantages. However, efficiently fusing data from these diverse sensors for accurate 3D object detection in complex traffic environments continues to present a substantial challenge. To address this, Triplet-Sensor Fusion Network (TriFusionNet) is proposed as a multimodal fusion framework designed to integrate LiDAR, radar, and camera data for 3D object detection. TriFusionNet employs a two-stage regression architecture. In the first stage, radar features are associated with preliminary camera detections to construct a multi-channel input, facilitating the estimation of 3D bounding boxes. In the second stage, a Deep Layer Aggregation (DLA) network refines these 3D bounding boxes to enhance the precision of center point detection. Additionally, a frustum-based radar association method establishes associations between extended LiDAR point clouds and targets in 3D space, improving localization accuracy. An enhanced convolutional block attention mechanism is introduced to further strengthen the fusion of radar and camera data, resulting in improved precision in 3D object detection. Key innovations of TriFusionNet include its sequential two-stage regression framework, a frustum-based radar association method, and an improved attention mechanism to enhance multimodal data integration. The model was evaluated on the NuScenes dataset, demonstrating substantial performance enhancements over existing single-modal and dual-modal methods, with a 0.124 and 0.055 increase in NuScenes Detection Score (NDS) and a 0.175 and 0.147 increase in mean Average Precision (mAP), respectively. These results indicate that TriFusionNet surpasses existing detection models, confirming its effectiveness in multimodal 3D object detection."

Although numerous robust aggregators have been developed to merge the collected gradient information in the server, they either require data homogeneity and are suboptimal for heterogeneous data, or their breakdown points—the smallest proportion of outliers that can make the aggregators fail—are not theoretically analyzed or less than 0.5. In contrast to existing aggregators, this paper formulates the aggregation process as a low-rank plus sparse decomposition model, where the low-rank component, with a rank of one, facilitates accurate gradient computation, while the sparse component, penalized by the ℓ<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2,0</sub>-norm, mitigates the impact of outliers. We prove that the devised rule achieves the maximum breakdown point of 0.5. Besides, we apply our aggregation rule to Byzantine-robust federated learning and employ the Polyak’s momentum to reduce gradient variance among honest workers. It is analyzed that our aggregator achieves order-optimal Byzantine-resilient federated learning for heterogeneous data. Experimental results using MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that the developed approach yields higher classification accuracy than the competing aggregators under different attack types and heterogeneity levels."

Improving the performance of memory-intensive data retrieval processes using approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) algorithms has become increasingly crucial for delivering high-quality generative AI services. <p xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">In this work, we propose Q-VESA, a software-hardware collaborative solution designed to accelerate low-precision graph-based vector search while preserving recall rates comparable to high-precision. We perform a comprehensive analysis of hierarchical navigable small-world (HNSW), one of the most promising graph-based ANNS methods, using recent datasets tailored for RAG systems. Unlike standard vector database datasets, vector data used in LLMs present unique challenges for low-precision search. To address these, we introduce software-oriented precision partitioning techniques that enable mixed-precision computations during graph traversal without compromising hardware performance. The Q-VESA architecture is developed with two key innovations: a database restructuring scheme with vector data segments, and a dedicated accelerator design to maximize throughput in distance computations. Experimental results demonstrate that Q-VESA on a CPU system achieves query-per-second (QPS) speedups of up to 1.81× in the SIMD execution mode.

    "abstract": "Blind quantum computation (BQC) enables clients with limited quantum capabilities to protect the privacy of inputs, outputs and algorithms during the computation process. However, if a client’s private information is exposed to a server after the computation, the server can deduce the client’s output or even input. Quantum encryption with certified deletion (QECD) offers a potential solution by enabling the data owner to generate a deletion certificate, making the original plaintext inaccessible, provided the certificate is valid. Nevertheless, current QECD can only handle classical data and cannot be applied to BQC with quantum inputs. This paper first introduces the concept of certified deletion for quantum states and then proposes a single-client BQC protocol with certified deletion, where the client can use the classical certificate generated by the server to confirm whether her quantum inputs have been deleted after computation.We also give a specific example and simulate it using Qiskit to show its feasibility. In addition, the proposed protocol can also be extended to a multi-client environment in which honest clients request certified deletion if any client disconnects or behaves maliciously, thereby terminating the protocol and protecting their privacy."

These articles often employ persuasive strategies, which are rhetorical techniques in narrative framing, visual rhetoric, or data presentation, to influence audience interpretation and opinion formation regarding information communication. While previous research has examined whether and when data visualizations persuade, the strategic choices made by persuaders remain largely unexplored. Addressing this gap, our work presents a taxonomy of persuasive strategies grounded in psychological theories and expert insights, categorizing 15 strategies across five dimensions: Credibility, Guided Interpretation, Reference-based Framing, Emotional Appeal, and Participation Invitation. To facilitate large-scale analysis, we curated a dataset of 936 data-driven news articles annotated with both persuasive strategies and their perceived effects. Leveraging this corpus, we developed a multimodal, multi-task learning model that jointly predicts the presence of persuasive strategies and their persuasive effects by incorporating both embedded (text and visualization) and explicit (visual narrative and psycholinguistic) features. Our evaluation demonstrates that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in identifying persuasive strategies and measuring their effects."

    "abstract": "The increasing integration of inverter-based resources (IBRs), such as Distributed Generation Units (DGUs), in shore-power cyber-physical DC shipboard microgrids (SMGs) enhances maritime energy autonomy and operational flexibility but also introduces critical vulnerabilities to cyberattacks. In particular, bounded and unbounded false data injection attacks (FDIAs) and man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attacks targeting measurement units and communication links within shore-ship inverters and DGU converters can destabilize voltage regulation, disrupt power-sharing coordination, and compromise system integrity. To address these challenges, a novel distributed, resilient control strategy is proposed in this paper for the operation of DC SMGs in dynamic maritime environments. The approach integrates decentralized voltage regulation with adaptive load-sharing mechanisms and embedded compensation terms to autonomously detect and mitigate malicious input perturbations in IBRs. The controller dynamically suppresses corrupted feedback signals and ensures resilient coordination among DGUs without relying on centralized supervision or prior knowledge of attack models. The proposed method guarantees uniformly ultimately bounded convergence for global voltage regulation and proportional load sharing objectives, even under unbounded attack settings. A Lyapunov-based stability analysis is also performed to formally establish these guarantees, ensuring robust performance against a wide range of adversarial scenarios. Test results of a practical shore-power DC SMG are presented to validate and demonstrate the performance of proposed method in terms of voltage stability, power-sharing accuracy, and cyber-resilience compared with those obtained from standard control schemes against multiple and combined attacks. The results have indicated that the proposed method can be a practical and adaptive solution for secure, stable, and resilient operation of IBRS-based shore-power DC SMGs under advanced threats."

Due to the inherent characteristics of thyristors, it is difficult for existing methods to significantly reduce the risk of commutation failure. A Hybrid Commutated Converter (HCC) based on Integrated Gate Commutated Thyristor (IGCT) has been proposed to solve the problem of commutation failure. HCC uses Metal-Oxide Varistor (MOV) in parallel with the IGCT module to clamp the voltage and ensure the IGCT is safely turned off. In order to ensure the reliable operation of MOV in HCC, a Self-Protecting MOV (SP-MOV) scheme based on fuse in series is proposed, effectively preventing prolonged current flow through the MOV. The parameter design of the fuse is carried out, and by conducting experiments on the action characteristics of the fuses and the failure characteristics of the MOV, the reliability of the coordination of fuse-MOV parameters is analyzed. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed SP-MOV for isolating failed MOVs is verified by an IGCT module-level test."

Inspired by the cross-band correlations of natural multispectral images, we introduce the multi-channel matching and low-rank strategies that jointly optimize image patches of all channels, exhibiting higher efficiency and accuracy than existing approaches. Furthermore, we present global structural matching (GSM) which performs structure-aware multi-channel matching across the entire multispectral image. GSM extracts structurally important patches and efficiently searches their similar patches via parallel correlation, providing an order-of-magnitude improvement in efficiency. By combining the aforementioned techniques, we have achieved superior performance over the state-of-the-art NLR demosaicing technique, leading to up to 3.9 dB peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) gain and over a 150-fold increase in computational speed. Experiments validated that the technique outperforms existing methods in reconstructing fine textures and details and exhibits superior robustness to noise."

This paper introduces AIMC-Spec, a comprehensive synthetic dataset for spectrogram-based image classification, encompassing 33 modulation types across 13 signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels. To benchmark AIMC-Spec, five representative deep learning algorithms—ranging from lightweight CNNs and denoising architectures to transformer-based networks—were re-implemented and evaluated under a unified input format. The results reveal significant performance variation, with frequency-modulated (FM) signals classified more reliably than phase or hybrid types, particularly at low SNRs. A focused FM-only test further highlights how modulation type and network architecture influence classifier robustness. AIMC-Spec establishes a reproducible baseline and provides a foundation for future research and standardization in the AIMC domain."

Super-resolution reconstruction of FY-4A remote sensing imagery not only enhances the spatial accuracy of low-resolution bands and achieves cross-band scale consistency, but also improves feature recognition and monitoring capabilities. This provides clearer and more reliable data support for quantitative remote sensing and applications in meteorology, ecology, agriculture, and other fields. Therefore, a Differential Enhancement Super-Resolution Network (DESR) is proposed based on scale invariance. The dual paths consist of a CNN branch and a Swin Transformer branch. The CNN branch employs Rep-Residual Blocks (RRB) to capture spatial structures, where each RRB integrates a Spatial Feature Attention (SFA) that employs large convolutional kernels with directional strides along the height and width to model long-range dependencies and spatial correlations. The Swin Transformer branch adopts Residual Swin Transformer Blocks (RSTB) to obtain a global receptive field. In addition, A Differential Feature Enhancement Module (DFEM) is further introduced to fuse features, highlight branch-specific deficiencies through subtraction, and achieve complementary enhancement. Experimental results show that DESR achieves more uniform error distribution and superior reconstruction quality compared with representative methods. On 2× and 4× super-resolution tasks, DESR reaches PSNR values of 54.1395 and 46.0942, SSIM values of 0.9899 and 0.9749, with improvements at least 1.87% and 0.59%, respectively, while also attaining the best spectral angle mapping."

Since the bases are orthogonal after decomposition, we also introduce a strategy to dynamically increase the number of basis functions during optimization, ensuring that each newly added basis does not interfere with the existing ones. By progressively adding bases, the topology evolves from a coarse representation to a more refined structure, which helps reduce optimization time and avoid getting trapped in poor local solutions."

To significantly reduce the difficulty of modeling converters while providing similar results to electromagnetic transient analysis, this paper proposes a novel dynamic interactive framework that can reflect the dynamic characteristics between converters and the power system. Firstly, the mathematical model constructed using the state-space modeling method can reflect the basic dynamic characteristics while simplifying the modeling of converters and AC networks. Then, the dynamic interaction between the AC network and typical converters is analyzed, and the computing process of the dynamic calculation based on the proposed framework is clarified. The effectiveness of the proposed dynamic framework is verified using a real distribution network, and the simulation results demonstrate consistency between the dynamic calculation based on the proposed framework and the electromagnetic transient calculation in MATLAB/Simulink under steady-state power fluctuations and short-circuit fault conditions."

    "abstract": "Mobile crowdsourcing platforms leverage a mass of mobile users and their vehicles to learn massive point-of-interest (PoI) information while traveling and share it as a public good. Given that the crowdsourced users mind their travel costs and have diverse usage preferences for PoI information along different paths, we formulate the problem as a novel non-atomic multi-path routing game. This game features positive network externalities from social information sharing, distinguishing it from the traditional routing game literature that primarily focuses on congestion control of negative externalities among users. Our price of anarchy (PoA) analysis shows that in the absence of any incentive design, users’ selfish routing on the lowest-cost path will significantly limit PoI diversity leading to an arbitrarily large efficiency loss from the social optimum with a PoA of 0. This motivates us to design effective incentive mechanisms to remedy while upholding desirable properties including individual rationality (IR), incentive compatibility (IC), and budget balance (BB) to ensure practical feasibility. Without knowing a specific user’s path preference, we first present a non-monetary mechanism called Adaptive Information Restriction (AIR) that satisfies all the desirable properties. Our AIR indirectly penalizes non-cooperative users by adaptively reducing their access to the public good, according to actual user flows along different paths. It achieves a significant PoA of 1/4 with low complexity <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">O</i>(<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</i> log <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</i> + log <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</i>), where <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</i> and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</i> represent the numbers of paths and user preference types, respectively. When the system can support pricing/billing for users, we further propose a new monetary mechanism called Adaptive Side-Payment (ASP), which adaptively charges and rewards users based on their chosen paths. Our ASP achieves a better PoA of 1/2 with an even lower complexity of <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">O</i>(<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</i> log <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</i>).

    "abstract": "Optical axis position systems are widely used in fields such as optoelectronic tracking, chip manufacturing, and hard disk drive control. These fields play key roles in improving the performance and functionality of consumer electronics. This paper proposes a new control method enabled by a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) to reject dynamic disturbances across the full frequency band for an optical axis position system, which relaxes the restrictions on time consumption. The method proposed in this paper effectively combines the error observer and a frequency estimation algorithm. A new frequency estimation algorithm based on FPGA is proposed to adjust the parameters of the error-based observer, which improves the efficiency of generating adaptive parameters. Parallel and serial processing structures are combined to improve time efficiency and area utilization for implementation in an FPGA. Compared with using a DSP, implementing the algorithm on an FPGA enables real-time performance for high sampling frequency applications. To achieve disturbance rejection across the full frequency band, delay compensation and multi-rate control are used to adjust the error observer. The experimental results show that the proposed FPGA-enabled method accurately estimates the frequencies of time-varying disturbances consisting of narrow-band sinusoidal disturbances, and effectively rejects full-band disturbances."

    "abstract": "Implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a transformative paradigm for time-varying volumetric data compression and representation, owing to their ability to model high-dimensional signals effectively. INRs represent scalar fields based on sampled coordinates, typically using either a single network for the entire field or multiple networks across different spatial domains. However, these approaches often face challenges in modeling complex patterns and introducing boundary artifacts. To address these limitations, we propose MoE-INR,an INR architecture based on a mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework. MoE-INR automates irregular subdivisions of spatiotemporal fields and dynamically assigns them to different expert networks. The architecture comprises three key components: a policy network, a shared encoder, and multiple expert decoders. The policy network subdivides the field and determines which expert decoder is responsible for a given input coordinate. The shared encoder extracts hidden representations from the input coordinates, and the expert decoders transform these high-dimensional features into scalar values. This design results in a unified framework accommodating diverse INR types, including conventional, grid-based, and ensemble. We evaluate the effectiveness of MoE-INR on multiple time-varying datasets with varying characteristics. Experimental results demonstrate that MoE-INR significantly outperforms existing non-MoE and MoE-based INRs and traditional lossy compression methods across quantitative and qualitative metrics under various compression ratios."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes an integrated anti-jamming covert communication and sensing system assisted by reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS). By jointly optimizing beamforming vectors and RIS phase shifts, the system maximizes the sum transmission rate while enhancing communication security, sensing accuracy, and anti-jamming capability. We present two comprehensive optimization schemes: a perfect scheme under ideal channel conditions and a robust scheme for practical scenarios. The perfect scheme jointly optimizes beamforming and phase shifts when perfect channel state information (CSI) is available, establishing a performance upper bound. The robust scheme addresses practical transmission challenges by transforming stochastic uncertainties from imperfect CSI and phase shift errors into deterministic constraints through statistical expectation analysis and worst-case formulations, ensuring reliable system performance under realistic conditions. Both schemes effectively solve the resulting non-convex problems through innovative mathematical reformulations using fractional programming, quadratic transformation techniques, and the alternating direction method of multipliers. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate significant advantages of our proposed framework in communication reliability, sensing accuracy, and resilience against the jammer compared to conventional approaches."

    "abstract": "Transverse flux PM linear generator (TF-PMLG) enables a higher power density under low-speed wave characteristics. However, thrust pulsation and magnetic leakage are major issues in these generators. To address the foregoing problems, a hybrid excitation TF-PMLG is proposed. However, it presents significant control challenges due to large phase inductance and non-negligible internal resistance, particularly under conditions of insufficient bus voltage. Additionally, the necessity for electromagnetic thrust to adapt in real time to wave variations further intensifies the demands on the dynamic performance of the control system. To this end, this paper proposes a model predictive thrust control (MPTC) strategy based on optimal flux linkage vector selection. It can effectively mitigate thrust fluctuations of the generator in response to wave action. Furthermore, a dynamic flux-enhancing strategy is developed, which can reduce the dependence on bus voltage magnitude, thus increasing the peak thrust of the generator. Finally, simulations and experimental results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed MPTC methods in direct-drive wave energy converter (DDWEC) system."

    "abstract": "Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) plays a crucial role in numerous military and civilian applications. However, existing methods often face the gradual degradation of target edge pixels as the number of network layers increases, and traditional convolution struggles to differentiate between frequency components during feature extraction, leading to low-frequency backgrounds interfering with high-frequency targets and high-frequency noise triggering false detections. To address these limitations, we propose MDAFNet (Multi-scale Differential Edge and Adaptive Frequency Guided Network for Infrared Small Target Detection), which integrates the Multi-Scale Differential Edge (MSDE) module and Dual-Domain Adaptive Feature Enhancement (DAFE) module. The MSDE module, through a multi-scale edge extraction and enhancement mechanism, effectively compensates for the cumulative loss of target edge information during downsampling. The DAFE module combines frequency domain processing mechanisms with simulated frequency decomposition and fusion mechanisms in the spatial domain to effectively improve the network’s capability to adaptively enhance high-frequency targets and selectively suppress high-frequency noise. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the superior detection performance of MDAFNet."

Building on previous work using high-accuracy spectrally-sparse time of arrival (ToA) waveforms and a multistep ToA refinement process, a high-accuracy two-way time transfer (TWTT)-based time–frequency coordination approach is demonstrated. Due to the two-way nature of the high-accuracy TWTT approach, the time and frequency estimates are Doppler and multipath tolerant, so long as the channel is reciprocal over the synchronization epoch. This technique is experimentally verified using COTS SDRs in a lab environment in static and dynamic scenarios and with significant multipath scatterers. Time, frequency, and phase stability were evaluated by beamforming over coaxial cables to an oscilloscope which achieved time and phase precisions of ~60–<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathbf {\\mathrm {70~\\text {p}\\text {s} }}$</tex-math> </inline-formula>, with median coherent gains above 99% using optimized coordination parameters, and a beamforming frequency root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 3.73 ppb in a dynamic scenario.

Most of the studies focus on the design of sensor components and, however, lack exploration on how to build an independent sensor system. This study proposes a microwave multiparameter detection system (MMDS) based on a phase-locked loop (PLL) and dual-AD8302. A modified complementary split-ring resonator (MCSRR) works as the passive sensor component. The system is specially designed to handle the environmental influence and work for multiple parameter detection. The PLL driving circuit generates a 0.9–1.4-GHz sweep signal to drive the MCSRR. Then, the insertion loss and phase curve are read out during the sensing process. We quantify and optimize the system noise by establishing a contribution model and propose a compensation model using a neural network for offsetting the influence of environmental temperature and humidity. An evaluation system is built with six indicators: accuracy, linearity, sensitivity, limit of detection (LOD), repeatability, and humidity calibration coefficient (HCC). The measured results show that the MMDS can detect frequency, amplitude, and phase change with an accuracy of 98.7%, 97.2%, and 85.2%, respectively. Empowered by its integrated humidity compensation model, the system demonstrates superior robustness against ambient humidity variations, with an HCC exceeding 92% for frequency, amplitude, and phase detection."

In this approach, a State-Space Model incorporating Rate-Dependent Hysteresis (SSMRDH) is developed to depict the properties of EMSM. Then, according to the constructed model and considering the suppression of model errors and unknown disturbances, the ESOH is developed for the state estimation of EMSM. To obtain the optimal ESOH and taking into account the EMSM, a Predictive Gradient-Based Learning (PGBL) algorithm is applied to the online determination of the observer’s gain vector, thus preventing the learning search process from being trapped in the local extrema resulting from the rate-dependent hysteresis in EMSM. Thereafter, the convergence analysis of the online-learning ESOH is investigated. Subsequently, the online predictive-gradient-based ESOH is utilized for the online fault detection of EMSM. In order to cover the entire cycle from the occurrence to the development of a fault, improve the fault detection rate and reduce the fault detection delay, a fusion decision threshold method that integrates information entropy and relative divergence is proposed. At the end of the paper, the experimental results are presented to verify the proposed fault-detection strategy."

Ensemble of similar differential evolution algorithms has been proposed in literature. Building on previous research, we introduce a novel ensemble framework of similar differential evolution algorithms, where the primary algorithm initially manages all individuals. If, over a series of generations, an individual consistently fails to be eliminated, one of the secondary algorithms is chosen based on historical performance to provisionally handle the individual’s position. This ensemble system requires optimization of a single parameter, namely, the upper limit of successive generations without improvement in a position. Based on differential evolution algorithms within the same family, we present two versions of our ensemble. Our experimental analysis utilizes two benchmark test suites and a group of real-world problems. The results reveal that the first version outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our ablation experiment on the first version confirms the effectiveness of the proposed ensemble schemes. By observing the performance of the both versions, we establish a relationship between the individual algorithms’ performance and that of the ensemble as a whole."

Traditional methods for creating 3D cell cultures often rely on non-biodegradable materials, which limit their application and raise concerns about cell viability. In this work, we successfully replace poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) with dextran-2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (dex-HEMA), a biocompatible and biodegradable alternative. Furthermore, we introduce a technical solution for sterile cell encapsulation, validated through assessments of cell growth and viability alongside the biodegradation rate of the microgel matrix. Our results demonstrate the potential of the self-assembly technique to form organized structures with high spatial resolution. By encapsulating relevant cell lines, Caco-2 and HT-29, within distinct microgel types, we pave the way for the development of sophisticated 3D co-culture models. These advancements hold significant promise for replicating the structural and functional complexities found in native tissues, thereby enhancing the relevance of in vitro studies in biomedical research."

Monitoring of LIBs is essential for safety and reliability. Acoustic Emission (AE) technology enables non-destructive online monitoring of LIBs under normal operating conditions, coupled with electrochemical analysis. This paper employs an experimental setup to monitor AE signals during the charging and discharging processes of LIBs. A feature analysis of the preprocessed AE signals is conducted in conjunction with electrochemical-mechanical mechanisms. The results indicate that the deintercalation and intercalation of lithium ions (Li-ions) at the electrodes may generate opposite characteristics in the AE signals. The peak-peak amplitude and waveform time intervals of the signals show strong correlations with the electrical parameters and electrochemical states of the LIB under different charging and discharging modes, allowing for the identification of constant current (CC) and constant voltage (CV) stages. Analysis of data from multiple LIBs under different state demonstrates the universality of these features. This confirms that AE is an effective method for gaining detailed, real-time insights into the internal state and mechanisms of LIBs."

In this work, we present Sel-V and MuSSel-V, two efficient variants within the segment-level VPR paradigm that replace heavy and fragmented supersegments with lightweight, visually compact and complete dilated superpixels for local feature aggregation. The use of superpixels preserves pixel-level details while reducing computational overhead. A multi-scale extension further enhances robustness to viewpoint and scale changes. Comprehensive experiments on twelve public benchmarks show that our approach achieves a better trade-off between accuracy and efficiency than existing segment-based methods. These results demonstrate that lightweight, non-semantic segmentation can serve as an effective alternative for high-performance, resource efficient visual place recognition in robotics.

    "abstract": "The detection of cognitive load (CL) has emerged as a significant research challenge in recent years. Most traditional techniques that rely heavily on physiological and audio-visual sensors are both privacy-invasive and computationally complex. The complexities of synchronization, data alignment, and accessibility limitations can potentially increase noise and error rates, thereby compromising the accuracy of CL estimates. This study presents a multi-modal, non-invasive, and privacy-preserving Radio Frequency (RF) sensing technique to overcome these limitations and enhance the reliability of CL estimation. The RF sensors are developed to capture blood flow changes in specific brain regions with high spatial resolution. The novel approach adopts RF sensing to estimate in-vivo CL variations utilizing pupillometry as a baseline. The in-vivo audio-only (AO) and audio-visual (AV) trials are conducted in controlled and uncontrolled environments with participants to comprehend target speech with varying background noise levels. Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) methodologies are evaluated for CL classification using RF statistical features with iterative features selection to build a robust feature set. The binary classification achieves an accuracy of 88% and 75% for AO and AV trials. The multi-class classification resulted in an accuracy of 81% and 69% for AO and AV trials. The proposed RF sensing can be utilized to assess the listening effort and CL of hearing-aid users. These RF measurements can be adapted to regulate real-time speech enhancement in hearing aids, tailored to the user's CL and complexity of the acoustic environment."

However, most existing SAR target recognition methods rely on single-channel data, and the potential of multi-channel polarimetric images remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose an end to-end target recognition framework for polarimetric SAR (Pol SAR) images based on a quaternion convolutional neural network (QCNN) operating in the Poincare sphere parameter domain. The QCNN is constructed with a sequence of quaternion operation layers and incorporates a specialized loss function designed for quaternion-valued representations. To address the mismatch problem in the quaternion field, we introduce quaternion maximum pooling (QuatMaxPool) and quaternion average pooling (QuatAvgPool) operations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first QCNN developed for PolSAR target recognition. Experiments on both simulated and real datasets demonstrate that the proposed QCNN achieves recognition performance comparable to state-of-the-art real- and complex-valued models while requiring significantly fewer parameters and offering enhanced physical interpretability, thereby validating the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach"

Due to their widespread adoption in the market, significant efforts have been dedicated in researching and developing various transduction principles, sensing materials, and innovative mechanical designs. This review summarizes the most employed transduction principles for force sensing at the MEMS scale. Among these, electrostatic-capacitive MEMS force sensors are particularly well-suited for implementing closed-loop configurations, as they can integrate both capacitive sensing and electrostatic actuation within a single device thus keeping the system compact and favorably compatible with integrated circuit. Accordingly, this review focuses on the latest research in the literature on electrostatic-capacitive MEMS force sensors operating in both open-loop and closed-loop configurations. The working principles of both approaches are discussed, along with their respective advantages and disadvantages, and a comparison of state-of-the-art sensors in terms of resolution, sensitivity, and measurement range is provided.

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation plays a pivotal role in analyzing high-resolution aerial imagery, forming the backbone of critical applications like urban planning, environmental monitoring, and emergency response planning. Current approaches relying on Convolutional neural networks(CNNs) and Transformers each come with their own set of drawbacks: convolutional networks struggle with their narrow field of view, missing the big picture needed for intricate geographical landscapes, whereas Transformer models bog down under the weight of their own computational demands. Cutting through these limitations, our research introduces an innovative segmentation framework-the Dual-Branch Global-Local Fusion Network (DGLFNet)-which leverages Mamba architecture to simultaneously harvest fine-grained details and broad spatial relationships within satellite and aerial imagery. Specifically, DGLFNet employs ResNet18 as its main encoder and VMamba for extra support in feature extraction from images. To capture global features across multiple scales, the Multi-Scale Vision State Space (MSVSS) module is constructed. Additionally, the Adaptive Wavelet Fusion Module (AWFM), based on wavelet transform, fully extracts and fuses spatial features from different levels. Finally, the multi-scale global features captured by MSVSS and the local features captured by the convolutional branch are fed into the AWFM for feature fusion. The performance on popular datasets like ISPRS Vaihingen, Potsdam, and LoveDA Urban shows that DGLFNet is effective and has real promise."

    "abstract": "Most distributed photovoltaics (PVs) are installed behind-the-meter (BTM) and measured together with user loads, making the specific PV generation and native load invisible. Existing methods typically learn patterns from detailed data collected at fully observable users, modeling PV generation and native load separately, and then developing net load decomposition algorithms. However, these algorithms require substantial amounts of data, and their accuracy decreases when the total number of users is insufficient or when the observation rate is low. To this end, a novel Bayesian Transfer Learning (BTL) based PV-load decomposition strategy for the BTM system is proposed in this paper. First, feature extraction and clustering are performed on the net load nighttime sequence data based on their characteristics, while a data augmentation algorithm is used to expand the user dataset. Second, a two-layer Bayesian network model is designed, where the outer layer learns common features from all user data, and a parameter transfer strategy is employed to transfer the posterior distribution to the inner layer for learning the individual characteristics of data within each cluster. Finally, the trained BTL model is used to separate the PV generation and native load from the unobservable user net load. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated across datasets from various user cases."

    "abstract": "Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus protocols are the core components of blockchain. In the process of improving the performance of BFT protocols, existing work faces the following three problems: 1) the binary dilemma between the leader’s performance bottleneck in star-based linear communication and compromised resilience in tree-based sublinear communication; 2) two- or three-round protocols restrict the phase number of one proposal, thereby limiting the number of concurrent proposals and causing high latency. 3) The fixed timeout makes the protocol sensitive to varying network delays. Therefore, this paper proposes <sc xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Crackle</small>, the first sector-based pipelined BFT protocol with a sublinear communication complexity, for a throughput improvement of consensus protocol with max resilience of <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$(\\mathcal {N}\\textrm {-} 1)/3$</tex-math> </inline-formula>. We propose a sector-based communication mode to disseminate messages from the leader to a subset of replicas in each phase to accelerate consensus and split the traditional two-round protocol into <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$2\\mathsf {\\kappa }$</tex-math> </inline-formula> phases to increase the basic pipeline scale. We refine the timer strategy so that the timeout <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\Delta $</tex-math> </inline-formula> is adjusted with the proposal submission to cope with the changing network environment. We then address two technical challenges: 1) to ensure Quorum Certificate (QC) validation, we design a <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathit {voteMap} s$</tex-math> </inline-formula> field within each block, and verify QC by the signature aggregation of <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathit {voteMap} s$</tex-math> </inline-formula> in continuous <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathsf {\\kappa }$</tex-math> </inline-formula> phases; and 2) to achieve pipeline decoupling among shorter phases, we propose a vote-appending mechanism that relaxes the conditions for the leader to send new proposals. We provide comprehensive theoretical proof of the correctness of <sc xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Crackle</small>, including safety and <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathit{liveness}$</tex-math> </inline-formula>. Moreover, we implement <sc xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Crackle</small> based on a public BFT framework and deploy it on 64 cloud servers. Real experimental results reveal that our <sc xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Crackle</small> protocol achieves up to 10.36x higher throughput and can dynamically adapt to network delay compared with state-of-the-art BFT protocols such as Kauri and Hotstuff."

    "abstract": "Multifactorial optimization (MFO) has gained increasing attention in evolutionary multitasking (EMT), as it enables implicit knowledge transfer among tasks to enhance overall optimization efficiency. However, selecting appropriate transfer methods and adjusting their transfer probabilities remain significant challenges in MFO. Since existing selection and adjustment rules are typically formulated based on classical logic, they often fail to effectively handle the inherent uncertainty and dynamic nature of EMT. To address these limitations, this paper suggests a new multifactorial evolutionary algorithm based on fuzzy logic, called MFEA-FL. By employing the Mamdani fuzzy inference system (FIS), expert knowledge can be naturally incorporated into the decision-making process, enabling MFEA-FL to exhibit strong fault tolerance and robustness across a wide range of multitasking environments. Specifically, two strategies, namely fuzzy transfer method selection (FTMS) and fuzzy transfer probability adjustment (FTPA), are proposed. FTMS quantifies the applicability of candidate transfer methods via a Mamdani FIS and then adaptively selects the most promising one for conducting knowledge transfer. Meanwhile, FTPA estimates the change of the transfer probability via a Mamdani FIS and dynamically adjusts the intensity of knowledge transfer. Experimental results on a series of multitasking optimization problems validate the effectiveness of the two fuzzy strategies and the superior performance of MFEA-FL over existing state-of-the-art EMT algorithms."

Current approaches suffer from fundamental limitations: Symbolic Computer Algebra (SCA) techniques struggle with heavily optimized multipliers, Satisfiability (SAT)-based approaches require structurally similar reference designs, and hybrid methods fail to handle Booth multipliers. On the other hand, industrial design flows possess extensive libraries of verified multipliers for optimization workflows, creating an underutilized opportunity for library-based verification. Yet optimal reference selection becomes challenging due to large-scale libraries and optimization-obscured architectural relationships. To address these challenges, we propose LibSCAT, a verification framework that leverages large-scale reference libraries in a scalable manner. First, we propose a reference library-based methodology that adaptively combines SCA and SAT techniques through intelligent reference selection and predictive method choice. Second, we propose a Siamese Graph Neural Network model that captures multiplier structural relationships in latent space from reverse-engineered graphs, generating robust embeddings for efficient reference selection. Third, we propose a Random Forest-based predictor that leverages learned embeddings for accurate selection of verification strategies. Experimental results show our method achieves 88.2% success on heavily optimized simple partial product multipliers and 94.0% success on heavily optimized Booth multipliers, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods."

The proposed marker is designed for out-of-plane rotation measurement, which comprises two periodic masks etched on the opposite sides of a glass wafer. The masks project a Moiré pattern on the image plane of the observing camera, and this Moiré pattern is dramatically sensitive to out-of-plane rotation. The key contribution is that we first explicitly derive, for the first time, the geometric relationship between the rotation angle and the Moiré pattern to build a straightforward measurement model, which reveals that the angle is simply determined by the Moiré phase at the image principal point. The accuracy is independent of the observation distance and camera intrinsic parameters. Estimation and calibration algorithms are given. Experiment demonstrates the superiority, which shows an accuracy that is up to 7 times higher than traditional visual markers and at least 2 times higher than state-of-the-art 3-D Moiré-based markers."

    "abstract": "The thickness detection of thin asphalt layers helps evaluate the construction quality and daily maintenance of roads. However, the limitation of low-frequency ground penetrating radar (GPR) resolution, combined with the similarity of the thin asphalt layer’s dielectric constant, leads to an inaccurate estimation of the thickness of the thin asphalt layer. Therefore, to accurately measure the thickness of thin asphalt layers, this paper proposes a super-resolution analysis algorithm based on Weighted Fourier Transform and Relaxation (WRELAX), which overcomes the resolution limit of low-frequency GPR and enables the construction of super-resolution signals. The efficient data acquisition method of multi-offset GPR enables us to verify its effectiveness in both simulation and field data. In the simulation data, the relative error in the electromagnetic wave velocity is within 1.84 %, and the thickness error is less than 9.30 %. In the field data, the maximum relative thickness error is 6.62 %. The research shows that the algorithm can accurately measure the thickness of the thin asphalt layer and the velocity of the electromagnetic wave without changing the design of the low-frequency multi-offset GPR equipment and its observation system. This algorithm offers a novel approach to detecting road structures, which is crucial in ensuring road safety."

    "abstract": "Few-shot object detection (FSOD) in remote sensing imagery aims to achieve accurate detection of novel object categories with limited training samples. However, current mainstream transfer learning based methods are frequently constrained by two major challenges. Firstly, due to the scarcity of novel class samples and the bias of pre-trained models towards base classes, novel classes may rely overly on base class knowledge to construct feature representations, causing novel class features to be easily confused with similar base classes. Secondly, the inter-class similarity and intra-class diversity in remote sensing images can further exacerbate classification confusion. To tackle the above problems, we propose a semantic correlation-guided method for FSOD (SCG-FSOD) in remote sensing images. Specifically, we design an inter-class semantic correlation transfer (ISCT) module to fully explore the semantic correlations between base and novel classes, employing knowledge distillation for cross-class correlation transfer. This module effectively mitigates base-class bias while enhancing the discriminative power of novel class features. Furthermore, we propose a semantic correlation-driven supervised contrastive learning (SSCL) module, which employs semantic correlation priors to weight negative sample pairs in supervised contrastive learning. By imposing stronger separation constraints on negative pairs with high inter-class similarity, this module significantly alleviates feature confusion in remote sensing images. Extensive experiments conducted on two public benchmark datasets (DIOR and NWPU VHR-10.v2) demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, which achieves competitive performance compared with several state-of-the-art approaches."

    "abstract": "Small weak object detection (SWOD) is a significant but neglected task in remote sensing image interpretation. Due to limitations in imaging resolution and inherent characteristics of the objects, detection networks struggle to effectively extract semantic features, which are crucial for object identification and recognition. In recent years, graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have been developed to handle non-Euclidean data. Through GCNs, node data are enriched via aggregation and propagation across the graph. In this article, we explore the feasibility of GCNs in semantic clue extraction to address the lack of key semantics in small weak objects. First, we propose a multi-head graph reasoning learning model (MGRL) that projects initial feature representations into graph space and utilizes a two-layer multi-head graph network to extract essential semantic information. Second, we introduce a foreground-background binary masking technique (FBM) that roughly segments the foreground region of the image. The mask is converted into a prior prompt, which is then incorporated into the adjacency matrix, emphasizing object reasoning in MGRL. Next, we present a cross learning-based feature alignment learning module (FAL) to resolve feature misalignment issues caused by spatial projection. Finally, we adopt a cross-layer semantic interaction module (CSI) to facilitate cross-layer communication and aggregation of features. Extensive experiments are conducted on five remote sensing datasets: DIOR, AI-TOD, NWPU VHR-10, DOTA-v1.0, and STAR. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance and advantages of our method."

However, SC is still in the infant stage with quite a few limitations, such as insufficient semantic representation capacity, high communication latency, and the susceptibility to channel noise. In this paper, we propose <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">LiFiSC</i>, a cross-modal fusion based generative semantic communication framework with strong semantic compression capacity and high-fidelity semantic restoration.

    "abstract": "The highly demanding operation of electrical machines in aerospace ultimately leads to the degradation of the electrical insulation system within the machine stator windings over time. This paper presents a novel hybrid methodology for high-frequency modelling of the insulation system in the concentrated stator winding of a 2 MW aerospace generator. A degradation-informed coil model is presented for purposes of characterisation and monitoring of the coil insulation system by the impedance responses using Bode plots in frequency response analysis (FRA), notably electrical impedance spectroscopy. The proposed approach utilises a finite element model which is informed by measurements of dielectric properties on unaged and thermally aged insulation material specimen and deployed in tandem with an electrical equivalent circuit representation. An analytical tool built in Matlab is used to quantify the results taken from finite element modelling and implemented into LTSpice for circuit considerations, so that the model considers mutual coupling effects of inductances and high-frequency effects such as proximity and skin effect. Dielectric properties measurements allow to inform this model to account for degradation effects and how these reflect in the impedance frequency spectrum. This novel methodology allows extraction of the impedance profile with respect to the material changes within the simulated and experimentally measured unaged and degraded insulation system. The theoretical results acquired by the hybrid co-simulations are validated experimentally using thermally aged coil samples."

    "abstract": "Single-switch resonant converter topology is used in induction cooking and cap sealing. Due to the usage of thin non-magnetic material (aluminium foil), converter for cap sealing needs to operate at high frequency to transfer the required power. To maintain zero voltage switching for each load type, the duty cycle of the gate pulse needs to be varied accordingly. To avoid the complexity of changing an application-specific duty cycle, parallel-connected SiC MOSFETs are preferred as a single switch for near-continuous-duty operation. The gate voltage is highly asymmetrical for these devices, and due to a small gate threshold voltage, they are sensitive to ringing in gate signals. This work proposes a novel low-leakage pulse transformer (PT) for a magnetically coupled GDC to drive multiple isolated devices for high current applications like induction sealing. The proposed pulse transformer is cost-effective and can avoid spurious turn-on. The leakage- and self-inductances of the proposed transformer are computed using FEM simulations. The calculated inductances agree with the measured values. By using the proposed PT, the effectiveness of the GDC is demonstrated by using a circuit simulation, and the same is experimentally verified by driving two parallel connected SiC MOSFETs for high-speed offline induction cap sealing applications."

We study simple visual displays that directly show color-mapped scalar fields, namely those drawn from a distribution, and whether humans can identify strongly correlated spatial regions in these displays. In this setting, the recognition of correlation requires making judgments on a set of fields, rather than just one field. Thus, in our experimental design we compare two basic visualization designs: animation-based displays against juxtaposed views of scalar fields, along different choices of color scales. Moreover, we investigate the impacts of the distribution itself, controlling for the level of spatial correlation and discriminability in spatial scales. Our study's results illustrate the impacts of these distribution characteristics, while also highlighting how different visual displays impact the types of judgments made in assessing spatial correlation.

    "abstract": "Abnormal events such as PV disconnections and capacitor bank switching frequently cause voltage violations in active distribution networks, posing significant challenges to system stability and operational resilience. To address these challenges, this work proposes an event-triggered real-time voltage regulation framework to enhance the resilience of distribution systems under abnormal operating conditions. First, a multi-task wavelet spectrum network (MWSN) is developed to detect and localize abnormal events with high accuracy by integrating global and local time-frequency features through a novel wavelet spectrum block. The detection results are used to classify events into three distinct categories, each corresponding to a customized voltage control strategy. These categorized events and their associated recovery strategies are then encoded into a Markov decision process (MDP) formulation designed for real-time voltage regulation. To solve the MDP efficiently, a multi-agent soft actor-critic (MASAC) algorithm is employed, enabling decentralized agents to adjust PV inverter outputs and perform load curtailment actions. The proposed framework introduces a closed-loop design that tightly integrates data-driven event perception with adaptive control, thereby enabling timely and scalable response to disturbances. Simulation results on a modified IEEE 33-bus distribution network validate the effectiveness of the proposed MWSN-MASAC framework in reducing voltage violations and improving overall system performance during abnormal events."

However, their autonomy in movement, energy consumption, and economic behavior introduces dynamic uncertainty, which can lead to unreliable sensing data, early participant dropout, and unfair resource allocation. To address these challenges, we propose DAACS, a Double-Auction-based Autonomous Crowd Sensing system. First, DAACS adopts a Markov-based Spatiotemporal State Prediction Algorithm (STSTA) to identify reliable participants and handle mobility uncertainty. Second, multi-round task allocation is formulated as an online optimization problem, and a primal-dual algorithm, termed MRTADA, is developed. By dynamically adjusting the shadow prices associated with energy budgets, MRTADA achieves long-term system sustainability and fairness. Third, a Critical-Value-based Reward and Payment Mechanism (CVBRPA) is incorporated to ensure individual rationality and truthfulness. Theoretical analysis proves the online algorithm achieves a competitive ratio of αρ/ρ-1. Experimental results demonstrate that DAACS attains near-optimal social welfare with low computational overhead while effectively balancing mobility and energy constraints."

A critical factor affecting precision is the joint transmission system, where error sources such as nonlinearity, backlash, and radial clearance remain insufficiently addressed. Based on mechanistic analysis and test validation of the residual errors after secondary encoder system (SES) compensation, this study proposes a composite control strategy that integrates SES feedback with crosstalk compensation to address dynamic disturbances. The approach begins with joint detection using high-precision gratings, establishing an angular measurement error compensation model to correct SES measurement errors. Subsequently, feedforward control is implemented based on the crosstalk error model to mitigate the impact of axis-to-axis crosstalk and joint radial clearance on end-effector positioning accuracy. Finally, experimental results demonstrate a significant enhancement in robotic accuracy, achieving multidirectional repeatability of <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\pm$</tex-math></inline-formula>0.08 mm and circular trajectory accuracy of <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\pm$</tex-math></inline-formula>0.2 mm.

However, its precoding designs that maximize the sum rate normally have high computational complexity. To implement an efficient RSMA scheme for the MU-MIMO system, in this work, we propose a novel robust precoding design, which can handle imperfect CSI. Specifically, we first adopt the generalized mutual information to construct a lower bound of the objective function in the sum rate maximization problem. Then, we apply a smooth lower bound of the non-smooth sum rate objective function to construct a new optimization problem. By revealing the relationship between the generalized signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio and the minimum mean square error matrices, we transform the constructed problem into a tractable one. After decomposing the transformed problem into three subproblems, we investigate a new alternating precoding design based on sequential solutions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed precoding scheme achieves comparable performance to conventional methods, while significantly reducing the computational complexity."

Video-based clothes-changing person re-identification (VCC-ReID) has become essential due to the rich information in videos and its broad applications. Because clothes are attached to the human body, the clothes and pedestrian features are highly coupled when extracting features, making VCC-ReID challenging. To solve this challenge, we propose a Multi-Task Disentanglement Framework guided by Pedestrian Attributes (MTDF-PAttr), whose core is the cross-domain attribute distillation decoupling mechanism. Pedestrian attribute recognition (PAR) is used as an auxiliary task in MTDF-PAttr to guide feature decoupling, thereby enhancing the main task, VCC-ReID’s performance. Since the existing VCC-ReID dataset lacks PAR annotations, we employ knowledge distillation to train the auxiliary task, where the teacher network is a pre-trained video-based PAR network. To make the PAR teacher network have better accuracy, stronger generalization, and can identify more attributes, we propose a Multi-Dataset Fusion Framework for Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (MDFF-PAttr), whose core is the multi-teacher collaborative self-distillation mechanism. MDFF-PAttr can simultaneously use multiple datasets for training and provide a powerful teacher model for MTDF-PAttr to distill its auxiliary task. Experimental results demonstrate that MTDF-PAttr can achieve state-of-the-art performance in the VCC-ReID task, providing an effective method for intelligent surveillance systems in the IoT. Additionally, MDFF-PAttr can effectively enhance the accuracy and generalization of the PAR network."

This approach achieves synergistic regulation of low-frequency trends and high-frequency turbulence via a multi-timescale decoupling framework. The strategy uses an extended Kalman filter (EKF) to estimate the effective wind speed and to provide feedforward compensation for LiDAR measurement delay, and it uses multi-timescale decomposition (MTSD) to decompose the disturbance into a slow trend and a fast residual. The upper loop applies adaptive sliding-mode control to the slow component, while the lower loop employs a super-twisting disturbance observer with an adaptive gain law for real-time estimation and compensation of the fast residual, thereby attenuating chattering. Validation on the OpenFAST–MATLAB/Simulink co-simulation platform shows that, under three extreme operating conditions, the proposed strategy achieves average improvements of 16.21%, 34.24%, and 12.43% in overshoot, steady-state error, and pitch-rate fluctuation suppression, respectively, demonstrating superior dynamic performance and strong robustness. This solution integrates theoretical rigor with practical applicability, potentially extending turbine lifespan while enhancing energy-capture efficiency and power-generation performance. Its scalability will be further assessed through hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) and field validation across multiple turbine sites."

    "abstract": "Quadruped manipulators require precise detection of external forces to perform a series of force-related tasks during environmental interactions. However, these systems often lack tactile sensors on their body surfaces or force/torque sensors at critical joints. Conventional momentum based observer is widely used for external force estimation, but it relies heavily on an accurate dynamics model. This study introduces an external force estimation method for quadruped manipulators, utilizing a novel external force observer together with a Transformer network, that estimates external forces acting on the manipulator or the quadruped's base in the presence of model uncertainties. The observer leverages the robustness of a super-twisting algorithm (STA) based on the momentum model of quadruped manipulators, and compensates for the plantar force during dynamic gaits, reducing the influence on the estimation results. Model uncertainties are mitigated using Transformer, which predict the uncertainty-induced components in the observer estimation results. By means of residual, the proposed method estimates the purely applied external force with only proprioceptive sensors. Experimental validation across diverse scenarios confirms the effectiveness of this approach in facilitating safe and adaptive interactions between quadruped manipulators and external forces."

The machine employs two grippers actuated by five degrees of freedom: three rotational axes for in-plane bending, out-of-plane bending, and twisting of the plate, and two translational axes for feeding and reorientation. Each gripper is equipped with a pair of commercial orthodontic pliers for bending titanium plates, together with a four-bar self-locking mechanism driven by a low-power servo motor, providing high clamping force to resist plate springback and ensuring reliable handling of thick titanium plates. Experimental validation, including discrete out-of-plane bending, twisting, and continuous L-shaped bending tests, demonstrated that the machine reproduces target shapes within a 0.5 mm geometric tolerance. Overall, the proposed bending machine provides an efficient, accurate, and cost-effective solution for pre-operative titanium plate preparation in maxillofacial surgery."

However, duty-cycled communication leads to high latency, making on-demand and event-based communication impractical. Wake-up receivers address this issue by reducing energy consumption during reception. Since most wake-up receivers operate in always-on mode, they enable low-latency and event-based communication. Given the wide variety of design approaches, a clear overview is needed. Many existing solutions are incompatible with real-world deployment, require custom fabrication, or lack repeatability. Therefore, there is a strong need to focus on prototypes based on commercial off-the-shelf components. These offer practical advantages in terms of cost, availability, and ease of integration. This article surveys the literature over the period of 2002–2024. We analyzed over 120 articles dealing with this topic. We examined, characterized, and classified 132 wake-up receiver prototypes. We identified the main building blocks of wake-up receivers and analyzed the components and circuits used. Additionally, we highlighted the strengths and limitations of current research and provided an outlook on future research directions."

    "abstract": "Multi-agent reinforcement learning with temporal logic presents unique challenges, particularly in competitive settings where agents pursue conflicting objectives. This paper presents NASTL-CIRL (Nash Signal Temporal Logic for Causal Inference in Reinforcement Learning), a novel approach that combines Nash Q-Learning with Causal Signal Temporal Logic (Causal STL) inference to guide agent behavior in competitive environments. Our approach enables agents to infer causal relationships through STL formulas that explain agent behavior and environmental dynamics, providing strategic advantages. Pacman Game scenario and Factory Assembly scenario are conducted to show the superior performance of the proposed NASTL-CIRL algorithm compared to baseline methods. Our results show that integrating causal STL inference with Nash equilibrium concepts leads to more structured and interpretable agent behaviors while maintaining competitive performance."

Hosted at ESRIN (ESA’s Earth Observation Center, Italy), the event welcomed around 300 people on site, and an additional 550 online, with the promise that FMs can revolutionize EO and Earth sciences. The workshop marked a pivotal moment in aligning the EO and FM communities, fostering a shared commitment to developing open and trustworthy tools that support science discovery, operational applications, and prescriptive analytics. EO data is massive, complex and high dimensional requiring specific yet scalable AI architectures. The workshop emphasized the need for training and architecture enabling interpretability, explainability, and physical consistency. Coordination should be strengthened to minimize redundant development and to better leverage collective expertise. The focus has shifted from prototyping to real-world deployment, with FMs needing further design for integration into digital twins, dashboards, and edge platforms. Transparent benchmarking and user-driven evaluation are key to guiding model development and decision-making. In addition, parameter-efficient adaptation, neural compression, and embedding-based workflows offer promising paths for scaling EO analytics. While FMs show promise, their effectiveness remains context-dependent. The community debated whether to pursue universal models, specialized solutions, or mixtures of experts. The workshop envisioned the future of agentic AI in EO, with multi-agent system powered by EO FMs and vision-language models, that can dynamically reason and act on EO data. This shift from static pipelines to adaptive, smarter systems could redefine the future of EO. This paper summarizes key discussions and concludes with thought-provoking remarks."

    "abstract": "Although dual-vector model predictive current control (MPCC) provides fast dynamic response and a compact control structure, it still relies exclusively on the inverter’s eight basic voltage vectors (VVs). This dependence leads to substantial computational load as well as pronounced current ripple, ultimately limiting steady-state performance. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents an enhanced MPCC strategy for surface-mounted PMSM drives. First, a simplified optimal-vector selection framework is introduced to reduce the computational complexity of conventional MPCC, achieving nearly a 50% reduction in execution time. Second, a refined cost function incorporating both soft and hard constraints on current variation is developed to suppress rapid current changes and achieve near zero-error tracking. Finally, a duty-ratio allocation method based on the deadbeat principle is derived, enabling more effective utilization of the selected voltage vectors and further improving control performance. The proposed method is validated through theoretical analysis and simulation studies and is experimentally demonstrated on a 1-kW PMSM platform, confirming its effectiveness and superior steady-state and dynamic performance."

    "abstract": "Differential evolution exhibits strong performance in real parameter single objective optimization. Ensemble of similar differential evolution algorithms has been proposed in literature. Building on previous research, we introduce a novel ensemble framework of similar differential evolution algorithms, where the primary algorithm initially manages all individuals. If, over a series of generations, an individual consistently fails to be eliminated, one of the secondary algorithms is chosen based on historical performance to provisionally handle the individual’s position. This ensemble system requires optimization of a single parameter, namely, the upper limit of successive generations without improvement in a position. Based on differential evolution algorithms within the same family, we present two versions of our ensemble. Our experimental analysis utilizes two benchmark test suites and a group of real-world problems. The results reveal that the first version outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our ablation experiment on the first version confirms the effectiveness of the proposed ensemble schemes. By observing the performance of the both versions, we establish a relationship between the individual algorithms’ performance and that of the ensemble as a whole."

Traditional methods for creating 3D cell cultures often rely on non-biodegradable materials, which limit their application and raise concerns about cell viability. In this work, we successfully replace poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) with dextran-2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (dex-HEMA), a biocompatible and biodegradable alternative. Furthermore, we introduce a technical solution for sterile cell encapsulation, validated through assessments of cell growth and viability alongside the biodegradation rate of the microgel matrix. Our results demonstrate the potential of the self-assembly technique to form organized structures with high spatial resolution. By encapsulating relevant cell lines, Caco-2 and HT-29, within distinct microgel types, we pave the way for the development of sophisticated 3D co-culture models. These advancements hold significant promise for replicating the structural and functional complexities found in native tissues, thereby enhancing the relevance of in vitro studies in biomedical research."

    "abstract": "Massive MIMO beamforming for 6G networks faces a fundamental tradeoff between solution quality and computational complexity. Exhaustive search guarantees optimal antenna selection; however, this becomes prohibitively expensive for arrays exceeding 16 elements, while polynomial-time classical heuristics sacrifice 15–25% performance to achieve practical scalability. This paper introduces a quantum-enhanced optimization framework using the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to address this challenge for IoT-integrated 6G massive MIMO systems. Our approach combines quantum solution exploration with classical parameter optimization, integrating realistic 3GPP TR 38.901 channel models across 28–60 GHz bands and heterogeneous IoT device characteristics (mMTC, URLLC, eMBB). The framework incorporates an adaptive penalty mechanism that achieves constraint satisfaction within five iterations while maintaining polynomial complexity. Statistical validation across 50 independent channel realizations demonstrates significant advantages: 10–20% spectral efficiency improvement over classical heuristics (p<0.001, Cohen’s d=1.24), 35–42% IoT energy reduction, and 90–95% near-optimal solution quality compared to 65–85% for polynomial-time classical methods. Hardware validation on IBM quantum platforms (127–133 qubits) confirms practical feasibility for medium-scale systems with M≤16 antennas, achieving 89.3% of ideal performance with 22% measurement success rate. Current hardware limitations restrict deployment to proof-of-concept demonstrations, with full-scale 6G implementations requiring quantum error correction projected for 2030+."

    "abstract": "Recently, deep neural networks have improved the performance of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) image classification. Nonetheless, traditional approaches based on deep learning are highly dependent on substantial labeled datasets, which is difficult to obtain for PolSAR images. To tackle this issue, self-supervised learning is introduced to the studied task, exploiting hidden information within massive unlabeled data. Current self-supervised methods predominantly rely on a single paradigm, either generative or contrastive learning, yet each captures only partial features critical for PolSAR image classification. Therefore, to achieve comprehensive PolSAR image interpretation, we propose GHSS-Net, a graph-enhanced hybrid self-supervised framework for PolSAR image classification. Integrating graph-based generative learning and pixel-level contrastive learning through a dual-branch architecture, GHSS-Net improves classification results in scenarios with sparse annotations. Specifically, the generative learning branch utilizes superpixel-based graph neural networks with a low-rank constraint for representation learning by masking and reconstructing graphs. To compensate for the lack of fine-grained information, the contrastive learning branch captures pixel-level features through an implicit comparison process. We validate the effectiveness of GHSS-Net on four benchmark datasets. Experimental results substantiate that GHSS-Net attains state-of-the-art performance compared with other competitors with limited labels."

    "abstract": "Most decentralized optimization algorithms are handcrafted. While endowed with strong theoretical guarantees, these algorithms generally target a broad class of problems, thereby not being adaptive or customized to specific problem features. This paper studies data-driven decentralized algorithms trained to exploit problem features to boost convergence. Existing learning-to-optimize methods typically suffer from poor generalization or prohibitively vast search spaces. In addition, they face more challenges in decentralized settings where nodes must reach consensus through neighborhood communications without global information. To resolve these challenges, this paper first derives necessary conditions for decentralized algorithmic rules to achieve both optimality and consensus. Then, we propose a novel Convergence-Motivated Learning-to-optimize framework for Decentralized optimization (MiLoDo) based on these conditions. Empirical results demonstrate that MiLoDo-trained algorithms outperform handcrafted algorithms and exhibit strong generalizations. Algorithms learned via MiLoDo in 100 iterations perform robustly when running 100,000 iterations during inferences. Moreover, MiLoDo-trained algorithms on synthetic datasets perform well on problems involving real data, higher dimensions, and different loss functions.

Our method takes advantage of the multiply-scattered waves that are reflected by uncontrolled background structures and that illuminate the foreground RI from behind. It tackles the ill-posed nature of the problem using weighted time loss, positivity constraints and Total Variation regularization. We have validated our method with data generated by detailed 2D and 3D simulations, demonstrating its performance under weak multiple scattering conditions and with simplified forward models used in the optimization routine for computational efficiency. In addition, we highlight the need for multi-wavelength analysis and the use of regularization to ensure the reconstruction of the low spatial frequencies of the foreground RI."

    "abstract": "The survivability of floating structures in harsh marine environments is a critical factor affecting their safety, stability, and large-scale applicability. To enhance the survivability of floating structures, a novel submersible floating mooring system (SFMS) is proposed in this article based on hexagonal modular floating structures (HMFSs). The proposed SFMS consists of a taut mooring system and a buoyancy adjustment device (i.e., ballast tank and winch). By adjusting ballast water and mooring lines, the floating and submerged statuses of the HMFS can be autonomously switched to accommodate varying sea conditions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the new mooring system, a simulation analysis is conducted based on the SESAM software, considering different submerged depths and mooring line lengths. The optimization design, based on a neural network and a genetic algorithm, was performed to minimize the total cost of the proposed system while considering HMFS safety requirements. The results showed that as the submerged depth increases, the safety and serviceability of the HMFS were enhanced gradually; compared to the surface status, the heave, line tension, and maximum acceleration of the HMFS with a submerged depth of 20 m were reduced by 91.1%, 64.91%, and 93.01%, respectively. Compared to the initial design, the optimal design has a reduction of 33.11% in cost with a mooring line length of 120 m and a submerged depth of 17.17 m. The proposed SFMS provides a promising approach for the safe operation of modular floating structures in harsh marine environments."

By first designing the attention mechanism, we extract channel features over time and utilize fading correlations for improved tracking in dynamic environments. Additionally, a hypernetwork is introduced to exploit partial uplink reciprocity to refine downlink CE network, reducing pilot overhead. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed HyperTransformer achieves a lower normalized mean square error (NMSE) than state-of-the-art deep learning (DL)-based methods."

The platform had integrated four components—data-quality analysis, model-performance evaluation, explainability diagnostics, and governance-based certification—to provide measurable, auditable, and reproducible assessments of AI systems. Experimental results had shown that each module had been indispensable to reliability, traceability, transparency, and certification readiness; the elimination of any module had always led to a decrease in trustworthiness scores. In addition, the platform had enabled rigorous verification in various engineering contexts through clause-level standards mapping, trust-index computation, lifecycle traceability, and explanation-stability analysis. The findings confirmed that AIVeritas had offered a unified and regulation-ready pathway for assessing the validity, robustness, and explainability of AI models used in engineering design and operational decision-making."

Existing studies employ similarity-based, summarization-based, and dual summarization methods to detect incongruent news. However, the incongruent news detection methods in existing studies exhibit the following key limitations. 1) Bag-of-words-based methods fail to capture the deep semantic relationships and complex negations between the news body sentences and the headline and between the news body and the headline. 2) Similarity-based methods struggle to detect incongruent news articles with concise headlines and large news bodies. 3) The existing methods in the literature are ineffective in partially incongruent news detection. 4) Methods in the literature are inadequate in handling topic inconsistency between sentences of the news body and topic dissimilarities between headlines and bodies for detecting incongruent articles.

We conduct our experiments on four publicly available benchmark datasets, and our results suggest that our proposed models outperform existing state-of-the-art methods in the literature and effectively detect incongruent and fake news of various forms, including misleading, satire, hoax, and propaganda. We also evaluate the robustness of our proposed methods in detecting incongruent and fake news by assessing their performance on a curated dataset of real-world misinformation and incongruent news instances. Our evaluations suggest that the proposed models are highly effective in detecting incongruent and fake news articles across diverse genres."

    "abstract": "Remote sensing change detection (CD) identifies land-use/land-cover changes by analyzing multi-temporal imagery. Mainstream methods employ siamese multi-level encoders and a single multi-level decoder: encoders extract multi-scale features, while the decoder fuses them to generate change maps. However, the effective exploitation of multi-scale features in existing methods remains limited, often falling short in fully unleashing the discriminative potential at each scale and in adequately achieving synergistic cross-scale fusion. To address this limitation, we propose the bidirectional LSTM gated triple-decoder network (TDNet), which introduces two innovations: 1. Triple-decoder architecture: We abandon the single-decoder paradigm and construct three cascaded decoder branches of varying depths (2, 3, and 4 layers). Each branch specializes in processing features at its corresponding level—shallow, middle, or deep—fully unleashing the discriminative potential at every scale. 2. Bidirectional LSTM-based multi-scale feature interaction module (BLMIM): Leveraging LSTM’s gating mechanism, BLMIM extends the bidirectional LSTM to handle multi-scale feature interactions: it adaptively retains upstream features via the forget gate, filters current-layer information via the input gate, and controls contributions to subsequent layers via the output gate. This yields interpretable multi-scale interactions and, to our knowledge, constitutes the first adaptation of LSTM to supervised change detection. Comprehensive experiments on LEVIR-CD, CDD, and WHU-CD demonstrate that TDNet surpasses state-of-the-art methods, achieving F1 improvements of 0.60 %, 0.49 %, and 0.50 %, respectively."

    "abstract": "As a popular distributed learning paradigm, federated learning (FL) over mobile devices fosters numerous applications, while their practical deployment is hindered by participating devices’ computing and communication heterogeneity. Some pioneering research efforts proposed to extract subnetworks from the global model, and assign as large a subnetwork as possible to the device for local training based on its full computing and communications capacity. Although such fixed size subnetwork assignment enables FL training over heterogeneous mobile devices, it is unaware of (i) the dynamic changes of devices’ communication and computing conditions and (ii) FL training progress and its dynamic requirements of local training contributions, both of which may cause very long FL training delay. Motivated by those dynamics, in this paper, we develop a wireless and heterogeneity aware latency efficient FL (WHALE-FL) approach to accelerate FL training through adaptive subnetwork scheduling. Instead of sticking to the fixed size subnetwork, WHALE-FL introduces a novel subnetwork selection utility function to capture device and FL training dynamics, and guides the mobile device to adaptively select the subnetwork size for local training based on (a) its computing and communication capacity, (b) its dynamic computing and/or communication conditions, and (c) FL training status and its corresponding requirements for local training contributions. We provide a theoretical convergence analysis for WHALE-FL with heterogeneous subnetwork assignment, based on which subnetwork structures can be dynamically optimized to reduce the resulting gap to standard full-model FL. Our evaluation shows that, compared with peer designs, WHALE-FL effectively accelerates FL training without sacrificing learning accuracy."

Furthermore, a neural-network-based multi-sensitive parameter mapping modeling approach is proposed to characterize the reliability degradation of the devices. The experimental results indicate that the TID sensitivity increases with the fin number, while the hot carrier reliability improves. Compared to unirradiated devices, irradiated devices exhibit more severe HCD, and the degradation becomes more pronounced as the fin number increases. The model based on TID-HCD multi-sensitive parameter mapping developed using BP neural network effectively captures the degradation induced by irradiation-hot carrier synergistic effect and reflects the impact of the fin number, with a maximum error of less than 2%. These results emphasize the importance of strategic transistor design to improve the TID radiation reliability of FinFET technology. The proposed transistor-level model can be used for reliability evaluation and radiation-hardened design of circuits operating in irradiated environments."

However, significant variations in carrier mobility-lifetime (μτ) products in perovskite materials (e.g., CsPbBr<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sub>) lead to intricate interplays of charge collection efficiency (CCE) and spectral resolution. Particularly in unipolar detector geometries, nonlinear signal distortion arises, limiting the predictive accuracy of conventional simulation frameworks. To address this, we established a systematic semiconductor detector simulation framework that integrates energy deposition data from Geant4 Monte Carlo simulation with weighting potential and electric field derived from the finite element method (FEM), enabling precise probing of induced charges and tracking of carrier trajectories, exemplified for pixelated perovskite detector. This framework modeled the physical photoelectric conversion and signal generation processes, in generating real-time charge-sensitive amplifier (CSA) pulses and energy spectra that closely aligned with experimental signals of pixelated perovskite detector. It is validated that pulses generated deploying this physically accurate carrier trajectories exhibited superior agreement with actual detector signals compared to traditional exponential decay models, which could be used as high-fidelity training datasets for pulse-processing algorithms such as baseline correction and digital shaping. In addition, a 3D charge-loss correction was introduced into the simulated spectrum, demonstrating improved energy resolution and highlighting the strong potential of CsPbBr<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sub> detectors.

    "abstract": "To resolve the problems of low sensitivity and reliability for optical fiber salinity sensors, a novel design is proposed and experimentally verified. In this design, a section of quartz capillary tube (QCT) coated with polyimide (PI) is spliced to the end of a single-mode fiber (SMF), and then implanted with a small-diameter FBG to form a unique Fabry-Pérot interferometer (FPI). Unlike traditional FPIs, it features a long active length of several millimeters and an ultrashort cavity of only several micrometers, rather than being of equal length. Therefore, the capillary strain generated by the salinity response due to the osmotic pressure of the PI coating is fully transferred to the cavity length change of the FPI, thereby amplifying the strain effect of the FPI by several hundred times. This achieves an ultra-high sensitivity of 0.79 nm/με, and further obtains a high salinity sensitivity of ~ 1.5 nm/%, which is tens of times higher than other PI-based salinity sensors. Furthermore, the proposed sensor features good reversibility, long-term stability and low detection limits. The integrated FBG in sensor’s body is used for in-situ monitoring of ambient temperature to eliminate the crosstalk for precise salinity measurement. Overall, the compact size (just a few millimeters long) and the outstanding performance with high reliability of our sensor make it an ideal candidate for precise salinity measurements."

    "abstract": "Temperature variations directly affect the electrical performance and reliability of high-power semiconductor devices. Therefore, to prevent semiconductor devices from overheating and to ensure stable operation, the design of efficient heat sinks to enhance the thermal management of microchips is particularly critical. This work focuses on high-power IGBT modules as a representative application and addresses the challenges of high thermal-failure risk and stringent temperature uniformity under high power-density operation by proposing a novel liquid-cooled plate (LCP) heat sink integrating serpentine channels, cooling fins, and staggered turbulence promoters. The serpentine channel increases the contact time between the coolant and the IGBT, enhancing heat exchange, while the additional fins enlarge the heat transfer area, further improving dissipation. Additionally, various turbulence promoters are introduced into the flow channels to disrupt laminar flow and induce turbulence, thereby increasing the heat transfer coefficient and thermal exchange efficiency. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are employed to analyze the thermal performance of the LCP heat sink, and experimental comparisons are conducted to evaluate the effects of different turbulence promoter structures and distributions on temperature uniformity. Simulation results indicate that the inclusion of turbulence promoters reduces the IGBT maximum temperature from 369.48 K to 343.94 K, while the alternating arrangement of promoters significantly improves temperature uniformity, maximizing thermal performance. Experimental results indicate that increasing the coolant flow rate can lower the maximum IGBT temperature by up to 22 K, with performance stabilizing at 8.5 L/min. Moreover, when the spacing of the heat dissipation fins is 3.5 mm, the temperature of the LCP reaches its minimum, approximately 3 K lower than that observed with other spacing configurations."

    "abstract": "Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) and serverless computing are two emerging technologies that have significantly impacted their respective domains in recent years. However, their interaction remains surprisingly underexplored. In this work, through in-depth semi-structured interviews with cybersecurity experts, we identify the trust issues within the CTI ecosystem that can be exploited to introduce fake CTI manipulation, enabling indirect attacks against entities with dynamic IP allocation, such as those in serverless computing. Furthermore, these attacks can be amplified by commercial CTI platforms due to their widespread adoption and sharing mechanisms. Based on these insights, we propose Ares, a novel attack strategy that leverages fake CTI manipulation to enable large-scale, stealthy indirect denial-of-service attacks against serverless infrastructures. We demonstrate the feasibility and impact of Ares through extensive evaluations in a controlled experimental environment. Our results show that Ares can rapidly and widely disseminate fake CTI within the CTI ecosystem, leading to an overall average reject rate of 23.03% and a high reject rate of up to 45.42% when accessing top websites in certain industries, while maintaining a low detection rate across state-of-the-art serverless security systems. These findings underscore the urgent need for more frequent communication and collaboration among CTI platforms and related stakeholders to develop a more robust trustworthiness model across the ecosystem."

    "abstract": "Unsupervised visible-infrared person reidentification (US-VI-ReID) seeks to learn a cross-modality retrieval model without relying on manual annotations, thereby reducing the high cost associated with labeling. Recent large-scale vision-language pre-training models, such as CLIP, have shown significant potential in enhancing pure-vision-based person re-identification. However, existing CLIP-based US-VI-ReID methods focus on independently learning semantic information within the visible and infrared modalities. These methods overlook the mismatch between the pre-training data of CLIP and the downstream cross-modality data, resulting in substantial cross-modal semantic differences. Such inconsistent semantic information, which exhibits modality discrepancies, cannot ensure the accuracy of cross-modality associations and thus hampers the performance of cross-modality learning. To address these challenges and further explore the generalizable semantic representation across modalities in CLIP, we propose a novel framework named Mining Cross-Modality Implicit Semantic Association (MCSA), which focuses on learning a modality-invariant implicit semantic space to enhance cross-modality associations and feature learning. The proposed method comprises two key modules: Modality-invariant Prompt Learning and GCNs-Driven Collaboration Alignment. Specifically, to enable CLIP to learn modality-invariant semantics, we integrate a random color augmentation branch into the visible stream for joint contrastive learning for mining generalizable semantic representations. This ensures the color generalization of the constructed implicit semantic prompts. Moreover, within the cross-modal invariant implicit semantic space, we utilize Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to uncover more reliable cross-modal associations. By integrating information from images and semantic graphs, we jointly refine cross-modal correspondences, enabling the model to perform precise cross-modal feature learning. Extensive experiments conducted on the SYSU-MM01 and RegDB datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MCSA. The source code will be released."

    "abstract": "Medical facilities providing dialysis treatment need to strengthen their power grid resilience against blackouts to ensure continued medical services. In Japan, the number of artificial dialysis patients is increasing, and natural disasters cause blackouts annually. Then, reinforcing power grid resilience has become a critical issue for medical facilities. Typically, most of these facilities install emergency generators that are designed to only supply power to essential equipment. As a result, load suppression must be implemented, limiting their ability to provide medical services during blackouts. To address this issue, a power supply system combining a diesel generator (DG) and electric vehicles (EVs) is being considered. By optimizing the power supply from the DG and EVs, as well as coordinating EV charging, this system is anticipated to supply power to a medical facility for a longer duration without load suppression. Therefore, this paper proposes an optimization method for multiple vehicles, coordinating EV power supply and charging. The results indicate that the proposed optimization method can supply stable power to the medical facility, even under natural disasters where additional fuel cannot be supplied to the DG fuel tank, providing power for over 72 h in summer and 48 h in winter without load suppression. In Japan, there are more than 4,500 dialysis facilities, and their aggregated power demand is comparable to that of a large-scale power plant. Accordingly, the proposed operation method has substantial significance in terms of both practical feasibility and societal impact. In addition, business buildings are legally required to install emergency power generation systems. The proposed approach can contribute not only to medical facilities but also to enhancing power resilience in business buildings that utilize EVs for commercial operations or goods transportation"

The MAM aggregates multi-layer features from the vision encoder, capturing both high-level semantic information and low-level spatial details, thereby enriching the visual representation. The IEM enhances visual features through intra- and inter-modal interactions, effectively suppressing irrelevant information while amplifying task-relevant features, leading to more robust multimodal understanding. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, evaluating vMLLM across diverse settings, including different vision encoders, training dataset scales, and varying sizes of LLMs. Our results demonstrate that vMLLM consistently achieves significant performance improvements, validating its effectiveness in harnessing the potential of visual features.

Firstly, data preprocessing and feature selection are employed to significantly enhance the discriminative capability of features. Then, M1DCNN is utilized to extract multi-scale information, overcoming the limitations of traditional one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1DCNN) in handling complex features. Meanwhile, the integration of HWSCCE enables dynamic adjustment of sample weights, effectively mitigating the issue of class imbalance. The effectiveness of combining M1DCNN with HWSCCE is validated through ablation and comparative experiments. Ablation experiments demonstrate that the combined model of M1DCNN and HWSCCE achieves an mF1 of 93.07%, representing a 3.21% improvement over the baseline 1DCNN model, indicating a significant performance enhancement. In comparative experiments, the proposed model outperforms other benchmark algorithms on the collected dataset. Furthermore, generalization tests on different datasets constructed based on the IEC TC 10 dataset show that the model maintains consistently high performance, with mP, mR, and mF1 mostly exceeding 86%. The results indicate that the proposed method effectively improves the accuracy and reliability of transformer fault diagnosis, exhibits strong generalization capability, and provides robust support for the safe and stable operation of power systems."

To address this, we propose a structure-aware alignment (SAA) method that, for the first time, formulates centered kernel alignment as a trainable loss for structural alignment between domains. This approach explicitly aligns cross-domain relational structures, thereby supporting the transfer of intra-class compactness and inter-class separability from the source to the target domain for robust cross-domain matching.

    "abstract": "Neural machine translation (NMT) excels in high-resource languages but struggles with low-resource languages, such as translating Classical Chinese into modern Chinese. The scarcity of parallel corpora for translating Classical Chinese into modern Chinese is a significant challenge. Classical Chinese exhibits unique syntactic features, including omitted sentence components and interchangeable character features that hinder the translation models to precisely extract semantic features, resulting in suboptimal performance in translating Classical Chinese into modern Chinese. To address this issue, we construct a high-quality and concise parallel corpus. Based on the corpus, we propose a novel Convolutional Sequence Generative Networks (CSGN) model that explicitly fuses local and global semantic features within the transformer architecture, which differs from existing methods that typically rely on either global or local representations alone. Multiple ablation studies show that our feature fusion strategy significantly enhances the model’s ability to correlate information and improves the quality of translation compared to previous approaches."

In this paper, laminated composite insulation papers with varying cellulose nanocrystals ( CNC ) content are prepared, including a novel type of laminated composite insulation paper with CNC interlayer spraying. Based on the microstructure and pore size distribution of the insulating paper, the crack development in the interlayer structure is analyzed using fiber bridging and the Benzeggagh-Kenane criterion in fracture mechanics, with auxiliary analysis via the Page model. This reveals the synergistic effect of the interlayer structure and CNC on mechanical properties. In addition, the relationship among the pore size, porosity, and breakdown strength of the samples is established, and the dielectric properties of the samples are measured and evaluated. The constructed “fiber-CNC film-fiber” interface is analyzed from the perspective of interface traps. The results demonstrate that the introduction of the interface significantly enhances the performance of the modified paper. Specifically, the tensile strength of the sprayed insulating paper is 13.46% higher than that of ordinary laminated insulating paper. Additionally, its AC breakdown field strength is increased by 17.64%, while the DC breakdown field strength is improved by 11.63%. The multi-layer laminated structure combined with spraying technology can effectively enhance the overall performance of the insulating paper."

    "abstract": "Mining fairness in blockchain refers to equality between the computational resources invested in mining and the block rewards received. There exists a dilemma wherein increasing the transaction processing capacity of a blockchain compromises mining fairness, thereby undermining its decentralization. This dilemma remains unresolved despite methods such as the greedy heaviest observed subtree (GHOST) protocol, indicating that mining fairness is an inherent bottleneck in the transaction processing capacity of the blockchain system. However, despite its significance, existing analyses neglect the impact of blockchain forks, resulting in imprecise evaluations and limited insights. To address this issue, we propose a method for calculating mining fairness that explicitly captures the influence of forks. First, we approximate a complex blockchain network using a simple mathematical model, assuming that no more than two blocks are generated per round. Within this model, we quantitatively determine local mining fairness and derive several measures of global mining fairness based on local mining fairness. Subsequently, we validated by blockchain network simulations that our calculation method computes mining fairness in networks much more accurately than existing methods. The proposed method facilitates a rigorous evaluation of trade-offs between scalability and decentralization by offering a clear, quantitative framework for measuring and comparing reward distribution among miners. Consequently, it is expected to provide valuable insights for future mining fairness research and the design of next-generation blockchain systems."

    "abstract": "Mobile devices have penetrated our daily life, and so have the fast chargers. However, while improving users' charging efficiency, fast chargers may pose severe security threats. In this work, we present a novel side-channel attack called ChargerWhisper, which exploits the acoustic signals generated by fast chargers to infer users' private information in an on-charging mobile device. In particular, when users perform different activities on the charging device, the fast charger will supply distinct amounts of power outputs to the mobile device. By conducting a deep investigation of the fast charger circuits, we find that the electronic components, i.e., inductors, capacitors, and transformers, vibrate at certain frequencies and generate high-frequency inaudible sounds. Meanwhile, the leaked sound frequencies are highly correlated with electric intensity flowing through these electronic components (charger's output power). To demonstrate the acoustic side-channel attack leveraging fast chargers, we present two specific exploitation scenarios: a website fingerprinting attack to identify users' on-browsing websites, and a PIN inference attack to infers the device's unlock PIN. Extensive evaluations are performed on off-the-shelf devices. The results show that both attacks are robust under diverse usage settings and achieve good performance in inferring users' privacy information. These findings highlight the essential need to address unnoticed privacy leakage risks associated with fast chargers."

Existing works either rely on <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">a priori</i> knowledge of the environment and safety constraints to ensure system safety or provide assurances for a specific locomotion policy. To address these limitations, we propose an observation-conditioned reachability-based (OCR) safety-filter framework. Our key idea is to use an OCR value network (OCR-VN) that predicts the optimal control-theoretic safety value function for new failure regions and dynamic uncertainty during deployment time. Specifically, the OCR-VN facilitates rapid safety adaptation through two key components: a LiDAR-based input that allows the dynamic construction of safe regions in light of new obstacles and a disturbance estimation module that accounts for dynamics uncertainty in the wild. The predicted safety value function is used to construct an adaptive safety filter that overrides the nominal quadruped controller when necessary to maintain safety. Through simulation studies and hardware experiments on a Unitree Go1 quadruped in agile planar navigation tasks, we demonstrate that the proposed framework can automatically safeguard a wide range of hierarchical quadruped controllers, adapts to novel environments, and is robust to unmodeled dynamics <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">without a priori access to the controllers or environments</i> - hence, “One Filter to Deploy Them All”.

    "abstract": "We introduce a new class of attitude control laws for rotational systems, which generalizes the use of the Euler axis–angle representation beyond quaternion-based formulations. Using basic Lyapunov’s stability theory and the notion of extended K∞ functions, we developed a method for determining and enforcing the global asymptotic stability of the single fixed point of the resulting closed-loop (CL) scheme. In contrast with traditional quaternion-based methods, the proposed generalized axis–angle approach enables greater flexibility in the design of the control law, which is of great utility when employed in combination with a switching scheme whose transition state depends on the angular velocity of the controlled rotational system. Through simulation and real-time experimental results, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. According to the recorded data, in the execution of high-speed tumble-recovery maneuvers, the new method consistently achieves shorter stabilization times and requires lower control effort relative to those corresponding to the quaternion-based and geometric-control methods used as benchmarks."

    "abstract": "Beamforming plays a crucial role in millimeter wave (mmWave) communication systems to mitigate the severe attenuation inherent to this spectrum. However, the use of large active antenna arrays in conventional architectures often results in high implementation costs and excessive power consumption, limiting their practicality. As an alternative, deploying large arrays at transceivers using passive devices, such as reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), offers a more cost-effective and energy-efficient solution. In this paper, we investigate a promising base station (BS) architecture that integrates a beyond diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) within the BS to enable passive beamforming. By utilizing Takagi’s decomposition and leveraging the effective beamforming vector, the RIS profile can be designed to enable passive beamforming directed toward the target. Through the beamforming analysis, we reveal that BD-RIS provides robust beamforming performance across various system configurations, whereas the traditional diagonal RIS (D-RIS) exhibits instability with increasing RIS size and decreasing BS-RIS separation-two critical factors in optimizing RIS-assisted systems. Comprehensive computer simulation results across various aspects validate the superiority of the proposed BS-integrated BD-RIS over conventional D-RIS architectures, showcasing performance comparable to active analog beamforming antenna arrays."

    "abstract": "The rapid development of intelligent transportation systems has led to the generation of massive vehicular data from onboard sensors, GPS devices, and driving logs, paving the way for advanced driver behavior profiling. To extract insights from such data, clustering techniques, particularly k-means, are widely employed. However, traditional centralized k-means clustering for driving behavior analysis poses potential privacy leakage, as raw features are transmitted to the cloud server in plaintext. Existing privacy-preserving k-means schemes either rely on interactive homomorphic encryption protocols, which incur significant communication overhead, or adopt differential privacy, which reduces accuracy due to noise injection. To address these challenges, we propose <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">PPKC</b>, a non-interactive privacy-preserving k-means clustering framework tailored for vehicular driving behavior analysis. PPKC leverages an improved Paillier cryptosystem with a three- modulus construction, enabling secure Euclidean distance computation and cluster center updates directly over ciphertexts without decryption or repeated interaction with data owners. Each vehicle only uploads a single round of encrypted feature vectors, after which the cloud server can independently execute the complete k-means clustering process. We rigorously analyze the security of PPKC, proving its semantic security and indistinguishability under the IND-CCA assumption with unforgeable digital signatures. Extensive experiments on the highD dataset demonstrate that PPKC achieves high clustering accuracy with significantly lower communication and computation overhead than existing protocols."

Unified management of network and compute fabrics is crucial for achieving seamless service delivery, end-to-end power efficiency, and delay guarantees, while resiliency becomes a key enabler for adapting to various application demands and diverse network segment conditions. In this context, this paper proposes a unified framework for dependable wireless EC networks that jointly addresses the problems of RAN selection and Service Function Chain (SFC) embedding to minimize the total power consumption across network segments under end-to-end delay SFC deployment constraints. The framework iteratively solves these problems, considering the interdependencies between RAN ingress points and the EC network resource constraints. To deal with the high dimensionality of the considered parameters and achieve timely and scalable decision-making, a coalition formation game optimizes RAN selection, while a delay-aware heuristic approach undertakes the power-efficient embedding of multiple SFCs within the EC network. Simulation results demonstrate the framework’s efficiency in reducing power consumption compared to segment-specific approaches, highlighting the importance of cross-segment dependencies. Also, the adaptability of the proposed unified modeling and the framework’s scalability are demonstrated, ensuring resilient performance under varying network parameter settings."

The IC integrates on-chip classification capabilities for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) based on photo-plethysmogram (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG), along with hazardous gas analysis. For low-power multimodal sensing, an ECG R-peak_triggered PPG window (RPT-PW) is proposed as an inter-sensor scheme to reduce activity on the PPG channel, which is the dominant energy consumer. Additionally, the PPG and ECG readout channels incorporate analog peak detection to enable normalized on-chip extraction of pulse arrival time (PAT) and R-R interval (RRI). For minimal computation and communication power, a multi-domain convolutional neural network (MD-CNN) processes both analog and digital inputs, and a reconfigurable analog ternary/binarized neural network (a-TNN/BNN) provides additional computation capability for multi-domain applications. The IC was fabricated in an 180-nm BCD process and integrated into a chest patch device prototype with an in-house adhesive meta patch. The RPT-PW demonstrated adaptive operation with an effective LED duty cycle (EDC) as low as 0.02%. The on-chip computation achieved average sensitivity and specificity of 90.87%/95.38% for three-label hypertension, 92.80%/96.36% for three-label arrhythmia, and 92.46%/97.50% for four-label gas mixture classification."

    "abstract": "An approach for simultaneous adaptive multichannel radio frequency (RF) self-interference cancellation (SIC) and fiber transmission (FT) is proposed and demonstrated for in-band full-duplex (IBFD) radio-over-fiber (ROF) systems with array antennas (AAs). The key enabler for these multifunctional capabilities without additional system complexity is the combined use of optical carrier phase-shifted phase modulation (CPS-PM) and a varied-order lattice recursive least square (VO-LRLS) algorithm. By controlling the optical carrier phase of the CPS-PM signal, power fading of the signal of interest (SOI) induced by fiber dispersion can be compensated. Through photonic polarization multiplexing, the modulated multichannel self-interference (SI) received by the AA and reference (REF) signals is transmitted via fiber to the central station (CS) for digital-domain self-interference cancellation (DSIC). The VO-lattice recursive least square (LRLS) algorithm is employed to track the response of the multichannel SI, thereby overcoming the difficulty of reconstructing multichannel analog reference signals for SIC with high complexity in FT and AA scenarios. It also addresses the issue of digital filter order selection under changing wireless conditions. Experimental results show a cancellation depth of 30.16 dB for a 2-GHz frequency comb signal centered at 2.5 GHz, using four transmitted elements and one received element. The superior channel order search performance of the VO-LRLS filter is also verified. Furthermore, compared to the same-criterion filters, such as LS, RLS, and FTRLS with variable orders, the proposed algorithm reduces computational effort by 99.99%, 98.98%, and 61.91%, respectively."

    "abstract": "Combining three-phase power converters in parallel is a practical approach to enhance required power ratings in distribution power networks. However, when these converters are not identical, the configuration can lead to circulating currents (CCs) among the converters and challenges in managing undesirable power output under three-phase unbalanced operating conditions. This work proposes a solution for parallel-connected three-phase Neutral Point Clamped (NPC) converters, aiming to mitigate CCs while ensuring precise power sharing. The study begins by examining the impact of pulse width modulation (PWM) on reducing high-frequency zero-sequence circulating currents (ZSCC) and common-mode voltage in multiple parallel three-level NPC converters. Analytical expressions for circulating currents are derived, and two carrier-based modulation (CBM) techniques are evaluated using double Fourier integral analysis. To address low-frequency ZSCC, a comprehensive control scheme is introduced, incorporating proportional-integral-resonant (PIR) current controllers with zero-sequence voltage injection and a feed-forward decoupling mechanism. Additionally, communication-enabled virtual synchronous generator (VSG) control with virtual impedance adjustments is integrated to meet the dynamic requirements of microgrid applications. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through numerical simulations and hardware experiments, demonstrating its capability to achieve stable and efficient operations in parallel-connected NPC converter systems."

    "abstract": "Timely and accurate detection of Earth surface anomalies (ESAs) using single-temporal remote sensing data is critical for early warning and rapid emergency response. However, existing algorithms are designed mostly for specific ESA categories and suffer from ambiguous decision boundaries between anomalous and normal instances. Therefore, this study proposes a novel unified ESA detection model based on historical steady-state priors that quantify feature deviations as detection indicators, with enhanced discrimination achieved by amplifying the separation between anomalies and the normal Earth surface. First, an enhanced hyperbolic space network is developed, which can represent high-dimensional complex data in lower-dimensional spaces by capturing hierarchical structures in images, thereby extracting richer features from remote sensing imagery. Then, these extracted features are aggregated under semantic guidance to construct the historical steady-state prior that characterizes normal Earth surface patterns, which is represented by a lightweight prototype set. Next, to further improve the representativeness of the steady-state prior, a semantic augmented contrastive clustering (SACC) module is introduced to refine the prototype set by reducing intra-class variability and increasing inter-class separability. Finally, leveraging the geometric property of hyperbolic space which amplifies feature differences, a hyperbolic distance-based anomaly scoring function is proposed to quantify the anomaly level of test samples by measuring the hyperbolic distance between their feature representations and prototypes in prototype set. This enables accurate ESA detection from single-temporal remote sensing image. The results indicate that the proposed method outperforms the currently popular methods in both accuracy and robustness and has potential for on-orbit deployment and applications.

    "abstract": "High-resolution land cover mapping is vital for global challenges such as urban planning, environmental monitoring, disaster response, and sustainable development. Yet, building accurate large-scale datasets remains difficult due to complex terrain, multimodal sensor data, and varying atmospheric conditions. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR), with its cloud-penetrating, all-weather, and day-and-night imaging capabilities, provides a unique advantage, but progress has been hindered by the lack of tailored benchmark datasets. In this article, we introduce OpenEarthMap-SAR, a large-scale benchmark dataset for high-resolution land cover mapping using SAR imagery. OpenEarthMap-SAR includes 1.5 million segments across 5,033 aerial and satellite images (1,024 × 1,024 pixels) from 35 regions in Japan, France, and the United States. It features partially manually annotated and fully pseudo-labeled eight-class land cover labels at a ground sampling distance (GSD) of 0.15–0.5 m. We evaluate state-of-the-art semantic segmentation, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), and Image2Image/Label2Image translation methods and propose challenging benchmark settings to foster future development. OpenEarthMap-SAR also serves as the official dataset for track 1 of the IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society (GRSS) Data Fusion Contest, specifically for the task of semantic segmentation.

The stochastic nature of space data arrivals and the intrinsically time-varying satellite-ground links in LSNs pose significant challenges for offloading substantial volumes of space data from LSNs to the ground stations. To overcome these challenges, we systematically study the joint online optimization of power allocation and task scheduling for data offloading in LSNs. Firstly, we remove the constraint of mean rate queue stability from the formulated joint online optimization problem and leverage Lyapunov optimization to decouple it into a set of per-time-slot subproblems. Each subproblem is then divided into a task scheduling problem and a power allocation problem. Subsequently, we derive a closed-form optimal solution for the power allocation problem, and a multi-armed bandit-based quasi-optimal solution for the task scheduling problem. Furthermore, we extend the aforementioned solutions to address the original joint online optimization problem. Through theoretical analyses, we show that the proposed algorithms consistently attain a sublinear time-averaged regret. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithms exhibit superior performance over other benchmarks."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a two-stage linear least squares (LS) approach for estimating the parameters of a battery equivalent circuit model (ECM) using a simple pulse-relaxation excitation. Unlike conventional approaches that require long relaxation periods or pre-characterized open-circuit voltage (OCV) models to determine the battery OCV, the proposed approach jointly estimates the OCV and the ECM parameters directly from the input-output response. The estimation process is carried out in two sequential LS stages: the first stage estimates the RC time constant from the voltage relaxation response, and the second stage uses the estimated time constant and the entire pulse-relaxation response to estimate the remaining ECM parameters including OCV. A key theoretical contribution is the derivation and Monte Carlo validation of the Cramér–Rao lower bounds for both stages, establishing the lower bound on estimation performance. Using simulations and a newly introduced metric, the rest-to-time-constant ratio, we provide a generalized analytical insights into how signal-to-noise ratio, sampling rate, and the pulse characteristics impact estimation accuracy. The results reveal important principles for excitation signal design in battery ECM parameter estimation, a topic often overlooked in the literature. Finally, experimental validation on a cylindrical Li-ion cell demonstrates that the two-stage LS approach achieves less than 1% relative voltage fitting error over the typical battery operational range."

    "abstract": "Forest tree species classification using remote sensing data often faces the challenge of limited labeled samples, which hampers the performance of deep learning models. While few-shot learning techniques, such as Prototypical Networks (PNet), show promise, overfitting remains a significant issue. Given the relatively low cost of acquiring unlabeled data, semisupervised learning offers a potential solution. However, due to class imbalance, pseudo-labels based on fixed confidence thresholds tend to favor majority classes, leading to lower classification accuracy for minority classes.To address this, we propose a novel semi-supervised few-shot classification model, Class-Wise Pseudo-Labeling Squeeze-and-Excitation PNet (CWPL-SEPNet). The model incorporates a channel attention module into the PNet backbone and employs a class-wise adaptive pseudo-labeling mechanism based on quantile thresholds. This approach balances the pseudo-labeled samples and reduces bias toward majority classes.Experiments conducted using Sentinel-2 imagery in Pu'er City, China, show that incorporating unlabeled data increases the overall classification accuracy to 95.14%, with per-class accuracies of 91.82% for Tea Farm, 90.19% for Oak, 94.70% for Eucalyptus, and 94.64% for Pinus kesiya. The CWPL strategy significantly outperforms traditional fixed-threshold methods, particularly in handling class imbalance and improving classification accuracy for minority classes. Compared to baseline methods such as TPNsemi, PNet, Random Forest, and SVM, CWPL-SEPNet excels in overall accuracy, average accuracy, and Kappa value. Furthermore, the model was validated on three publicly available remote sensing datasets.CWPL-SEPNet provides a robust and efficient classification solution under few-shot conditions, offering an effective approach for tree species classification using remote sensing data."

This paper develops a data-driven framework to characterize, detect, and cluster Volt-VAR control events and responses using data from measurement units, which are typically not yet widely available at the distribution level. To this end, a gradient estimation-based wavelet transform is utilized to extract distinctive multiscale signatures from measurement data corresponding to Volt-VAR control actions, effectively capturing both slow-varying and fast-transient dynamics. Furthermore, an event detection framework is introduced to identify relevant time windows within the data stream, facilitating the isolation of segments associated with potential control actions for subsequent analysis. Finally, a hierarchical clustering algorithm is used to group the potential types of Volt-VAR events and actions, which is a key step toward automated root cause analysis. Detailed computer simulations and lab-scale experiments on a testbed integrating <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">real-world</i> components—such as a full-scale secondary substation, power hardware-in-the-loop with a three-phase inverter, physical cabling, and communication protocols—validate the proposed methodology.

    "abstract": "With the extensive application of unmanned vehicles and drones in logistics, inspection, and other scenarios, the planning and decision-making capabilities of consumer unmanned electronic systems have attracted significant research attention. When multiple performance indicators are considered simultaneously, the decision-making process transforms into a multi-objective optimization problem. In such problems, a single optimal solution typically does not exist; instead, decision-makers are presented with a set of Pareto optimal solutions, commonly referred to as the solution pool. However, the size of this solution pool grows exponentially with the number of objectives, making manual management impractical. Consequently, there is an increasing demand for effective methods to extract a small subset of representative solutions from the pool to enable effective and manageable decision-making. Motivated by this challenge, this paper proposes a pruning method for the Pareto optimal set based on the Borda count. The method first determines the optimal size of the representative subset using a diversity metric, followed by the establishment of preference rankings to identify representative solutions. This study first takes into account the inherent conflict among objectives and provides a theoretical analysis of the optimality of the Borda count method from the perspective of the probability of the Condorcet paradox. It demonstrates that this method minimizes errors arising from preference aggregation when multiple objective functions are considered. Subsequently, simulations on 12 test instances confirm the significant advantages of the two pruning frameworks proposed in this paper over the two existing methods."

A generalized CFD model is developed to investigate the CHTCs of cavity surfaces, considering end-space geometry, surface roughness, and rotor speed, and the results are compared with widely used empirical correlations. Sensitivity analyses are performed to assess the effect of CHTC uncertainties on the thermal performances, focusing on critical winding and magnet temperatures. It is found that in FSCW TE-PMSMs with smooth rotor ends and no internal cooling, the end-space cavity-surface CHTCs are strongly influenced by end-space geometry and may exhibit exponential saturation with increasing rotor speed, depending on the end-space length. Additionally, uncertainties in CHTC predictions can significantly affect the thermal performances, especially in high torque/speed regions. A prototype is manufactured for experimental validation under different cooling and load conditions, and the results show good agreement with the numerical predictions."

However, the limitations of clinical data have hindered extensive research in this area. While deep learning has shown superior performance over traditional machine learning, its reliance on large-scale annotated datasets and vulnerability to catastrophic forgetting during incremental learning remain notable challenges. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel Continual Learning framework, PCG-CL, which incorporates training strategy and is built upon a lightweight deep network (0.61M parameters) augmented with a single-head Transformer. This design enables the coordinated facilitation of global and local features, improving the recognition of heart sound characteristics, while enabling adaptive knowledge retention as clinical data expands incrementally. Additionally, inspired by curriculum learning, this paper categorizes data based on varying levels of difficulty and trains them sequentially to facilitate knowledge transfer between tasks. Evaluations on clinical PCG data show that PCG-CL achieves an accuracy of 94.52%, outperforming MobileNetV2 by 8.19%, while using only 27% of the parameters of MobileNetV2. These findings help address the challenges of the clinical diagnostic gray zone for HFpEF, providing a promising solution for clinical practice."

Finite-element modelling is performed to compare induction motors (IMs), synchronous reluctance motors (SyRMs), and PMaSyRMs under identical design constraints, demonstrating the PMaSyRM's superior power factor and efficiency.

We introduce a paradigm shift: enabling an ultra-compact, artifact-tolerant readout frontend by permitting brief saturation during stimulation pulses and applying backend interpolation to reconstruct the signals. High-fidelity neural features can thus be extracted with minimal error.

    "abstract": "Accurate and convenient assessment for state of health (SOH) plays crucial role in the safe and efficient operation of lithium-ion battery. In fact, owing to the randomness of working conditions and user habits, the collected charge-discharge data are always fragmented in practice, which makes it difficult to apply the traditional complete data-based method to estimate SOH. How to use fragmented data to scientifically, quickly and accurately assess SOH is a challenging task. Hence, an innovative SOH definition method based on fragmented charging data is proposed, which respectively uses fragmented charging capacity of the current and the first cycle as molecular and denominator to characterize SOH. By segmenting the charging voltage intervals and extracting corresponding capacity features for combination, an efficient, rapid, and flexible evaluation is achieved. The theoretical basis of this method is the high correlation between capacity characteristics in voltage interval and battery overall degradation. The complete charging data and time-consuming estimation process are not required in the redefined SOH, which can directly characterize battery health status. To prove the effectiveness, hundreds of thousands of samples are collected and utilized from 20 LIB cells produced by 5 different manufacturers. Compared with traditional methods, the average test time is reduced by 59% and the evaluation error is less than 4.51%. More importantly, the feasibility and robustness of the proposed method are verified by the actual EV charge-discharge data."

    "abstract": "Aiming to extend the speed range of E-core outer-rotor permanent magnet flux-switching (OR-PMFS) machine, two derived structures are proposed in this paper from the perspective of winding reconfiguration. Distinguished by the characteristics of introduced winding, the mechanism of winding reconfiguration is investigated and outer-rotor dual-armature flux-switching (OR-DAFS) machine and outer-rotor hybrid-excitation flux-switching (OR-HEFS) machine are developed respectively. With the aid of general air-gap field modulation theory, the speed range extension principles are revealed for two derived topologies. On this basis, a thorough comparison is put forward among the initial OR-PMFS machine, the proposed OR-DAFS machine and the OR-HEFS machine. Particular emphasis is placed on the output torque and the speed range extension capabilities, and advantages and disadvantages are summarized in this process. Compared to the initial OR-PMFS machine, the proposed OR-DAFS machine could achieve a great balance between output torque and speed range, while the speed regulation capability of OR-HEFS machine is more remarkable and its speed range is much wider. The prototype experiment is carried out for both OR-DAFS machine and OR-HEFS machine, and the overall performance is concluded to visualize the outcome of this paper."

Instead of assuming particular touch gestures are caring, we explored the application of the sensing and analysing system to characterise a caring quality of touch across different gestures. We were able to characterise distinctive features for touch aimed for sensory aspects and for moving the body. Our findings demonstrate that caring touch is not limited to specific gestures or a single parameter but is rather characterised by how the touch is performed across multiple features, with deliberateness - the careful and smoothness in the increasing and decreasing of force, emerging as a shared characteristic of caring touch regardless of the specific gesture employed. The study also demonstrates the feasibility of using raw tactile sensor data to assess subjective touch quality."

To alleviate this issue, the present study develops a scheme with integrated tri-modality on-train sensor and an improved evidence-theoretic fusion. The integrated sensor can simultaneously leverage data from camera, Infrared imaging sensoR (IR) and Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR). The evidence-theoretic fusion is improved to avoid evidence conflict by proposing a Kernelled Belief Cosine Distance (KBCD) as a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS)-based modality credibility measure. As far as the authors learn, the evidence theory is also first bridged to train-mounted rail clearance intrusion detection. Experiments verify the effectiveness of leveraging tri-modality sensor and evidence-theoretic fusion in on-train rail clearance intrusion inspection."

    "abstract": "Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-enabled systems have been widely considered as one of the revolutionary technologies for the new generation of communications. In particular, RIS-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications have come at the forefront of research, yet there is still lack of supportive channel measurements and modeling in real environments. Against this background, this paper conducts multi-frequency and multi-scenario channel measurements and channel modeling for RIS-assisted MIMO communication systems. Utilizing a temporal autocorrelation-based channel sounder and the fabricated RISs, the virtual RIS-assisted MIMO channels are realized by successively moving the transceiver antennas on movable rotary tables. The channel realizations are collected in indoor hotspot (InH) and urban microcellular (UMi) scenarios at sub-6 GHz and millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency bands, respectively, where various communication states, different coding schemes of the RIS, as well as with and without RIS deployment are fully considered. Based on the measured channel realizations, critical channel metrics including the signal power, effective rank, spectral efficiency (SE), root-mean-square delay-spread (RMS DS), Ricean <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">K</i>-factor (KF), spatial correlation, etc., are illustrated and compared under different coding schemes, communication states, deployment scenarios, and frequency bands. The measurement results indicate that the coding scheme of the RIS significantly impacts the channel performance, while the capability of RIS to customize the channel is strongly related to the power intensity it provides. Deploying an RIS with energy-focused coding can provide significant signal power gains for non-line-of-sight (NLoS) links and spatial multiplexing gains for line-of-sight (LoS) and obstructed-line-of-sight (OLoS) links, thereby greatly improving the SE. Moreover, it is found that under different communication states, such as RIS-assisted NLoS/LoS/OLoS links, the influence imposed by RIS on the channel metrics could be completely opposite, especially for the KF, RMS DS, and effective rank. In addition, after the RIS deployment with a beamforming mode, the spatial correlation in the NLoS and LoS MIMO channels significantly increases and decreases, respectively. Furthermore, it is verified that the Weichselberger model can provide a satisfactory prediction accuracy on the SE of RIS-assisted MIMO channels, while the Kronecker model underestimates it."

    "abstract": "The Superconducting Electrodynamic Suspension (EDS) is one of the most promising technologies for developing an ultra-high-speed maglev due to its special advantages. The superconducting coil (SC), which generates the force source for the EDS, is one of the key components. Improving the SC supporting characteristics, such as stiffness and damping, is an unavoidable challenge for enhancing the reliability and durability of the SC under long-term operation. Therefore, this article establishes a 3-D transient dynamic finite element model (FEM) to investigate the SC supporting characteristics. In this model, the frictional heat generation between the SC and the coil box is considered. Firstly, the modeling method is verified by the One-Degree-of-Freedom (ODOF) vibration system, incorporating damping and friction. Secondly, the time-varying loads of suspension, guidance, and drag of 600 km/h are calculated based on dynamic-circuit theory and the virtual displacement method, and the stiffness of a self-developed SC support structure is tested. Thirdly, based on the validated modeling method, the calculated time-varying loads, and the tested stiffness, the 3-D FEM of the SC is established. The dynamic response of the SC is estimated by the 3-D model, further, the support stiffness and damping are optimized. Finally, the influence of friction coefficient on friction energy between the SC and coil box is investigated."

    "abstract": "Data-driven intelligent diagnosis methods for aerospace electro-hydraulic actuators (EHA) under few-shot conditions have achieved some progress. However, most approaches rely on a closed-set assumption, constructing diagnostic models solely for known fault categories while neglecting the occurrence of open-set scenarios involving unknown fault types during actual operation. This severely limits the algorithms' generalization capability and practical applicability. Aiming at this key issue, this paper proposes a small-sample fault diagnosis method for EHA that integrates graph convolutional contrast learning with unknown category perception mechanism (GCN-CN) of open-set data. The method introduces a cross-state difference-driven contrast learning strategy through graph convolutional neural networks, and constructs a Kullback-leibler scatter edge feature matrix fusing time-frequency features during the graph construction process, in order to enhance the network's ability of recognizing sample differences. On this basis, an unknown fault recognition mechanism based on the similarity distribution characteristics is designed to realize the effective discrimination of whether the input samples belong to an unknown fault category. Experimental results show that the proposed diagnostic network structure can still achieve excellent diagnostic performance while reducing the data volume requirement, and the fault diagnosis accuracy can reach over 99%. Meanwhile, the proposed fault category diagnosis mechanism can achieve more than 80% diagnosis accuracy for unforeseen fault types."

    "abstract": "Segmenting medical images accurately is crucial for disease prevention and treatment. Despite the significant progress of deep learning techniques in semi-supervised segmentation, they still face the inability to effectively identify and utilize ambiguous regions with high predictive volatility in practical applications. Considering that ambiguous regions in unlabeled data contain more informative complementary cues, this article proposes an innovative ambiguous focusing and correction (AFoCo) framework. AFoCo consists of two parallel and complementary networks: the ambiguous focus and the ambiguous correction network. The ambiguous focus network combines historical change prediction and instantaneous information entropy to compute ambiguity indices and accurately capture ambiguous regions. Meanwhile, the ambiguous correction network utilizes the identified deterministic information to redistribute the pixel labels of the ambiguous region through the weight-weighted similarity strategy, thus effectively alleviating prediction volatility in ambiguous areas. Furthermore, we propose a task-aware asymmetric cross-supervision constraint, which assigns differentiated cross-pseudo supervision signals based on the task-specific characteristics of the two networks. By leveraging a consistency constraint, it enhances global prediction stability, ensuring precise ambiguous region focusing and high-quality feature rectification. The experimental results show that AFoCo performs better than other SOTA techniques on four medical image datasets, significantly improving the segmentation accuracy and effectively reducing the proportion of ambiguous regions."

    "abstract": "The monitoring of global soil moisture is crucial for understanding the hydrological cycle and managing terrestrial water resources. The Chinese-French Oceanography Satellite (CFOSAT), equipped with the first sector-beam rotary scanning microwave scatterometer (CSCAT), provides a novel opportunity for global soil moisture mapping. However, the capability of CFOSAT's Ku-band for soil moisture retrieval remains underexplored and lacks systematic evaluation. In this study, an Adaptive Backscatter Change Tracking (ABCT) algorithm is designed to retrieve absolute soil moisture from CFOSAT's CSCAT measurements. The ABCT algorithm assumes a stable roughness, where changes in backscattering are primarily attributed to soil moisture variation based on a logarithmic relationship. It incorporates a vegetation influence coefficient, which quantifies how vegetation impacts the backscatter signal This coefficient adaptively scales with changes in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to adjust the backscattering appropriately to include the effect of vegetation growth or decay. This allows the algorithm to isolate changes in the backscatter signal that are due to soil moisture while minimizing the false readings from vegetation growth or wilting. The CFOSAT ABCT algorithm's performance was evaluated against extensive in-situ soil moisture data, demonstrating a robust correlation, with the Vertical-Vertical Polarization Ascending Orbit (VV Asc) result showing the highest accuracy, indicated by Pearson's correlation coefficient (R) of 0.68 and unbiased root mean squared error (ubRMSE) of 0.057 m3/m3. Comparative analysis with the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) data revealed that, while the ABCT algorithm's correlation was slightly lower than that of the official EUMETSAT H SAF product, it notably improved the bias and ubRMSE metrics. This study underscores that the CFOSAT ABCT soil moisture retrieval algorithm and product are a valuable addition to global soil moisture mapping, complementing existing satellite missions or sensors such as SMAP, SMOS, ASCAT, AMSR2 and FY-3/MWRI."

    "abstract": "Solar photovoltaic (PV) power plants play a critical role in clean energy generation, but their performance is often compromised by partial shading, dust, aging, and open-circuited bypass or antiparallel diodes. Timely detection of such faults is essential to prevent power losses, reduce downtime, and ensure safe operation. This paper presents SPARK (Solar Panel Analyzing and Recording Kit), a low-cost and practical framework for the real-time diagnostics and performance evaluation of solar PV panels. Unlike conventional approaches that require multiple current and voltage sensors, the proposed SPARK system employs a voltage-based diagnostic technique that significantly reduces sensor count and overall cost. A switching circuit with insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) and a minimal set of Hall-effect voltage sensors is designed to sequentially monitor the voltages of multiple panels in an array. The system integrates irradiance and temperature sensors, whose data, along with measured voltages, are processed by an ATmega-based controller running the proposed diagnostic algorithm. The algorithm estimates panel voltages under given conditions and compares them with measured values against adaptive thresholds to classify panels as normal, partially shaded, physically damaged, or faulty due to open-circuited antiparallel diodes. The hardware implementation is validated on a 2 kW rooftop PV plant consisting of six panels in two strings, with experimental testing under no-load and load conditions. Results confirm that SPARK accurately identifies normal and abnormal conditions, with LED indicators providing intuitive fault visualization. The proposed system offers a compact, scalable, and effective solution for condition monitoring of solar PV arrays in practical applications. Sensitivity and robustness analyses were conducted to ensure dependable fault detection across varying environmental and operational conditions."

    "abstract": "With the rise of mega-satellite constellations, the integration of hierarchical non-terrestrial and terrestrial networks has become a cornerstone of 6G coverage enhancements. In these hierarchical satellite networks, controllers manage satellite switches within their assigned domains. However, the high mobility of LEO satellites and field-of-view (FOV) constraints pose fundamental challenges to efficient domain partitioning. Centralized control approaches face scalability bottlenecks, while distributed architectures with onboard controllers often disregard FOV limitations, leading to excessive signaling overhead. LEO satellites outside a controller’s FOV require an average of five additional hops, resulting in a 10.6-fold increase in response time. To address these challenges, we propose Eunomia, a three-step domain-partitioning framework that leverages movement-aware FOV segmentation within a hybrid control plane combining ground stations and MEO satellites. Eunomia reduces control plane latency by constraining domains to FOV-aware regions and ensures single-hop signaling. It further balances traffic load through spectral clustering on a Control Overhead Relationship Graph and optimizes controller assignment via the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm. We implement Eunomia on the Plotinus emulation platform with realistic constellation parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that Eunomia reduces request loss by up to 58.3%, control overhead by up to 50.3%, and algorithm execution time by 77.7%, significantly outperforming current state-of-the-art solutions."

    "abstract": "Distributed stream processing has recently gained much interest due to the need of extracting meaningful results from continuous data stream. To keep the extracted results fresh, the underlying network flows are often required to transmit packets continuously. Otherwise, these results will become stale, and their staleness is determined by the slowest flow. At this point, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">coflows</i> can be semantically comprised. Hence, efficient coflow transmission is critical for streaming applications. However, prior coflow-based solutions have significant limitations. They use a one-shot performance metric—CCT (coflow completion time), which cannot continuously reflect the staleness of the output results for a streaming application. To this end, we propose a new performance metric—<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">coflow age</i> (CA), for coflows generated by distributed streaming applications. The CA tracks the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">longest time-since-last-service</i> among all flows in a coflow. In such a context, we consider a data center network with multiple coflows that continuously transmit packets between their source-destination pairs and address the problem of minimizing the average long-term CA while simultaneously satisfying the throughput constraints from the coflows. To solve this problem efficiently, we design a randomized algorithm and a drift-plus-age algorithm, and show that they can make the average long-term CA to achieve nearly two times and arbitrarily close to the optimal value, respectively. Through extensive simulations, we further demonstrate that both of the proposed algorithms can significantly reduce the CA of coflows, without violating the throughput requirement of any coflow, when compared to the state-of-the-art solution in both scenario with the packet arrival probability being known and unknown a prior."

    "abstract": "Feature alignment is crucial in remote sensing change detection, as it enhances detection accuracy by mitigating feature inconsistencies and suppressing appearance discrepancies between bi-temporal images. However, existing single-shot alignment strategies often fail to accurately model the complex, non-linear feature mappings that arise from variations in perspective, illumination, and season. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an innovative framework based on frame sequence construction and progressive feature alignment. The framework first generates a smooth sequence of intermediate frames from the bi-temporal image pair via linear interpolation to explicitly model the dynamic evolution of regions of interest. Based on this sequence, we design the Progressive Feature Alignment Network (PFAN), which adopts a frame-by-frame iterative alignment strategy to decompose the complex, long-span non-linear mapping in feature space into a series of multi-stage local optimizations. This strategy is synergistically realized by two core modules: a Feature Alignment (FA) module, which performs precise alignment of features in each iteration through an adaptive cross-frame mechanism, and a parallel Feature Enhancement (FE) module, which reinforces the feature stability of unchanged regions to suppress appearance-based interference. Finally, a temporal difference fusion strategy aggregates the aligned and enhanced features to generate a high-reliability binary change map. Evaluations on the LEVIR-CD, CDD, and WHU-CD datasets demonstrate that the proposed PFAN outperforms state-of-the-art models."

However, identifying patterns in attack incidents and quantifying them remains highly challenging. Without this capability, predicting the attacker’s next action becomes difficult, thereby hindering proactive defense. The key challenge lies in discovering unique correlations among attack behaviors. In this study, we employ an embedding model to uncover and quantify relationships between attack activities. By managing these relationships through clustering, we were able to predict subsequent attacker behaviors. Furthermore, we propose an advanced attack-group identification framework by detecting attack patterns and integrating them with existing methodologies. The proposed approach achieved 91.73% accuracy in predicting the attacker’s next action and demonstrated 93.49% accuracy in identifying attack groups. Additionally, we present two use cases to illustrate the practical applicability of our methodology. Through this research, we aim to pave the way for next-generation intrusion response technologies."

    "abstract": "Most existing domain generalization methods for fault diagnosis focus on extracting domain-invariant features from multiple source domains. However, the lack of target data severely restricts these domain-invariant features to only the source domain distribution, leading to inadequate generalization performance under unseen working conditions. To address this critical limitation, we propose a novel method named domain information removal with decision region enlargement. Specifically, for domain information elimination, we design dual encoders and dual classifiers to separately extract and classify fault-related features and domain-related features. A distribution discriminator is then introduced to minimize the mutual information between fault-features and domain-features, thereby yielding purer fault-discriminative representations. To further enhance the discriminability of fault features, learnable comparative anchors are employed to strengthen intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. This process clarifies the decision region for each fault category, enabling more robust adaptation to accurate identification of diverse faults in the target domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method."

Remote education platforms face increasing demands for low latency, personalization, and scalability across diverse and resource-constrained infrastructures. Conventional scheduling and orchestration methods often lack responsiveness, adaptability, and contextual awareness due to rigid optimization models and centralized architectures. To address these limitations, this study introduces a decentralized framework comprising a Spatiotemporal Federated Edge Learning Network (S-FELN) and a Context-Aware Multiscale Orchestration Protocol (CAMP). S-FELN combines federated learning with attention-based mechanisms to dynamically prioritize learner tasks and enable personalized inference under stringent real-time constraints. CAMP employs reinforcement learning to optimize task offloading, semantic fidelity, and synchronization by leveraging contextual factors such as learner engagement, device conditions, and edge congestion. Experimental evaluations in simulated environments reveal substantial improvements in latency reduction, workload distribution, and engagement-aware content delivery. This framework provides a scalable and intelligent edge-native solution, aligning with the objectives of immersive and distributed computing systems central to contemporary computer science research."

Deploying a UAV swarm as aerial base stations requires simultaneously optimizing three-dimensional positions and discrete sub-channel assignments. The main challenge lies in the strong coupling between continuous 3D deployment variables and discrete spectrum decisions, compounded by severe co-channel interference under limited spectrum resources. We propose a distributed alternating optimization (AO) framework that decomposes the joint problem into two coordinated sub-problems. First, with fixed channels, a position-refinement phase exploits a constrained action space and adaptive exploration to maximize spatial coverage. Then, at fixed positions, a channel-allocation phase leverages spatial-separation principles and neighbor-aware interference metrics to suppress co-channel interference. An outer AO loop iterates these phases, while binary log-linear learning (BLLL) is embedded to escape local optima. The propagation path loss data used in the algorithm is calculated by IRT to ensure precision. The superiority of IRT is verified through comparison with various wave propagation models, and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by comparing it against different optimization algorithms."

To achieve efficient and accurate medical image analysis, we propose Shared Attention Vision Transformer (SAViT) that comprises three innovative modules: i) Shared Prior Attention (SPA) that enhances data efficiency by innovatively employing a visual prompt to sequentially share consistent attention weights across local image regions, thereby enabling the learning of translational invariance to capture locality; ii) MixPool that preserves global modeling ability by aggregating local features after SPA through a multi-pooling mechanism, thus effectively facilitating long-range dependency across local image regions; and iii) Low-rank Multi-head Self-Attention (Lr-MSA) that improves parameter efficiency by using low-rank weights of multi-head self-attention, hence reducing computational complexity while maintaining accuracy in medical image analysis. SAViT demonstrates strong generalization across multiple medical imaging modalities, including retinopathy, dermoscopy, and radiography. Extensive experiments are conducted. The results indicate its high data efficiency and outstanding performance in comparison with more than 20 medical-specific and ViT-based models when all of them are trained from scratch. It excels in parameter-efficient tuning by surpassing 17 models across 6 datasets in transfer learning, with only 0.17M/0.23M trainable parameters on ViT-B/SwinViT-B backbones requiring 86.60M/88.00M parameters.

For example, the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) compartment model is foundational for population epidemiological modeling and has been implemented in several prior Petri Net studies. While the SIR model is typically expressed as Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), with continuous time and variables, Petri Nets operate as discrete event simulations with deterministic or stochastic timings. We present the first systematic study of the numerical convergence of two distinct Petri Net implementations of the SIRS compartment model relative to the standard ODE. In particular, we introduce a novel deterministic implementation of the SIRS model using dynamic transition weights in the GPenSIM package and stochastic Petri Net models using SPIKE. We show how rescaling and rounding procedures are critical for the numerical convergence of Petri Net SIR models relative to the ODEs, and we achieve a relative root mean squared error of less than 1% compared to ODE simulations for biologically relevant parameter ranges. Our findings confirm that both stochastic and deterministic discrete time Petri Nets are valid for modeling SIR-type dynamics with appropriate numerical procedures, laying the foundations for larger-scale use of Petri Net models."

    "abstract": "This paper deals with the problem of dynamic trajectory planning for a group of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in unknown environments. The existing methods often suffer from excessive computational burden, which creates the gap between theoretical approaches and practical swarm deployment. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a distributed cooperative planning system (DCPS). The system consists of two levels: a trajectory planning level and a cooperative trajectory planning level. On the trajectory planning level, a kinodynamic Gaussian potential B-spline (KGPB) approach is designed by combining the local kinodynamic-A-star method and the Gaussian potential field B-spline method. Specifically, in the front-end, a trajectory is first generated by using the local kinodynamic-A-star method based on kinematics-dynamics constraints. And then, in the back-end, the trajectory is further optimized by using the Gaussian potential B-spline (GPB) method. On the cooperative trajectory planning level, a back field neighbor replanning (BFNP) approach is proposed, where each UAV only needs to communicate with the nearest neighbors. According to the potential collision region of the front UAV, the trajectory of the current UAV is dynamically improved to ensure safe and stable flight such that communication costs are significantly improved. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DCPS achieves at least a 27% increase in average velocity and a 24% reduction in traversal time for the UAV swarm compared to prior methods. The experimental outcomes provide further validation that the proposed DCPS can generate efficient and safe trajectories. For particular cases, the UAV operates at 97% of its maximum possible velocity. The proposed DCPS provides a reliable solution for a group of unmanned aerial vehicles in unknown environments."

    "abstract": "Within the framework of the International Muon Collider Collaboration (IMCC), a feasibility study is underway for a 10 km collider ring aiming to achieve 10 TeV of center-of-mass energy. The short muon lifetime (2.2 μs at rest) imposes stringent requirements on the magnets, which must be compact, high-field, and large aperture to both maximize luminosity and host the internal shielding for the muon decay products. These challenges point to the use of REBCO High-Temperature Superconductors (HTS) and motivate the development of innovative design strategies addressing electromagnetic performance, quench protection, AC losses and mechanical integrity. This work presents an updated 2D analysis of dipoles in a block-coil configuration for the muon collider ring, featuring an innovative stacked-cable orientation with a novel end-winding concept. An improved electromagnetic design with a bore field of 16 T in a 140 mm aperture diameter is introduced, accompanied by an analytical estimation of hysteretic losses, which now accounts also for transport current effects. In addition, an advancement of the preliminary mechanical design is provided through Finite Element Method (FEM) using ANSYS software, employing a stress-management strategy to mitigate the high Lorentz forces."

    "abstract": "Under vacuum high-frequency electrical stress, polyimide (PI) films face severe surface discharge risks, which significantly affect their insulation stability in spacecraft dielectric systems. In this study, fluorinated polyimide (FPI) films with different fluorine contents were prepared, and a vacuum high-frequency surface discharge testing platform was established to systematically investigate their discharge characteristics. The results show that the introduction of fluorinated groups increases the surface electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity of the films. The discharge inception voltage increased from 1.88 kV for pure PI to 2.38 kV for 50% FPI, with a 26.6% increase. In addition, a non-equilibrium plasma model was constructed to dynamically simulate the formation process of discharge channels and the multiphysical evolution mechanisms. The results reveal that the front region of the discharge channel exhibits a coupled feature of “high density-low temperature-high reaction rate,” with significant electric field shielding and energy dissipation observed at the electron avalanche position. Fluorinated groups effectively suppress the establishment of surface discharge channels by reducing the secondary electron emission yield (SEEY) and dielectric constant, thereby weakening the electron multiplication effect and space charge accumulation. This study, from the perspectives of material regulation and physical mechanisms, provides theoretical support for optimizing the insulation performance of polyimide materials under vacuum high-frequency conditions."

Quantum chemical calculation (QCC) reveals that impact of injected space charges on the MO distribution is mitigated by the stabilizing ability of the rutile-TiO2 and AlN molecule. Further, density of states (DOS) analysis reveals deeper electron traps (3.24 eV and 3.12 eV) under the presence of trapped electrons. On the other hand, the trapped holes cause a slight increment in the hole trap levels from 0.80 eV to 1.28 eV under the presence of an electric field. Furthermore, 2 stage isothermal relaxation current (IRC) measurement is employed, based on which the trap distribution shows that incorporation of hybrid NP prompts deep electron (0.93 eV) and deep hole (0.90 eV) traps to develop in nanocomposite (NC) insulation. In addition, a time dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) based excitation characteristics is investigated to understand the influence of the charge recombination induced luminescence (RIL) on the complex mechanism of electronic transition, which is responsible for the modulation in the intermolecular charge transfer (ICT). As a whole, this study presents a new approach of studying hybrid TiO2 /AlN NP-induced inhibition of charge injection into the epoxy insulation."

    "abstract": "Time series Semi-Supervised Classification (SSC) aims to improve model performance by utilizing abundant unlabeled data in scenarios where labeled samples are limited. Previous approaches mainly focus on exploiting temporal dependencies within the time domain for SSC. However, these temporal dependencies are susceptible to sampling noise and may not effectively capture the global periodicity of features across categories. To this end, we propose a time series SSC framework called CompleMatch, leveraging the complementary information from both temporal and frequency representations for unlabeled data learning. CompleMatch simultaneously trains two deep neural networks based on time-domain and frequency-domain views, with pseudo-labels generated via label propagation in the representation space guiding the training of the opposing view's classifier. In this co-training paradigm, we incorporate a constraint term to harness the complementary nature of temporal-frequency representations, thereby enhancing the model's robustness under limited labeled data. In addition, we design a temporal-frequency contrastive learning module that integrates supervised and self-supervised signals to enhance pseudo-label quality by learning more discriminative representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CompleMatch surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, analyses of model behavior (i.e., ablation studies and visualization) underscore the effectiveness of our proposed approach."

The introduction of magnetostrictive (MS) phase can not only address the static charge leakage in piezoelectric (PE) phase, but also generate induced electromotive force as an auxiliary signal to enhance dynamic measurement reliability. To validate the feasibility of proposed mechanism, a system dynamic model centered on bidirectional magneto-mechanical coupling is established to characterize the multiphysics coupling response of ME composite. In addition, the performance of prototype is evaluated based on the theoretical model’s simulation results. For static force, the prototype achieves a resolution below 0.05 mN within a broad measurement range (0.1 mN-1 N). For dynamic force, the prototype is also capable of achieving a resolution below 2 mN. These experimental results demonstrate the considerable application potential of proposed sensing mechanism for broadband micro-force detection."

    "abstract": "The diagnosis of faults in electric motor bearings plays an important role in ensuring the reliability and safety of industrial systems. The inherent nonstationary nature of machinery vibration signals (MVS) from defective bearings makes time-frequency analysis (TFA) a powerful tool for fault detection. However, the performance of TFA-based fault feature extraction is highly dependent on the energy concentration of the time-frequency representation (TFR). Conventional TFA methods are limited by Gabor's time-frequency uncertainty principle, which restricts their ability to achieve high resolution in both the time domain (TD) and frequency domain (FD) simultaneously, limiting localization of transient phenomena from MVS in noisy environments. To address these challenges, this paper introduces two optimal window sequences for TFA, namely the Teager energy concentrated time-limited window (TECTLW) and the Teager energy concentrated band-limited window (TECBLW). These windows are designed to enhance the Teager energy concentration (TEC) measure enabling improved localization of transient fault signatures in the target domain (time or frequency), while minimizing dispersion in the complementary domain. The simulation results illustrate that TECTLW offers superior time localization with optimal TEC in the FD, while TECBLW improves frequency resolution with optimal TEC in the TD. With its precise time and/or frequency resolution, the TFA technique using these optimized windows holds great promise for industrial applications, particularly in condition monitoring, machinery fault diagnosis, and MVS analysis."

In this work, digital twin technology enables high-fidelity mapping of the physical domain into its virtual representation. The proposed mechanism adopts differentiated scheduling strategies by classifying flows into three categories: monitoring and data aggregation, control and execution, and data analysis and optimization. Deterministic networking techniques are applied to ensure cross-domain, low-latency end-to-end communication. Through model and behavior mapping, the system constructs a mixed-traffic topology in the virtual space, where data transmission paths and time-slot resources are pre-allocated to minimize scheduling conflicts and resource contention. Additionally, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent performs online decision-making to balance efficiency and effectiveness in dynamic environments. Compared with existing approaches, the integration of digital twins facilitates adaptive interaction between the physical and virtual worlds, supports DRL under non-stationary communication conditions, and prevents service degradation caused by real-world exploration. Simulation results verify that the proposed mechanism achieves reliable scheduling of mixed traffic flows, delivering higher transmission efficiency with reduced overall end-to-end latency."

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have made significant strides in the analysis and modeling of complex network data, particularly excelling in graph and node classification tasks. However, the ”black-box” nature of GNNs impedes user understanding and trust, thereby restricting their broader application. This challenge has spurred a growing focus on demystifying GNNs to make their decision-making processes more transparent. Traditional methods for explaining GNNs often rely on selecting subgraphs and employing combinatorial optimization to generate understandable outputs. However, these methods are closely linked to the inherent complexity of GNNs, leading to higher explanation costs. To address this issue, we introduce a lower-complexity proxy model to explain GNNs. Our approach leverages knowledge distillation with inter-layer alignment, specifically targeting the challenge of over-smoothing and its detrimental impact on model explanation. Initially, we distill critical insights from complex GNN models into a more manageable proxy model. We then apply an inter-layer alignment-based distillation technique to ensure alignment between the proxy and the original model, facilitating the extraction of node or edge-level explanations within the proxy framework. We theoretically prove that the explanations derived from the proxy model are faithful to both the proxy and the original model. Additionally, we show that the upper bound of unfaithfulness between the proxy and the original model remains consistent when the distillation error is infinitesimal. This inter-layer alignment knowledge distillation technique enables the proxy model to retain the knowledge learning and topological representation capabilities of the original model to the greatest extent. Experimental evaluations on numerous real-world datasets confirm the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating robust performance."

    "abstract": "This letter proposes an active current smoother (ACS) is proposed for pulsed power suppression to eliminate the large current disturbance caused by the pulse load current. The ACS is connected between the DC bus and the input capacitor of the load to ensure that the DC bus provides a smooth DC current to the load, regardless of how the load current pulsates. The ACS compensates for the voltage difference between the DC bus and the load input capacitor simultaneously. Therefore, the capacitor voltage on the pulsed-load input side is allowed to fluctuate over a wide range without causing fluctuations in the DC bus voltage. As a result, the capacitance of the filter capacitor can be significantly reduced. The ACS, which is composed of a floating capacitor and an H-bridge converter, is essentially a partial power conversion converter, because only a very small part of the load power needs to be processed by the ACS. Therefore, the power loss, volume, and weight of the ACS can be reduced. The operating principles of the ACS are analyzed. Besides, the key parameter design consideration is proposed to address the volume-efficiency trade-off for limited capacity systems. Moreover, the corresponding control strategy are also developed to meet multiple requirements for stable operation of ACS. Finally, experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the ACS."

    "abstract": "High-Throughput Satellites (HTS) use beam hopping to handle non-uniform and time-varying ground traffic demand. A significant technical challenge in beam hopping is the computation of effective illumination patterns. Traditional algorithms, like the genetic algorithm, require over 300 seconds to compute a single illumination pattern for just 37 cells, whereas modern HTS typically covers over 300 cells, rendering current methods impractical for real-world applications. Advanced approaches, such as multi-agent deep reinforcement learning, face convergence issues when the number of cells exceeds 40. In this paper, we introduce Tyche, a hybrid computation framework designed to address this challenge. Tyche incorporates a Monte Carlo Tree Search Beam Hopping (MCTS-BH) algorithm for computing illumination patterns and employs sliding window and pruning techniques to significantly reduce computation time. Specifically, MCTS-BH can compute one illumination pattern for 37 cells in just 12 seconds. To ensure real-time computation, we use a Greedy Beam Hopping (G-BH) algorithm, which provides a provisional solution while MCTS-BH completes its computation in the background. Our evaluation results show that MCTS-BH can increase throughput by up to 98.76%, demonstrating substantial improvements over existing solutions."

    "abstract": "The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources and frequent topological changes in modern distribution networks pose significant challenges for state estimation, demanding frameworks that are not only accurate but also numerically stable and scalable. Conventional Kalman filter-based estimators often suffer from numerical instability, where the error covariance matrix loses positive definiteness, leading to filter divergence. Concurrently, distributed multi-area estimation, while essential for scalability, faces hurdles in ensuring rapid convergence and minimizing communication overhead. To address these interconnected challenges, this paper proposes a novel multi-area forecasting aided state estimation framework. The framework first employs a hierarchical partitioning method, using composite electrical distance metrics with spectral clustering and mixed-integer programming, to create weakly-coupled sub-networks. At the core of each sub-area, a numerically stable U-D factorization Cubature Kalman Filter (UD-CKF) guarantees positive definiteness of the error covariance matrix. For distributed coordination, an improved ADMM algorithm incorporating U-D factor synchronization and a wavelet-based compression scheme with error compensation achieves global consistency with significantly reduced data traffic. Case studies on the IEEE Standard Test Feeder demonstrate the proposed method's effectiveness, providing a robust and practical solution for large-scale distribution networks."

    "abstract": "In pipeline systems such as oil transportation, defects on both the internal and external surfaces of thick-walled pipes can lead to distinct negative effects. It is crucial to detect and differentiate between these two types of defects simultaneously. Traditional methods for differentiation are generally only applicable to thin-walled ferromagnetic components and are not effective for thick-walled components. This study proposes a new method based on the slope ratio of stepped-lift-off signals to distinguish between internal and external defects. The method utilizes the principle of permeability perturbation and differentiates internal and external defects by comparing the attenuation rates of the secondary magnetic fields. Initially, a finite element simulation model is employed to explore the influence of probe parameters under direct current magnetization conditions on permeability perturbation signals, as well as how the signals vary with different lift-off values. This allows for the development of a threshold selection method for distinguishing internal and external defects. Subsequently, a stepped-lift-off multi-coil probe was fabricated and tested in experiments designed to detect internal and external defects in plates of varying thicknesses and dimensions. Experimental results demonstrate that by appropriately setting the slope ratio threshold, the method can effectively identify internal and external defects on steel plates of varying thicknesses and sizes. Additionally, the influence of coil size on the method’s precision is further investigated, offering valuable insights for enhancing the overall performance of the method and guiding future research."

    "abstract": "Exploring the causality among variables is crucial for uncovering the fault root cause. However, the existing methods are difficult to achieve a fine characterization of the causality evolutionary process. To this end, this paper proposes a multi-stage consistency constrained dynamic causal learning for root cause identification. Firstly, the CPD-DenStream is proposed to objectively describe the evolution process of faults, which lay the foundation for the following causal learning and root cause analysis. Then, the designed causal Transformer introduces a variable-level attention mechanism, which can accurately capture the causality among variables through the continuous dynamic learning. Subsequently, the F-Diff causal loss and interaction redundancy based dynamic causal learning are combined to guide the learning and adjustment of causality, making them more compatible throughout the entire evolution process of faults. Finally, the proposed method is evaluated on Tennessee Eastman process and the real-world coal mill dataset, achieving minimum improvement 8.7% in F1-score, 9.8% in precision, 8.4% in recall compared with baseline methods. These results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in capturing multi-stage causality, thereby advancing the practical implementation of root cause analysis systems."

    "abstract": "Accurate measurement and monitoring of vehicle dynamics and road surface conditions are critical for ensuring road safety and improving transportation infrastructure maintenance. This paper presents CV-Net (Connected Vehicle Network), a novel instrumentation-oriented measurement and monitoring framework that integrates smartphone-based multi-sensor instrumentation with an attention-augmented Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for real-time detection of driving behavior patterns and road anomalies. Unlike conventional anomaly detection approaches that treat smartphones only as data sources, CV-Net treats the device as a calibrated measurement instrument, incorporating both calibrated and uncalibrated signals from accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, and GPS modules. A comprehensive calibration protocol and preprocessing pipeline are applied to mitigate sensor bias, drift, and noise, thereby improving measurement repeatability and reliability. The proposed method is validated on both public and real-world datasets, achieving measurement classification accuracies up to 99.18% for driving behavior and 99.94% for road anomaly detection, outperforming existing instrumentation-based monitoring approaches. A rigorous 5-fold cross-validation confirmed the model’s consistency with narrow 95% confidence intervals, and statistically significant results (p < 0.05) validated its measurement reliability and statistical significance. Computational efficiency is demonstrated through reduced inference latency and low MFLOPS, enabling deployment in resource-constrained measurement systems. Model interpretability is enhanced using Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) and permutation importance, providing traceable measurement reasoning. The results establish CV-Net as a robust, efficient, and interpretable measurement and monitoring tool for intelligent transportation networks. Model Code: https://github.com/fariya17/CV_Net."

    "abstract": "Overvoltage in low-voltage distribution networks is increasingly frequent under high photovoltaic (PV) penetration, leading to active power curtailment through smart inverters. However, conventional local volt-watt schemes disproportionately penalize end-of-feeder units, raising fairness concerns and wasting renewable energy. Meanwhile, electric vehicles (EVs) represent flexible loads that can absorb curtailed PV energy, yet previous studies have neglected fairness in charging allocation. This study proposes a two-stage fairness-oriented control framework for coordinated PV curtailment and EV charging. Stage 1 employs a distributed algorithm that equitably allocates overvoltage-induced curtailment across PV units, eliminating locational penalization. Stage 2 redistributes curtailed PV energy to EVs via a fairness-promoting charging strategy that balances energy-sensitive and time-sensitive user preferences. The framework requires only local measurements, neighbor-level communication, and lightweight updates, minimizing complexity. Validating on the modified IEEE 33-bus system shows that the proposed framework mitigates overvoltage, improves fairness metrics for both PVs and EVs, and recovers nearly all curtailed PV energy without compromising network safety. Sensitivity studies confirm robustness under PV intermittency, fairness-system trade-offs, and communication link losses. The results highlight the potential of fairness-aware joint PV-EV coordination as a practical pathway for equitable and efficient distributed energy integration."

In the pursuit of maximal per-watt performance, the complex hardware and software of AES require intelligent energy efficiency optimizers (EO), and the stochastic runtime variances require continuous EO. However, deploying the desirable ondevice EO causes severe performance slowdown due to contention on limited computing power with the AES pipeline. We find that there are ignored and underutilized heterogeneous resources within AES for costly EO, which results from unbalanced accelerator behaviors and misaligned parallel inference executions. We experimentally and theoretically analyze the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Shadow Cycles</i> within the realistic autonomous Bird’s Eye View pipeline on commercial embedded platforms, categorizing them into vertical and horizontal types with distinct properties. <p xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">In this paper, we introduce <i>SHEEO</i>+, a continuous and intelligent energy efficiency optimizer that utilizes ignored heterogeneous shadow cycles. It achieves continuous and lightweight AES monitoring with the observation module, as well as intelligent and efficient AES power management with the optimization module. On the one hand, <i>SHEEO</i>+ observes both the internal runtime status and external environment variance with portable interfaces to capture shadow cycles and real-time states. On the other hand, <i>SHEEO</i>+ optimizes power configurations per iteration based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods. It tailors DRL for two types of shadow cycles and invocates optimization processes based on resource availability. To extensively evaluate <i>SHEEO</i>+, we implement a prototype and deploy it on realistic edge platforms. The evaluation results show that <i>SHEEO</i>+ utilizes up to 74.2% shadow cycles and achieves up to 18.6% energy efficiency improvements compared to state-of-the-art energy efficiency optimizers with negligible deployment overheads.</p>"

    "abstract": "Pneumatic soft robots are well-suited for minimally invasive surgery owing to their compliance and safe interaction with tissues. However, achieving highly adaptive control is difficult owing to modeling inaccuracies, inter-chamber coupling, and disturbances from surgical instruments. Non-learning adaptive methods depend on simplified models and perform poorly in unstructured settings. Conversely, learning-based methods often impose high computational costs in multi-degree-of-freedom (multi-DoF) pneumatic systems. A previous study proposed a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based proportional–integral–derivative (G-PID) controller that combined PID stability with learning-based adaptability by aligning system behavior with a reference model. However, its performance in highly coupled multi-DoF pneumatic soft robots was unverified, and its online adversarial training was computationally intensive. We addressed these limitations by developing an offline-trained G-PID controller, shifting adversarial training offline to reduce computational overhead, achieving 23-fold faster convergence, and enabling real-time, model-free control with balanced adaptability and efficiency. We evaluated three multi-DoF data fusion strategies, showing effective coordination of DoF coupling while maintaining individual control fidelity. Validation on a multi-DoF soft robotic mechatronic system for single-port transvesical prostatectomy revealed tip errors below 0.16 mm across surgical instruments. Proposed controller enhances scalability and adaptability and may generalize to other mechatronic systems with nonlinear, coupled dynamics."

    "abstract": "Accurate retrieval of multi-dimensional sea surface parameters, including height, radial velocity, and their temporal evolution, is critical for ocean monitoring and environmental applications. Dual-satellite Geosynchronous Spatial Correlation SAR (GEOSC-SAR) configurations, benefiting from the persistent monitoring of geosynchronous orbits, enable multi-frame interferometric observations that capture rich information on the evolution of dynamic sea surfaces. However, their cross-track and along-track components inherently form hybrid baselines, yielding mixed interferometric phases in which height and radial velocity are coupled. Existing decoupling methods typically require additional baselines or revisit passes, increasing system complexity. This letter presents Wave-Adaptive Dynamic Decomposition and Mixed-Basis Decoupling (WADDMD), a novel algorithm that resolves mixed-phase coupling using only a single hybrid baseline. WADDMD integrates (1) wave-adaptive dynamic decomposition, which embeds linear wave theory into dynamic mode decomposition to construct physically consistent temporal bases, and (2) mixed-basis decoupling, which structurally separates height and velocity contributions via baseline sensitivity coefficients and regularized least-squares fitting. Extensive validation confirms the method’s effectiveness: realistic GEO-SAR simulation experiments demonstrate significant improvement over direct inversion; evaluation with in-situ buoy observations further verifies accurate retrieval of sea surface height, radial velocity, and temporal evolution; and multi-region tests using Copernicus Marine Service data validate its robustness across different oceanic regions."

    "abstract": "To address the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image recognition caused by viewpoint-sensitive, high-interference samples encountered in dynamic environments, we propose a lightweight and efficient online class-incremental learning (OCI) framework named Interference-Aware Replay with Dynamic Review for SAR Target Recognition (IAR-DR). Based on the experience replay (ER) mechanism, a Maximally Interfered Retrieval (MIR) strategy is designed to prioritize the replay of high-interference samples by measuring loss changes before and after model updates, thereby preserving decision boundaries under viewpoint variation. A Review Trick (RT) mechanism is further introduced to periodically revisit all buffered samples with a low learning rate, which complements MIR by reinforcing global feature retention and enhancing long-term memory stability. The combination of MIR and RT achieves a synergistic balance between local discrimination and global generalization, mitigating the forgetting effect while maintaining the efficiency. Extensive experiments conducted on the MSTAR and Bistatic MiniSAR datasets demonstrate that the proposed IAR-DR framework maintains high recognition accuracy while achieving a forgetting rate as low as 6.92% in ablation studies, and improving retention by 4.7% over recent SAR class-incremental methods."

The wettability, biocompatibility, and corrosion measurements were performed after electrochemical anodization of the surfaces. The experimental alloys exhibited lower initial ground surface contact angles compared to the commonly used Ti-6Al-4V alloy—anodization in aqueous and organic electrolytes produced nanoporous/nanotubular morphologies, significantly enhancing surface wettability. The Ti-20Nb-20Zr-4Ta alloy anodized in an ethylene glycol-based electrolyte at 60 V demonstrated the best hydrophilic properties, with a contact angle of 52.76 ± 3.90°, notably lower than the 86.06 ± 3.92° of the control Ti-6Al-4V alloy. Electrochemical measurements were carried out to evaluate the corrosion resistance of the metallic alloys in chloride-containing solutions.

To tackle these issues, a Sample Recommendation-based Multidimensional View Collaborative (SR-MDVC) domain adaptation algorithmis proposed. Initially, by integrating transfer learning theory and the hierarchical emission model, unknown and known pulse signals are defined from the perspective of probability density functions （PDFs）. Subsequently，a sample recommendation algorithm based on user collaborative filtering algorithm is introduced. This algorithm effectively reduces the disparity in the PDFs of unknown and known radar pulses. Moreover, a collaborative domain adaptation algorithm for multidimensional perspective model is developed. The model adapts data in the statistical feature dimension and the geometric feature dimension, and is optimized by iterating results across different dimensions. Finally, the domain - adapted data is fed into the least squares support vector machines (LSSVM) to complete the identification of unknown radar pulses. The effectiveness of this method is verified by semi-physical experiments, which demonstrate the excellent recognition performance of the proposed method, with a recognition accuracy of more than 0.9 for unknown and unbalanced data, and a 4-fold improvement in computational efficiency."

    "abstract": "Logging is a fundamental practice in software engineering, supporting monitoring, debugging, and system comprehension. However, determining where to insert log statements, what information to record, and how to phrase messages remains a labor-intensive and error-prone task. Recent research has explored automated logging; however, most approaches rely on domain- or language-specific pretraining, limiting applicability across diverse projects and environments. This paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) trained on general code and natural-language corpora can eliminate the need for task-specific pretraining in automated logging. In our setting, models do not perform any Java- or task-specific pretraining but are trained only through lightweight supervised fine-tuning on the logging dataset. We compare LEONID, a state-of-the-art pretraining-centric logging system, and off-the-shelf models, including T5, CodeT5, and Qwen, without additional Java-specific pretraining. This evaluation encompasses single-log injection (levels, variables, positions, and messages), log-message quality assessed using reference-based metrics, and multilog injection, requiring multiple statements in a method. The results indicate that general-purpose LLMs rival or surpass LEONID in several aspects. Notably, Qwen-7B improves insertion position accuracy by 14 percentage points, addressing one of the most critical factors for the practical deployment of automated logging. Moreover, CodeT5 and Qwen achieve competitive or superior performance in message generation, and Qwen-7B demonstrates stronger structural reasoning for insertion positions and multilog scenarios. Although LEONID remains more stable in level selection and variable binding, the findings indicate that task-specific pretraining is not universally required. This work provides the first head-to-head evaluation of a pretraining-based approach versus off-the-shelf LLM approaches for automated logging, offering practical guidance for when to apply custom pretraining and when general-purpose models are sufficient."

This paper proposes an LLM-driven DRL framework named L2D2, which autonomously generates reward functions for DRL through LLMs and enables dynamic model optimization through a self-refinement loop mechanism. The reward function within the L2D2 framework can adjust the strategy based on environmental feedback, eliminating the need for manual redesign in complex low-altitude scenarios and reducing debugging costs. To validate the performance of L2D2, the framework is utilized in a multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted MEC heterogeneous network operating in the low-altitude airspace to enhance system energy efficiency. A novel dueling double deep Q-network (D3QN) is utilized as the DRL method within L2D2, named the L2D2-D3QN algorithm. To evaluate its effectiveness in enhancing system energy efficiency, a comprehensive comparison is conducted across various LLMs, including Deepseek-R1, GPT-4o, Llama-3.1-70B, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and Qwen-2.5. The simulation results demonstrate that the L2D2-D3QN algorithm achieves up to 56% higher energy efficiency compared to DRL with human-designed reward function. Furthermore, the influence of LLM tokenization strategies on the performance of LLM-driven DRL is also explored."

Most existing studies focus on a single underwater robot and environmental obstacles, with limited research on collision avoidance planning among multiple underwater robots. This paper addresses these issues for multiple underwater robots by performing the simultaneous target tracking (STT) from an optimization perspective. On the basis of the neurodynamic design method, the path tracking, collision avoidance, and communication maintenance are formulated as a series of inequality and equality constraints. By incorporating these constraints, the STT scheme, which is depicted as a unified quadratic program (QP) framework, is thus established for multiple underwater robots with certified safety. Such a QP-type STT scheme is then solved by using the Lagrangian-based recurrent neural network. Computer simulations are performed to further verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed QP-type STT scheme. These results indicate that the multiple underwater robots via the proposed STT scheme can accomplish the assigned target-tracking tasks while maintaining the safe distance to avoid collision and staying within communication range throughout the tracking mission."

Recently, optical PD detection methods have garnered increasing attention due to their immunity to electromagnetic and acoustic interference. However, these methods still suffer from limitations such as low capture efficiency for PD optical signal within GIS and inadequate detection sensitivity. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel, high-sensitivity optical PD sensor based on a lightguide rod (LGR) whose sidewall is uniformly coated with CdSe/ZnS core-shell quantum dot (QD) material. Comprehensive demonstrations from theoretical analysis, optical simulation, and performance verification affirm that sidewall QD coating substantially improves the LGR’s ability to capture PD optical signals, thereby improving PD detection sensitivity. Finally, PD experiments are conducted on an experimental platform built based on a small GIS tank. The QD-coated LGR showed higher response intensity and lower PD inception voltage in detecting four typical PD defects than traditional uncoated LGRs, achieving an average response gain of 37.4%. Experimental results indicate that the QD-coated LGR has considerable potential for practical engineering applications."

    "abstract": "Resistive crossbars using non-volatile memory devices have become promising components for implementing deep learning models in hardware. However, crossbar-based computations encounter a notable challenge due to device and circuit-level non-idealities. In this study, we explore three recent crossbar simulation tools, namely, AIHWKIT, CrossSim, and MemTorch, and evaluate four pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification on CIFAR-100, MNIST, and SVHN datasets using these tools. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study using all three simulation tools of analog accelerators, representing three distinctive hardware settings, to evaluate CNN-based model robustness under analog noise and nonlinearities. We first test the robustness of four models (VGG19, InceptionV3, ResNet50, & MobilenetV2) using different levels of white Gaussian noise as baselines. Then we evaluate their inference performance on the three tools to determine their resilience to analog noise and nonlinearities in the hardware environment. Results show that while all CNNs' suffer performance degradation as expected, insights are obtained such as ResNet50 outperforms others in two out of three simulators despite real-world hardware imperfections due to its deep structure. Furthermore, we explore the impact of three key factors: cell bits, ADC resolution, and tile size on CNN performance across various hardware configurations, providing recommendations for the efficient deployment of CNN on hardware. Our results suggest that increasing cell bits and ADC resolution improves CNNs' performance. It is also observed that smaller tiles are suitable for lightweight models, while for complex networks, we should choose larger shape of tiles."

    "abstract": "The integration of satellite communications with mobile edge computing (MEC) into space-air-ground integrated networks, known as satellite edge computing (SEC), has become a crucial research field for future communication systems to provide extensive global coverage services. This paper investigates the joint dependent task offloading and resource allocation problem for remote Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications within the SEC architecture. The proposed system leverages unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as mobile access points and edge servers and utilizes low- earth orbit (LEO) satellites and ground stations as cloud computing resources. Multiple applications with dependent tasks from IoT devices (IoTDs) are modeled as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). To address the challenges of reducing the system cost in UAV-assisted SEC, we first propose a one-to-many matching algorithm to associate IoTDs with UAVs. Then, a multi-application task sequence algorithm is devoted to merging the multiple DAGs and sorting the task order. Finally, a graph-aware asynchronous multi-agent reinforcement learning approach empowers the agents to autonomously discover optimal offloading and resource allocation strategies. Extensive simulations based on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in minimizing the system costs while meeting application latency requirements, outperforming other benchmark algorithms."

    "abstract": "Extending the use of dc-dc converters such as the dual active bridge (DAB) to high voltage applications will require voltage sharing among series-connected power devices. Initial solutions used snubber capacitors to limit voltage rise and balance the turn-off voltage. However, this mechanism is not viable at low currents, which leads to high capacitor discharge currents. The quasi-square wave modular multilevel dc-dc converter (QSW-MMC) has been proposed as an option for high voltage DAB converters. This circuit employs an additional switch in series with the capacitor which acts as a controlled voltage clamp. This avoids problems at low loading but loses the benefit of switching loss reduction at high currents. In this paper, a dual-mode operation based on the QSW-MMC is proposed, which actively controls the auxiliary switch to use the submodule capacitor as a clamping component at low currents and as a snubber component at high currents. Additionally, the presented control strategy can achieve smooth transitions between two modes. Finally, simulation and experimental results from a scaled test rig validate the efficiency improvement achieved by the proposed dual-mode operation."

    "abstract": "Autonomous navigation is a core function of Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled robotic systems, particularly in applications such as smart warehousing, intelligent inspection, and collaborative logistics. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved remarkable progress in robotic navigation, but conventional RL methods typically rely on fixed task distributions, making it difficult to adapt to incremental multi-scene navigation strategies that are common in dynamic IoT environments. Learning navigation across multiple scenes faces follow major challenges: catastrophic forgetting in sequential learning, where new scene learning overwrites prior knowledge, and sample inefficiency due to random exploration in complex environments. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Knowledge-Guided continual reinforcement learning (KGCRL) approach. Built upon the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) framework, KGCRL integrates Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) to mitigate catastrophic forgetting by preserving critical parameters from previously learned tasks. Furthermore, a knowledge-guided learning mechanism is introduced to incorporate external knowledge, thereby improving exploration efficiency and stability. Experimental results in incremental scene navigation demonstrate that KGCRL significantly improves scene adaptability while reducing cross-scene performance degradation. These results validate the effectiveness and practicality of KGCRL, providing new insights for robot incremental scene navigation."

    "abstract": "Modulation recognition in lowsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments poses significant challenges for existing deep learning models, particularly those based on the Vision Transformer (ViT). Although ViT architectures demonstrate strong performance under quasi-static noise conditions, their robustness tends to decline in more complex, time-varying noise scenarios due to inherent limitations in self-attention and normalization mechanisms. This paper identifies and analyzes the root causes of ViT’s performance degradation under such non-stationary conditions and proposes ResGatNet, a hybrid neural architecture designed to address these limitations. ResGatNet integrates a large-kernel ResNet backbone to enhance local receptive fields, a Gated Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) module to adaptively suppress noise, and a Kolmogorov–Arnold Network (KAN) module to improve global representation with reduced parameter complexity. Experimental results across both quasi-static and time-varying noise settings demonstrate that ResGatNet achieves superior classification accuracy and generalization, significantly outperforming CNN- and ViT-based baselines under low-SNR conditions. These findings confirm that targeted architectural innovations can substantially improve robustness in non-stationary wireless environments."

    "abstract": "Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) ship recognition plays a critical role in maritime security. Unlike optical imagery, SAR ship recognition faces inherent challenges mainly due to its imaging mechanism and the structural characteristics of ships, especially concerning inter-class similarities and intra-class variations. Fine-grained information allows the network to focus on discriminative scattering substructures, thereby facilitating more effective ship recognition. For this reason, this letter introduces PAENet—a novel SAR ship recognition network that incorporates local part-aware attention enhancement. PAENet constructs part-level scattering representations using scattering keypoints, allowing for adaptive concentration on fine-grained features. Importantly, a dedicated part information attention module (PIAM) is introduced to refine distinctive features based on the cosine similarity measure. Extensive evaluations on the standardized public OpenSARShip datastet with three-category and six-category ships demonstrate that the proposed network achieves state-of-the-art performance in SAR ship recognition."

    "abstract": "Few-shot aircraft detection in remote sensing imagery still challenges modern deep-learning based detectors with limited annotated priors. While existing strategies (e.g., data augmentation, transfer/ meta learning) could alleviate the serious over-fitting to a large extent, the adopted generic inductive bias, rather than aircraft-specific knowledge, does not change the inherently data-hungry property of deep representation learning. In this paper, we propose a grammar-guided detection framework that incorporates high-level structural knowledge with three kinematic grammars of semantic landmarks: symmetry, parallelism, and verticality. These grammatical rules are embedded in a differentiable energy function for geometry-constrained landmark inference. Besides, we incorporate the grammar into the Faster RCNN framework as top-down priors to filter the conventional bottom-up message passing process. Specifically, the top-down Landmark-aware Attention refines feature responses within ROIs, while the bottom-up Scale-aware Attention strengthens backbone features by learning multi-scale representations. These modulated features are further fed into a Contour-aware Detection Head to predict landmark heatmaps and reconstruct aircraft outlines. The experiments conducted on an enhanced MAR20 benchmark with newly annotated landmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method under few-shot settings."

    "abstract": "Vector fields are advantageous in handling non holonomic motion planning, as they provide the robot with reference orientation across the workspace. However, additionally incorporating curvature constraints presents challenges due to the interconnection between the design of the curvature-bounded vector field and the tracking controller under limited actuation. In this paper, we present a novel framework to co-develop the vector field and the control law, guiding the nonholonomic robot to the target configuration with curvature-bounded trajectory. First, we formulate the problem by introducing the target positive limit set, which allows the robot to either converge to or pass through the target configuration, depending on its dynamics and the specific tasks. Next, we construct a curvature-constrained vector field (CVF) via blending and embedding elementary flows in the workspace. To track such CVF, a saturated control law with dynamic gains is proposed, under which the tracking error's magnitude decreases even when saturation occurs. Under the control law, the kinematically constrained nonholonomic robot is guaranteed to track the reference CVF and converge to the target positive limit set with bounded trajectory curvature. Numerical simulations show that the proposed CVF method outperforms other vector-field-based algorithms. Experiments on Ackermann UGVs and semi-physical fixed-wing UAVs demonstrate that the method can be effectively implemented in real-world scenarios."

    "abstract": "Data gloves offer excellent portability and a strong ability to handle occluded movements, making them more advantageous over other methods for capturing complex hand motions in unstructured environments. However, the majority of existing hand-motion-capture gloves do not preserve visual features of the hand, which critically hinders their applicability for automatic pose annotation in RGB images. Here, we propose a data glove based on filament-sliding linear potentiometers (FLiPo), which can maintain finger appearance and ensure high accuracy as well as robustness, paving the way for automatic annotation. In FLiPo, fine filaments (Φ.1 mm) are deployed on finger skin to transmit joint arc length variations as well as preserve the hand's visual features, while linear potentiometers used to capture filament length changes are positioned on the arm. Simultaneously, a quantitative occlusion scoring metric is proposed to evaluate the degree of finger occlusion caused by the device. Further, we experimentally analyze the nonlinearities induced by biaxial joint coupling and skin tissue artifact (STA)-related hysteresis, and employ a fully connected neural network to map arc length to joint angles with an MAE of joint angles of 2.15°. Meanwhile, tests under challenging environmental conditions, including heat, moisture, and magnetic interference, are conducted to evaluate its stability. Finally, the system's capability for real-time pose capture with high accuracy, robustness, and low occlusion was demonstrated."

    "abstract": "Utilizing a single vision sensor for learning from human demonstration (LfD) planning offers numerous benefits. However, the accurate identification of key task constraints for motion planning is a prevailing challenge, stemming from data unreliability. This research introduces a novel LfD planning framework that employs a human action recognition algorithm to extract task constraints from unreliable human skeleton data derived from single camera images, thereby enhancing motion planning. Initially, the method aims to obtain task constraints from the skeleton data using action labels associated with specific constraints, for instance, “pick upward while maintaining a consistent pose.” Subsequently, a robot motion is crafted to comply with the extracted constraints and is catalogued in the motion database as a path experience. For novel planning challenges, this path experience is tailored to new environments, serving as a reference for discerning a valid motion via the random modification of any inconsistent segments. Simulation results, focused on pick-and-place tasks, indicate that the introduced method surpasses the state-of-the-art approach by elevating the success rate and diminishing the computation time and path length by 8%, 20%, and 15%, respectively. Furthermore, superior performance was also observed in two real-world scenarios, including a task that requires more complex human actions, such as rotating the wrist. Although the execution time was slightly increased, the proposed method was shown to increase the success rate by 11% and 28% and reduce the average computation time by 14% and 29% for the two real-world scenarios."

Current imitation learning methods show promise in handling individual long–horizon tasks, but they struggle to scale to multi-task scenarios and fail to execute new tasks. This work proposes a framework that learns a unified imitation policy capable of generalizing to diverse interaction-rich tasks and environmental variations. Our approach introduces a task decomposition strategy that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) and robot proprioception to infer agent–object interaction events from expert demonstrations. With these interaction events as input, we introduce the Future-aware Imitation Transformer (FIT), a transformerbased policy that acquires interaction-aware skills. At every time step, FIT predicts the actions, the latent representations of the future states to anticipate the outcomes of actions, and a task embedding to maintain awareness of the long-horizon manipulation objective. We evaluated our method in simulated LIBERO, Franka Kitchen, and real–world xARM6 environments. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms all baselines, particularly on novel tasks, where existing methods fail to generalize."

    "abstract": "Utilizing scatterers in communication engineering, such as reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and backscatter systems, requires physically consistent models for accurate performance prediction. A multiport model, which also accounts for structural scattering, has been developed for non-periodic scatterers. However, many emerging systems operate at multiple frequencies or generate intermodulation harmonics, particularly when incorporating space-time modulation (STM) or dynamic load control. These functionalities demand advanced modeling approaches capable of capturing scattering behavior across several frequencies and directions simultaneously. To address these challenges, this article extends a multiport S-parameters-based model for predicting the scattering properties of multifrequency operating structures. The proposed model broadens the applicability of convenient S-matrix models to time-modulated multiport scatterers. Unlike known approaches, this model incorporates structural scattering, mutual coupling, the possibility of non-digital modulation, and spatially non-periodic configurations, enabling physically consistent analysis and optimization across a wide range of communication and sensing systems. Validation against experimental results for a space-time modulated scattering structure demonstrates the accuracy and practical applicability of the proposed model."

We establish the first graph-based framework for optimizing qubit-reuse compilation. In particular, we characterize the task of finding the optimal compilation strategy for maximizing qubit reuse using binary integer programming and provide efficient heuristic algorithms for devising general compilation strategies. We conduct a thorough analysis of quantum circuits with practical relevance and offer their optimal qubit-reuse compilation strategies. We also perform a comparative analysis against state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating the superior performance of our methods in both structured and random quantum circuits. Our framework lays a rigorous foundation for understanding dynamic quantum circuit compilation via qubit reuse, holding significant promise for the practical implementation of large-scale quantum algorithms on quantum computers with limited resources."

Furthermore, we introduce magnetic vector constraints to address the unobservability of absolute heading and reduce position drift errors. In typical indoor environments, such as offices and underground parking lots, our method achieves an average horizontal position RMSE of 2.5m and a velocity estimation accuracy of up to 0.07 m/s.

Therefore, in this study, we aimed to develop a more accurate method for retrieving DFMC by integrating multi-source satellite remote sensing data with machine learning algorithms. Evaluation of six retrieval models (extreme gradient boosting [XGB], linear regression [LR], generalized additive model [GAM], random forest [RF], convolutional neural network [CNN], and long short-term memory [LSTM]) confirmed the adaptability of XGB to four forest types, achieving an average R² value of 0.78. In addition, we used SHAP analysis to assess the importance of the model's influencing factors and identified the significance of soil moisture content (SMC) and evapotranspiration. Furthermore, comparative analysis of four input parameter combinations confirmed the pivotal role of SMC, with the integrated use of ERA5-Land reanalysis data and SMC data achieving optimal model performance while balancing large-scale applicability with accuracy. Additionally, a daily DFMC dataset for the Greater Khingan Mountains was constructed by integrating SMAP soil moisture data, ERA5 meteorological data, and the XGB model. In this study, we innovatively combined microwave remote sensing data with machine learning to provide a robust methodological framework for DFMC data retrieval via microwave remote sensing. Our results establish a foundation for enhancing the precision of forest fire risk early warning systems."

    "abstract": "Model-free predictive control (MFPC) strategies have shown significant potential for achieving robust and highperformance operation in permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drives without relying on detailed system models. This paper presents a novel MFPC approach, termed the Local Dynamic Estimation Predictive Controller (LDEPC), which integrates a flexible real-time estimator with a refined local dynamics framework to capture unknown system behaviors. Two variants are proposed: the Zero-Order LDEPC, optimized for simplicity and ease of implementation, and the First-Order LDEPC, designed to improve disturbance rejection and capture nonlinear effects more accurately. The framework balances robustness, prediction accuracy, and computational efficiency, enabling effective control under parameter variations, rapid reference changes, and external disturbances. The effectiveness of LDEPC is experimentally validated on a PMSM test bench across multiple scenarios, including step responses, regenerative braking, parameter mismatch, disturbance rejection, and dynamic reference tracking. Comparisons with PI control, an MFPC using an ultra-local model and extended state observer (MFPCC-ESO), and an observer-enhanced MFPC with a generalized proportional-integral observer (MFPCC-GPIO) show that LDEPC consistently delivers robust, reliable, and precise control, underscoring its strong potential for practical deployment in demanding applications."

    "abstract": "The widespread integration of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in consumer devices has heightened the need for a cost-effective and energy-efficient mechanism to safeguard the intellectual property (IP) of artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC). This paper proposes RO-SVD+, a hardware-based framework that exploits low-rank matrix decomposition and on-chip process variations to enable device-level traceability and high-quality randomness generation while exhibiting strong resistance to AI-driven attacks. Using AI-generated images as a case study, evaluations of a 28-nm FPGA and an ASIC design flow show up to 185× and 153× improvements in per-pixel cost-effectiveness as image resolutions scale from 32×32 to 1024×1024 under consistent power consumption. Compared with our prior work, RO-SVD+ achieves a 2× speedup in entropy extraction and a 4× improvement in cost-effectiveness for 1024×1024 matrices. Compared to other equivalent efforts, RO-SVD+ delivers 8× to 53× higher throughput with reduced FPGA design complexity and ASIC area, making it a promising hardware-based solution for copyright protection in modern consumer electronics where high-resolution and dense GenAI workloads are widely deployed."

    "abstract": "Holographic Video Communication (HVC) stands as a significant innovation in immersive technology, aiming to revolutionize human interaction by integrating lifelike three-dimensional communications into everyday experiences. Delivering real-time HVC presents challenges due to intensive computational demands and high expectations for Quality of Experience (QoE) requirements. This article presents an In-Network Computing (INC) empowered framework for resource allocation for HVC. Our framework provides guidelines and insights into optimizing the seamless integration of Communication, Computation, and Caching (3C) resources from the cloud to the edge. We present resource allocation strategies for the Service Function Chain (SFC) representing the HVC processing pipeline and highlight the advantages of incorporating parallel distributed rendering and pre-caching mechanisms. Through simulation, we demonstrate how our approach mitigates end-to-end delays and enhances frame refresh rates, significantly improving the holographic streaming experience. The results validate the effectiveness of our proposed strategies and offer valuable insights for further research into optimizing immersive communication technologies."

    "abstract": "Numerous data-intensive applications benefit from offloading data processing to storage devices, typically Computational Storage Devices (CSD). Co-locating requests from diverse applications to one CSD offers better performance and power efficiency than dedicating CSDs to a single application. However, current CSD scheduling frameworks struggle to effectively manage contention among CPU, flash I/O, and buffer resources across requests due to less consideration in their inter-dependencies. This paper proposes REMUS, a CSD scheduling framework handling multiple requests for commercial SSD with multiple homogeneous cores. The key idea of REMUS is to allocate workloads across multiple cores based on the distribution of the Logical Block Address (LBA) of requests, and to mitigate stall time by sorting requests according to their urgency for resources, where urgency is quantified by each request’s remaining buffer capacity. Furthermore, a request batching scheme that intelligently groups the requests to be scheduled according to their characteristics is proposed to provide congestion control for REMUS and to minimize the contention it introduces. We conduct experiments on both a simulator and a real CSD platform. The experiment results show that REMUS improved throughput by 1.51× on the simulator and 1.39× on the real platform on average compared to the baselines."
