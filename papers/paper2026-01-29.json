    "abstract": "Diffie-Hellman groups are commonly used in cryptographic protocols. While most state-of-the-art, symbolic protocol verifiers support them to some degree, they do not support all mathematical operations possible in these groups. In particular, they lack support for exponent addition, as these tools reason about terms using unification, which is undecidable in the theory describing all Diffie-Hellman operators. In this paper we approximate such a theory and propose a semi-decision procedure to determine whether a protocol, which may use all operations in such groups, satisfies user-defined properties. We implement this approach by extending the Tamarin prover to support the full Diffie-Hellman theory, including group element multiplication and hence addition of exponents. This is the first time a state-of-the-art tool can model and reason about such protocols. We illustrate our approach's effectiveness with different case studies: ElGamal encryption and MQV. Using Tamarin, we prove security properties of ElGamal, and we rediscover known attacks on MQV."

    "abstract": "Machine learning models are routinely deployed on a wide range of computing hardware. Although such hardware is typically expected to produce identical results, differences in its design can lead to small numerical variations during inference. In this work, we show that these variations can be exploited to create backdoors in machine learning models. The core idea is to shape the model's decision function such that it yields different predictions for the same input when executed on different hardware. This effect is achieved by locally moving the decision boundary close to a target input and then refining numerical deviations to flip the prediction on selected hardware. We empirically demonstrate that these hardware-triggered backdoors can be created reliably across common GPU accelerators. Our findings reveal a novel attack vector affecting the use of third-party models, and we investigate different defenses to counter this threat."

    "abstract": "Massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) downlink precoding offers high spectral efficiency but remains challenging to deploy in practice because near-optimal algorithms such as the weighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE) are computationally expensive, and sensitive to SNR and channel-estimation quality, while existing deep learning (DL)-based solutions often lack robustness and require retraining for each deployment site. This paper proposes a plug-and-play precoder (PaPP), a DL framework with a backbone that can be trained for either fully digital (FDP) or hybrid beamforming (HBF) precoding and reused across sites, transmit-power levels, and with varying amounts of channel estimation error, avoiding the need to train a new model from scratch at each deployment. PaPP combines a high-capacity teacher and a compact student with a self-supervised loss that balances teacher imitation and normalized sum-rate, trained using meta-learning domain-generalization and transmit-power-aware input normalization. Numerical results on ray-tracing data from three unseen sites show that the PaPP FDP and HBF models both outperform conventional and deep learning baselines, after fine-tuning with a small set of local unlabeled samples. Across both architectures, PaPP achieves more than 21$\\times$ reduction in modeled computation energy and maintains good performance under channel-estimation errors, making it a practical solution for energy-efficient mMIMO precoding."

    "abstract": "Web attack detection is the first line of defense for securing web applications, designed to preemptively identify malicious activities. Deep learning-based approaches are increasingly popular for their advantages: automatically learning complex patterns and extracting semantic features from HTTP requests to achieve superior detection performance. However, existing methods are less effective in embedding irregular HTTP requests, even failing to model unordered parameters and achieve attack traceability. In this paper, we propose an effective web attack detection model, named WADBERT. It achieves high detection accuracy while enabling the precise identification of malicious parameters. To this end, we first employ Hybrid Granularity Embedding (HGE) to generate fine-grained embeddings for URL and payload parameters. Then, URLBERT and SecBERT are respectively utilized to extract their semantic features. Further, parameter-level features (extracted by SecBERT) are fused through a multi-head attention mechanism, resulting in a comprehensive payload feature. Finally, by feeding the concatenated URL and payload features into a linear classifier, a final detection result is obtained. The experimental results on CSIC2010 and SR-BH2020 datasets validate the efficacy of WADBERT, which respectively achieves F1-scores of 99.63% and 99.50%, and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods."

    "abstract": "Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a widely used technique for controllable generation in diffusion and flow-based models. Despite its empirical success, CFG relies on a heuristic linear extrapolation that is often sensitive to the guidance scale. In this work, we provide a principled interpretation of CFG through the lens of optimization. We demonstrate that the velocity field in flow matching corresponds to the gradient of a sequence of smoothed distance functions, which guides latent variables toward the scaled target image set. This perspective reveals that the standard CFG formulation is an approximation of this gradient, where the prediction gap, the discrepancy between conditional and unconditional outputs, governs guidance sensitivity. Leveraging this insight, we reformulate the CFG sampling as a homotopy optimization with a manifold constraint. This formulation necessitates a manifold projection step, which we implement via an incremental gradient descent scheme during sampling. To improve computational efficiency and stability, we further enhance this iterative process with Anderson Acceleration without requiring additional model evaluations. Our proposed methods are training-free and consistently refine generation fidelity, prompt alignment, and robustness to the guidance scale. We validate their effectiveness across diverse benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements on large-scale models such as DiT-XL-2-256, Flux, and Stable Diffusion 3.5."

The complex process is model-free. That is, we do not have a suitable physics-based model characterizing the temporal evolution of the process state. The closed-form Gaussian posterior is provided by a recurrent neural network (RNN). The use of RNN is computationally simple in the inference phase. For learning the RNN, an additional RNN is used in the learning phase. Both RNNs help each other learn better based on variational inference principles. The VSE is demonstrated for a tracking application - state estimation of a stochastic Lorenz system (a benchmark process) using a 2-D camera measurement model. The VSE is shown to be competitive against a particle filter that knows the Lorenz system model and a recently proposed data-driven state estimation method that does not know the Lorenz system model."

However, their performance can be significantly hindered when applied to computationally intensive industrial problems. To address this limitation, we propose an adaptive surrogate modelling approach designed to accelerate the early-stage convergence speed of state-of-the-art MOEAs. This is important because it ensures that a solver can identify optimal or near-optimal solutions with relatively few fitness function evaluations, thereby saving both time and computational resources. Our method employs a two-loop architecture. The outer loop runs a (baseline) host MOEA which carries out true fitness evaluations. The inner loop contains an Adaptive Accelerator that leverages data-driven machine learning (ML) surrogate models to approximate fitness functions. Integrated with NSGA-II and MOEA/D, our approach was tested on 31 widely known benchmark problems and a real-world North Sea fish abundance modelling case study. The results demonstrate that by incorporating Gaussian Process Regression, one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks, and Random Forest Regression, our proposed approach significantly accelerates the convergence speed of MOEAs in the early phases of optimisation."

    "abstract": "Manipulation surfaces control objects by actively deforming their shape rather than directly grasping them. While dense actuator arrays can generate complex deformations, they also introduce high degrees of freedom (DOF), increasing system complexity and limiting scalability. The MANTA-RAY (Manipulation with Adaptive Non-rigid Textile Actuation with Reduced Actuation densitY) platform addresses these challenges by leveraging a soft, fabric-based surface with reduced actuator density to manipulate fragile and heterogeneous objects. Previous studies focused on single-module implementations supported by four actuators, whereas the feasibility and benefits of a scalable, multi-module configuration remain unexplored. In this work, we present a distributed, modular, and scalable variant of the MANTA-RAY platform that maintains manipulation performance with a reduced actuator density. The proposed multi-module MANTA-RAY platform and control strategy employs object passing between modules and a geometric transformation driven PID controller that directly maps tilt-angle control outputs to actuator commands, eliminating the need for extensive data-driven or black-box training. We evaluate system performance in simulation across surface configurations of varying modules (3x3 and 4x4) and validate its feasibility through experiments on a physical 2x2 hardware prototype. The system successfully manipulates objects with diverse geometries, masses, and textures including fragile items such as eggs and apples as well as enabling parallel manipulation. The results demonstrate that the multi-module MANTA-RAY improves scalability and enables coordinated manipulation of multiple objects across larger areas, highlighting its potential for practical, real-world applications."

Employing a model-agnostic framework based on the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution applied to the second CHIME/FRB catalog, we quantify its rarity within the current population. Bayesian fitting of GEV models to block maxima of peak flux and fluence data reveals FRB 20250316A to be a profound statistical outlier. For the peak flux, the analysis yields a return period of $\\sim$ 600 years ($1σ$ credible level), with the underlying distribution being of the heavy-tailed, unbounded Fréchet type ($ξ> 0$). The fluence analysis indicates greater complexity: while the full sample suggests a Fréchet-type distribution with a $\\sim50$-year return period in $1σ$ credible level, the removal of three other notable outliers points toward a light-tailed Weibull-type distribution ($ξ< 0$) with a finite upper bound far exceeded by FRB 20250316A. This dichotomy highlights the challenge in characterizing the tail of the FRB luminosity function with limited data. Although less extreme in recurrence time than the ``Brightest Of All Time'' gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A, FRB 20250316A constitutes a similarly exceptional event (a potential FRB ``BOAT'') within the short observational history of wide-field radio surveys. Our results underscore the existence of rare, highly luminous events that may probe the upper limits or distinct sub-populations of the FRB luminosity distribution."

Most existing debiasing methods adopt a suppressive paradigm by modifying parameters, prompts, or neurons associated with biased behavior; however, such approaches are often brittle, weakly generalizable, data-inefficient, and prone to degrading general capability. We propose \\textbf{KnowBias}, a lightweight and conceptually distinct framework that mitigates bias by strengthening, rather than suppressing, neurons encoding bias-knowledge. KnowBias identifies neurons encoding bias knowledge using a small set of bias-knowledge questions via attribution-based analysis, and selectively enhances them at inference time. This design enables strong debiasing while preserving general capabilities, generalizes across bias types and demographics, and is highly data efficient, requiring only a handful of simple yes/no questions and no retraining. Experiments across multiple benchmarks and LLMs demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art debiasing performance with minimal utility degradation.

In multi-vector retrieval systems, both queries and documents are encoded using one embedding for each token, and similarity between queries and documents is measured by the MaxSim similarity measure. However, the improved recall of multi-vector retrieval comes at the expense of significantly increased latency. This necessitates designing efficient approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) algorithms for multi-vector search. In this work, we introduce LEMUR, a simple-yet-efficient framework for multi-vector similarity search. LEMUR consists of two consecutive problem reductions: We first formulate multi-vector similarity search as a supervised learning problem that can be solved using a one-hidden-layer neural network. Second, we reduce inference under this model to single-vector similarity search in its latent space, which enables the use of existing single-vector ANNS methods for speeding up retrieval. In addition to performance evaluation on ColBERTv2 embeddings, we evaluate LEMUR on embeddings generated by modern multi-vector text models and multi-vector visual document retrieval models. LEMUR is an order of magnitude faster than earlier multi-vector similarity search methods."

DiDAE first edits foundation model embeddings in interpretable disentangled directions of the disentangled dictionary and then decodes them via a diffusion autoencoder. This allows the generation of multiple diverse, disentangled counterfactuals for each factual, much faster than existing baselines, which generate single entangled counterfactuals.

The broader electron density profile near the secondary X-point leads to additional plasma-neutral interactions, evidenced by a broader hydrogenic emission profile, and resulting in larger power and ion sinks. The increase in plasma-neutral interactions also leads to lower target electron temperatures and heat fluxes. These benefits appear to extend to transients, and preliminary evidence of improved ELM buffering in the XPT is presented. These results showcase how multiple alternative divertor configuration strategies can be combined to improve momentum, power, and particle losses, which may be required for the challenging exhaust conditions of future reactors."

To overcome this bottleneck, we introduce error-detectable universal control of bosonic modes, wherein ancilla relaxation events are detected and the corresponding trajectories discarded, thereby suppressing operational errors on logical qubits. For binomial codes, we demonstrate universal gates with fidelities exceeding $99.6\\%$ and QEC gains of $8.33\\times$ beyond break-even.

However, ensuring the desired level of accuracy for a certain task at minimal computational cost, e.g. as few black-box samples as possible, remains a challenges. Active learning strategies are used for scalar quantities to overcome this challenges and different so-called infill criteria exists and are commonly employed in several scenarios. Even though needed in various field an extension of active learning strategies towards field predictions is still lacking or limited to very specific scenarios and/or model types. In this paper we propose an active learning strategy for machine learning models that are capable if predicting field which is agnostic to the model architecture itself. For doing so, we combine a well-established Gaussian process model for a scalar reference value and simultaneously aim at reducing the epistemic model error and the difference between scalar and field predictions. Different specific forms of the above-mentioned approach are introduced and compared to each other as well as only scalar-valued based infill. Results are presented for the NASA common research model for an uncertainty propagation task showcasing high level of accuracy at significantly smaller cost compared to an approach without active learning."

We provide an evaluation protocol and report baseline results for a range of contemporary vision-language models.

    "abstract": "Determinism is indispensable for reproducibility in large language model (LLM) training, yet it often exacts a steep performance cost. In widely used attention implementations such as FlashAttention-3, the deterministic backward pass can incur up to a 37.9% throughput reduction relative to its non-deterministic counterpart, primarily because gradient accumulation operations must be serialized to guarantee numerical consistency. This performance loss stems from suboptimal scheduling of compute and gradient-reduction phases, leading to significant hardware underutilization. To address this challenge, we formulate the backward pass of deterministic attention as a scheduling problem on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and derive schedules that minimize the critical path length. Building on this formulation, we present DASH (Deterministic Attention Scheduling for High-Throughput), which encapsulates two complementary scheduling strategies: (i) Descending Q-Tile Iteration, a reversed query-block traversal that shrinks pipeline stalls in causal attention, and (ii) Shift Scheduling, a theoretically optimal schedule within our DAG model that reduces pipeline stalls for both full and causal masks. Our empirical evaluations on NVIDIA H800 GPUs demonstrate that DASH narrows the performance gap of deterministic attention.

    "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are highly energy-efficient due to event-driven, sparse computation, but their training is challenged by spike non-differentiability and trade-offs among performance, efficiency, and biological plausibility. Crucially, mainstream SNNs ignore predictive coding, a core cortical mechanism where the brain predicts inputs and encodes errors for efficient perception. Inspired by this, we propose a self-prediction enhanced spiking neuron method that generates an internal prediction current from its input-output history to modulate membrane potential. This design offers dual advantages, it creates a continuous gradient path that alleviates vanishing gradients and boosts training stability and accuracy, while also aligning with biological principles, which resembles distal dendritic modulation and error-driven synaptic plasticity. Experiments show consistent performance gains across diverse architectures, neuron types, time steps, and tasks demonstrating broad applicability for enhancing SNNs."

    "abstract": "Endotracheal suctioning (ES) is an invasive yet essential clinical procedure that requires a high degree of skill to minimize patient risk - particularly in home care and educational settings, where consistent supervision may be limited. Despite its critical importance, automated recognition and feedback systems for ES training remain underexplored. To address this gap, this study proposes a unified, LLM-centered framework for video-based activity recognition benchmarked against conventional machine learning and deep learning approaches, and a pilot study on feedback generation. Within this framework, the Large Language Model (LLM) serves as the central reasoning module, performing both spatiotemporal activity recognition and explainable decision analysis from video data. Furthermore, the LLM is capable of verbalizing feedback in natural language, thereby translating complex technical insights into accessible, human-understandable guidance for trainees. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LLM-based approach outperforms baseline models, achieving an improvement of approximately 15-20\\% in both accuracy and F1 score. Beyond recognition, the framework incorporates a pilot student-support module built upon anomaly detection and explainable AI (XAI) principles, which provides automated, interpretable feedback highlighting correct actions and suggesting targeted improvements. Collectively, these contributions establish a scalable, interpretable, and data-driven foundation for advancing nursing education, enhancing training efficiency, and ultimately improving patient safety."

    "abstract": "Internet memes have become pervasive carriers of digital culture on social platforms. However, their heavy reliance on metaphors and sociocultural context also makes them subtle vehicles for harmful content, posing significant challenges for automated content moderation. Existing approaches primarily focus on intra-modal and inter-modal signal analysis, while the understanding of implicit toxicity often depends on background knowledge that is not explicitly present in the meme itself. To address this challenge, we propose KID, a Knowledge-Injected Dual-Head Learning framework for knowledge-grounded harmful meme detection. KID adopts a label-constrained distillation paradigm to decompose complex meme understanding into structured reasoning chains that explicitly link visual evidence, background knowledge, and classification labels. These chains guide the learning process by grounding external knowledge in meme-specific contexts. In addition, KID employs a dual-head architecture that jointly optimizes semantic generation and classification objectives, enabling aligned linguistic reasoning while maintaining stable decision boundaries. Extensive experiments on five multilingual datasets spanning English, Chinese, and low-resource Bengali demonstrate that KID achieves SOTA performance on both binary and multi-label harmful meme detection tasks, improving over previous best methods by 2.1%--19.7% across primary evaluation metrics. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of knowledge injection and dual-head joint learning, highlighting their complementary contributions to robust and generalizable meme understanding.

We analyze the algebraic structure, finding the spacetime to be generically of Petrov type I, and investigate the equatorial dynamics of charged test particles and photons. Our analysis reveals that the external magnetic field $b$ induces a ``Lorentz shift'' in the effective angular momentum, suppressing the potential barrier and causing the Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO) to migrate inward. In contrast, the radius of the photon ring shifts slightly outward with increasing magnetization."

    "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) can achieve competitive performance by converting already existing well-trained Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), avoiding further costly training. This property is particularly attractive in Reinforcement Learning (RL), where training through environment interaction is expensive and potentially unsafe. However, existing conversion methods perform poorly in continuous control, where suitable baselines are largely absent. We identify error amplification as the key cause: small action approximation errors become temporally correlated across decision steps, inducing cumulative state distribution shift and severe performance degradation. To address this issue, we propose Cross-Step Residual Potential Initialization (CRPI), a lightweight training-free mechanism that carries over residual membrane potentials across decision steps to suppress temporally correlated errors. Experiments on continuous control benchmarks with both vector and visual observations demonstrate that CRPI can be integrated into existing conversion pipelines and substantially recovers lost performance. Our results highlight continuous control as a critical and challenging benchmark for ANN-to-SNN conversion, where small errors can be strongly amplified and impact performance."

Our framework introduces scattering maps prescribed on two classes of hypersurfaces: a gravitational singularity hypersurface and a fluid-discontinuity hypersurface. By analyzing the causal structures induced by the light cone and the acoustic cone, we formulate a local evolution problem for the Einstein-Euler system in the presence of such interfaces. We explain how suitable scattering relations must supplement the field equations in order to ensure uniqueness and thus yield a complete macroscopic description of the evolution. This viewpoint builds on a theory developed in collaboration with G. Veneziano for quiescent (velocity-dominated) singularities in solutions of the Einstein equations coupled to a scalar field, where the passage across the singular hypersurface is encoded by a singularity scattering map. The guiding question is to identify junction prescriptions that are compatible with the Einstein and Euler equations, in particular with the propagation of constraints. The outcome is a rigid set of universal relations, together with a family of model-dependent parameters. Under physically motivated requirements (general covariance, causality, constraint compatibility, and ultra-locality), we aim to classify admissible scattering relations arising from microscopic physics and characterizing, at the macroscopic level, the dynamics of a fluid coupled to Einstein gravity."

The Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will deliver multi-band light curves for millions of AGN, enabling variability studies at a true population scale. We synthesize recent results from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), which demonstrate that optical variability amplitudes and timescales are primarily regulated by accretion state, with secondary dependence on black hole mass and redshift, and establish the feasibility of survey-driven continuum reverberation mapping. ZTF measurements reveal optical continuum-emitting region sizes that often exceed standard thin disk predictions, implicating diffuse continuum emission from the broad line region as a significant contributor to observed inter-band lags. We evaluate the implications of LSST cadence and survey strategy, particularly the deep drilling fields, for continuum and emission line reverberation mapping, changing-look AGN, extreme variability quasars, and periodic variability searches. Key limitations of broadband photometric variability are identified, including variable emission line contamination, diffuse BLR continuum emission, and cadence-dependent lag recoverability. We argue that realizing LSST's full scientific potential requires community-scale, standardized variability metric pipelines, probabilistic classification integrated with alert brokers for follow-up triggering, and complementary medium-band photometric observations to isolate the accretion disk continuum. Together, these elements will enable LSST to convert photometric variability into quantitative constraints on accretion disks, BLR structure, and supermassive black hole growth across cosmic time."

This, in turn, allows the development of an efficient coordinate ascent variational inference algorithm to find the optimal values of the variational parameters. The approach produces posterior inclusion probabilities and parameter estimates, enabling interpretable selection and prediction within a single framework.

We introduce SONIC-O1, a comprehensive, fully human-verified benchmark spanning 13 real-world conversational domains with 4,958 annotations and demographic metadata. SONIC-O1 evaluates MLLMs on key tasks, including open-ended summarization, multiple-choice question (MCQ) answering, and temporal localization with supporting rationales (reasoning). Experiments on closed- and open-source models reveal limitations. While the performance gap in MCQ accuracy between two model families is relatively small, we observe a substantial 22.6% performance difference in temporal localization between the best performing closed-source and open-source models. Performance further degrades across demographic groups, indicating persistent disparities in model behavior.

Small Language Models (SLMs) offer dramatic cost savings yet lag substantially in accuracy. Existing approaches - routing and cascading - treat the LLM as an all-or-nothing resource: either the query bypasses the LLM entirely, or the LLM generates a complete response at full cost. We introduce LLM Shepherding, a framework that requests only a short prefix (a hint) from the LLM and provides it to SLM. This simple mechanism is surprisingly effective for math and coding tasks: even hints comprising 10-30% of the full LLM response improve SLM accuracy significantly. Shepherding generalizes both routing and cascading, and it achieves lower cost under oracle decision-making. We develop a two-stage predictor that jointly determines whether a hint is needed and how many tokens to request. On the widely-used mathematical reasoning (GSM8K, CNK12) and code generation (HumanEval, MBPP) benchmarks, Shepherding reduces costs by 42-94% relative to LLM-only inference. Compared to state-of-the-art routing and cascading baselines, shepherding delivers up to 2.8x cost reduction while matching accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the first work to exploit token-level budget control for SLM-LLM collaboration."

We refined the photometry of the TOI-4342 system using TESS and LCOGT data, and characterized the host stars with NIRPS and ESPRESSO spectroscopy. High-precision ESPRESSO radial velocities allowed us to constrain the planetary masses and investigate their potential compositions. The TOI-4336 A system is composed of a sub-Neptune with a period of 16.34 days, a radius of $2.14 \\pm 0.08$ Re, and a mass of $3.33 \\pm 0.36$ Me, along with an inner super-Earth on a 7.59-day orbit with a radius of $1.25 \\pm 0.07$ Re and a mass of $1.55 \\pm 0.13$ Me. The TOI-4342 system hosts two sub-Neptunes of similar sizes ($2.33 \\pm 0.09$ Re and $2.35 \\pm 0.09$ Re), with periods of 5.54 and 10.69 days. Their masses are measured to be $7.3 \\pm 1.3$ Me and $4.8 \\pm 1.4$ Me, respectively. The RVs also reveal a planet candidate around TOI-4342, likely non-transiting, with a period of 47.5 days and a minimum mass of $17.8 \\pm 3.0$ Me. With precise radii and masses, we derived bulk densities and explored possible compositions.

All four planets are excellent targets for future atmospheric characterization with JWST, and their multi-planet nature makes them especially interesting for comparative planetology. Notably, TOI-4336 A b stands out as one of the best-known targets in its size and temperature regime, with a TSM of 138, comparable to benchmark planets such as K2-18 b and LHS 1140 b."

In practice, standard optimizers (e.g., gradient-based local search and evolutionary strategies) often converge to a single local optimum, overlooking many comparably good alternatives that matter for downstream engineering decisions. We propose the Lens Descriptor-Guided Evolutionary Algorithm (LDG-EA), a two-stage framework for multimodal lens optimization. LDG-EA first partitions the design space into behavior descriptors defined by curvature-sign patterns and material indices, then learns a probabilistic model over descriptors to allocate evaluations toward promising regions. Within each descriptor, LDG-EA applies the Hill-Valley Evolutionary Algorithm with covariance-matrix self-adaptation to recover multiple distinct local minima, optionally followed by gradient-based refinement. On a 24-variable (18 continuous and 6 integer), six-element Double-Gauss topology, LDG-EA generates on average around 14500 candidate minima spanning 636 unique descriptors, an order of magnitude more than a CMA-ES baseline, while keeping wall-clock time at one hour scale. Although the best LDG-EA design is slightly worse than a fine-tuned reference lens, it remains in the same performance range. Overall, the proposed LDG-EA produces a diverse set of solutions while maintaining competitive quality within practical computational budgets and wall-clock time."

    "abstract": "The Segment Anything Model has revolutionized image segmentation with its zero-shot capabilities, yet its reliance on manual prompts hinders fully automated deployment. While integrating object detectors as prompt generators offers a pathway to automation, existing pipelines suffer from two fundamental limitations: objective mismatch, where detectors optimized for geometric localization do not correspond to the optimal prompting context required by SAM, and alignment overfitting in standard joint training, where the detector simply memorizes specific prompt adjustments for training samples rather than learning a generalizable policy. To bridge this gap, we introduce BLO-Inst, a unified framework that aligns detection and segmentation objectives by bi-level optimization. We formulate the alignment as a nested optimization problem over disjoint data splits. In the lower level, the SAM is fine-tuned to maximize segmentation fidelity given the current detection proposals on a subset ($D_1$). In the upper level, the detector is updated to generate bounding boxes that explicitly minimize the validation loss of the fine-tuned SAM on a separate subset ($D_2$). This effectively transforms the detector into a segmentation-aware prompt generator, optimizing the bounding boxes not just for localization accuracy, but for downstream mask quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BLO-Inst achieves superior performance, outperforming standard baselines on tasks in general and biomedical domains."

    "abstract": "Urban mobility systems are transitioning toward electric, on-demand services, creating operational challenges for fleet management under energy and service-quality constraints. The Electric Dial-a-Ride Problem (E-DARP) extends the classical dial-a-ride problem by incorporating limited battery capacity and nonlinear charging dynamics, increasing computational complexity and limiting the scalability of exact methods for real-time use. This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning approach based on a graph neural network encoder and an attention-driven route construction policy. By operating directly on edge attributes such as travel time and energy consumption, the method captures non-Euclidean, asymmetric, and energy-dependent routing costs in real road networks. The learned policy jointly optimizes routing, charging, and service quality without relying on Euclidean assumptions or handcrafted heuristics. The approach is evaluated on two case studies using ride-sharing data from San Francisco. On benchmark instances, the method achieves solutions within 0.4% of best-known results while reducing computation times by orders of magnitude. A second case study considers large-scale instances with up to 250 request pairs, realistic energy models, and nonlinear charging. On these instances, the learned policy outperforms Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) by 9.5% in solution quality while achieving 100% service completion, with sub-second inference times compared to hours for the metaheuristic. Finally, sensitivity analyses quantify the impact of battery capacity, fleet size, ride-sharing capacity, and reward weights, while robustness experiments show that deterministically trained policies generalize effectively under stochastic conditions."

    "abstract": "Confinement strongly influences electrochemical systems, where structural control has enabled advances in nanofluidics, sensing, and energy storage. In electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs), or supercapacitors, energy density is governed by the accessible surface area of porous electrodes. Continuum models, built on first-principles transport equations, have provided critical insight into electrolyte dynamics under confinement but have largely focused on pores with straight walls. In such geometries, a fundamental trade-off emerges: wider pores charge faster but store less energy, while narrower pores store more charge but charge slowly. Here, we apply perturbation analysis to the Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equations for a single pore of gradually varying radius, focusing on the small potential and slender aspect ratio regime. Our analysis reveals that sloped pore walls induce an additional ionic flux, enabling simultaneous acceleration of charging and enhancement of charge storage. The theoretical predictions closely agree with direct numerical simulations while reducing computational cost by 5-6 orders of magnitude. We further propose a modified effective circuit representation that captures geometric variation along the pore and demonstrate how the framework can be integrated into pore-network models. This work establishes a scalable approach to link pore geometry with double-layer dynamics and offers new design principles for optimizing supercapacitor performance."

    "abstract": "Instruction following aims to align Large Language Models (LLMs) with human intent by specifying explicit constraints on how tasks should be performed. However, we reveal a counterintuitive phenomenon: instruction following can paradoxically interfere with LLMs' task-solving capability. We propose a metric, SUSTAINSCORE, to quantify the interference of instruction following with task solving. It measures task performance drop after inserting into the instruction a self-evident constraint, which is naturally met by the original successful model output and extracted from it. Experiments on current LLMs in mathematics, multi-hop QA, and code generation show that adding the self-evident constraints leads to substantial performance drops, even for advanced models such as Claude-Sonnet-4.5. We validate the generality of the interference across constraint types and scales. Furthermore, we identify common failure patterns, and by investigating the mechanisms of interference, we observe that failed cases allocate significantly more attention to constraints compared to successful ones. Finally, we use SUSTAINSCORE to conduct an initial investigation into how distinct post-training paradigms affect the interference, presenting empirical observations on current alignment strategies. We will release our code and data to facilitate further research"

Augmenting agents with predictions can overcome this temporal myopia, yet uptake in networking is scarce because forecast-aware agents act as closed-boxes; operators cannot tell whether predictions guide decisions or justify the added complexity. We propose SIA, the first interpreter that exposes in real time how forecast-augmented DRL agents operate. SIA fuses Symbolic AI abstractions with per-KPI Knowledge Graphs to produce explanations, and includes a new Influence Score metric. SIA achieves sub-millisecond speed, over 200x faster than existing XAI methods. We evaluate SIA on three diverse networking use cases, uncovering hidden issues, including temporal misalignment in forecast integration and reward-design biases that trigger counter-productive policies. These insights enable targeted fixes: a redesigned agent achieves a 9% higher average bitrate in video streaming, and SIA's online Action-Refinement module improves RAN-slicing reward by 25% without retraining. By making anticipatory DRL transparent and tunable, SIA lowers the barrier to proactive control in next-generation mobile networks."

By means of an empirical power-law fit, Leviathan exhibits a markedly superior effective parameter capacity.

    "abstract": "Autoregressive (AR) language models enforce a fixed left-to-right generation order, creating a fundamental limitation when the required output structure conflicts with natural reasoning (e.g., producing answers before explanations due to presentation or schema constraints). In such cases, AR models must commit to answers before generating intermediate reasoning, and this rigid constraint forces premature commitment. Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs), which iteratively refine all tokens in parallel, offer a way to decouple computation order from output structure. We validate this capability on GSM8K, Math500, and ReasonOrderQA, a benchmark we introduce with controlled difficulty and order-level evaluation. When prompts request answers before reasoning, AR models exhibit large accuracy gaps compared to standard chain-of-thought ordering (up to 67% relative drop), while MDLMs remain stable ($\\leq$14% relative drop), a property we term \"order robustness\". Using ReasonOrderQA, we present evidence that MDLMs achieve order robustness by stabilizing simpler tokens (e.g., reasoning steps) earlier in the diffusion process than complex ones (e.g., final answers), enabling reasoning tokens to stabilize before answer commitment. Finally, we identify failure conditions where this advantage weakens, outlining the limits required for order robustness."

    "abstract": "We introduce a new multivariate statistical problem that we refer to as the Ensemble Inverse Problem (EIP). The aim of EIP is to invert for an ensemble that is distributed according to the pushforward of a prior under a forward process. In high energy physics (HEP), this is related to a widely known problem called unfolding, which aims to reconstruct the true physics distribution of quantities, such as momentum and angle, from measurements that are distorted by detector effects. In recent applications, the EIP also arises in full waveform inversion (FWI) and inverse imaging with unknown priors. We propose non-iterative inference-time methods that construct posterior samplers based on a new class of conditional generative models, which we call ensemble inverse generative models. For the posterior modeling, these models additionally use the ensemble information contained in the observation set on top of single measurements. Unlike existing methods, our proposed methods avoid explicit and iterative use of the forward model at inference time via training across several sets of truth-observation pairs that are consistent with the same forward model, but originate from a wide range of priors. We demonstrate that this training procedure implicitly encodes the likelihood model. The use of ensemble information helps posterior inference and enables generalization to unseen priors. We benchmark the proposed method on several synthetic and real datasets in inverse imaging, HEP, and FWI.

We introduce CLReg, a contrastive representation regularizer that identifies forget features while pushing them away from retain features, explicitly reducing forget-retain interference with minimal shifts on retain features. We provide first theoretical insights that relate representation shaping to entanglement reduction. Across unlearning benchmarks and LLMs of different sizes, CLReg decreases forget-retain representation entanglement that facilitates mainstream unlearning methods without positing extra privacy risks, inspiring future work that reshapes the representation space to remove forget concepts."

These transformations can lead to forgetting by reducing the allocated capacity of features (worse representation) and disrupting their readout by downstream computations. Analysis of a tractable model formalizes this view, allowing us to identify best- and worst-case scenarios. Through experiments on this model, we empirically test our formal analysis and highlight the detrimental effect of depth. Finally, we demonstrate how our framework can be used in the analysis of practical models through the use of Crosscoders. We present a case study of a Vision Transformer trained on sequential CIFAR-10. Our work provides a new, feature-centric vocabulary for continual learning."

This inference can be made more efficient by partitioning the process across multiple devices, which, in turn, requires compressing its intermediate representations. In this work, we introduce a principled rate-distortion-based framework for lossy compression that learns compact encodings that explicitly trade off bitrate against accuracy. Experiments on language benchmarks show that the proposed codec achieves substantial savings with improved accuracy in some cases, outperforming more complex baseline methods. We characterize and analyze the rate-distortion performance of transformers, offering a unified lens for understanding performance in representation coding. This formulation extends information-theoretic concepts to define the gap between rate and entropy, and derive some of its bounds. We further develop probably approximately correct (PAC)-style bounds for estimating this gap. For different architectures and tasks, we empirically demonstrate that their rates are driven by these bounds, adding to the explainability of the formulation."

Despite its practical significance, it remains underexplored, primarily due to the technical complexity of handling their entanglement and the paucity of theoretical foundations. In this paper, we begin by theoretically establishing the generalization bound for IDG, highlighting the role of posterior discrepancy and decision margin. This bound motivates us to focus on directly steering decision boundaries, marking a clear departure from existing methods. Subsequently, we technically propose a novel Negative-Dominant Contrastive Learning (NDCL) for IDG to enhance discriminability while enforce posterior consistency across domains. Specifically, inter-class decision-boundary separation is enhanced by placing greater emphasis on negatives as the primary signal in our contrastive learning, naturally amplifying gradient signals for minority classes to avoid the decision boundary being biased toward majority classes. Meanwhile, intra-class compactness is encouraged through a re-weighted cross-entropy strategy, and posterior consistency across domains is enforced through a prediction-central alignment strategy. Finally, rigorous yet challenging experiments on benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our NDCL. The code is available at https://github.com/Alrash/NDCL."

To overcome these vulnerabilities, we present the first adaptively robust sketches for resettable streams that maintain polylogarithmic space complexity in the stream length. Our framework supports (sub) linear statistics including $L_p$ moments for $p\\in[0,1]$ (in particular, Cardinality and Sum) and Bernstein statistics. We bypass strong impossibility results known for linear and composable sketches by designing dedicated streaming sketches robustified via Differential Privacy. Unlike standard robustification techniques, which provide limited benefits in this setting and still require polynomial space in the stream length, we leverage the Binary Tree Mechanism for continual observation to protect the sketch's internal randomness. This enables accurate prefix-max error guarantees with polylogarithmic space."

We introduce On-policy Verbal Distillation (OVD), a memory-efficient framework that replaces token-level probability matching with trajectory matching using discrete verbal scores (0--9) from teacher models. OVD dramatically reduces memory consumption while enabling on-policy distillation from teacher models with verbal feedback, and avoids token-level alignment, allowing the student model to freely explore the output space. Extensive experiments on Web question answering and mathematical reasoning tasks show that OVD substantially outperforms existing methods, delivering up to +12.9% absolute improvement in average EM on Web Q&A tasks and a up to +25.7% gain on math benchmarks (when trained with only one random samples), while also exhibiting superior training efficiency.

Among these, GPT-based molecular language models (MLM) have shown strong molecular design performance by learning chemical syntax and semantics from large-scale data. However, existing MLMs face two fundamental limitations: they inadequately capture the graph-structured nature of molecules when formulated as next-token prediction problems, and they typically lack explicit mechanisms for target-aware generation. Here, we propose SoftMol, a unified framework that co-designs molecular representation, model architecture, and search strategy for target-aware molecular generation. SoftMol introduces soft fragments, a rule-free block representation of SMILES that enables diffusion-native modeling, and develops SoftBD, the first block-diffusion molecular language model that combines local bidirectional diffusion with autoregressive generation under molecular structural constraints. To favor generated molecules with high drug-likeness and synthetic accessibility, SoftBD is trained on a carefully curated dataset named ZINC-Curated. SoftMol further integrates a gated Monte Carlo tree search to assemble fragments in a target-aware manner. Experimental results show that, compared with current state-of-the-art models, SoftMol achieves 100% chemical validity, improves binding affinity by 9.7%, yields a 2-3x increase in molecular diversity, and delivers a 6.6x speedup in inference efficiency.

However, modeling long, domain-specific clinical text remains challenging due to limited labeled data, severe class imbalance, and the high computational cost of adapting large pretrained language models. This study presents a GPT-based architecture for clinical text classification that adapts a pretrained decoder-only Transformer using a selective fine-tuning strategy. Rather than updating all model parameters, the majority of the GPT-2 backbone is frozen, and training is restricted to the final Transformer block, the final layer normalization, and a lightweight classification head. This approach substantially reduces the number of trainable parameters while preserving the representational capacity required to model complex clinical language. The proposed method is evaluated on radiology reports from the MIMIC-IV-Note dataset using uncertainty-aware CheXpert-style labels derived directly from report text. Experiments cover multiple problem formulations, including multi-label classification of radiographic findings, binary per-label classification under different uncertainty assumptions, and aggregate disease outcome prediction. Across varying dataset sizes, the model exhibits stable convergence behavior and strong classification performance, particularly in settings dominated by non-mention and negated findings. Overall, the results indicate that selective fine-tuning of pretrained generative language models provides an efficient and effective pathway for clinical text classification, enabling scalable adaptation to real-world EHR data while significantly reducing computational complexity."

    "abstract": "Prevalent retrieval-based tool-use pipelines struggle with a dual semantic challenge: their retrievers often employ encoders that fail to capture complex semantics, while the Large Language Model (LLM) itself lacks intrinsic tool knowledge from its natural language pretraining. Generative methods offer a powerful alternative by unifying selection and execution, tasking the LLM to directly learn and generate tool identifiers. However, the common practice of mapping each tool to a unique new token introduces substantial limitations: it creates a scalability and generalization crisis, as the vocabulary size explodes and each tool is assigned a semantically isolated token. This approach also creates a semantic bottleneck that hinders the learning of collaborative tool relationships, as the model must infer them from sparse co-occurrences of monolithic tool IDs within a vast library. To address these limitations, we propose ToolWeaver, a novel generative tool learning framework that encodes tools into hierarchical sequences. This approach makes vocabulary expansion logarithmic to the number of tools. Crucially, it enables the model to learn collaborative patterns from the dense co-occurrence of shared codes, rather than the sparse co-occurrence of monolithic tool IDs. We generate these structured codes through a novel tokenization process designed to weave together a tool's intrinsic semantics with its extrinsic co-usage patterns. These structured codes are then integrated into the LLM through a generative alignment stage, where the model is fine-tuned to produce the hierarchical code sequences. Evaluation results with nearly 47,000 tools show that ToolWeaver significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, establishing a more scalable, generalizable, and semantically-aware foundation for advanced tool-augmented agents."

In this work, we focus on Concept Bottleneck Models and investigate how different modeling decisions affect the emerging representations. We introduce the notion of clarity, a measure, capturing the interplay between the downstream performance and the sparsity and precision of the concept representation, while proposing an interpretability assessment framework using datasets with ground truth concept annotations. We consider both VLM- and attribute predictor-based CBMs, and three different sparsity-inducing strategies: per example $\\ell_1, \\ell_0$ and Bernoulli-based formulations. Our experiments reveal a critical trade-off between flexibility and interpretability, under which a given method can exhibit markedly different behaviors even at comparable performance levels.

    "abstract": "Medical multimodal representation learning aims to integrate heterogeneous data into unified patient representations to support clinical outcome prediction. However, real-world medical datasets commonly contain systematic biases from multiple sources, which poses significant challenges for medical multimodal representation learning. Existing approaches typically focus on effective multimodal fusion, neglecting inherent biased features that affect the generalization ability. To address these challenges, we propose a Dual-Stream Feature Decorrelation Framework that identifies and handles the biases through structural causal analysis introduced by latent confounders. Our method employs a causal-biased decorrelation framework with dual-stream neural networks to disentangle causal features from spurious correlations, utilizing generalized cross-entropy loss and mutual information minimization for effective decorrelation. The framework is model-agnostic and can be integrated into existing medical multimodal learning methods. Comprehensive experiments on MIMIC-IV, eICU, and ADNI datasets demonstrate consistent performance improvements."

    "abstract": "We introduce AgenticSimLaw, a role-structured, multi-agent debate framework that provides transparent and controllable test-time reasoning for high-stakes tabular decision-making tasks. Unlike black-box approaches, our courtroom-style orchestration explicitly defines agent roles (prosecutor, defense, judge), interaction protocols (7-turn structured debate), and private reasoning strategies, creating a fully auditable decision-making process. We benchmark this framework on young adult recidivism prediction using the NLSY97 dataset, comparing it against traditional chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting across almost 90 unique combinations of models and strategies. Our results demonstrate that structured multi-agent debate provides more stable and generalizable performance compared to single-agent reasoning, with stronger correlation between accuracy and F1-score metrics. Beyond performance improvements, AgenticSimLaw offers fine-grained control over reasoning steps, generates complete interaction transcripts for explainability, and enables systematic profiling of agent behaviors. While we instantiate this framework in the criminal justice domain to stress-test reasoning under ethical complexity, the approach generalizes to any deliberative, high-stakes decision task requiring transparency and human oversight. This work addresses key LLM-based multi-agent system challenges: organization through structured roles, observability through logged interactions, and responsibility through explicit non-deployment constraints for sensitive domains.

We describe an algorithm for explicitly computing values of these $L$-functions, demonstrating implementations in the cases of certain curves with actions by $C_3$, $C_4$ and $D_{10}$. We explain how this algorithm can be used to factor $L$-functions of curves with endomorphisms of Hecke type. Towards applications, we explicitly formulate and numerically verify a version of Deligne's Period Conjecture for hitherto-uninvestigated $L$-functions arising from motivic pieces of superelliptic curves."

    "abstract": "Diffusion-based visuomotor policies built on 3D visual representations have achieved strong performance in learning complex robotic skills. However, most existing methods employ an oversized denoising decoder. While increasing model capacity can improve denoising, empirical evidence suggests that it also introduces redundancy and noise in intermediate feature blocks. Crucially, we find that randomly masking backbone features at inference time (without changing training) can improve performance, confirming the presence of task-irrelevant noise in intermediate features. To this end, we propose Variational Regularization (VR), a lightweight module that imposes a timestep-conditioned Gaussian over backbone features and applies a KL-divergence regularizer, forming an adaptive information bottleneck. Extensive experiments on three simulation benchmarks (RoboTwin2.0, Adroit, and MetaWorld) show that, compared to the baseline DP3, our approach improves the success rate by 6.1% on RoboTwin2.0 and by 4.1% on Adroit and MetaWorld, achieving new state-of-the-art results. Real-world experiments further demonstrate that our method performs well in practical deployments. Code will released."

The method leverages pre-computed QAOA angles, derived from depth-$p$ QAOA circuits on regular trees, to compute local expectation values and inform sequential greedy decisions that progressively build an independent set. This hybrid approach maintains shallow quantum circuit and avoids instance-specific parameter training, making it well-suited for implementation on current quantum hardware: we have implemented the algorithm on a 20 qubit IQM superconducting device to find independent sets in graphs with thousands of nodes. We perform tensor network simulations to evaluate the performance of the algorithm beyond the reach of current quantum hardware and compare to established classical heuristics. Our results show that even at low depth ($p=4$), the quantum-enhanced greedy method significantly outperforms purely classical greedy baselines as well as more sophisticated approximation algorithms. The modular structure of the algorithm and relatively low quantum resource requirements make it a compelling candidate for scalable, hybrid optimization in the NISQ era and beyond."

However, the capability of video aesthetic quality assessment, which is a fundamental ability for human, remains underexplored for LMMs. To address this, we introduce VideoAesBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LMMs' understanding of video aesthetic quality. VideoAesBench has several significant characteristics: (1) Diverse content including 1,804 videos from multiple video sources including user-generated (UGC), AI-generated (AIGC), compressed, robotic-generated (RGC), and game videos. (2) Multiple question formats containing traditional single-choice questions, multi-choice questions, True or False questions, and a novel open-ended questions for video aesthetics description. (3) Holistic video aesthetics dimensions including visual form related questions from 5 aspects, visual style related questions from 4 aspects, and visual affectiveness questions from 3 aspects. Based on VideoAesBench, we benchmark 23 open-source and commercial large multimodal models. Our findings show that current LMMs only contain basic video aesthetics perception ability, their performance remains incomplete and imprecise. We hope our VideoAesBench can be served as a strong testbed and offer insights for explainable video aesthetics assessment."

While measuring energy consumption and observing trends is a valuable first step, accurately understanding and diagnosing why those differences occur is crucial for optimization. To that end, we begin by presenting a large-scale measurement study of inference time and energy across the generative AI landscape with 46 models, 7 tasks, and 1,858 different configurations on NVIDIA H100 and B200 GPUs. Our empirical findings span order-of-magnitude variations: LLM task type can lead to 25$\\times$ energy differences, video generation sometimes consumes more than 100$\\times$ the energy of images, and GPU utilization differences can result in 3--5$\\times$ energy differences. Based on our observations, we present a framework for reasoning about the underlying mechanisms that govern time and energy consumption. The essence is that time and energy are determined by latent metrics like memory and utilization, which are in turn affected by various factors across the algorithm, software, and hardware layers. Our framework also extends directly to throughput per watt, a critical metric for power-constrained datacenters."

The resulting luminosity function is well described by a Schechter function with a characteristic magnitude $M^* = -21.30 \\pm 0.27$ and a faint-end slope $α= -1.23 \\pm 0.05$. This faint-end slope is consistent with those measured in the nearby Coma and Virgo clusters and in a cluster from the TNG50 cosmological simulation, and is slightly shallower than that of field galaxies. These findings indicate that the previously claimed steep faint-end upturn (with $α\\sim -2$) in nearby galaxy clusters is not supported. Instead, they indicate that environmental processes in dense cluster cores does not seem to trigger the formation or survival of low-mass galaxies, thereby preventing a steep faint-end upturn in the luminosity function."

The cascade is organized as a rooted tree that specifies the order in which tasks are learned and refined. We design a cascaded transfer mechanism deployed over a minimum spanning tree structure that connects the tasks according to a suitable distance measure, and allocates the available training budget along its branches. Experiments on synthetic and real many-task settings show that the resulting method enables more accurate and cost effective adaptation across large task collections compared to alternative approaches."

The method is based on the insertion of a laser with a scanned frequency and the detection of all the electrical and optical signals obtained from the instrument. The spectra calculated from these signals show fringes due to interference between each stray light contribution and the nominal beam. The frequency of these interference peaks indicates the difference in path length between the stray light path and the nominal path. To have a description of the measured data we realized optical simulations, which link the measured path length to a possible path throughout the system. In the following, we will show some measurements made on a test bench realized to simulate the performance of LISA interferometers and describe how accurate simulations are in predicting and explaining the measured results."

Ten case-based patterns illustrate how AI support of predictive maintenance can be organized to address quality assurance and continuous improvement and to provide different types of sup-port for HCAI. The analysis shows that AI adoption often requires and enables new forms of organizational learning, where specialists jointly interpret AI output, adapt workflows, and refine rules for system improve-ment. Different dimensions and levels of socio-technical integration of AI are considered to reflect the effort and benefits of keeping the organization in the loop."

    "abstract": "We investigate the superintegrability of rigid body rotors coupled to planar systems. In particular, we study the isotropic harmonic oscillator in two dimensions, with its (central) force acting on the rotor's center of mass constrained to move in the plane. By including an internal rotational degree of freedom described by a rigid rotor, the resulting planar system possesses three degrees of freedom: two translational and one rotational. When the orbital motion and the internal rotation are tuned to resonance, additional integrals of motion arise, extending the hidden symmetry algebras of the underlying models. For the oscillator, the well-known $\\mathfrak{su}(2)$ symmetry algebra can be enlarged by the presence of the rotor, with the conserved momentum $p_θ$ reasonably playing the role of a deformation parameter. These algebraic structures remain to be properly understood, and we hope that this short letter will serve as an invitation to further investigate these interesting models. To close the work, we also examine the oscillator in a vertical plane, in the presence of a rotor, under the effect of a uniform gravitational field, showing that the algebraic structure persists as a translated version of the isotropic case, as expected. In all these settings, the extended dynamics admits five functionally independent integrals, thereby confirming maximal superintegrability. Our simple yet nontrivial results suggest that rigid-body rotors provide a natural mechanism for generating new families of (resonant) superintegrable systems, along with their associated symmetry algebras, an outcome that aligns with the main objective of this work."

Accurate predictions about the other group's use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) are fundamental for such trust. However, the disruptive rise of AI has transformed academic work practices, raising important questions about how teachers and students use these tools and how well they can estimate each other's usage. While the frequency of use is well studied, little is known about how AI is used, and comparisons with similar practices are rare. This study surveyed German university teachers (N = 113) and students (N = 123) on the frequency of AI use and the degree of delegation across six identical academic tasks. Participants also provided incentivized cross-sample predictions of the other group's AI use to assess the accuracy of their predictions. We find that students reported higher use of AI and greater delegation than teachers. Both groups significantly overestimated the other group's use, with teachers predicting very frequent use and high delegation by students, and students assuming teachers use AI similarly to themselves. These findings reveal a perception gap between teachers' and students' expectations and actual AI use. Such gaps may hinder trust and effective collaboration, underscoring the need for open dialogue about AI practices in academia and for policies that support the equitable and transparent integration of AI tools in higher education."

Based on this, our algorithm, Energy-Guided Test-Time Scaling (ETS), estimates the key energy term via online Monte Carlo, with a provable convergence rate. Moreover, to ensure practical efficiency, ETS leverages modern acceleration frameworks alongside tailored importance sampling estimators, substantially reducing inference latency while provably preserving sampling quality. Experiments on MLM (including autoregressive models and diffusion language models) across reasoning, coding, and science benchmarks show that our ETS consistently improves generation quality, validating its effectiveness and design."

Here, to address the challenge, we present a novel approach to construct differential causal networks directly from electroencephalogram (EEG) data. The proposed network is based on conditionally coupled neuronal circuits which describe the average behaviour of interacting neuron populations that contribute to observed EEG data. In the network, each node represents a parameterised local neural system while directed edges stand for node-wise connections with transmission parameters. The network is hierarchically structured in the sense that node and edge parameters are varying in subjects but follow a mixed-effects model. A novel evolutionary optimisation algorithm for parameter inference in the proposed method is developed using a loss function derived from Chen-Fliess expansions of stochastic differential equations. The method is demonstrated by application to the fitting of coupled Jansen-Rit local models. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on both synthetic and real EEG data. In the real EEG data analysis, we track changes in the parameters that characterise dynamic causality within brains that demonstrate epileptic activity. We show evidence of network functional disruptions, due to imbalance of excitatory-inhibitory interneurons and altered epileptic brain connectivity, before and during seizure periods."

This model captures settings such as language generation, where multiple responses may be valid but data provide only a single reference. We give a near-complete characterization of minimax regret for both deterministic and randomized learners in the set-realizable regime, i.e., in the regime where sublinear regret is generally attainable. For deterministic learners, we introduce the Partial-Feedback Littlestone dimension (PFLdim) and show it precisely governs learnability and minimax regret; technically, PFLdim cannot be defined via the standard version space, requiring a new collection version space viewpoint and an auxiliary dimension used only in the proof. We further develop the Partial-Feedback Measure Shattering dimension (PMSdim) to obtain tight bounds for randomized learners. We identify broad conditions ensuring inseparability between deterministic and randomized learnability (e.g., finite Helly number or nested-inclusion label structure), and extend the argument to set-valued online learning, resolving an open question of Raman et al. [2024b]. Finally, we show a sharp separation from weaker realistic and agnostic variants: outside set realizability, the problem can become information-theoretically intractable, with linear regret possible even for $|H|=2$. This highlights the need for fundamentally new, noise-sensitive complexity measures to meaningfully characterize learnability beyond set realizability."

This dependency prevents the model architecture from reusing native LLM vocabularies, resulting in high maintenance costs and poor scalability. In response, we aim to efficiently reuse open-source LLM architectures without constructing a separate tokenization vocabulary. Furthermore, we identify that the optimization strategy of OneRec Gradient Bounded Policy Optimization (GBPO),suffers from a \"Symmetric Conservatism\" problem: its static gradient boundaries structurally suppress the update momentum required for cold-start items and fail to prevent diversity collapse in high-noise environments.To address this issue, we propose SAGE (Sequence-level Adaptive Gradient Evolution), a unified optimization framework tailored for list-wise generative recommendation. SAGE introduces two key innovations:(1) Sequence-level Signal Decoupling: By combining a geometric mean importance ratio with decoupled multi-objective advantages, we eliminate token-level variance and resolve the \"Reward Collapse\" problem. (2) Asymmetric Adaptive Dynamics: We construct a dynamic gradient manifold that applies a \"Boost Factor\" to high-potential cold start items to achieve super-linear updates and employs an \"Entropy Aware Penalty\" to break information cocoons. Theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate that SAGE effectively unblocks cold-start traffic and sustains recommendation diversity, all while retaining the numerical stability of GBPO."

    "abstract": "The efficiency of long-video inference remains a critical bottleneck, mainly due to the dense computation in the prefill stage of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). Existing methods either compress visual embeddings or apply sparse attention on a single GPU, yielding limited acceleration or degraded performance and restricting LMMs from handling longer, more complex videos. To overcome these issues, we propose Spava, a sequence-parallel framework with optimized attention that accelerates long-video inference across multiple GPUs. By distributing approximate attention, Spava reduces computation and increases parallelism, enabling efficient processing of more visual embeddings without compression and thereby improving task performance. System-level optimizations, such as load balancing and fused forward passes, further unleash the potential of Spava, delivering speedups of 12.72x, 1.70x, and 1.18x over FlashAttn, ZigZagRing, and APB, without notable performance loss.

    "abstract": "The ability to steer polariton flow on-demand holds significant promise towards nanophotonic applications and photonic circuitry. Polariton canalization, exhibiting intrinsic collimation and diffractionless transport, emerges as a promising solution without guiding structures. However, earlier demonstrations have been restricted to certain crystal surfaces with intrinsic hyperbolic responses and operated in the linear regime. Here, we experimentally demonstrate canalization of nonlinear exciton polariton condensates with optical reconfigurability in a birefringent CsPbBr3 perovskite crystal without intrinsic hyperbolic response. By embedding the birefringent perovskite crystal into a planar microcavity, the interplay between cavity transverse-electric-transverse-magnetic splitting and crystalline birefringence produces an anisotropic band geometry with a hyperbolic-flat-parabolic evolution of polaritonic isofrequency contours (IFCs). Nonresonant pumping drives exciton polariton condensation onto flat far-field contours with nonlinear emission amplification, leading to coherent canalized flows with over twentyfold collimation with respect to arc-shaped contours. Reconfiguring the optical pumping-spot size allows switching the nonlinear polariton condensates into hyperbolic and parabolic IFC regimes, leading to divergent propagation behaviour with collimating reconfiguration. Our study reveals a distinct canalization framework for shaping the nonlinear exciton-polariton condensate flows, opening opportunities for all-optical polaritonic logic circuits based on stabilized nonlinear quantum interconnects."

However, amid the ongoing boom in AI research and applications, the translational synergy between these two fields has grown increasingly elusive-hampered by a widening infrastructural incompatibility: modern AI frameworks lack native support for biophysical realism, while neural simulation tools are poorly suited for gradient-based optimization and neuromorphic hardware deployment. To bridge this gap, we introduce BrainFuse, a unified infrastructure that provides comprehensive support for biophysical neural simulation and gradient-based learning. By addressing algorithmic, computational, and deployment challenges, BrainFuse exhibits three core capabilities: (1) algorithmic integration of detailed neuronal dynamics into a differentiable learning framework; (2) system-level optimization that accelerates customizable ion-channel dynamics by up to 3,000x on GPUs; and (3) scalable computation with highly compatible pipelines for neuromorphic hardware deployment. We demonstrate this full-stack design through both AI and neuroscience tasks, from foundational neuron simulation and functional cylinder modeling to real-world deployment and application scenarios. For neuroscience, BrainFuse supports multiscale biological modeling, enabling the deployment of approximately 38,000 Hodgkin-Huxley neurons with 100 million synapses on a single neuromorphic chip while consuming as low as 1.98 W. For AI, BrainFuse facilitates the synergistic application of realistic biological neuron models, demonstrating enhanced robustness to input noise and improved temporal processing endowed by complex HH dynamics. BrainFuse therefore serves as a foundational engine to facilitate cross-disciplinary research and accelerate the development of next-generation bio-inspired intelligent systems."

Existing data analytics agents are predominantly limited to processing structured data, failing to activate and correlate this high-value visual information, thus creating a significant gap with industrial needs. To bridge this gap, we introduce DataCross, a novel benchmark and collaborative agent framework for unified, insight-driven analysis across heterogeneous data modalities. DataCrossBench comprises 200 end-to-end analysis tasks across finance, healthcare, and other domains. It is constructed via a human-in-the-loop reverse-synthesis pipeline, ensuring realistic complexity, cross-source dependency, and verifiable ground truth. The benchmark categorizes tasks into three difficulty tiers to evaluate agents' capabilities in visual table extraction, cross-modal alignment, and multi-step joint reasoning. We also propose the DataCrossAgent framework, inspired by the \"divide-and-conquer\" workflow of human analysts. It employs specialized sub-agents, each an expert on a specific data source, which are coordinated via a structured workflow of Intra-source Deep Exploration, Key Source Identification, and Contextual Cross-pollination. A novel reReAct mechanism enables robust code generation and debugging for factual verification. Experimental results show that DataCrossAgent achieves a 29.7% improvement in factuality over GPT-4o and exhibits superior robustness on high-difficulty tasks, effectively activating fragmented \"zombie data\" for insightful, cross-modal analysis."

The resulting dataset contains 81 million locally relaxed crystal structures spanning 4495 ternary phase diagrams constructed from elements ranging from lithium to bromine and contains 88,498 crystal prototypes not present in existing crystal-structure databases. The methods are validated both for three well-explored materials systems, Zr-Zn-N, Ti-Zn-N, and Hf-Zn-N, and by comparing with known data for structures resulting from the larger screening.

Our method leverages a simulator to generate synthetic data, effectively addressing the issue of poor generalization caused by data scarcity. By employing a domain randomization technique, we reduce the distributional gap between synthetic and real data through bi-level optimization of both sample weighting and model training. Moreover, Sim-MSTNet incorporates attention-based mechanisms to selectively share knowledge between tasks and applies dynamic loss weighting to balance task objectives. Extensive experiments on two open-source datasets show that Sim-MSTNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving enhanced accuracy and generalization."

The structure consists of two regions with distinct phase responses, realized via spectral tuning of Mie-type resonances. This design enables simultaneous frequency conversion and spatial mode shaping, transforming a Gaussian pump near 1100 nm into a first-order Hermite-Gaussian mode at 550 nm, while maintaining the pump profile. The demonstrated approach offers a pathway toward ultracompact and tunable components for nonlinear holography and related applications."

    "abstract": "Recent studies of federated graph foundational models (FedGFMs) break the idealized and untenable assumption of having centralized data storage to train graph foundation models, and accommodate the reality of distributed, privacy-restricted data silos. Despite their simplicity and intuition, existing studies that project aligned generalizable knowledge onto a discrete token space via vector-quantized backbones suffer from irreversible knowledge loss during the quantization process. In this context, we argue that reconciling the semantic-structural orthogonality and integrity between pre-trained language models (PLMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) is paramount for developing effective FedGFMs while simultaneously mitigating the severe data heterogeneity and communication constraints inherent in distributed, resource-limited environments. To address these issues, we propose FedGALA (Federated Graph And Language Alignment), a framework that resolves graph-based semantic-structural orthogonality and integrity in federated settings by employing unsupervised contrastive learning to align GNNs and frozen PLMs within a continuous embedding space, thereby capturing robust, transferable general knowledge. Subsequently, FedGALA leverages a communication-efficient prompt tuning mechanism to steer these pre-aligned encoders and frozen PLMs, facilitating effective adaptation to diverse downstream tasks while circumventing the prohibitive overhead of full-parameter fine-tuning. The comprehensive experiments validate that FedGALA outperforms all competitive baselines across multi-domain datasets on multiple tasks with up to 14.37% performance improvement."

    "abstract": "This paper develops a unified theory of natural superconvergence points for polynomial spline approximations to second-order elliptic problems. Beginning with the one-dimensional case, we establish that when a point $x_0$ is a local symmetric center of the partition, the numerical error $(u-u_h)^{(s)}(x_0)$ exhibits superconvergence whenever the polynomial degree $k$ and the derivative order $s$ share the same parity. In particular, for the smoothest spline (B-spline) solution, the abundance of superconvergence points allows us to construct asymptotic expansion of the error within the element that fully characterize all superconvergence points, for both function values and derivatives. The theoretical framework is then extended to higher-dimensional settings on simplicial and tensor-product meshes, and the essential conclusions are preserved, with one-dimensional derivatives generalized to mixed derivatives. Numerical experiments demonstrate that superconvergence persists even in extremely localized symmetric regions, revealing that superconvergence points are both readily attainable and follow systematic distribution patterns."

In this article we study a combined framework of a tachyonic minimally coupled single scalar field theory in the presence of an $\\mathcal{R}^2$ correction term and with a rescaled Einstein-Hilbert term of the form $\\sim λ\\frac{\\mathcal{R}}{16πG}$. Such terms can be part of an $f(\\mathcal{R})$ gravity which in the large curvature regime yields such correction terms effectively. Alternatively, such terms can simply be quantum corrections to the scalar field action. We aim to answer two questions, firstly if this framework can lead to phantom divide line transitions and secondly whether the resulting model can be compatible with the ACT data. The model we studied is an inverse square power-law model, well known from tachyon inflation models. As we show, the field equations can be cast in terms of the scalar field solely, however the resulting theory is distinct from a single scalar field theory, because the phantom divide line is crossed during inflation. Thus initially the tachyonic nature of the scalar field generates a phantom equation of state parameter, and during inflation the phantom divide line is crossed, with the effective equation of state parameter at the end of inflation being $w=-1/3$ which corresponds to the non-accelerating state of the Universe. The model is proved to be compatible with the ACT data, only when the gravity during inflation is stronger than Einstein-Hilbert gravity, with the effective gravitational constant during inflation being $\\frac{G}λ$. The effective theory is valid only during inflation, thus Big-Bang nucleosynthesis is not affected by the rescaling of the Einstein-Hilbert gravity. The feature of a phantom crossing in $f(\\mathcal{R},φ)$ frameworks is new in the literature."

However, deploying these advanced models in latency-critical MVA scenarios presents significant challenges. Unlike traditional CNN-based offloading paradigms where network transmission is the primary bottleneck, ViT-based systems are constrained by substantial inference delays, particularly for dense prediction tasks where the need for high-resolution inputs exacerbates the inherent quadratic computational complexity of ViTs. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamic mixed-resolution inference strategy tailored for ViT-backboned dense prediction models, enabling flexible runtime trade-offs between speed and accuracy. Building on this, we introduce ViTMAlis, a ViT-native device-to-edge offloading framework that dynamically adapts to network conditions and video content to jointly reduce transmission and inference delays. We implement a fully functional prototype of ViTMAlis on commodity mobile and edge devices. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art accuracy-centric, content-aware, and latency-adaptive baselines, ViTMAlis significantly reduces end-to-end offloading latency while improving user-perceived rendering accuracy, providing a practical foundation for next-generation mobile intelligence."

However, these methods typically operate as opaque end-to-end mappings from explicit reasoning steps to latent states, and often require a pre-defined number of latent steps during inference. In this work, we introduce PLaT (Planning with Latent Thoughts), a framework that reformulates latent reasoning as planning by fundamentally decouple reasoning from verbalization. We model reasoning as a deterministic trajectory of latent planning states, while a separate Decoder grounds these thoughts into text when necessary. This decoupling allows the model to dynamically determine when to terminate reasoning rather than relying on fixed hyperparameters. Empirical results on mathematical benchmarks reveal a distinct trade-off: while PLaT achieves lower greedy accuracy than baselines, it demonstrates superior scalability in terms of reasoning diversity. This indicates that PLaT learns a robust, broader solution space, offering a transparent and scalable foundation for inference-time search."

As we demonstrate in a very detailed manner, this is impossible for a canonical and minimally coupled single scalar field theory, but it may be possible for ghost condensate theories like $k$-essence theories. We point out how the ghost instabilities may be eliminated, and we analyze the quantitative features of a $k$-essence theory that may realize a phantom-to-quintessence transition in the late Universe.

Of particular practical interest are checking confidentiality and integrity of secrets, by checking that there is no information flow between the secrets and observable outputs. A standard method for checking information flow is to translate the corresponding non-interference hyperproperty into a safety property on a self-composition of the design, which has two copies of the design composed together. Although prior efforts have aimed to reduce the size of the self-composed design, there are no state-of-the-art model checkers that exploit their special structure for hardware security verification. In this paper, we propose SecIC3, a hardware model checking algorithm based on IC3 that is customized to exploit this self-composition structure. SecIC3 utilizes this structure in two complementary techniques: symmetric state exploration and adding equivalence predicates. We implement SecIC3 on top of two open-source IC3 implementations and evaluate it on a non-interference checking benchmark consisting of 10 designs. The experiment results show that SecIC3 significantly reduces the time for finding security proofs, with up to 49.3x proof speedup compared to baseline implementations."

For this class, we show that bit-node and check-node combining can be tracked efficiently via closed-form recursions on the Gram-matrix eigenvalues, independent of the particular physical realization of the output states. These recursions yield explicit BPQM unitaries and analytic bounds on the fidelities of the combined channels in terms of the input-channel fidelities.

In this work, we analyze various methods of forming an alliance in the Coalitional General Lotto game, a simple model of competitive resource allocation. In the game, Players 1 and 2 independently compete against a common Adversary by allocating their limited resource budgets towards separate sets of contests; an agent wins a contest by allocating more resources towards it than their opponent. In this setting, we study three alliance mechanisms: budget transfers (resource donation), contest transfers (contest redistribution), and joint transfers (both simultaneously). For all three mechanisms, we study when they present opportunities for collective improvement (the sum of the Players' payoffs increases) or mutual improvement (both Players' individual payoffs increase). In our first result, we show that all three are fundamentally different with regards to mutual improvement; in particular, mutually beneficial budget and contest transfers exist in distinct, limited subsets of games, whereas mutually beneficial joint transfers exist in almost all games. However, in our second result, we demonstrate that all three mechanisms are equivalent when it comes to collective improvement; that is, collectively beneficial budget, contest, and joint transfers exist in almost all game instances, and all three mechanisms achieve the same maximum collective payoff. Together, these results demonstrate that differences between mechanisms depend fundamentally on the objective of the alliance."

    "abstract": "The rapid advance of Generative AI into software development prompts this empirical investigation of perceptual effects on practice. We study the usage patterns of 147 professional developers, examining perceived correlates of AI tools use, the resulting productivity and quality outcomes, and developer readiness for emerging AI-enhanced development. We describe a virtuous adoption cycle where frequent and broad AI tools use are the strongest correlates of both Perceived Productivity (PP) and quality, with frequency strongest. The study finds no perceptual support for the Quality Paradox and shows that PP is positively correlated with Perceived Code Quality (PQ) improvement. Developers thus report both productivity and quality gains. High current usage, breadth of application, frequent use of AI tools for testing, and ease of use correlate strongly with future intended adoption, though security concerns remain a moderate and statistically significant barrier to adoption. Moreover, AI testing tools' adoption lags that of coding tools, opening a Testing Gap. We identify three developer archetypes (Enthusiasts, Pragmatists, Cautious) that align with an innovation diffusion process wherein the virtuous adoption cycle serves as the individual engine of progression. Our findings reveal that organizational adoption of AI tools follows such a process: Enthusiasts push ahead with tools, creating organizational success that converts Pragmatists. The Cautious are held in organizational stasis: without early adopter examples, they don't enter the virtuous adoption cycle, never accumulate the usage frequency that drives intent, and never attain high efficacy. Policy itself does not predict individuals' intent to increase usage but functions as a marker of maturity, formalizing the successful diffusion of adoption by Enthusiasts while acting as a gateway that the Cautious group has yet to reach."

Specifically, we model the locations of access points (APs) using a Poisson point process, human blockages as random cylinder processes, and wall blockages through a Boolean straight line process. A pointing error refers to beamforming gain and direction mismatch between the transmitter and receiver. We characterize it based on the inaccuracy of location estimate. We then analyze the impact of this pointing error on the received signal power and derive a tractable expression for the coverage probability, incorporating the multi-cluster fluctuating two-ray distribution to accurately model small-scale fading in THz communications. Aided by simulation results, we corroborate our analysis and demonstrate that the pointing error has a pronounced impact on the coverage probability. Specifically, we find that merely increasing the antenna array size is insufficient to improve the coverage probability and mitigate the detrimental impact of the pointing error, highlighting the necessity of advanced estimation techniques in THz communication systems."

We introduce the concepts of Informativeness and Utility, capturing crucial information within a sample and essential samples in the training set, respectively. Building on these principles, we define optimal dataset distillation mathematically. We then present InfoUtil, a framework that balances informativeness and utility in synthesizing the distilled dataset. InfoUtil incorporates two key components: (1) game-theoretic informativeness maximization using Shapley Value attribution to extract key information from samples, and (2) principled utility maximization by selecting globally influential samples based on Gradient Norm. These components ensure that the distilled dataset is both informative and utility-optimized.

After appropriate normalization, the masked cross-covariance behaves like a spiked rectangular random matrix whose effective signal strength is attenuated by $\\sqrtρ$, where $ρ$ is the joint entry retention probability. As a result, PLS-SVD exhibits a sharp BBP-type phase transition: below a critical signal-to-noise threshold the leading singular vectors are asymptotically uninformative, while above it they achieve nontrivial alignment with the latent shared directions, with closed-form asymptotic overlap formulas. Simulations and semi-synthetic multimodal experiments corroborate the predicted phase diagram and recovery curves across aspect ratios, signal strengths, and missingness levels."

We use Ethereum for our case study and present a concrete protocol, Ira-L, within our framework to improve cache management of Ethereum block execution. The primaries implementing Ira-L provide hints that consist of the working set of keys used in an Ethereum block and one byte of metadata per key indicating the table to read from, and backups use these hints for efficient block replay. We evaluated Ira-L against the state-of-the-art Ethereum client reth over two weeks of Ethereum mainnet activity ($100,800$ blocks containing over $24$ million transactions). Our hints are compact, adding a median of $47$ KB compressed per block ($\\sim5\\%$ of block payload). We observe that the sequential hint generation and block execution imposes a $28.6\\%$ wall-time overhead on the primary, though the direct cost from hints is $10.9\\%$ of execution time; all of which can be pipelined and parallelized in production deployments.

In this paper, we address this by presenting Zenith, a scalable and efficient ranking architecture that learns complex feature interactions with minimal runtime overhead. Zenith is designed to handle a few high-dimensional Prime Tokens with Token Fusion and Token Boost modules, which exhibits superior scaling laws compared to other state-of-the-art ranking methods, thanks to its improved token heterogeneity. Its real-world effectiveness is demonstrated by deploying the architecture to TikTok Live, a leading online livestreaming platform that attracts billions of users globally.

In response, we propose Distilled Unlearning from an Efficient Teacher (DUET), a novel distillation-based unlearning method that combines the merits of these two lines of work. It learns a student model to imitate the behavior of a prompt-steered teacher that effectively refuses undesirable knowledge generation while preserving general domain knowledge. Extensive evaluations on existing benchmarks with our enriched evaluation protocols demonstrate that DUET achieves higher performance in both forgetting and utility preservation, while being orders of magnitude more data-efficient than state-of-the-art unlearning methods."

Our key insight is constructing all arithmetic operations, both linear and nonlinear, from pure IF neuron logic gates that implement IEEE-754 compliant floating-point arithmetic. Through spatial bit encoding (zero encoding error by construction), hierarchical neuromorphic gate circuits (from basic logic gates to complete transformer layers), and surrogate-free STE training (exact identity mapping rather than heuristic approximation), NEXUS produces outputs identical to standard ANNs up to machine precision. Experiments on models up to LLaMA-2 70B demonstrate identical task accuracy (0.00\\% degradation) with mean ULP error of only 6.19, while achieving 27-168,000$\\times$ energy reduction on neuromorphic hardware.

    "abstract": "In generalized Proca theories, characterized by a vector field with broken $U(1)$ gauge invariance, late-time cosmic acceleration can be realized with a dark energy equation of state in the regime $w_{\\rm DE} < -1$. In such scenarios, however, a phantom-divide crossing, as recently suggested by DESI observations, is not achieved without encountering theoretical inconsistencies. We incorporate a canonical scalar field with a potential, in addition to the vector field, and show that the phantom-divide crossing from $w_{\\rm DE} < -1$ to $w_{\\rm DE} > -1$ can occur at low redshifts. We propose a minimal model that admits such a transition and identify the region of parameter space in which all dynamical degrees of freedom in the scalar, vector, and tensor sectors are free from ghost and Laplacian instabilities. We further investigate the evolution of linear cosmological perturbations by applying the quasi-static approximation to modes well inside the Hubble radius. The dimensionless quantities $μ$ and $Σ$, which characterize the growth of matter perturbations and the bending of light rays, respectively, depend on the sound speed $c_ψ$ of the longitudinal scalar perturbation associated with the vector field. Since $c_ψ$ is influenced by the transverse vector mode, the model exhibits sufficient flexibility to yield values of $μ$ and $Σ$ close to 1. Consequently, unlike theories such as scalar Galileons, the present model can be consistent with observations of redshift-space distortions and integrated Sachs-Wolfe-galaxy cross-correlations."

It remains consistent under a comparatively weak dependence condition in which conventional OLS- and GLS-based estimators can be inconsistent, and it is asymptotically efficient under stronger conditions. Monte Carlo experiments indicate that the associated Wald test achieves improved size control and competitive power in finite samples, especially when combined with a bootstrap-based bias correction. An empirical application further illustrates that the proposed procedure delivers stable inference and is practically useful for multi-equation specification testing."

Our method enables efficient VDR tasks using only dozens of visual tokens, achieving a 30-155x reduction in token count while maintaining highly competitive performance across various backbones and benchmarks.

Among these, one model called WS model is based on the asymptotic expansion factor. However, it is known that it fails in the case of pseudostreamers. In this study, as a first step toward constructing a solar wind speed empirical model based on physical parameters, we investigated the effect of the radial profile of flux-tube shape on the solar wind speed using one-dimensional numerical simulations. In the simulations, ad hoc Alfvén waves are injected from the photosphere at $r=R_\\odot$ as the energy source, and the MHD equations are solved out to the interplanetary space at $r=70R_\\odot$ to reproduce solar wind acceleration. As a result, even when the coronal base magnetic field and the asymptotic expansion factor are fixed, the final solar wind speed varies by approximately 300 km s$^{-1}$ depending on changes in the expansion height or non-monotonic expansion. Additionally, across all simulations performed, a better correlation is found with the quantities that reflect the information about the radial profile of flux-tube shape than the asymptotic expansion factor. Our results suggest that, as a physical characteristic parameter of the solar wind speed, an operation that can account for the expansion factor throughout the corona is necessary."

This allows us to recover correct answers to causal queries that would otherwise be marked incorrect due to superficial differences in their causal semantics.

In this paper, we address this question by focusing on the statistical distribution of function words. Function words have long been argued to play a crucial role in language acquisition due to their distinctive distributional properties, including high frequency, reliable association with syntactic structure, and alignment with phrase boundaries. We use cross-linguistic corpus analysis to first establish that all three properties are present across 186 studied languages. Next, we use a combination of counterfactual language modeling and ablation experiments to show that language variants preserving all three properties are more easily acquired by neural learners, with frequency and structural association contributing more strongly than boundary alignment. Follow-up probing and ablation analyses further reveal that different learning conditions lead to systematically different reliance on function words, indicating that similar performance can arise from distinct internal mechanisms."

    "abstract": "Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) serve as a critical enabler for intelligent transportation systems. However, their practical deployment faces a core governance dilemma: the network topology requires a dynamic trade-off between robustness against targeted attacks and ensuring low-latency information transmission. Most existing models generate fixed degree distributions, lacking the ability to adapt autonomously to the demands of diverse traffic scenarios. To address this challenge, this paper innovatively proposes a schedulable degree distribution model for localized VANETs. The core of this model lies in introducing a hybrid connection mechanism. When establishing connections, newly joining nodes do not follow a single rule but instead collaboratively perform random attachment and preferential attachment. Through theoretical derivation and simulation validation, this study demonstrates that by adjusting the cooperative weighting between these two mechanisms, the overall network degree distribution can achieve a continuous and controllable transition between a uniform distribution and a power-law distribution. The former effectively disperses attack risks and enhances robustness, while the latter facilitates the formation of hub nodes, shortening transmission paths to reduce latency. Experimental results based on the real-world road network of Beijing indicate that this model can precisely regulate node connection heterogeneity, attack resistance, and average transmission path length through the reshaping of the underlying topology. This provides a forward-looking and practical governance paradigm for constructing next-generation VANETs capable of dynamically adapting to complex environments."

Most public datasets remain limited by simulated data sources, single-modality sensing, or the absence of fine-grained object-level annotations, which prevents robust scene understanding and multimodal safety reasoning for industrial foundation models. To address these limitations, InspecSafe-V1 is released as the first multimodal benchmark dataset for industrial inspection safety assessment that is collected from routine operations of real inspection robots in real-world environments. InspecSafe-V1 covers five representative industrial scenarios, including tunnels, power facilities, sintering equipment, oil and gas petrochemical plants, and coal conveyor trestles. The dataset is constructed from 41 wheeled and rail-mounted inspection robots operating at 2,239 valid inspection sites, yielding 5,013 inspection instances. For each instance, pixel-level segmentation annotations are provided for key objects in visible-spectrum images. In addition, a semantic scene description and a corresponding safety level label are provided according to practical inspection tasks. Seven synchronized sensing modalities are further included, including infrared video, audio, depth point clouds, radar point clouds, gas measurements, temperature, and humidity, to support multimodal anomaly recognition, cross-modal fusion, and comprehensive safety assessment in industrial environments."

These microscopic dust particles are found in primitive solar system materials. Their distinct isotopic compositions record the nucleosynthetic processes in their parent stars and the Galactic chemical environment in which these stars formed. We studied presolar graphite grains of high-density type from the Murchison meteorite and found five grains with subgrains that show enrichments in 84Sr compared to the solar abundance.84Sr is the neutron-deficient isotope of strontium that can be produced in the deep oxygen-rich interior of high-mass stars that end their lives as core-collapse supernovae. The observed 84Sr excesses cannot be produced in low-mass asymptotic giant branch stars, the source of most high-density presolar graphites found in meteorites. High-density graphites with embedded 84Sr excesses are, instead, compatible with a core-collapse supernovae origin. The graphite subgrains condensed from carbon-rich materials in the outer layers of core-collapse supernovae, where 84Sr was destroyed by neutron captures during hydrostatic evolution of the stars and their final explosion. Based on current theoretical stellar models, a few percent of contribution from the inner regions of core-collapse supernovae, which are enriched in p-process nuclides, to the outer carbon-rich regions is the most likely explanation for the observed enrichment of 84Sr in the subgrains of the high-density graphites. In this study, we present the first observational evidence that core-collapse supernovae produce and eject isotopes made by the p-process."

To that end, we develop FedGEM: a federated generalized expectation-maximization algorithm for the training of mixture models with an unknown number of components. Our proposed algorithm relies on each of the clients performing EM steps locally, and constructing an uncertainty set around the maximizer associated with each local component. The central server utilizes the uncertainty sets to learn potential cluster overlaps between clients, and infer the global number of clusters via closed-form computations. We perform a thorough theoretical study of our algorithm, presenting probabilistic convergence guarantees under common assumptions. Subsequently, we study the specific setting of isotropic GMMs, providing tractable, low-complexity computations to be performed by each client during each iteration of the algorithm, as well as rigorously verifying assumptions required for algorithm convergence. We perform various numerical experiments, where we empirically demonstrate that our proposed method achieves comparable performance to centralized EM, and that it outperforms various existing federated clustering methods."

    "abstract": "High-resolution remote sensing imagery is characterized by densely distributed land-cover objects and complex boundaries, which places higher demands on both geometric localization and semantic prediction. Existing training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) methods typically fuse CLIP and vision foundation models (VFMs) using \"one-way injection\" and \"shallow post-processing\" strategies, making it difficult to satisfy these requirements. To address this issue, we propose a spatial-regularization-aware dual-branch collaborative inference framework for training-free OVSS, termed SDCI. First, during feature encoding, SDCI introduces a cross-model attention fusion (CAF) module, which guides collaborative inference by injecting self-attention maps into each other. Second, we propose a bidirectional cross-graph diffusion refinement (BCDR) module that enhances the reliability of dual-branch segmentation scores through iterative random-walk diffusion. Finally, we incorporate low-level superpixel structures and develop a convex-optimization-based superpixel collaborative prediction (CSCP) mechanism to further refine object boundaries. Experiments on multiple remote sensing semantic segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves better performance than existing approaches. Moreover, ablation studies further confirm that traditional object-based remote sensing image analysis methods leveraging superpixel structures remain effective within deep learning frameworks.

The Bruhat orders are natural partial orders on the symmetric group, appearing in wide-reaching settings including the geometry of flag manifolds, the representation theory of $\\mathfrak{S}_{n}$, and the combinatorics of the permutohedron. To analyze weak Bruhat order, we combine classic analytic, tableau-theoretic, and poset-theoretic tools, including the Plancherel measure and the RSK bijection. For strong Bruhat order we construct large families where members are comparable with high probability. Our proof that members are comparable combines the tableau criterion with an associated random-walk-type deviation process."

To strictly quantify this phenomenon, we introduce the Cognitive Complexity Benchmark (CCB), a robust evaluation framework grounded in a dataset constructed from 95 real-world Chinese A-share annual reports. Unlike traditional datasets, the CCB stratifies financial queries into a three-dimensional taxonomy, Data Source, Mapping Difficulty, and Result Unit, enabling the precise diagnosis of reasoning degradation in high-cognitive-load scenarios. To address these failures, we propose the Iterative Dual-Phase Financial-PoT framework. This neuro-symbolic architecture enforces a strict architectural decoupling: it first isolates semantic variable extraction and logic formulation, then offloads computation to an iterative, self-correcting Python sandbox to ensure deterministic execution. Evaluation on the CCB demonstrates that while standard Chain-of-Thought falters on complex tasks, our approach offers superior robustness, elevating the Qwen3-235B model's average accuracy from 59.7\\% to 67.3\\% and achieving gains of up to 10-fold in high-complexity reasoning tasks. These findings suggest that architectural decoupling is a critical enabling factor for improving reliability in financial reasoning tasks, providing a transferable architectural insight for precision-critical domains that require tight alignment between semantic understanding and quantitative computation."

    "abstract": "Recent progress in geospatial foundation models highlights the importance of learning general-purpose representations for real-world locations, particularly points-of-interest (POIs) where human activity concentrates. Existing approaches, however, focus primarily on place identity derived from static textual metadata, or learn representations tied to trajectory context, which capture movement regularities rather than how places are actually used (i.e., POI's function). We argue that POI function is a missing but essential signal for general POI representations. We introduce Mobility-Embedded POIs (ME-POIs), a framework that augments POI embeddings derived, from language models with large-scale human mobility data to learn POI-centric, context-independent representations grounded in real-world usage. ME-POIs encodes individual visits as temporally contextualized embeddings and aligns them with learnable POI representations via contrastive learning to capture usage patterns across users and time. To address long-tail sparsity, we propose a novel mechanism that propagates temporal visit patterns from nearby, frequently visited POIs across multiple spatial scales. We evaluate ME-POIs on five newly proposed map enrichment tasks, testing its ability to capture both the identity and function of POIs. Across all tasks, augmenting text-based embeddings with ME-POIs consistently outperforms both text-only and mobility-only baselines. Notably, ME-POIs trained on mobility data alone can surpass text-only models on certain tasks, highlighting that POI function is a critical component of accurate and generalizable POI representations."

I test six models including Gemini 3 Flash, GPT-4o, and open-source alternatives such as DeepSeek v3.2 and GLM-4.7. Enabling extended reasoning can improve accuracy by 1-3 percentage points, though effects vary across contexts; including metadata such as party registration reaches 86.7%. LLM classification also reduces the income bias inherent in BISG, where minorities in wealthier neighborhoods are systematically misclassified as White. I further validate using Lebanese voter registration with religious sect (64.3% accuracy), Indian MPs from reserved constituencies (99.2%), and Indian land records with caste classification (74.0%). Aggregate validation across India, Uganda, Nepal, Armenia, Chile, and Costa Rica using original full-count voter rolls demonstrates that the method recovers known population distributions where naming conventions are distinctive. For large-scale applications, small transformer models fine-tuned on LLM labels exceed BISG accuracy while enabling local deployment at no cost."

However, existing literature rarely discuss non-smooth targets. In this work, we derive explicit spectral gap bounds for the Random-Walk Metropolis and Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithms over a broad class of non-smooth distributions. Moreover, combining our analysis with a recent result in Goyal et al.

We develop a learning-assisted procedure based on the projection 1-Wasserstein distance, which we call the neural Wasserstein test. The method is motivated by the observation that there often exists a low-dimensional projection under which the two high-dimensional distributions differ. In practice, we learn the projection directions via manifold optimization and a witness function using deep neural networks. To adapt to unknown projection dimensions and sparsity levels, we aggregate a collection of candidate statistics through a max-type construction, avoiding explicit tuning while potentially improving power. We establish the validity and consistency of the proposed test and prove a Berry--Esseen type bound for the Gaussian approximation. In particular, under the null hypothesis, the aggregated statistic converges to the absolute maximum of a standard Gaussian vector, yielding an asymptotically pivotal (distribution-free) calibration that bypasses resampling. Simulation studies and a real-data example demonstrate the strong finite-sample performance of the proposed method."

We perform a mechanistic analysis on a trained PFN that identifies attention latent output as the key intermediary, linking observed function data to spectral structure. Building on this insight, we propose decoder architectures that map PFN latents to explicit spectral density estimates and corresponding stationary kernels via Bochner's theorem. We study this pipeline in both single-realization and multi-realization regimes, contextualizing theoretical limits on spectral identifiability and proving consistency when multiple function samples are available. Empirically, the proposed decoders recover complex multi-peak spectral mixtures and produce explicit kernels that support Gaussian process regression with accuracy comparable to PFNs and optimization-based baselines, while requiring only a single forward pass. This yields orders-of-magnitude reductions in inference time compared to optimization-based baselines."

While predicting the future state introduces bias, conditioning the IDM on the prediction can significantly reduce variance. We establish conditions on the state predictor bias for PIDM to achieve lower prediction error and higher sample efficiency than BC, with the gap widening when additional data sources are available. We validate the theoretical insights empirically in 2D navigation tasks, where BC requires up to five times (three times on average) more demonstrations than PIDM to reach comparable performance; and in a complex 3D environment in a modern video game with high-dimensional visual inputs and stochastic transitions, where BC requires over 66\\% more samples than PIDM."

TAPPA both deepens the understanding of attention behavior and guides inference acceleration approaches. Specifically, TAPPA characterizes attention patterns as predictable patterns with clear regularities and unpredictable patterns that appear effectively random. Our analysis further reveals that this distinction can be explained by the degree of query self-similarity along the temporal dimension. Focusing on the predictable patterns, we further provide a detailed mathematical analysis of three representative cases through the joint effect of queries, keys, and Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE). We validate TAPPA by applying its insights to KV cache compression and LLM pruning tasks.

The SCSP incurs content fetching costs while fetching and broadcasting the contents. The SCSP also incurs an age cost if users do not receive the most recent version of the content after requesting. We study a content fetching and broadcast problem, aiming to minimize the time-averaged content fetching and age costs. The problem can be framed as a Markov decision process but cannot be elegantly solved owing to its multi-dimensional state space and complex dynamics. To address this, we first obtain the optimal policy for the homogeneous case with all the users having the same request probability and age cost. We extend this algorithm for heterogeneous case but the complexity grows exponentially with the number of users. To tackle this, we propose a low complexity Whittle index based algorithm, which performs very close to the optimal. The complexity of the algorithm is linear in number of users and serves as a heuristic for both homogeneous and heterogeneous cases."

OG-MAR summarizes respondent-specific values from the World Values Survey (WVS) and constructs a global cultural ontology by eliciting relations over a fixed taxonomy via competency questions. At inference time, it retrieves ontology-consistent relations and demographically similar profiles to instantiate multiple value-persona agents, whose outputs are synthesized by a judgment agent that enforces ontology consistency and demographic proximity. Experiments on regional social-survey benchmarks across four LLM backbones show that OG-MAR improves cultural alignment and robustness over competitive baselines, while producing more transparent reasoning traces."

HESS J1813-126, associated with the energetic, radio-quiet gamma-ray pulsar PSR J1813-1246, has been suggested as a candidate pulsar halo, though its nature remains uncertain. We interpreted the high-energy emission of PSR J1813-1246 using the synchro-curvature (SC) radiation model and tested whether the gamma-ray spectral energy distribution (SED) of HESS J1813-126 can be explained as a pulsar halo powered by PSR J1813-1246. We explain the X-ray and gamma-ray SEDs of the pulsar using the SC framework. We further computed the transport and losses of $e^\\pm$ injected by the pulsar through time-dependent diffusion-loss equations, exploring various common pulsar halo transport models. The resulting IC emission was compared with \\textit{Fermi}-LAT, H.E.S.S., HAWC, and LHAASO data. We present predictions for the surface brightness profiles (SBPs) and the aperture-dependent emission for the different transport models, providing key diagnostics for assessing the observability of HESS J1813-126 with current and future instruments. The SC framework successfully reproduces the emission of PSR J1813-1246. The SED of HESS J1813-126 can be consistently reproduced within different pulsar halo frameworks, albeit with distinct predictions across different transport models. The corresponding SBP predictions and aperture-dependent emission offer testable signatures for future imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes, which will be crucial for discriminating between the transport models. We further examined the link between the pulsar central engine and its extended halo by comparing the pair multiplicities in the magnetospheric and halo regions."

Better understanding how they reach predictions can allow us to inspect for biases, which is especially important with simulated data, and verify that predictions are made on the basis of physically plausible features. This ultimately improves the ease of adoption of machine learning techniques. The most used methods to explain machine learning model predictions (such as SHAP and other methods that rely on stochastic sample generation) suffer from high computational complexity and struggle to account for interactions between inputs. PERTURB-c addresses these issues by leveraging physical knowledge of the known spectral correlation. For visualisation of this analysis, we propose a heat-map-based representation which is better suited to large numbers of input features along a single dimension, and that is more intuitive to those who are already familiar with retrieval methods. Note that while we chose this exoplanet retrieval context to demonstrate our methodologies, the PERTURB-c framework is model agnostic and in a broader context has potential value across a plethora of adjacent regression problems."

    "abstract": "Network protocol fingerprinting is used to identify a protocol implementation by analyzing its input-output behavior. Traditionally, fingerprinting operates under a closed-world assumption, where models of all implementations are assumed to be available. However, this assumption is unrealistic in practice. When this assumption does not hold, fingerprinting results in numerous misclassifications without indicating that a model for an implementation is missing. Therefore, we introduce an open-world variant of the fingerprinting problem, where not all models are known in advance. We propose an incremental fingerprinting approach to solve the problem by combining active automata learning with closed-world fingerprinting. Our approach quickly determines whether the implementation under consideration matches an available model using fingerprinting and conformance checking. If no match is found, it learns a new model by exploiting the structure of available models. We prove the correctness of our approach and improvements in asymptotic complexity compared to naive baselines. Moreover, experimental results on a variety of protocols demonstrate a significant reduction in misclassifications and interactions with these black-boxes."

While recent methods leverage multi-modal fusion and prompt-based learning, most fail to distinguish between modality-specific signals and cross-modal evidence, leading to suboptimal performance. We propose DiME (Disentangled Multi-modal Experts), a novel architecture that explicitly separates stance information into textual-dominant, visual-dominant, and cross-modal shared components. DiME first uses a target-aware Chain-of-Thought prompt to generate reasoning-guided textual input. Then, dual encoders extract modality features, which are processed by three expert modules with specialized loss functions: contrastive learning for modality-specific experts and cosine alignment for shared representation learning. A gating network adaptively fuses expert outputs for final prediction. Experiments on four benchmark datasets show that DiME consistently outperforms strong unimodal and multi-modal baselines under both in-target and zero-shot settings."

    "abstract": "Hydrogen absorption significantly alters the mechanical properties of steel. However, absorbed hydrogen also influences its electronic and magneto-structural properties, helping to interpret how hydrogen is incorporated. This study therefore investigates the influence of hydrogen incorporation on the electronic and magneto-structural properties of X2CrNi18-9 stainless steel in different microstructural states. Microstructural characterization included analytic electron microscopy mapping, X-ray diffraction and thermodynamic stability maps to evaluate grain size, dislocation density and chemical homogeneity. The electronic properties were characterized using the Seebeck coefficient, while the magneto-structural properties were investigated using diffuse neutron scattering and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). Hydrogen incorporation showed clear changes in the Seebeck coefficients. Magnetic SANS in conjunction with diffuse neutron scattering indicates the existence of nanoscale inhomogeneities with the same fcc structure as the bulk, but with correlation lengths of a few nanometres. The size of these inhomogeneities increased with hydrogen incorporation, suggesting that hydrogen preferentially accumulates in their vicinity. However, no direct correlation between the electronic and magneto-structural properties and the dislocation density could be demonstrated. We suggest that studies such as these will lead in the medium term to the development of guidelines for material design to make steels more resistant to hydrogen."

In this work, we introduce Iterative Latent Representation Refinement (ILRR), a learning-free framework for steering DLMs using a single reference sequence. ILRR guides generation by dynamically aligning the internal activations of the generated sequence with those of a given reference throughout the denoising process. This approach captures and transfers high-level semantic properties, with a tunable steering scale enabling flexible control over attributes such as sentiment. We further introduce Spatially Modulated Steering, an extension that enables steering long texts using shorter references by regulating guidance intensity across the sequence. Empirically, we demonstrate that ILRR achieves effective attribute steering on LLaDA and MDLM architectures with a minor computational overhead, requiring only one additional parallel forward pass per denoising step. Under the same compute budget, ILRR improves attribute accuracy over comparable baselines by 10$\\%$ to 60$\\%$ points, while maintaining high generation quality."

Recent work by Choquette-Choo et al. (2025) proposes a sampling-based Monte Carlo approach to compute amplification parameters in this setting. However, their guarantees either only hold with some high probability or require random abstention by the mechanism. Furthermore, the required number of samples for ensuring $(ε,δ)$-DP is inversely proportional to $δ$. In contrast, we develop sampling-free bounds based on Rényi divergence and conditional composition. The former is facilitated by a dynamic programming formulation to efficiently compute the bounds. The latter complements it by offering stronger privacy guarantees for small $ε$, where Rényi divergence bounds inherently lead to an over-approximation. Our framework applies to arbitrary banded and non-banded matrices. Through numerical comparisons, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach across a broad range of matrix mechanisms used in research and practice."

After a brief hands-on training activity, students' explanations shifted significantly from anthropomorphic and misconceived accounts toward data- and model-based reasoning. The results suggest that enabling learners to directly observe training can support conceptual understanding of the data-driven nature of language models and model training, even within a short intervention.

    "abstract": "Post Training Quantization (PTQ), a mainstream model compression technique, often leads to the paradoxical 'low error, high loss' phenomenon because it focuses solely on minimizing quantization error. The root cause lies in the Hessian matrix of the LLM loss landscape: a few high curvature directions are extremely sensitive to perturbations. To address this, we propose the Hessian Robust Quantization (HeRo Q) algorithm, which applies a lightweight, learnable rotation-compression matrix to the weight space prior to quantization. This joint framework reshapes the loss landscape by reducing the largest Hessian eigenvalue and reducing its max eigenvalue, thereby significantly enhancing robustness to quantization noise. HeRo-Q requires no architectural modifications, incurs negligible computational overhead, and integrates seamlessly into existing PTQ pipelines. Experiments on Llama and Qwen models show that HeRo Q consistently outperforms state of the art methods including GPTQ, AWQ, and SpinQuant not only achieving superior performance under standard W4A8 settings, but also excelling in the highly challenging W3A16 ultra low bit regime, where it boosts GSM8K accuracy on Llama3 8B to 70.15\\% and effectively avoids the logical collapse commonly seen in aggressive quantization."

    "abstract": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are advancing computational pathology with superior visual understanding capabilities. However, current systems often reduce diagnosis to directly output conclusions without verifiable evidence-linked reasoning, which severely limits clinical trust and hinders expert error rectification. To address these barriers, we construct PathReasoner, the first large-scale dataset of whole-slide image (WSI) reasoning. Unlike previous work reliant on unverified distillation, we develop a rigorous knowledge-guided generation pipeline. By leveraging medical knowledge graphs, we explicitly align structured pathological findings and clinical reasoning with diagnoses, generating over 20K high-quality instructional samples. Based on the database, we propose PathReasoner-R1, which synergizes trajectory-masked supervised fine-tuning with reasoning-oriented reinforcement learning to instill structured chain-of-thought capabilities. To ensure medical rigor, we engineer a knowledge-aware multi-granular reward function incorporating an Entity Reward mechanism strictly aligned with knowledge graphs. This effectively guides the model to optimize for logical consistency rather than mere outcome matching, thereby enhancing robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PathReasoner-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on both PathReasoner and public benchmarks across various image scales, equipping pathology models with transparent, clinically grounded reasoning capabilities.

To bridge this gap, we propose AIR-VLA, the first VLA benchmark specifically tailored for aerial manipulation. We construct a physics-based simulation environment and release a high-quality multimodal dataset comprising 3000 manually teleoperated demonstrations, covering base manipulation, object & spatial understanding, semantic reasoning, and long-horizon planning. Leveraging this platform, we systematically evaluate mainstream VLA models and state-of-the-art VLM models. Our experiments not only validate the feasibility of transferring VLA paradigms to aerial systems but also, through multi-dimensional metrics tailored to aerial tasks, reveal the capabilities and boundaries of current models regarding UAV mobility, manipulator control, and high-level planning. AIR-VLA establishes a standardized testbed and data foundation for future research in general-purpose aerial robotics.

The cognitive complexity measure employed in this work is the one defined by SonarSource, which is a company that develops well-known applications for static code analysis. This extraction problem can be modeled as a combinatorial optimization problem. The main difficulty arises from the existence of different criteria for evaluating the solutions obtained, requiring the formulation of the code extraction problem as a multi-objective optimization problem using alternative methods. We propose a multi-objective integer linear programming model to obtain a set of solutions that reduce the cognitive complexity of a given piece of code, such as balancing the number of lines of code and its cognitive complexity. In addition, several algorithms have been developed to validate the model. These algorithms have been integrated into a tool that enables the parameterised resolution of the problem of reducing software cognitive complexity."

We obtain this result as a special case of a general minimax formula for convex optimization on entanglement polytopes (and other moment polytopes) that has further applications to other tensor parameters, including the asymptotic slice rank.

In this work, we introduce Vision KAN (ViK), an attention-free backbone inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks. At its core lies MultiPatch-RBFKAN, a unified token mixer that combines (a) patch-wise nonlinear transform with Radial Basis Function-based KANs, (b) axis-wise separable mixing for efficient local propagation, and (c) low-rank global mapping for long-range interaction. Employing as a drop-in replacement for attention modules, this formulation tackles the prohibitive cost of full KANs on high-resolution features by adopting a patch-wise grouping strategy with lightweight operators to restore cross-patch dependencies. Experiments on ImageNet-1K show that ViK achieves competitive accuracy with linear complexity, demonstrating the potential of KAN-based token mixing as an efficient and theoretically grounded alternative to attention."

We consider networks initialized with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) weights possessing sufficiently many finite moments, and i.i.d. Gaussian biases independent of the weights. Specifically, when the network is evaluated at a single input, we obtain convergence rates of order $O(n^{-1/2})$ in both total variation and Wasserstein distances. When evaluated at a general finite collection of inputs, we establish bounds of the same order in terms of the convex distance. All bounds are given in explicit and computable form. As a consequence of our estimates, we also deduce a novel convergence result in the regime where the depth of the neural network increases simultaneously with the width $n$, up to order $O\\big((\\log_2 n)^{1/3}\\big)$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first CLT in the infinite width/depth limit holding for general (nonlinear) Lipschitz activation functions and non-Gaussian weight distributions. Our analysis yields several results of independent interest, including: (i) an explicit lower bound on the determinant of the limiting covariance matrix and (ii) new advances in Stein's method, both for the one-dimensional Stein's equation associated with the square of a Lipschitz function and for the multivariate Stein's equation associated with the tensor product of a Lipschitz function with itself."

Although transmon type qubits are designed and manufactured routinely in the range of a few Giga-Hertz, normally from 4 to 6 GHz (and, at times, up to around 10GHz), achieving higher-frequency operation has challenges and entails special design and manufacturing considerations. This report presents the proposal and preliminary design of an 8-qubit transmon (with possible upgrade to up to 72 qubits on a chip) architecture working beyond an operation frequency of 10GHz, as well as presents a new connection topology. The current design spans a range of around 11 to 13.5 GHz (with a possible full range of 9-12GHz at the moment), with a central optimal operating frequency of 12.0 GHz, with the aim to possibly achieve a stable, compact and low-charge-noise operation, as lowest as possible as per the existing fabrication techniques. The aim is to achieve average relaxation times of up to 1.9ms with average quality factors of up to 2.75 x 10^7 after trials, while exploiting the new advances in superconducting junction manufacturing using tantalum and niobium/aluminum/aluminum oxide tri-layer structures on high-resistivity silicon substrates (carried out elsewhere by other groups and referred in this report)."

Rather than treating synthesis as the endpoint, KAPSO uses synthesis as an operator within a long-horizon optimization loop, where progress is defined by evaluator outcomes. KAPSO targets long-horizon failures common in coding agents, including lost experimental state, brittle debugging, and weak reuse of domain expertise, by integrating three tightly coupled components. First, a git-native experimentation engine isolates each attempt as a branch, producing reproducible artifacts and preserving provenance across iterations. Second, a knowledge system ingests heterogeneous sources, including repositories, internal playbooks, and curated external resources such as documentation, scientific papers, and web search results, and organizes them into a structured representation that supports retrieval over workflows, implementations, and environment constraints. Third, a cognitive memory layer coordinates retrieval and maintains an episodic store of reusable lessons distilled from experiment traces (run logs, diffs, and evaluator feedback), reducing repeated error modes and accelerating convergence. We evaluated KAPSO on MLE-Bench (Kaggle-style ML competitions) and ALE-Bench (AtCoder heuristic optimization), and report end-to-end performance.

We investigate the response of the system using three distinct wave proxies (compressible parallel, compressible transverse and incompressible parallel) as well as Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition for decoupling and analyzing the resultant MHD wave behavior. We find that OR generates a slow magnetoacoustic wave of period $P$ that propagates outwards in all directions along the spine and fan plane of the 3D null point. We also find the generation of a propagating Alfvén wave of period $P$, exclusively along the $y$-axis in the fan plane, i.e. in the direction perpendicular to the spine motion. These findings provide new insights into waves generated from a 3D null point and their implications for coronal seismology."

    "abstract": "Diffusion generative models synthesize samples by discretizing reverse-time dynamics driven by a learned score (or denoiser). Existing convergence analyses of diffusion models typically scale at least linearly with the ambient dimension, and sharper rates often depend on intrinsic-dimension assumptions or other geometric restrictions on the target distribution. We develop an alternative, information-theoretic approach to dimension-free convergence that avoids any geometric assumptions. Under mild assumptions on the target distribution, we bound KL divergence between the target and generated distributions by $O(H^2/K)$ (up to endpoint factors), where $H$ is the Shannon entropy and $K$ is the number of sampling steps. Moreover, using a reformulation of the KL divergence, we propose a Loss-Adaptive Schedule (LAS) for efficient discretization of reverse SDE which is lightweight and relies only on the training loss, requiring no post-training heavy computation. Empirically, LAS improves sampling quality over common heuristic schedules."

    "abstract": "Bridging the gap between data-rich training regimes and observation-sparse deployment conditions remains a central challenge in spatiotemporal field reconstruction, particularly when target domains exhibit distributional shifts, heterogeneous structure, and multi-scale dynamics absent from available training data. We present SENDAI, a hierarchical Sparse-measurement, EfficieNt Data AssImilation Framework that reconstructs full spatial states from hyper sparse sensor observations by combining simulation-derived priors with learned discrepancy corrections. We demonstrate the performance on satellite remote sensing, reconstructing MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) derived vegetation index fields across six globally distributed sites. Using seasonal periods as a proxy for domain shift, the framework consistently outperforms established baselines that require substantially denser observations -- SENDAI achieves a maximum SSIM improvement of 185% over traditional baselines and a 36% improvement over recent high-frequency-based methods. These gains are particularly pronounced for landscapes with sharp boundaries and sub-seasonal dynamics; more importantly, the framework effectively preserves diagnostically relevant structures -- such as field topologies, land cover discontinuities, and spatial gradients. By yielding corrections that are more structurally and spectrally separable, the reconstructed fields are better suited for downstream inference of indirectly observed variables. The results therefore highlight a lightweight and operationally viable framework for sparse-measurement reconstruction that is applicable to physically grounded inference, resource-limited deployment, and real-time monitor and control."

Existing approaches typically rely on specialized large language models (LLMs) or bespoke, task-specific agents. Such methods are often brittle, complex and frequently generating syntactically invalid or non-executable code. NEMO instead centers on remote interaction with autonomous coding agents (ACAs), treated as a first-class abstraction analogous to API-based interaction with LLMs. This design enables the construction of higher-level systems around ACAs that structure, consolidate, and iteratively refine task specifications. Because ACAs execute within sandboxed environments, code produced by NEMO is executable by construction, allowing automated validation and repair. Building on this, we introduce novel coordination patterns with and across ACAs, including asymmetric validation loops between independently generated optimizer and simulator implementations (serving as a high-level validation mechanism), external memory for experience reuse, and robustness enhancements via minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding and self-consistency. We evaluate NEMO on nine established optimization benchmarks. As depicted in Figure 1, it achieves state-of-the-art performance on the majority of tasks, with substantial margins on several datasets, demonstrating the power of execution-aware agentic architectures for automated optimization modeling."

Quantum fluctuations in the particle motion and in the field prevent signaling or violations of quantum mechanics in this setup. We reformulate this thought experiment by considering gravitational waves emitted by an extended quadrupolar object as a detector for Newtonian tidal fields. We find that quantum fluctuations in the gravitational waves prevent signaling. In the Newtonian limit, rotating black holes behave as extended quadrupolar objects, as consequence of the strong equivalence principle. It follows that consistency of the Newtonian limit of general relativity with quantum mechanics requires the quantization of gravitational radiation, even when the waves originate in strong gravity sources."

However, large models demand substantial GPU memory and exhibit high inference latency, while conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often struggles to bridge the capability gaps of small models. To address these limitations, we propose Drive-KD, a framework that decomposes autonomous driving into a \"perception-reasoning-planning\" triad and transfers these capabilities via knowledge distillation. We identify layer-specific attention as the distillation signal to construct capability-specific single-teacher models that outperform baselines. Moreover, we unify these single-teacher settings into a multi-teacher distillation framework and introduce asymmetric gradient projection to mitigate cross-capability gradient conflicts. Extensive evaluations validate the generalization of our method across diverse model families and scales. Experiments show that our distilled InternVL3-1B model, with ~42 times less GPU memory and ~11.4 times higher throughput, achieves better overall performance than the pretrained 78B model from the same family on DriveBench, and surpasses GPT-5.1 on the planning dimension, providing insights toward efficient autonomous driving VLMs."

The emerging paradigm of Green AI challenges this by recognising energy consumption as a critical performance dimension. Despite the high computational demands of automated planning, its energy efficiency has received little attention. This gap is particularly salient given the modular planning structure, in which domain models are specified independently of algorithms. On the other hand, this separation also enables systematic analysis of energy usage through domain model design. We empirically investigate how domain model characteristics affect the energy consumption of classical planners. We introduce a domain model configuration framework that enables controlled variation of features, such as element ordering, action arity, and dead-end states. Using five benchmark domains and five state-of-the-art planners, we analyse energy and runtime impacts across 32 domain variants per benchmark. Results demonstrate that domain-level modifications produce measurable energy differences across planners, with energy consumption not always correlating with runtime."

This leads to a remarkably simple expression for the crosscap overlap, which demonstrates that the finite-size corrections decay exponentially with system size.

To this end, we impose a Mean Flow consistency condition for time-averaged Hamiltonian dynamics. Unlike prior approaches, this allows training on independent phase-space samples without access to future states, avoiding expensive trajectory generation. Validated across diverse Hamiltonian systems, our method in particular improves upon molecular dynamics simulations using machine-learned force fields (MLFF). Our models maintain comparable training and inference cost, but support significantly larger integration timesteps while trained directly on widely-available trajectory-free MLFF datasets."

AWO analyzes existing workflow traces to discover recurring sequences of tool calls and transforms them into meta-tools, which are deterministic, composite tools that bundle multiple agent actions into a single invocation. Meta-tools bypass unnecessary intermediate LLM reasoning steps and reduce operational cost while also shortening execution paths, leading to fewer failures. Experiments on two agentic AI benchmarks show that AWO reduces the number of LLM calls up to 11.9% while also increasing the task success rate by up to 4.2 percent points."

We present a new version of our Monte Carlo radiative transfer code Andy Antares with improved treatment of the velocity field for arbitrary geometries. Our aim is to develop a numerical scheme that can incorporate a general velocity field defined at discrete points. Our main objective is to calculate radiative transfer in a general input hydrodynamic model. The Andy Antares code currently calculates pure radiative transfer. The input model is pre-calculated by another hydrodynamical code. The whole radiative transfer calculation is then processed in a Cartesian grid. Radiative transfer is solved using the Monte Carlo approach in 3-D regardless of the input hydrodynamical model's dimension. The velocity field at any given point is interpolated using the trilinear interpolation. The optical depth is then integrated numerically along the photon's path. We verified the accuracy of the numerical velocity interpolation by comparison with results obtained for analytical velocity fields, achieving successful outcomes. We also tested the radiative transfer solution on a 3-D model generated from a 2-D hydrodynamic model, and obtained emergent radiation. The code is suitable for the numerical solution of radiative transfer in 3-D with arbitrary velocity fields."

Inspired by the biological synergy between neuromodulators and local plasticity, we introduce a novel model-agnostic Global-guided Hebbian Learning (GHL) framework, which seamlessly integrates local and global information to scale up across diverse networks and tasks. In specific, the local component employs Oja's rule with competitive learning to ensure stable and effective local updates. Meanwhile, the global component introduces a sign-based signal that guides the direction of local Hebbian plasticity updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing Hebbian approaches.

These are not selected from sampled generations but are newly synthesized by combining individual responses in the latent space. Across different tasks, Bayes-optimal responses consistently outperform standard decoding methods like beam search. Moreover, quantifying uncertainty via the induced Bayesian risk captures variations in terms of the latent structure and improves alignment with output quality and correctness.

To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel adaptive learning framework named Hierarchical Attention and Dynamic Uniform Alignment (HADUA). Our approach unifies the learning of multimodal representations with domain adaptation. First, we design a hierarchical attention module that explicitly models intra-modal temporal dynamics and inter-modal semantic interactions (e.g., between electroencephalogram(EEG) and eye movement(EM)), yielding discriminative and semantically coherent fused features. Second, to overcome the noise inherent in pseudo-labels during adaptation, we introduce a confidence-aware Gaussian weighting scheme that smooths the supervision from target-domain samples by down-weighting uncertain instances. Third, a uniform alignment loss is employed to regularize the distribution of pseudo-labels across classes, thereby mitigating imbalance and stabilizing conditional distribution matching. Extensive experiments on multiple cross-subject emotion recognition benchmarks show that HADUA consistently surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and robustness, validating its effectiveness in handling modality gaps, noisy pseudo-labels, and class imbalance. Taken together, these contributions offer a practical and generalizable solution for building robust cross-subject affective computing systems."

Extrapolation to zero polymer concentration yields an intrinsic viscosity of 4 460 mL g^-1 for the polycation, i.e. roughly three times larger than that of the polyanion, although the polycation's molar mass is only one-tenth of the polyanion's. At low salinities the shear-overlap parameter S as a function of polymer concentration c exhibits a pronounced maximum for PAPTMAC-Cl, whereas PSS-Na shows a clear inflection point. With increasing NaCl concentration both curves become linear, indicating that the system has entered a regime where the solute dominates the flow behavior. The crossover concentrations (S_crov) of the polycation are systematically larger than those of the polyanion. By applying Pearson's Hard-Soft Acid-Base (HSAB) concept we find that the observed differences are not a simple consequence of opposite polymer charges. Rather they arise from the specific ion-pairing: the soft NR4+ group of PAPTMAC pairs with the hard Cl-, whereas the hard RSO3- units of PSS-Na interact with the hard Na+. This insight suggests that the rheological response of polyelectrolyte solutions can be deliberately tuned by choosing counter-ions of appropriate hardness/softness.

To address both issues, we propose SHARE (Sparse Hierarchical Angle-Range Estimation), a novel two-stage sparse recovery algorithm. SHARE operates in two stages. It first performs coarse, unambiguous angle estimation using individual subarrays to resolve the grating lobe ambiguity. It then leverages the full sparse aperture to perform a localized joint angle-range search. This hierarchical approach avoids an exhaustive and computationally intensive two-dimensional grid search while preserving the high resolution of the large aperture. Simulation results show that SHARE significantly outperforms conventional one-shot sparse recovery methods, such as Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP), in both localization accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, we show that SHARE's overall localization accuracy is comparable to or even surpasses that of the fully-digital 2D-MUSIC algorithm, despite MUSIC having access to the complete, uncompressed data from every antenna element. SHARE therefore provides a practical path for high-resolution near-field ISAC systems."

    "abstract": "Mean-field control (MFC) offers a scalable solution to the curse of dimensionality in multi-agent systems but traditionally hinges on the restrictive assumption of exchangeability via dense, all-to-all interactions. In this work, we bridge the gap to real-world network structures by proposing a rigorous framework for MFC on large sparse graphs. We redefine the system state as a probability measure over decorated rooted neighborhoods, effectively capturing local heterogeneity. Our central contribution is a theoretical foundation for scalable reinforcement learning in this setting. We prove horizon-dependent locality: for finite-horizon problems, an agent's optimal policy at time t depends strictly on its (T-t)-hop neighborhood. This result renders the infinite-dimensional control problem tractable and underpins a novel Dynamic Programming Principle (DPP) on the lifted space of neighborhood distributions. Furthermore, we formally and experimentally justify the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for actor-critic algorithms in this context. Our framework naturally recovers classical MFC as a degenerate case while enabling efficient, theoretically grounded control on complex sparse topologies."

While off-policy data can help, current approaches that mix entire trajectories cause significant policy mismatch and instability. In this work, we propose the $\\textbf{S}$ingle-sample Mix-p$\\textbf{O}$licy $\\textbf{U}$nified $\\textbf{P}$aradigm (SOUP), a framework that unifies off- and on-policy learning within individual samples at the token level. It confines off-policy influence to the prefix of a generated sequence sampled from historical policies, while the continuation is generated on-policy. Through token-level importance ratios, SOUP effectively leverages off-policy information while preserving training stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SOUP consistently outperforms standard on-policy training and existing off-policy extensions. Our further analysis clarifies how our fine-grained, single-sample mix-policy training can improve both exploration and final performance in LLM RL."

However, existing data collection and skill learning systems for dexterous manipulation often suffer from low-dimensional tactile information. To address this limitation, we propose DexTac, a visuo-tactile manipulation learning framework based on kinesthetic teaching. DexTac captures multi-dimensional tactile data-including contact force distributions and spatial contact regions-directly from human demonstrations. By integrating these rich tactile modalities into a policy network, the resulting contact-aware agent enables a dexterous hand to autonomously select and maintain optimal contact regions during complex interactions. We evaluate our framework on a challenging unimanual injection task. Experimental results demonstrate that DexTac achieves a 91.67% success rate. Notably, in high-precision scenarios involving small-scale syringes, our approach outperforms force-only baselines by 31.67%. These results underscore that learning multi-dimensional tactile priors from human demonstrations is critical for achieving robust, human-like dexterous manipulation in contact-rich environments."

Most existing memory systems serialize history as text, where token-level cost is uniform and scales linearly with length, often spending scarce budget on low-value details. To this end, we introduce MemOCR, a multimodal memory agent that improves long-horizon reasoning under tight context budgets by allocating memory space with adaptive information density through visual layout. Concretely, MemOCR maintains a structured rich-text memory (e.g., headings, highlights) and renders it into an image that the agent consults for memory access, visually prioritizing crucial evidence while aggressively compressing auxiliary details. To ensure robustness across varying memory budgets, we train MemOCR with reinforcement learning under budget-aware objectives that expose the agent to diverse compression levels. Across long-context multi-hop and single-hop question-answering benchmarks, MemOCR outperforms strong text-based baselines and achieves more effective context utilization under extreme budgets."

    "abstract": "Recently, the rapid advancement of multimodal domains has driven a data-centric paradigm shift in graph ML, transitioning from text-attributed to multimodal-attributed graphs. This advancement significantly enhances data representation and expands the scope of graph downstream tasks, such as modality-oriented tasks, thereby improving the practical utility of graph ML. Despite its promise, limitations exist in the current neural paradigms: (1) Neglect Context in Modality Alignment: Most existing methods adopt topology-constrained or modality-specific operators as tokenizers. These aligners inevitably neglect graph context and inhibit modality interaction, resulting in suboptimal alignment. (2) Lack of Adaptation in Modality Fusion: Most existing methods are simple adaptations for 2-modality graphs and fail to adequately exploit aligned tokens equipped with topology priors during fusion, leading to poor generalizability and performance degradation. To address the above issues, we propose LION (c\\underline{LI}ff\\underline{O}rd \\underline{N}eural paradigm) based on the Clifford algebra and decoupled graph neural paradigm (i.e., propagation-then-aggregation) to implement alignment-then-fusion in multimodal-attributed graphs. Specifically, we first construct a modality-aware geometric manifold grounded in Clifford algebra. This geometric-induced high-order graph propagation efficiently achieves modality interaction, facilitating modality alignment. Then, based on the geometric grade properties of aligned tokens, we propose adaptive holographic aggregation. This module integrates the energy and scale of geometric grades with learnable parameters to improve modality fusion. Extensive experiments on 9 datasets demonstrate that LION significantly outperforms SOTA baselines across 3 graph and 3 modality downstream tasks."

Near the critical regime, the control field is linearly ramped across the quantum critical point at a rate characterized by a quench time $τ_Q$. Away from the critical regime, the evolution is designed to follow the threshold of adiabatic breakdown, which we characterize by an adiabatic coefficient $ζ\\proptoτ_Q^α$. As a consequence, the total evolution time exhibits a sublinear power-law dependence on $τ_Q$, and the conventional linear quench protocol is recovered in the limit $α\\rightarrow\\infty$. We apply the OAI protocol to the transverse Ising chain and numerically determine the minimum value of $ζ$. We further investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics in the presence of a noisy field that can induce anti-Kibble-Zurek behavior, leading to more defects for slower ramps. Within the OAI protocol, the optimal quench time that minimizes defects obeys an altered universal power-law scaling with the noise strength. Finally, we generalize the OAI protocol to incorporate nonlinear Kibble-Zurek scaling."

Recent demonstrations of low-loss BaTiO$_3$ waveguides and high-Q resonators have established BaTiO$_3$-on-insulator as a promising platform for next-generation frequency-conversion and quantum photonic technologies. However, while BaTiO$_3$ electro-optic modulators are now well developed, nonlinear BaTiO$_3$ waveguide engineering remains comparatively immature. Techniques widely used in lithium niobate, such as periodic poling for quasi-phase-matching, are poorly suited to BaTiO$_3$ because epitaxial thin films exhibit high coercive fields, strong strain-clamping effects, multivariant domain structures, and slow, complex switching dynamics. These factors make accurate periodic poling challenging and hinder the development of efficient $X^{(2)}$ frequency converters. Here, we introduce a fabrication-robust alternative based on linear-nonlinear hybrid waveguides, where TiO$_2$ is selectively incorporated into BaTiO$_3$ ridge waveguides to enhance nonlinear mode overlap while relying solely on modal phase-matching. Using coupled-mode-theory simulations, we identify phase-matched geometries and show that the hybrid design achieves a 2.75x increase in normalized second harmonic generation efficiency over monolithic BaTiO$_3$ waveguides. The uniform, lithographically defined cross-section makes the approach highly scalable. These results position hybrid BaTiO$_3$-TiO$_2$ waveguides as a practical route to CMOS-compatible, high-efficiency $X^{(2)}$ devices for integrated quantum photonics."

The Gray-Wyner network, a classical concept from information theory, offers a principled framework for separating common and task-specific information. Inspired by this idea, we develop a learnable three-channel codec that disentangles shared information from task-specific details across multiple vision tasks. We characterize the limits of this approach through the notion of lossy common information, and propose an optimization objective that balances inherent tradeoffs in learning such representations. Through comparisons of three codec architectures on two-task scenarios spanning six vision benchmarks, we demonstrate that our approach substantially reduces redundancy and consistently outperforms independent coding. These results highlight the practical value of revisiting Gray-Wyner theory in modern machine learning contexts, bridging classic information theory with task-driven representation learning."

    "abstract": "The generalization capabilities of robotic manipulation policies are heavily influenced by the choice of visual representations. Existing approaches typically rely on representations extracted from pre-trained encoders, using two dominant types of features: global features, which summarize an entire image via a single pooled vector, and dense features, which preserve a patch-wise embedding from the final encoder layer. While widely used, both feature types mix task-relevant and irrelevant information, leading to poor generalization under distribution shifts, such as changes in lighting, textures, or the presence of distractors. In this work, we explore an intermediate structured alternative: Slot-Based Object-Centric Representations (SBOCR), which group dense features into a finite set of object-like entities. This representation permits to naturally reduce the noise provided to the robotic manipulation policy while keeping enough information to efficiently perform the task. We benchmark a range of global and dense representations against intermediate slot-based representations, across a suite of simulated and real-world manipulation tasks ranging from simple to complex. We evaluate their generalization under diverse visual conditions, including changes in lighting, texture, and the presence of distractors. Our findings reveal that SBOCR-based policies outperform dense and global representation-based policies in generalization settings, even without task-specific pretraining. These insights suggest that SBOCR is a promising direction for designing visual systems that generalize effectively in dynamic, real-world robotic environments."

    "abstract": "A classical approach to the multibody systems (MBS) modeling is to use absolute coordinates, i.e., a set of (possibly redundant) coordinates that describe the absolute position and orientation of the individual bodies with respect to an inertial frame (IFR). A well-known problem for the time integration of the equations of motion (EOM) is the lack of a singularity-free parameterization of spatial motions, which is usually tackled by using unit quaternions. Lie group integration methods were proposed as an alternative approach to the singularity-free time integration. At the same time, Lie group formulations of EOM naturally respect the geometry of spatial motions during integration. Lie group integration methods, operating directly on the configuration space Lie group, are incompatible with standard formulations of the EOM, and cannot be implemented in existing MBS simulation codes without a major restructuring. The contribution of this paper is twofold: (1) A framework for interfacing Lie group integrators to standard EOM formulations is presented. It allows describing MBS in terms of various absolute coordinates and at the same using Lie group integration schemes. (2) A method for consistently incorporating the geometry of rigid body motions into the evaluation of EOM in absolute coordinates integrated with standard vector space integration schemes. The direct product group and the semidirect product group SO(3)xR3 and the semidirect product group SE(3) are used for representing rigid body motions. The key element is the local-global transitions (LGT) transition map, which facilitates the update of (global) absolute coordinates in terms of the (local) coordinates on the Lie group. This LGT map is specific to the absolute coordinates, the local coordinates on the Lie group, and the Lie group used to represent rigid body configurations."

    "abstract": "Aerial-ground person re-identification (AG-ReID) is fundamentally challenged by extreme viewpoint and distance discrepancies between aerial and ground cameras, which induce severe geometric distortions and invalidate the assumption of a shared similarity space across views. Existing methods primarily rely on geometry-aware feature learning or appearance-conditioned prompting, while implicitly assuming that the geometry-invariant dot-product similarity used in attention mechanisms remains reliable under large viewpoint and scale variations. We argue that this assumption does not hold. Extreme camera geometry systematically distorts the query-key similarity space and degrades attention-based matching, even when feature representations are partially aligned. To address this issue, we introduce Geometry-Induced Query-Key Transformation (GIQT), a lightweight low-rank module that explicitly rectifies the similarity space by conditioning query-key interactions on camera geometry. Rather than modifying feature representations or the attention formulation itself, GIQT adapts the similarity computation to compensate for dominant geometry-induced anisotropic distortions. Building on this local similarity rectification, we further incorporate a geometry-conditioned prompt generation mechanism that provides global, view-adaptive representation priors derived directly from camera geometry. Experiments on four aerial-ground person re-identification benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently improves robustness under extreme and previously unseen geometric conditions, while introducing minimal computational overhead compared to state-of-the-art methods."

    "abstract": "Surfaces are typically represented as meshes, which can be extracted from volumetric fields via meshing or optimized directly as surface parameterizations. Volumetric representations occupy 3D space and have a large effective receptive field along rays, enabling stable and efficient optimization via volumetric rendering; however, subsequent meshing often produces overly dense meshes and introduces accumulated errors. In contrast, pure surface methods avoid meshing but capture only boundary geometry with a single-layer receptive field, making it difficult to learn intricate geometric details and increasing reliance on priors (e.g., shading or normals). We bridge this gap by differentiably turning a surface representation into a volumetric one, enabling end-to-end surface reconstruction via volumetric rendering to model complex geometries. Specifically, we soften a mesh into multiple semi-transparent layers that remain differentiable with respect to the base mesh, endowing it with a controllable 3D receptive field. Combined with a splatting-based renderer and a topology-control strategy, our method can be optimized in about 20 minutes to achieve accurate surface reconstruction while substantially improving mesh quality."

    "abstract": "We perform direct numerical simulations of rapidly rotating annular centrifugal convection to investigate how mixed (asymmetric) velocity boundary conditions and geometric curvature shape the flow organisation and heat transfer. Motivated by the quasi-two-dimensionalisation under strong rotation and the long spin-up required for large-scale states, we employ two-dimensional simulations and consider four boundary-condition sets: no-slip/no-slip (INON), no-slip/stress-free (INOS), stress-free/no-slip (ISON) and stress-free/stress-free (ISOS). For fixed geometry with the radius ratio $η=0.5$ and over the Rayleigh number $Ra\\in[10^6,10^9]$, the heat transfer is strongest for ISOS, followed by INOS and INON, while ISON exhibits a pronounced suppression as a strong zonal flow aligned with the rotation develops. In the three cases dominated by large-scale circulation, the Nusselt number $Nu$ follows an effective classical-type scaling close to $Nu\\sim Ra^{0.27}$, whereas the zonal-flow branch displays a much weaker scaling $Nu\\sim Ra^{0.1}$ and strong flow anisotropy with the large difference between the radial and azimuthal Reynolds numbers $Re_r\\ll Re_\\varphi$. A dissipation analysis shows that zonal-flow formation is accompanied by a transition from boundary-layer-dominated dissipation to a relatively low and uniform bulk dissipation, consistent with shear-induced plume suppression. By varying the radius ratio $η$, we demonstrate that increasing $η$ weakens curvature asymmetry and destabilises the zonal-flow state, leading to roll-dominated convection in the planar limit, and we relate the accompanying bulk-temperature asymmetry to the boundary heat flux asymmetry using a free-convective boundary-layer model."

    "abstract": "Q-learning provides a standard reinforcement learning framework for studying cooperation by specifying how agents update action values from repeated local interactions outcomes. Although previous work has shown that reputation can promote cooperation in such systems, most models introduce reputation by modifying payoffs, encoding it directly in the state or changing partner selection, which makes it difficult to isolate the role of the learning signal itself. Here, we construct the reinforcement signal as a weighted combination of reputation and game payoffs, leaving the game and network structure unchanged. We find that increasing the weight on reputation generally promotes cooperation by consolidating clusters, but this effect is conditional on the learning dynamics. Specifically, this promoting effect vanishes in two regimes: when the learning rate is extremely small, which prevents effective information propagation and when the discount factor approaches one, as distant future expectations obscure the immediate reputational advantage. Outside these limiting cases, the efficacy of reputation in promoting cooperation is attenuated by higher learning rates but amplified by larger discount factors. These results advance the understanding of cooperative dynamics by demonstrating that cooperation can be stabilized through the reputational shaping of learning signals alone, providing critical insights into the interplay between social information and individual learning parameters."

While automated systems and Large Language Models (LLMs) aim to retrieve and select concise evidence to support or refute claims, they often present users with either insufficient or overly redundant information, leading to inefficient and error-prone verification. To address this, we propose Evidence Ranking, a novel task that prioritizes presenting sufficient information as early as possible in a ranked list. This minimizes user reading effort while still making all available evidence accessible for sequential verification. We compare two approaches for the new ranking task: one-shot ranking and incremental ranking. We introduce a new evaluation framework, inspired by information retrieval metrics, and construct a unified benchmark by aggregating existing fact verification datasets. Extensive experiments with diverse models show that incremental ranking strategies better capture complementary evidence and that LLM-based methods outperform shallower baselines, while still facing challenges in balancing sufficiency and redundancy. Compared to evidence selection, we conduct a controlled user study and demonstrate that evidence ranking both reduces reading effort and improves verification.

However, existing works do not effectively consider the impact of extraneous variables on the prediction of the target variable. On the other hand, they fail to fully extract complex sequence information based on various time patterns of the sequences. To address these drawbacks, we propose a DA-SPS model, which adopts different modules for feature extraction based on the information characteristics of different variables. DA-SPS mainly consists of two stages: the target variable processing stage (TVPS) and the extraneous variables processing stage (EVPS). In TVPS, the model first uses Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) to process the target variable sequence and then uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and P-Conv-LSTM which deploys a patching strategy to extract features from trend and seasonality components, respectively. In EVPS, the model filters extraneous variables that have a strong correlation with the target variate by using Spearman correlation analysis and further analyses them using the L-Attention module which consists of LSTM and attention mechanism. Finally, the results obtained by TVPS and EVPS are combined through weighted summation and linear mapping to produce the final prediction. The results on four public datasets demonstrate that the DA-SPS model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, its performance in real-world scenarios is further validated using a private dataset collected by ourselves, which contains the test items' information on laptop motherboards."

In the present study, we investigated the polymerization and stability of adenosine monophosphate (AMP), a key precursor to ribonucleic acid (RNA), in dry and hydrated conditions (10 wt% water) under 6 GPa at ambient and boiling water temperatures. Comprehensive analyses with the use of X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, scanning electron microscopy, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry revealed no evidence of polymerization, while AMP partly transformed to other organic compounds such as nucleobase-derived fragments of adenine, phosphoribose fragments, dehydrated adenosine, protonated adenosine, and oxidized adenosine. The torque measurements during HPT further highlight the mechanical behavior of AMP under extreme conditions. These findings suggest that, while HPT under the conditions tested does not facilitate polymerization, the formation of various compounds from AMP confirms the significance of astronomical impacts on the prebiotic chemistry of RNA on early Earth.

    "abstract": "The observed masses and radii of sub-Neptunes can be explained by a variety of bulk compositions, with the two leading scenarios being the gas dwarf and the water world scenario. The evolutionary history of sub-Neptunes on a population level has been proposed as a method to distinguish between the possible bulk compositions. Previous evolutionary models, however, neglected the crucial role of chemical interactions between the atmosphere and interior. We present a novel evolution framework for sub-Neptunes that not only considers the thermal evolution but also takes the chemical coupling of atmosphere and interior into account. Using this model, we examine how planets formed inside and outside the ice line can be observationally distinguished. Young sub-Neptunes store the majority of their volatile budget in the interior, independent of formation location and thus initial composition. Nevertheless, the atmospheric metallicity is a factor 4 higher for the planet formed outside the ice line. As the planet cools, hydrogen and oxygen exsolve from the interior, leading to an increase in atmosphere mass fraction for both planets, counteracting the contraction due to cooling. Consequently, radius evolution alone cannot distinguish sub-Neptunes formed inside the water ice line from water-rich planets formed outside of it. Instead, a key discriminator is the abundance of carbon-bearing species and the resulting atmospheric C/O ratio. For water-rich sub-Neptunes formed outside the \\ice line, almost all carbon is in the gaseous phase. We find that high molar fractions of CH$_4$ ($\\>10^{-2}$) and H$_2$O ($> 5\\times10^{-2}$), and a high C/O ratio $(> 5\\times10^{-1})$ are indicative of formation outside the ice line. In contrast, sub-Neptunes formed inside the ice line exhibit strongly suppressed CH$_4$ abundances, yielding C/O ratios ranging widely from $10^{-7}$ to $10^{-1}$. (Shortened version)"

    "abstract": "Existing video-based 3D Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) methods often produce physically implausible results, stemming from their reliance on flawed intermediate 3D pose anchors and their inability to effectively model complex spatiotemporal dynamics. To overcome these deep-rooted architectural problems, we introduce HMRMamba, a new paradigm for HMR that pioneers the use of Structured State Space Models (SSMs) for their efficiency and long-range modeling prowess. Our framework is distinguished by two core contributions. First, the Geometry-Aware Lifting Module, featuring a novel dual-scan Mamba architecture, creates a robust foundation for reconstruction. It directly grounds the 2D-to-3D pose lifting process with geometric cues from image features, producing a highly reliable 3D pose sequence that serves as a stable anchor. Second, the Motion-guided Reconstruction Network leverages this anchor to explicitly process kinematic patterns over time. By injecting this crucial temporal awareness, it significantly enhances the final mesh's coherence and robustness, particularly under occlusion and motion blur. Comprehensive evaluations on 3DPW, MPI-INF-3DHP, and Human3.6M benchmarks confirm that HMRMamba sets a new state-of-the-art, outperforming existing methods in both reconstruction accuracy and temporal consistency while offering superior computational efficiency."

Existing benchmarks mainly focus on problem-solving or problem-level guidance, leaving knowledge-centered teaching underexplored. We propose a syllabus-grounded evaluation framework that measures LLM teaching capability via student performance improvement after multi-turn instruction. By restricting teacher agents to structured knowledge points and example problems, the framework avoids information leakage and enables reuse of existing benchmarks. We instantiate the framework on Gaokao data across multiple subjects. Experiments reveal substantial variation in teaching effectiveness across models and domains: some models perform well in mathematics, while teaching remains challenging in physics and chemistry. We also find that incorporating example problems does not necessarily improve teaching, as models often shift toward example-specific error correction. Overall, our results highlight teaching ability as a distinct and measurable dimension of LLM behavior."

In this work, we develop an adaptive two-stage stochastic optimization framework to support dynamic decision-making for hardening critical grid components under multiple hazard exposures. Unlike traditional approaches, our model adapts to evolving climate conditions, enabling more resilient investment strategies. Furthermore, we integrate long-term (undergrounding) and short-term (vegetation management) hardening actions to jointly minimize total system costs. Extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in reducing outage and repair costs while enhancing the adaptability and robustness of grid infrastructure planning."

To obtain a strategy for edge weights refinement, we derive a design function inspired by the cost-to-go function in a new convergence analysis for Di-DGD. This results in a data-dependent dynamical design for the edge weights. A fully decentralized version of D3GD is developed such that each agent refines its communication strategy using only neighbor's information. Numerical experiments show that D3GD accelerates convergence towards stationary solution by 30-40\\% over Di-DGD, and learns edge weights that adapt to data similarity."

Existing approaches mainly focus on data centric or model centric modifications, treating the diffusion model as an isolated predictor. In this paper, we study memorization in diffusion models from a denoising centric perspective. We show that uniform timestep sampling leads to unequal learning contributions across denoising steps due to differences in signal to noise ratio, which biases training toward memorization. To address this, we propose a timestep sampling strategy that explicitly controls where learning occurs along the denoising trajectory. By adjusting the width of the confidence interval, our method provides direct control over the memorization generalization trade off. Experiments on image and 1D signal generation tasks demonstrate that shifting learning emphasis toward later denoising steps consistently reduces memorization and improves distributional alignment with training data, validating the generality and effectiveness of our approach."

    "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently achieved substantial progress in general-purpose perception and reasoning. Nevertheless, their deployment in Food-Service and Retail Stores (FSRS) scenarios encounters two major obstacles: (i) real-world FSRS data, collected from heterogeneous acquisition devices, are highly noisy and lack auditable, closed-loop data curation, which impedes the construction of high-quality, controllable, and reproducible training corpora; and (ii) existing evaluation protocols do not offer a unified, fine-grained and standardized benchmark spanning single-image, multi-image, and video inputs, making it challenging to objectively gauge model robustness. To address these challenges, we first develop Ostrakon-VL, an FSRS-oriented MLLM based on Qwen3-VL-8B. Second, we introduce ShopBench, the first public benchmark for FSRS. Third, we propose QUAD (Quality-aware Unbiased Automated Data-curation), a multi-stage multimodal instruction data curation pipeline. Leveraging a multi-stage training strategy, Ostrakon-VL achieves an average score of 60.1 on ShopBench, establishing a new state of the art among open-source MLLMs with comparable parameter scales and diverse architectures. Notably, it surpasses the substantially larger Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B (59.4) by +0.7, and exceeds the same-scale Qwen3-VL-8B (55.3) by +4.8, demonstrating significantly improved parameter efficiency. These results indicate that Ostrakon-VL delivers more robust and reliable FSRS-centric perception and decision-making capabilities. To facilitate reproducible research, we will publicly release Ostrakon-VL and the ShopBench benchmark."

To address these challenges, we propose EHR-RAG, a retrieval-augmented framework designed for accurate interpretation of long-horizon structured EHR data. EHR-RAG introduces three components tailored to longitudinal clinical prediction tasks: Event- and Time-Aware Hybrid EHR Retrieval to preserve clinical structure and temporal dynamics, Adaptive Iterative Retrieval to progressively refine queries in order to expand broad evidence coverage, and Dual-Path Evidence Retrieval and Reasoning to jointly retrieves and reasons over both factual and counterfactual evidence. Experiments across four long-horizon EHR prediction tasks show that EHR-RAG consistently outperforms the strongest LLM-based baselines, achieving an average Macro-F1 improvement of 10.76%. Overall, our work highlights the potential of retrieval-augmented LLMs to advance clinical prediction on structured EHR data in practice."

Crucially, we discover that these topological edge modes emerges not only at zero energy but also at the quasienergy zone boundary $E=π$, exhibiting identical localization robustness despite the fractal nature of the bulk spectrum. These results demonstrate that Floquet topological protection remains intact amidst quasiperiodic disorder, offering a concrete route to observing exotic non-equilibrium phases in photonic experiments."

This preliminary study should prove that using pattern correlations inside the loss function could enhance the generalisation performances. Coherently, results show that generalisation measures are never worse than the standard losses and several times they are better. In our opinion, it should be considered a careful study of this loss, coupled with shallow and deep neural networks. In fact, we present some novel results obtained with those architectures."

These approaches offer accuracy comparable to ab initio molecular dynamics (MD), but at a fraction of the computational cost. However, their reliability critically depends on the quality and representativeness of the training data. In particular, static training datasets often lead to failure when the force field encounters previously unseen atomic configurations during MD simulations. In this work, we present a framework for dynamically training ML force fields and demonstrate its effectiveness across materials with varying degrees of anharmonicity, including cubic boron arsenide (c-BAs), silicon (Si), and tin selenide (SnSe). Our method builds on the conventional lattice dynamics expansion of total energy and incorporates Bayesian error estimation to guide adaptive data acquisition during simulation. Specifically, we show that trajectory-averaged Bayesian errors enable efficient and targeted exploration of the configuration space, significantly enhancing the robustness and transferability of the resulting force fields. We further demonstrate how Bayesian error estimation can be applied to determine the convergence of the dynamic training without requiring additional ab initio data. This proposed framework offers a practical and easily implementable scheme to improve the training process, which is the most critical step in developing reliable ML force fields."

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of the global population, alongside exponential technological advancement, has intensified the demand for food production. Meeting this demand depends not only on increasing agricultural yield but also on minimizing food loss caused by crop diseases. Diseases account for a substantial portion of apple production losses, despite apples being among the most widely produced and nutritionally valuable fruits worldwide. Previous studies have employed machine learning techniques for feature extraction and early diagnosis of apple leaf diseases, and more recently, deep learning-based models have shown remarkable performance in disease recognition. However, most state-of-the-art deep learning models are highly parameter-intensive, resulting in increased training and inference time. Although lightweight models are more suitable for user-friendly and resource-constrained applications, they often suffer from performance degradation. To address the trade-off between efficiency and performance, we propose Mam-App, a parameter-efficient Mamba-based model for feature extraction and leaf disease classification. The proposed approach achieves competitive state-of-the-art performance on the PlantVillage Apple Leaf Disease dataset, attaining 99.58% accuracy, 99.30% precision, 99.14% recall, and a 99.22% F1-score, while using only 0.051M parameters. This extremely low parameter count makes the model suitable for deployment on drones, mobile devices, and other low-resource platforms. To demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of the proposed model, we further evaluate it on the PlantVillage Corn Leaf Disease and Potato Leaf Disease datasets.

    "abstract": "Identifying the extent to which every temporal segment influences a model's predictions is essential for explaining model decisions and increasing transparency. While post-hoc explainable methods based on gradients and feature-based attributions have been popular, they suffer from reference state sensitivity and struggle to generalize across time-series datasets, as they treat time points independently and ignore sequential dependencies. Another perspective on explainable time-series classification is through interpretable components of the model, for instance, leveraging self-attention mechanisms to estimate temporal attribution; however, recent findings indicate that these attention weights often fail to provide faithful measures of temporal importance. In this work, we advance this perspective and present a novel explainability-driven deep learning framework, TimeSliver, which jointly utilizes raw time-series data and its symbolic abstraction to construct a representation that maintains the original temporal structure. Each element in this representation linearly encodes the contribution of each temporal segment to the final prediction, allowing us to assign a meaningful importance score to every time point. For time-series classification, TimeSliver outperforms other temporal attribution methods by 11% on 7 distinct synthetic and real-world multivariate time-series datasets. TimeSliver also achieves predictive performance within 2% of state-of-the-art baselines across 26 UEA benchmark datasets, positioning it as a strong and explainable framework for general time-series classification."

However, the computational overhead remains a major challenge. While prior work has improved efficiency, most approaches build on models originally designed for plaintext inference. Such models incur architectural inefficiencies when adapted to HE. We argue that substantial gains require networks tailored to HE rather than retrofitting plaintext architectures. Our design has two components: the building block and the overall architecture. First, StriaBlock targets the most expensive HE operation, rotation. It integrates ExRot-Free Convolution and a novel Cross Kernel, eliminating external rotations and requiring only 19% of the internal rotations used by plaintext models. Second, our architectural principles include (i) the Focused Constraint Principle, which limits cost-sensitive factors while preserving flexibility elsewhere, and (ii) the Channel Packing-Aware Scaling Principle, which adapts bottleneck ratios to ciphertext channel capacity that varies with depth. Together, these strategies control both local and end-to-end HE cost, enabling a balanced HE-tailored network. We evaluate the resulting StriaNet across datasets of varying scales, including ImageNet, Tiny ImageNet, and CIFAR-10. At comparable accuracy, StriaNet achieves speedups of 9.78x, 6.01x, and 9.24x on ImageNet, Tiny ImageNet, and CIFAR-10, respectively."

    "abstract": "Layered NbOX$_2$ ($X=\\mathrm{Cl,\\,Br,\\,I}$), a member of the van der Waals ferroelectric family, exhibits intrinsic ferroelectricity and pronounced nonlinear optical responses, making it a promising candidate for integrated nanophotonics applications. While previous studies have emphasized the material's strong second-order nonlinear responses, higher-order nonlinear responses are still mostly unexplored. This work systematically investigates NbOI$_2$ using high harmonic generation (HHG) spectroscopy. Driven by an intense mid-infrared laser field centered at $\\sim4~μ\\mathrm{m}$ wavelength, highly anisotropic odd- and even-order harmonics up to the 16th order are generated at a low peak intensity of $0.4~\\mathrm{TW\\,cm^{-2}}$, extending beyond the material's bandgap. Both bulk and flake forms of NbOI$_2$ display pronounced harmonic emission from the near-infrared to the deep-ultraviolet spectral region, with a notably high overall conversion efficiency compared to other known materials. Polarization-resolved measurements reveal that even-order harmonics remain aligned with the crystal polar axis regardless of the driving-field orientation, whereas odd-order harmonics are dynamically affected. First-principles calculations suggest that the flat valence band associated with Peierls dimerization enhances HHG efficiency through electron correlation. These findings provide fresh perspectives on HHG in van der Waals ferroelectric materials and facilitate the development of compact and tunable quantum light sources."

    "abstract": "Most reinforcement learning (RL) methods for training large language models (LLMs) require ground-truth labels or task-specific verifiers, limiting scalability when correctness is ambiguous or expensive to obtain. We introduce Reinforcement Learning from Meta-Evaluation (RLME), which optimizes a generator using reward derived from an evaluator's answers to natural-language meta-questions (e.g., \"Is the answer correct?\" or \"Is the reasoning logically consistent?\"). RLME treats the evaluator's probability of a positive judgment as a reward and updates the generator via group-relative policy optimization, enabling learning without labels. Across a suite of experiments, we show that RLME achieves accuracy and sample efficiency comparable to label-based training, enables controllable trade-offs among multiple objectives, steers models toward reliable reasoning patterns rather than post-hoc rationalization, and generalizes to open-domain settings where ground-truth labels are unavailable, broadening the domains in which LLMs may be trained with RL."

In this work, based on the observation that LLMs exhibit local preferences, we propose a novel contrastive guidance strategy along the temporal dimension, namely Temporal Guidance (TeGu). Our method ingeniously leverages Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) to construct weaker amateur predictions for model self-contrast. To standardize the implementation of this mechanism, we further introduce a lightweight Conditional MTP Projector (cMTPP), which avoids maintaining multiple independent networks as required by other MTP modules. Across various model series and benchmarks, TeGu achieves significant performance improvements while maintaining low additional memory consumption and computational overhead."

We show this weakness stems from both sycophancy and inadequate ability to evaluate peer reliability. To address this, we first formalize the learning problem of history-aware reference, introducing the historical interactions of peers as additional input, so that agents can estimate peer reliability and learn from trustworthy peers when uncertain. This shifts the task from evaluating peer reasoning quality to estimating peer reliability based on interaction history. We then develop Epistemic Context Learning (ECL): a reasoning framework that conditions predictions on explicitly-built peer profiles from history. We further optimize ECL by reinforcement learning using auxiliary rewards. Our experiments reveal that our ECL enables small models like Qwen 3-4B to outperform a history-agnostic baseline 8x its size (Qwen 3-30B) by accurately identifying reliable peers. ECL also boosts frontier models to near-perfect (100%) performance. We show that ECL generalizes well to various MA configurations and we find that trust is modeled well by LLMs, revealing a strong correlation in trust modeling accuracy and final answer quality."

    "abstract": "Evaluation of Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models has long been dominated by global correlation metrics, such as Pearson Linear Correlation Coefficient (PLCC) and Spearman Rank-Order Correlation Coefficient (SRCC). While widely adopted, these metrics reduce performance to a single scalar, failing to capture how ranking consistency varies across the local quality spectrum. For example, two IQA models may achieve identical SRCC values, yet one ranks high-quality images (related to high Mean Opinion Score, MOS) more reliably, while the other better discriminates image pairs with small quality/MOS differences (related to $|Δ$MOS$|$). Such complementary behaviors are invisible under global metrics. Moreover, SRCC and PLCC are sensitive to test-sample quality distributions, yielding unstable comparisons across test sets. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{Granularity-Modulated Correlation (GMC)}, which provides a structured, fine-grained analysis of IQA performance. GMC includes: (1) a \\textbf{Granularity Modulator} that applies Gaussian-weighted correlations conditioned on absolute MOS values and pairwise MOS differences ($|Δ$MOS$|$) to examine local performance variations, and (2) a \\textbf{Distribution Regulator} that regularizes correlations to mitigate biases from non-uniform quality distributions. The resulting \\textbf{correlation surface} maps correlation values as a joint function of MOS and $|Δ$MOS$|$, providing a 3D representation of IQA performance. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that GMC reveals performance characteristics invisible to scalar metrics, offering a more informative and reliable paradigm for analyzing, comparing, and deploying IQA models.

Early efforts applied ARIES-style cost-scaling relations to generate Nth-of-a-kind (NOAK) estimates and were calibrated through a pilot study with Bechtel and Decysive Systems to benchmark balance-of-plant (BOP) costs and validate plant-level reasonableness from an engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) perspective. Subsequent work, informed by Lucid Catalyst studies of nuclear cost drivers, expanded the methodology to treat indirect costs explicitly and to evaluate cost-reduction pathways for non-fusion-island systems through design-for-cost practices, modularization, centralized manufacturing, and learning. As ARPA-E's fusion portfolio expanded, these methods were applied across BETHE and GAMOW concepts (and select ALPHA revisits), including enhanced treatment of tritium handling and plant integration supported by Princeton/PPPL expertise. In 2023 the capability was refactored to align with the IAEA-GEN-IV EMWG-EPRI code-of-accounts lineage, while key ARIES-derived scaling relations were replaced by bottom-up subsystem models for dominant fusion cost drivers (e.g., magnets, lasers, power supplies, and power-core components) coupled to physics-informed power balances and engineering-constrained radial builds. These developments were implemented in the spreadsheet-based Fusion Economics code (FECONs) and released as an open-source Python framework (pyFECONs), providing a transparent mapping from subsystem estimates to standardized accounts and a consistent computation of LCOE."

    "abstract": "Cloth manipulation is a ubiquitous task in everyday life, but it remains an open challenge for robotics. The difficulties in developing cloth manipulation policies are attributed to the high-dimensional state space, complex dynamics, and high propensity to self-occlusion exhibited by fabrics. As analytical methods have not been able to provide robust and general manipulation policies, reinforcement learning (RL) is considered a promising approach to these problems. However, to address the large state space and complex dynamics, data-based methods usually rely on large models and long training times. The resulting computational cost significantly hampers the development and adoption of these methods. Additionally, due to the challenge of robust state estimation, garment manipulation policies often adopt an end-to-end learning approach with workspace images as input. While this approach enables a conceptually straightforward sim-to-real transfer via real-world fine-tuning, it also incurs a significant computational cost by training agents on a highly lossy representation of the environment state. This paper questions this common design choice by exploring an efficient and modular approach to RL for cloth manipulation. We show that, through careful design choices, model size and training time can be significantly reduced when learning in simulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the resulting simulation-trained model can be transferred to the real world. We evaluate our approach on the SoftGym benchmark and achieve significant performance improvements over available baselines on our task, while using a substantially smaller model."

By incorporating the coupled-channel dynamics between bare quark-model states and the $πN$, $πΔ$ and $ηN$ meson-baryon continua, we examine the mass shifts and structural properties of these excited states. We demonstrate that when the model parameters are calibrated to match the $1P$-wave spectrum and their widths, the pole associated with the bare $2S$ state is naturally shifted downward to the mass region of physical Roper resonance--$N(1440)$, thereby offering a dynamical explanation for the long-standing level-inversion problem. An approximate analysis of compositeness and elementariness reveals that the Roper resonance contains a significant meson-baryon continuum states, consistent with the picture of a bare core heavily dressed by meson-baryon cloud. Simultaneously, the pole positions and properties of five $1P$-wave resonances--$N(1535)$, $N(1650)$, $N(1520)$, $N(1700)$ and $N(1675)$ are successfully reproduced. Our results highlight the essential role of coupled-channel effects in shaping the nucleon spectrum and provide a consistent microscopic insight into the interplay between internal quark degrees of freedom and external hadronic fields."

We compare duration, spectral hardness ratio, minimum variability timescale (MVT), and spectral lag between these components. Both precursors and main bursts have durations and hardness broadly consistent with Type II GRBs. However, precursors show longer MVTs (by factors of 3-10) and diverse lags with near-zero median values, while main bursts display variable MVTs and positive lags. These differences suggest precursors may originate from distinct dissipation conditions, possibly due to cocoon shock breakout or early magnetically dominated outflows. Despite temporal differences, both episodes are consistent with a single collapsar origin, providing no evidence for dual-progenitor events. Our findings support pulse-resolved classification and show that precursors offer critical insights into jet formation and pre-burst activity."

Motivated by this insight, we propose Tri-Component Attention Profiling (TCAP), an unsupervised defense framework to filter backdoor samples. TCAP decomposes cross-modal attention maps into the three components, identifies trigger-responsive attention heads via Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) statistical profiling, and isolates poisoned samples through EM-based vote aggregation.

Starting from the theoretical insights, we then develop novel variants of local-SSL algorithms to approximate global BP-SSL in deep non-linear convolutional neural networks. Variants that improve the similarity between gradient updates of local-SSL with those of global BP-SSL also show better performance on image datasets (CIFAR-10, STL-10, and Tiny ImageNet). The best local-SSL rule with the CLAPP loss function matches the performance of a comparable global BP-SSL with InfoNCE or CPC-like loss functions, and improves upon state-of-the-art for local SSL on these benchmarks."

Focusing on the ULDM Jeans scale, we identify the critical conditions under which high-redshift baryonic gas, strongly confined by central solitonic cores of the halos, undergoes direct and monolithic collapse. The solitonic potential naturally drives rapid inflow and shock heating, allowing the gas to exceed the critical atomic-cooling and fragmentation-suppression threshold of $\\sim 3 \\times 10^4 {\\rm K}$ without invoking an external UV background. We derive semi-analytic relations for the halo mass, soliton mass, baryonic core radius, and thermodynamic state of the gas, including the effects of baryonic contraction. These relations simultaneously determine the minimum and maximum SMBH seed masses as functions of redshift. In this framework, pristine gas clouds that satisfy the temperature threshold collapse without fragmentation, forming SMBH seeds with characteristic masses of order $\\sim 10^5M_\\odot$, while systems below the threshold are expected to form compact star clusters instead. Our model also implies an upper limit on the attainable SMBH mass, predicting a maximum mass scale of order $\\sim10^{10}M_\\odot$, consistent with the most massive quasars observed to date. The ULDM particle mass required to reproduce the inferred seed mass scale, $m \\simeq 10^{-22}{\\rm eV}$, coincides with the value favored by galactic-scale observations, providing a unified explanation for the characteristic masses of both galactic cores and early SMBH seeds. Our model predicts efficient SMBH seed formation at redshifts $z \\gtrsim 10$ and offers a natural interpretation of recently observed little red dots as SMBHs embedded in compact, hot, ionized gas clouds."

Given a set of $n$ locations, $h$ vehicles of identical capacity $λ$ located at various depots, and $m$ ride requests each defined by a source and a destination, the goal is to plan non-preemptive routes that serve all requests while minimizing the total travel distance, ensuring that no vehicle carries more than $λ$ passengers at any time. The best-known approximation ratio for the mDaRP remains $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrtλ\\log m)$. We propose two simple algorithms: the first achieves the same approximation ratio of $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrtλ\\log m)$ with improved running time, and the second attains an approximation ratio of $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{\\frac{m}λ})$. A combination of them yields an approximation ratio of $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt[4]{n}\\log^{\\frac{1}{2}}n)$ under $m=Θ(n)$.

While recent deep learning approaches for depression detection have shown promise, most rely on limited feature types, overlook explicit cross-modal interactions, and employ simple concatenation or static weighting for fusion. To overcome these limitations, we propose CAF-Mamba, a novel Mamba-based cross-modal adaptive attention fusion framework. CAF-Mamba not only captures cross-modal interactions explicitly and implicitly, but also dynamically adjusts modality contributions through a modality-wise attention mechanism, enabling more effective multimodal fusion. Experiments on two in-the-wild benchmark datasets, LMVD and D-Vlog, demonstrate that CAF-Mamba consistently outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance."

We investigated the meteoroids of this shower using fireball data from the European Fireball Network supplemented by video data of faint meteors. We first derived the criteria for assigning meteors to this shower. A fragmentation model was then applied to selected shower fireballs with good deceleration data and light curves. Meteoroid fragmentation strengths and bulk densities were derived and compared with three other showers. We have confirmed the four year periodicity in the activity of eta-Virginids and their presence in the 3:1 mean motion resonance with Jupiter. The orbital period of four years was directly measured for the fireballs. Fainter meteors showed somewhat longer periods but the shower is poor in faint meteors. No member fainter than magnitude +1 was observed instrumentally. The physical properties of meteoroids are different from cometary streams and are similar to the Geminids. The limiting fragmentation strength of 0.5 MPa and typical bulk density of cm-sized meteoroids of 1500 kg/m3 suggest that the parent body is a carbonaceous asteroid. Besides Geminids, eta-Virginids is another stream of asteroidal origin. Some small meteoroids have densities around 2500 kg/m3. Three asteroids of the sizes between 40 - 120 meters have been found to have similar orbits but their relation to eta-Virginids remains uncertain."

    "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that disk warps can result from galaxy mergers. Recent research indicates a noticeable decline in the rotation curve (RC) of the Milky Way (MW), suggesting the need for a new low-mass model to describe its dynamical features. This study constructs a new Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) merger model to characterize the RC features of our galaxy. We use the GIZMO code to simulate mergers with various orbital parameters to investigate how the disk warp evolves under different conditions. This simulation demonstrates the evolutionary mechanism of disk warp, which arises due to the asymmetric gravitational potential of the dark matter (DM) halo generated universally by galaxy mergers. The results indicate that the tilt angle of the DM halo partly reflects the gravitational strength at the $Z=0$ plane, while the gravitational strength on the disk plane reflects the amplitude of disk warp. We identify a dual-regime interaction mechanism driven by the asymmetric halo potential. On short timescales, we find a distinct anti-correlation between the halo's tilt angle and the disk's warp amplitude, indicating a `seesaw' mechanism of angular momentum exchange. On secular timescales, however, dynamical friction drives a global alignment, causing both the halo tilt and the warp amplitude to decay simultaneously. Furthermore, we demonstrate that high-inclination mergers can sustain long-lived prograde precession, where the persistent yet decaying gravitational torque maintains the prograde bending mode against differential wind-up."

    "abstract": "In latent diffusion models, the autoencoder (AE) is typically expected to balance two capabilities: faithful reconstruction and a generation-friendly latent space (e.g., low gFID). In recent ImageNet-scale AE studies, we observe a systematic bias toward generative metrics in handling this trade-off: reconstruction metrics are increasingly under-reported, and ablation-based AE selection often favors the best-gFID configuration even when reconstruction fidelity degrades. We theoretically analyze why this gFID-dominant preference can appear unproblematic for ImageNet generation, yet becomes risky when scaling to controllable diffusion: AEs can induce condition drift, which limits achievable condition alignment. Meanwhile, we find that reconstruction fidelity, especially instance-level measures, better indicates controllability. We empirically validate the impact of tilted autoencoder evaluation on controllability by studying several recent ImageNet AEs. Using a multi-dimensional condition-drift evaluation protocol reflecting controllable generation tasks, we find that gFID is only weakly predictive of condition preservation, whereas reconstruction-oriented metrics are substantially more aligned. ControlNet experiments further confirm that controllability tracks condition preservation rather than gFID. Overall, our results expose a gap between ImageNet-centric AE evaluation and the requirements of scalable controllable diffusion, offering practical guidance for more reliable benchmarking and model selection."

By combining the fast constraints from the simple-pe algorithm with the nested sampling acceleration technique of posterior repartitioning, we demonstrate that our method can guide the nested sampler towards the most probable regions of parameter space more efficiently for signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) greater than 20, while mathematically guaranteeing that the final inference is identical to that of a standard, uninformed analysis. We validate the method through an injection study, demonstrating that it produces statistically robust and unbiased results, whilst providing speedups of up to $2.2\\times$ for binaries with SNRs $< 150$. Importantly, we show that the performance gain provided by our method scales with SNR, establishing it as a powerful technique to mitigate the cost of analysing signals from current and future gravitational-wave observatories."

StarSD decouples drafting and verification, enabling effective sharing of draft computation, and preventing distributed accelerators from remaining idle under bursty workloads. We provide a system-level analysis that characterizes when and why a single draft model can remain fully utilized by multiple verifiers, yielding predictable latency and utilization gains. Extensive experiments in real-world distributed inference settings demonstrate that StarSD simplifies deployment and supports flexible resource allocation across heterogeneous accelerators, while maintaining output quality.

While dual-rail erasure qubits have been demonstrated with a strong error hierarchy in circuit quantum electrodynamics, biased-erasure qubits -- where erasures originate predominantly from one logical basis state -- offer further advantages. Here, we realize a hardware-efficient biased-erasure qubit encoded in the vacuum and two-photon Fock states of a single microwave cavity. The qubit exhibits an erasure bias ratio of over 265. By using a transmon ancilla for logical measurements and mid-circuit erasure detections, we achieve logical state assignment errors below 1% and convert over 99.3% leakage errors into detected erasures. After postselection against erasures, we achieve effective logical relaxation and dephasing rates of $(6.2~\\mathrm{ms})^{-1}$ and $(3.1~\\mathrm{ms})^{-1}$, respectively, which exceed the erasure error rate by factors of 31 and 15, establishing a strong error hierarchy within the logical subspace. These postselected error rates indicate a coherence gain of about 6.0 beyond the break-even point set by the best physical qubit encoded in the two lowest Fock states in the cavity. Moreover, randomized benchmarking with interleaved erasure detections reveals a residual logical gate error of 0.29%. This work establishes a compact and hardware-efficient platform for biased-erasure qubits, promising concatenations into outer-level stabilizer codes toward fault-tolerant quantum computation."

    "abstract": "Missing data is a prevalent issue in many applications, including large medical registries such as the Swedish Healthcare Quality Registries, potentially leading to biased or inefficient analyses if not handled properly. Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) is a popular and versatile method for handling multivariate missing data but traditional implementations face significant challenges when applied to big data sets due to computational time and memory limitations. To address this, the bigMICE package was developed, adapting the MICE framework to big data using Apache Spark MLLib and Spark ML. Our implementation allows for controlling the maximum memory usage during the execution, enabling processing of very large data sets on a hardware with a limited memory, such as ordinary laptops. The developed package was tested on a large Swedish medical registry to measure memory usage, runtime and dependence of the imputation quality on sample size and on missingness proportion in the data. In conclusion, our method is generally more memory efficient and faster on large data sets compared to a commonly used MICE implementation. We also demonstrate that working with very large datasets can result in high quality imputations even when a variable has a large proportion of missing data. This paper also provides guidelines and recommendations on how to install and use our open source package."

Recent work has leveraged large language models (LLMs) to address the limitations of traditional relevance models, especially for long-tail and ambiguous queries. By incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, these approaches improve both accuracy and interpretability through multi-step reasoning. However, two key limitations remain: (1) most existing approaches rely on single-perspective CoT reasoning, which fails to capture the multifaceted nature of e-commerce relevance (e.g., user intent vs. attribute-level matching vs. business-specific rules); and (2) although CoT-enhanced LLM's offer rich reasoning capabilities, their high inference latency necessitates knowledge distillation for real-time deployment, yet current distillation methods discard the CoT rationale structure at inference, using it as a transient auxiliary signal and forfeiting its reasoning utility. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that better exploits CoT semantics throughout the optimization pipeline. Specifically, the teacher model leverages Multi-Perspective CoT (MPCoT) to generate diverse rationales and combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to construct a more robust reasoner. For distillation, we introduce Latent Reasoning Knowledge Distillation (LRKD), which endows a student model with a lightweight inference-time latent reasoning extractor, allowing efficient and low-latency internalization of the LLM's sophisticated reasoning capabilities. Evaluated in offline experiments and online A/B tests on an e-commerce search advertising platform serving tens of millions of users daily, our method delivers significant offline gains, showing clear benefits in both commercial performance and user experience."

Next, sufficient conditions are proposed to guarantee the global stability invariance of ordinary differential systems under the influence of diffusions. New theorems show that the diffusion is a double-edged sword in judging the stability of diffusion systems. Besides, an example is constructed to illuminate that any non-zero constant equilibrium point must be not in the phase plane of dynamic system under Dirichlet zero boundary value, or it must lead to a contradiction. Next, under Lipschitz assumptions on active function, another example is designed to prove that the small diffusion effect will cause the essential change of the phase plane structure of the dynamic behavior of the delayed neural networks via a Saddle point theorem. Finally, a numerical example illustrates the feasibility of the proposed methods. It is worth mentioning that some interesting mathematical problems are originally put forward in the last chapter."

We present a novel strategy for addressing this challenge by casting prediction of variable-sized sets as a continuous inference problem. Our approach, CORDS (Continuous Representations of Discrete Structures), provides an invertible mapping that transforms a set of spatial objects into continuous fields: a density field that encodes object locations and count, and a feature field that carries their attributes over the same support. Because the mapping is invertible, models operate entirely in field space while remaining exactly decodable to discrete sets. We evaluate CORDS across molecular generation and regression, object detection, simulation-based inference, and a mathematical task involving recovery of local maxima, demonstrating robust handling of unknown set sizes with competitive accuracy."

The product of the V-band geometric albedo, $p_V$, with the physical cross-section of the nucleus is $0.22 \\pm 0.07$ km$^{2}$, which corresponds to an effective radius of $1.3 \\pm 0.2$ km if assuming $p_{V} = 0.04$, as is typical for cometary nuclei in the solar system. This size is in agreement with our estimate derived from the reported nongravitational effect and activity of the interstellar object. If the measured photometric variations are solely due to the rotation of an aspherical nucleus, the axis ratio must be $2:1$ or greater, and the rotation period $\\gtrsim\\!1$ hr. Leveraging the range of covered phase angles, we identified a significant opposition surge of $\\sim\\!0.2$ mag with a width of $3^\\circ \\pm 1^\\circ$, which may include concurrent contributions from orbital plane crossing and tail projection, and determined a linear phase slope of $0.026 \\pm 0.006$ mag degree$^{-1}$ for the coma dust. Compared to the preperihelion brightening trend, 3I faded more rapidly on the outbound leg, following an activity index of $4.5 \\pm 0.3$, not unusual in the context of solar system comets. This activity asymmetry is further corroborated by a postperihelion coma surface brightness profile that is significantly shallower than its preperihelion counterpart. From the statistics, we infer that multiple interstellar objects resembling 3I likely went undetected even before the discovery of 1I/`Oumuamua."

Instead of modifying model parameters, we learn a transformation over representations that imposes an information bottleneck: maximizing mutual information with retained data while suppressing information about data to be forgotten. We derive variational surrogates that make this objective tractable and show how they can be instantiated in two practical regimes: when both retain and forget data are available, and in a zero-shot setting where only forget data can be accessed. Experiments across several benchmarks demonstrate that Representation Unlearning achieves more reliable forgetting, better utility retention, and greater computational efficiency than parameter-centric baselines."

We show that existing encoder-based attacks can substantially overestimate the robustness of compressed LVLMs, due to an optimization-inference mismatch: perturbations are optimized on the full-token representation, while inference is performed through a token-compression bottleneck. To address this gap, we propose the Compression-AliGnEd attack (CAGE), which aligns perturbation optimization with compression inference without assuming access to the deployed compression mechanism or its token budget. CAGE combines (i) expected feature disruption, which concentrates distortion on tokens likely to survive across plausible budgets, and (ii) rank distortion alignment, which actively aligns token distortions with rank scores to promote the retention of highly distorted evidence. Across diverse representative plug-and-play compression mechanisms and datasets, our results show that CAGE consistently achieves lower robust accuracy than the baseline. This work highlights that robustness assessments ignoring compression can be overly optimistic, calling for compression-aware security evaluation and defenses for efficient LVLMs."

    "abstract": "Hyperbolic space is quickly gaining traction as a promising geometry for hierarchical and robust representation learning. A core open challenge is the development of a mathematical formulation of hyperbolic neural networks that is both efficient and captures the key properties of hyperbolic space. The Lorentz model of hyperbolic space has been shown to enable both fast forward and backward propagation. However, we prove that, with the current formulation of Lorentz linear layers, the hyperbolic norms of the outputs scale logarithmically with the number of gradient descent steps, nullifying the key advantage of hyperbolic geometry. We propose a new Lorentz linear layer grounded in the well-known ``distance-to-hyperplane\" formulation. We prove that our formulation results in the usual linear scaling of output hyperbolic norms with respect to the number of gradient descent steps. Our new formulation, together with further algorithmic efficiencies through Lorentzian activation functions and a new caching strategy results in neural networks fully abiding by hyperbolic geometry while simultaneously bridging the computation gap to Euclidean neural networks.

    "abstract": "The performance of large language models (LLMs) on verifiable tasks is usually measured by pass@k, the probability of answering a question correctly at least once in k trials. At a fixed budget, a more suitable metric is coverage@cost, the average number of unique questions answered as a function of the total number of attempts. We connect the two metrics and show that the empirically-observed power-law behavior in pass@k leads to a sublinear growth of the coverage@cost (diminishing returns). To solve this problem, we propose Reset-and-Discard (ReD), a query method of LLMs that increases coverage@cost for any given budget, regardless of the pass@k form. Moreover, given a pass@k, we can quantitatively predict the savings in the total number of attempts using ReD. If pass@k is not available for the model, ReD can infer its power-law exponent. Experiments on three LLMs using HumanEval demonstrate that ReD substantially reduces the required attempts, tokens, and USD cost to reach a desired coverage, while also offering an efficient way to measure inference power-laws."

    "abstract": "Monitoring and forecasting fault slip evolution are fundamental for understanding earthquake cycles and assessing future seismic hazards. This study proposes a physics-based data assimilation framework that integrates geodetic observations with fault mechanics introducing spatial heterogeneity in frictional properties, with a particular focus on short-term fault slip forecasting. The proposed method employs physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to calculate fault slip evolutions and to optimize the spatial distribution of frictional properties and is applied to the 2010 slow slip event beneath the Bungo Channel, southwest Japan, by changing the data period to be assimilated. When only the initial phase of slip acceleration is assimilated, a velocity-weakening frictional region is inferred beneath southwest Shikoku, corresponding to the initial nucleation are of the slow slip event. Out results demonstrate that the PINN-based data assimilation framework successfully forecasts slow transient slip even when only slip acceleration data are assimilated, whereas forecasts based on frictionally homogeneous models result in unstable fast slip. This difference can be interpreted as a consequence of introducing frictional heterogeneity, which allows both the characteristic size of the slipping region and the critical nucleation size to be variable, leading to stable slip evolution consistent with observations. When longer observation periods are assimilated, a velocity-strengthening region emerges around the slip-weakening patch, progressively restricting the direction of slip propagation. This velocity-strengthening region is interpreted as a mechanical constraint imposed by fault physics, linking the slip regions required to reproduce the observed geodetic time series. The results highlight the capability of PINN-based data assimilation incorporating geodetic observations and fault mechanics."

This study addresses that gap by applying Social Identity Theory (SIT) to investigate four distinct forms of bias: lack of career development, stereotyped task selection, unwelcoming environments, and identity attacks. Using a vignette-based survey, we quantified the prevalence of these biases, identified the demographics most affected, assessed their consequences, and explored the motivations behind biased actions. Our results show that career development and task selection biases are the most prevalent forms, with over two-thirds of victims experiencing them multiple times. Women were more than three times as likely as men to face career development bias, task selection bias, and an unwelcoming environment. In parallel, individuals from marginalized ethnic backgrounds were disproportionately targeted by identity attacks. Our analysis also confirms that, beyond gender and race, factors such as age, years of experience, organization size, and geographic location are significant predictors of bias victimization."

We operationalize this in Hypersolid, a method using short-range hard-ball repulsion to prevent local collisions. This constraint results in a high-separation geometric regime that preserves augmentation diversity, excelling on fine-grained and low-resolution classification tasks."

    "abstract": "Superradiance is a quantum phenomenon in which coherence between emitters results in enhanced and directional radiative emission. Many quantum optical phenomena can be characterized by the two-time quantum correlation function $g^{(2)}(t,τ)$, which describes the photon statistics of emitted radiation. However, the critical task of determining $g^{(2)}(t,τ)$ becomes intractable for large emitter ensembles due to the exponential scaling of the Hilbert space dimension with the number of emitters. Here, we analyse and benchmark two approximate numerical sampling methods applicable to emitter arrays embedded within electromagnetic environments, which generally provide upper and lower bounds for $g^{(2)}(t,0)$. We also introduce corrections to these methods (termed offset corrections) that significantly improve the quality of the predictions. The optimal choice of method depends on the total number of emitters, such that taken together, the two approaches provide accurate descriptions across a broad range of important regimes. This work therefore provides new theoretical tools for studying the well-known yet complex phenomenon of superradiance in large ensembles of quantum emitters."

We introduce Skill Mixture-of-Experts Policy (SMP), a diffusion-based mixture-of-experts policy that learns a compact orthogonal skill basis and uses sticky routing to compose actions from a small, task-relevant subset of experts at each step. A variational training objective supports this design, and adaptive expert activation at inference yields fast sampling without oversized backbones. We validate SMP in simulation and on a real dual-arm platform with multi-task learning and transfer learning tasks, where SMP achieves higher success rates and markedly lower inference cost than large diffusion baselines. These results indicate a practical path toward scalable, transferable multi-task manipulation: learn reusable skills once, activate only what is needed, and adapt quickly when tasks change."

We further show that pairwise divergence matrices, including Kullback-Leibler divergence, Jeffrey Divergence, Jensen-Shannon Divergence and antisymmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence, provide more comprehensive measures of statistical changes than scalar entropy alone. Our approach successfully detects the onset of both long- and short-range order in neutron and X-ray scattering data, as well as a non-trivial phase transition in magnetic skyrmion lattices observed through Lorentz-transition electron microscopy. These results establish a framework for automated, model-free analysis of experimental data with broad applications in materials science and condensed matter physics."

    "abstract": "Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is a widely used analytical method for chemical substance detection, but measurement reliability tends to deteriorate in the presence of interfering substances. In particular, interfering substances cause nonspecific peaks, residence time shifts, and increased background noise, resulting in reduced sensitivity and false alarms. To overcome these challenges, in this paper, we propose an artificial intelligence discrimination framework based on a peak-aware conditional generative model to improve the reliability of GC-MS measurements under interference conditions. The framework is learned with a novel peak-aware mechanism that highlights the characteristic peaks of GC-MS data, allowing it to generate important spectral features more faithfully. In addition, chemical and solvent information is encoded in a latent vector embedded with it, allowing a conditional generative adversarial neural network (CGAN) to generate a synthetic GC-MS signal consistent with the experimental conditions. This generates an experimental dataset that assumes indirect substance situations in chemical substance data, where acquisition is limited without conducting real experiments. These data are used for the learning of AI-based GC-MS discrimination models to help in accurate chemical substance discrimination. We conduct various quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the generated simulated data to verify the validity of the proposed framework. We also verify how the generative model improves the performance of the AI discrimination framework. Representatively, the proposed method is shown to consistently achieve cosine similarity and Pearson correlation coefficient values above 0.9 while preserving peak number diversity and reducing false alarms in the discrimination model."

    "abstract": "Stratified fluids composed of a sequence of alternate layers show interesting macroscopic properties, which may be quite different from those of the individual constituent fluids. On a macroscopic scale, such systems can be considered a sort of fluid metamaterial. In many cases each fluid layer can be described by Euler equations following the stiffened gas equation of state. The computation of detailed numerical solutions of such stratified material poses several challenges, first and foremost the issue of artificial smearing of material parameters across interface boundaries. Lagrangian schemes completely eliminate this issue, but at the cost of rather stringent time step restrictions. In this work we introduce an implicit numerical method for the multimaterial Euler equations in Lagrangian coordinates. The implicit discretization is aimed at bypassing the prohibitive time step restrictions present in flows with stratified media, where one of the materials is particularly dense, or rigid (or both). This is the case for flows of water-air mixtures, air-granular media, or similar high density ratio systems. We will present the novel discretisation approach, which makes extensive use of the remarkable structure of the governing equations in Lagrangian coordinates to find the solution by means of a single implicit discrete wave equation for the pressure field, yielding a symmetric positive definite structure and thus a particularly efficient algorithm. Additionally, we will introduce simple filtering strategies for counteracting the emergence of pressure or density oscillations typically encountered in multimaterial flows, and will present results concerning the robustness, accuracy, and performance of the proposed method, including applications to stratified media with high density and stiffness ratios."

    "abstract": "AutoRegressive Visual Generation (ARVG) models retain an architecture compatible with language models, while achieving performance comparable to diffusion-based models. Quantization is commonly employed in neural networks to reduce model size and computational latency. However, applying quantization to ARVG remains largely underexplored, and existing quantization methods fail to generalize effectively to ARVG models. In this paper, we explore this issue and identify three key challenges: (1) severe outliers at channel-wise level, (2) highly dynamic activations at token-wise level, and (3) mismatched distribution information at sample-wise level. To these ends, we propose PTQ4ARVG, a training-free post-training quantization (PTQ) framework consisting of: (1) Gain-Projected Scaling (GPS) mitigates the channel-wise outliers, which expands the quantization loss via a Taylor series to quantify the gain of scaling for activation-weight quantization, and derives the optimal scaling factor through differentiation.(2) Static Token-Wise Quantization (STWQ) leverages the inherent properties of ARVG, fixed token length and position-invariant distribution across samples, to address token-wise variance without incurring dynamic calibration overhead.(3) Distribution-Guided Calibration (DGC) selects samples that contribute most to distributional entropy, eliminating the sample-wise distribution mismatch. Extensive experiments show that PTQ4ARVG can effectively quantize the ARVG family models to 8-bit and 6-bit while maintaining competitive performance.

The VAE consists of an encoder network that maps high-dimensional EOS data into a lower-dimensional latent space and a decoder network that reconstructs the full EOS from the latent representation. The latent space includes supervised NS observables derived from the training EOS data, as well as latent random variables corresponding to additional unspecified EOS features learned automatically. Sampling the latent space enables the generation of new, causal, and stable EOS models that satisfy astronomical constraints on the supervised NS observables, while allowing Bayesian inference of the EOS incorporating additional multimessenger data, including gravitational waves from LIGO/Virgo and mass and radius measurements of pulsars. Based on a VAE trained on a Skyrme EOS dataset, we find that a latent space with two supervised NS observables, the maximum mass $(M_{\\max})$ and the canonical radius $(R_{1.4})$, together with one latent random variable controlling the EOS near the crust--core transition, can already reconstruct Skyrme EOSs with high fidelity, achieving mean absolute percentage errors of approximately $(0.15\\%)$ for $(M_{\\max})$ and $(R_{1.4})$ derived from the decoder-reconstructed EOS."

This formulation reduces the number of parameters to optimize and enables the use of scalable algorithms such as L-BFGS and stochastic gradient descent. Furthermore, our method automatically determines the optimal posterior based on the prior and likelihood, distinguishing it from existing VI methods that often assume a Gaussian variational. Our approach represents a unified framework applicable to a wide range of exponential family distributions, removing the need to develop unique VI methods for each combination of likelihood and prior distributions. We apply the framework to solve sparse logistic regression and demonstrate the superior predictive performance of our method in extensive numerical studies, by comparing it to prevalent sparse logistic regression approaches."

Motivated by this gap, we introduce a cellular sheaf theoretic framework for modeling and analyzing the local consistency and harmonicity of node features and edge weights in graph-based architectures. By tracking local feature alignments and agreements through sheaf structures, the framework offers a topological perspective on feature diffusion and aggregation. Furthermore, a multiscale extension inspired by topological data analysis (TDA) is proposed to capture hierarchical feature interactions in graph models. This approach enables a joint characterization of GDL and TDL architectures based on their underlying geometric and topological structures and the learned signals defined on them, providing insights for future studies on conventional tasks such as node classification, substructure detection, and community detection."

    "abstract": "Decentralized large language model inference networks require lightweight mechanisms to reward high quality outputs under heterogeneous latency and cost. Proof of Quality provides scalable verification by sampling evaluator nodes that score candidate outputs, then aggregating their scores into a consensus signal that determines rewards. However, evaluator heterogeneity and malicious score manipulation can distort consensus and inflate payouts, which weakens incentive alignment in open participation settings. This paper extends a cost-aware Proof of Quality mechanism by adding adversary-resilient consensus formation. We study robust aggregation rules, including median and trimmed mean, and an adaptive trust-weighted consensus that updates evaluator weights from deviation signals. Using question answering and summarization workloads with a ground truth proxy for offline analysis, we quantify evaluator reliability and show strong variance across evaluators, including task-dependent misalignment that can invert correlations. We then evaluate robustness under four adversarial strategies, including noise injection, boosting, sabotage, and intermittent manipulation, across a sweep of malicious ratios and evaluator sample sizes. Our results show that robust aggregation improves consensus alignment with the ground truth proxy and reduces sensitivity to noisy and strategic attacks compared with simple averaging. We further characterize the operational trade-off introduced by evaluator sampling, where larger evaluator sets reduce evaluator rewards and increase payoff variance while inference rewards remain relatively stable in our configuration. These findings motivate robust consensus as a default component for cost-aware Proof of Quality and provide practical guidance for selecting evaluator sampling parameters under adversarial risk and resource constraints."

    "abstract": "Robotic blimps, as lighter-than-air (LTA) aerial systems, offer long endurance and inherently safe operation but remain highly susceptible to wind disturbances. Building on recent advances in moving mass actuation, this paper addresses the lack of disturbance-aware control frameworks for LTA platforms by explicitly modeling and compensating for wind-induced effects. A moving horizon estimator (MHE) infers real-time wind perturbations and provides these estimates to a model predictive controller (MPC), enabling robust trajectory and heading regulation under varying wind conditions. The proposed approach leverages a two-degree-of-freedom (2-DoF) moving-mass mechanism to generate both inertial and aerodynamic moments for attitude and heading control, thereby enhancing flight stability in disturbance-prone environments. Extensive flight experiments under headwind and crosswind conditions show that the integrated MHE-MPC framework significantly outperforms baseline PID control, demonstrating its effectiveness for disturbance-aware LTA flight."

    "abstract": "Efficiently enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by merging them with Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) has emerged as a promising direction. However, existing methods typically operate at a coarse-grained layer level, which often leads to a trade-off between injecting reasoning capabilities and preserving visual capabilities. To address this limitation, we propose {FRISM} (Fine-grained Reasoning Injection via Subspace-level model Merging), a fine-grained reasoning injection framework based on subspace-level model merging. Observing that reasoning capabilities are encoded in distinct subspaces, FRISM decomposes LRM task vectors via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and adaptively tunes the scaling coefficients of each subspace through learning to realize fine-grained reasoning injection. Furthermore, we introduce a label-free self-distillation learning strategy with a dual-objective optimization using common vision-language perception datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FRISM effectively improves reasoning capabilities without compromising the model's original visual capabilities by consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse visual reasoning benchmarks."

We propose the Comprehensive ISO Network (CISON) which combines dual hemisphere wide-field discovery with rapid high resolution characterization and selective escalation to interceptor missions.

    "abstract": "Understanding the three-dimensional motion of bubbles is essential for interpreting transport and mixing in multiphase flows, especially when bubbles deform under shear or move rapidly through the flow field. In many laboratory setups, only a single high-speed camera is available, which limits measurements to two dimensions. Traditional image-processing tools can identify bubbles only when they appear circular and isolated, but they struggle with irregularly shaped bubbles, shear-induced deformations, strong blurring, and partial overlaps. Multi-camera systems could overcome these issues, but require significant hardware additions and calibration effort. In this work, we introduce a new machine-learning framework that can detect bubbles and estimate their depth using only a single 20 kHz high-speed camera with 3 \\textmu m resolution. The method first uses a large unlabeled dataset and clusters the bubbles with an unsupervised algorithm to reveal their underlying structure. These clusters provide pseudo labels, which are combined with a small set of true in-plane bubble labels to train a semi-supervised model that generalizes across different bubble appearances. These components produce a continuous depth-proxy score that indicates how close each bubble is to the imaging plane, even when bubbles are distorted or irregularly shaped. In parallel, we perform robust bubble identification using instance segmentation, which separates touching, overlapping, and elongated bubbles generated by high-velocity shear. Quantitatively, the in-plane segmentation baseline achieves strong held-out performance with Average Precision (AP) = 0.818, implying stable detection across thresholds, clutter, bubble detection Precision of 0.901, and a False-Positive Rate (FPR) near 6.1\\%, hence low spurious bubbles and cleaner statistics under the tested acquisition conditions."

This stems from a critical \"reasoning horizon gap\": unlike link prediction in GFMs, EA necessitates capturing long-range dependencies across sparse and heterogeneous KG structuresTo address this challenge, we propose a EA foundation model driven by a parallel encoding strategy. We utilize seed EA pairs as local anchors to guide the information flow, initializing and encoding two parallel streams simultaneously. This facilitates anchor-conditioned message passing and significantly shortens the inference trajectory by leveraging local structural proximity instead of global search. Additionally, we incorporate a merged relation graph to model global dependencies and a learnable interaction module for precise matching. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our framework, highlighting its strong generalizability to unseen KGs."

While graph contrastive learning offers a promising unsupervised solution, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: random augmentations break semantic consistency in positive pairs, while naive negative sampling produces trivial, uninformative contrasts. We propose AC2L-GAD, an Active Counterfactual Contrastive Learning framework that addresses both limitations through principled counterfactual reasoning. By combining information-theoretic active selection with counterfactual generation, our approach identifies structurally complex nodes and generates anomaly-preserving positive augmentations alongside normal negative counterparts that provide hard contrasts, while restricting expensive counterfactual generation to a strategically selected subset. This design reduces computational overhead by approximately 65% compared to full-graph counterfactual generation while maintaining detection quality. Experiments on nine benchmark datasets, including real-world financial transaction graphs from GADBench, show that AC2L-GAD achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, with notable gains in datasets where anomalies exhibit complex attribute-structure interactions."

The method learns an optimal feature representation from a one-parameter family of estimators -- powers of the empirical covariance or precision matrix -- offering a principled way to tune in to the underlying structure driving the emergence of critical events. A supervised learning module then classifies the learned representation. We prove structural consistency of the family and demonstrate the empirical soundness of our approach on seizure detection and churn prediction, attaining competitive results in both. Beyond prediction, and toward explainability, we ascertain that the optimal covariance power exhibits evidence of good identifiability while capturing structural signatures, thus reconciling predictive performance with interpretable statistical structure."

Notably, the leading term of our regret bound is free of the constant $κ= \\mathcal O(\\exp(S))$, where $S$ is a bound on the magnitude of the unknown parameter vector.

This yields the first simple regret guarantee for randomized algorithms in stochastic contextual linear bandits, with regret $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/2}/\\sqrt{T})$. Extending this method to the logistic case, we obtain a similarly structured Thompson Sampling algorithm that achieves the same regret bound -- $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/2}/\\sqrt{T})$ -- again with no dependence on $κ$ in the leading term. The randomized algorithms, as expected, are cheaper to run than their deterministic counterparts. Finally, we conducted a series of experiments to empirically validate these theoretical guarantees."

Ideally, exploration needed to answer the original question will reveal new structures, patterns, and insights that are valuable in their own right. This contrasts with the exam-style paradigm in which the machine learning community typically applies AI to math. To maximize progress in mathematics using AI, we will need to go beyond simple question answering. With this in mind, we explore the extent to which narrow models trained to solve a fixed mathematical task learn broader mathematical structure that can be extracted by a researcher or other AI system. As a basic test case for this, we use the task of training a neural network to predict a group operation (for example, performing modular arithmetic or composition of permutations). We describe a suite of tests designed to assess whether the model captures significant group-theoretic notions such as the identity element, commutativity, or subgroups. Through extensive experimentation we find evidence that models learn representations capable of capturing abstract algebraic properties. For example, we find hints that models capture the commutativity of modular arithmetic. We are also able to train linear classifiers that reliably distinguish between elements of certain subgroups (even though no labels for these subgroups are included in the data). On the other hand, we are unable to extract notions such as the concept of the identity element. Together, our results suggest that in some cases the representations of even small neural networks can be used to distill interesting abstract structure from new mathematical objects."

Each functional region is represented by a specialized expert that learns localized neural dynamics, while a transformer-based global expert captures cross-regional dependencies. A learnable routing gate adaptively aggregates these heterogeneous experts, enabling context-dependent expert coordination and selective fusion. To promote coherent representation across the hierarchy, we introduce cross-regional distillation, where the global expert provides top-down regularization to the regional experts. We further release SilentSpeech-EEG (SS-EEG), a large-scale benchmark comprising over 120 hours of EEG recordings from 12 subjects performing 24 silent words, the largest dataset of its kind. Experiments demonstrate that BrainStack consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving superior accuracy and generalization across subjects.

    "abstract": "We study decentralized multi-agent coordination where agents must correlate actions against an unobserved field and cannot communicate. To isolate correlation geometry from payoff optimization, we introduce the Hidden-Field Coordination (HFC) model, which enforces identical information access and no-signaling constraints across strategies. Using information-theoretic diagnostics, we compare classical shared-randomness baselines with an entanglement-mediated strategy based on multipartite W states and a strictly local Spontaneous Leader Election rule. Within the restricted symmetric shared-latent baseline studied here, increasing total correlation is achieved primarily by driving actions toward alignment (copying), which also increases pairwise coincidence (collisions). By contrast, the quantum strategy realizes a collision-suppressing coordination regime: it preserves global dependence while reducing pairwise coincidence below the independent (product) baseline induced by the common marginal distribution. This produces a geometric separation in the joint-action distribution. Classical baselines concentrate probability near the diagonal of action equality, whereas the entanglement-mediated mapping occupies an offset-diagonal region associated with relational roles. Accordingly, the entanglement signature in this setting is not higher correlation magnitude; total-correlation differentials can be negative relative to the classical copying optimum. Instead, it reflects a change in dependence geometry that supports robust anti-coordination."

Data collection is the first step toward developing WheelArm models. In this paper, we present WheelArm-Sim, a simulation framework developed in Isaac Sim for synthetic data collection. We evaluate its capability by collecting a manipulation and navigation combined multimodal dataset, comprising 13 tasks, 232 trajectories, and 67,783 samples.

In this work, we investigate the use of Large Language Models to automatically generate paraphrased variants of written-language translations as synthetic alternative references for SLT. First, we compare multiple paraphrasing strategies and models using an adapted ParaScore metric. Second, we study the impact of paraphrases on both training and evaluation of the pose-based T5 model on the YouTubeASL and How2Sign datasets. Our results show that naively incorporating paraphrases during training does not improve translation performance and can even be detrimental. In contrast, using paraphrases during evaluation leads to higher automatic scores and better alignment with human judgments. To formalize this observation, we introduce BLEUpara, an extension of BLEU that evaluates translations against multiple paraphrased references. Human evaluation confirms that BLEUpara correlates more strongly with perceived translation quality. We release all generated paraphrases, generation and evaluation code to support reproducible and more reliable evaluation of SLT systems."

State-of-the-art research still focuses on efficiently executing enormous numbers of multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations. However, CPUs themselves are not good at executing such mathematical operations on a large scale, since they are more suited to execute control flow logic, i.e., computer algorithms. To enhance the computation efficiency of neural networks on CPUs, in this paper, we propose to convert them into logic flows for execution. Specifically, neural networks are first converted into equivalent decision trees, from which decision paths with constant leaves are then selected and compressed into logic flows. Such logic flows consist of if and else structures and a reduced number of MAC operations. Experimental results demonstrate that the latency can be reduced by up to 14.9 % on a simulated RISC-V CPU without any accuracy degradation.

In this work, we introduce a single-model approach that adapts a foundational audio-video diffusion model for video-to-video dubbing via a lightweight LoRA. The LoRA enables the model to condition on an input audio-video while jointly generating translated audio and synchronized facial motion. To train this LoRA, we leverage the generative model itself to synthesize paired multilingual videos of the same speaker. Specifically, we generate multilingual videos with language switches within a single clip, and then inpaint the face and audio in each half to match the language of the other half. By leveraging the rich generative prior of the audio-visual model, our approach preserves speaker identity and lip synchronization while remaining robust to complex motion and real-world dynamics. We demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality dubbed videos with improved visual fidelity, lip synchronization, and robustness compared to existing dubbing pipelines."

Identifying such lensed pairs, however, remains challenging due to the computational cost and/or the reliance on prior knowledge of source parameters in existing methods. This study investigates a novel approach, Optimal Cross-Correlation Analysis for Multiplets (OCCAM), applied to strain data from one or more detectors for Compact Binary Coalescence (CBC) events identified by GW searches, using an optimal, mildly model-dependent, low computation cost approach to identify strongly lensed candidates. This technique efficiently narrows the search space, allowing for more sensitive, but (much) higher latency, algorithms to refine the results further. We demonstrate that our method performs significantly better than other computationally inexpensive methods. In particular, we achieve 97 percent (80 percent) lensed event detection at a pairwise false positive probability of approximately 13 percent (7 percent) for a single detector with LIGO design sensitivity, assuming an SNR greater than or equal to 10 astrophysically motivated lensed and unlensed populations. Thus, this method, using a network of detectors and in conjunction with sky-localisation information, can enormously reduce the false positive probability, making it highly viable to efficiently and quickly search for lensing pairs among thousands of events, including the sub-threshold candidates."

Bayesian optimization, as a promising technique for black-box optimization, has been extended to meta-learning and multi-objective optimization independently, but methods that simultaneously address both settings - meta-learned priors for multi-objective Bayesian optimization - remain largely unexplored. We propose SMOG, a scalable and modular meta-learning model based on a multi-output Gaussian process that explicitly learns correlations between objectives. SMOG builds a structured joint Gaussian process prior across meta- and target tasks and, after conditioning on metadata, yields a closed-form target-task prior augmented by a flexible residual multi-output kernel. This construction propagates metadata uncertainty into the target surrogate in a principled way. SMOG supports hierarchical, parallel training: meta-task Gaussian processes are fit once and then cached, achieving linear scaling with the number of meta-tasks. The resulting surrogate integrates seamlessly with standard multi-objective Bayesian optimization acquisition functions."

To enable their use in clinical settings, LLMs are typically further adapted through continued pretraining or post-training using clinical data. However, most medical LLMs are trained on data from a single institution, which faces limitations in generalizability and safety in heterogeneous systems. Federated learning (FL) is a promising solution for enabling collaborative model development across healthcare institutions. Yet applying FL to LLMs in medicine remains fundamentally limited. First, conventional FL requires transmitting the full model during each communication round, which becomes impractical for multi-billion-parameter LLMs given the limited computational resources. Second, many FL algorithms implicitly assume data homogeneity, whereas real-world clinical data are highly heterogeneous across patients, diseases, and institutional practices. We introduce the model-agnostic and parameter-efficient federated learning framework for adapting LLMs to medical applications. Fed-MedLoRA transmits only low-rank adapter parameters, reducing communication and computation overhead, while Fed-MedLoRA+ further incorporates adaptive, data-aware aggregation to improve convergence under cross-site heterogeneity. We apply the framework to clinical information extraction (IE), which transforms patient narratives into structured medical entities and relations. Accuracy was assessed across five patient cohorts through comparisons with BERT models, and LLaMA-3 and DeepSeek-R1, GPT-4o models. Evaluation settings included (1) in-domain training and testing, (2) external validation on independent cohorts, and (3) a low-resource new-site adaptation scenario using real-world clinical notes from the Yale New Haven Health System."

    "abstract": "We introduce Prior-Informed Flow Matching (PIFM), a conditional flow model for graph reconstruction. Reconstructing graphs from partial observations remains a key challenge; classical embedding methods often lack global consistency, while modern generative models struggle to incorporate structural priors. PIFM bridges this gap by integrating embedding-based priors with continuous-time flow matching. Grounded in a permutation equivariant version of the distortion-perception theory, our method first uses a prior, such as graphons or GraphSAGE/node2vec, to form an informed initial estimate of the adjacency matrix based on local information. It then applies rectified flow matching to refine this estimate, transporting it toward the true distribution of clean graphs and learning a global coupling. Experiments on different datasets demonstrate that PIFM consistently enhances classical embeddings, outperforming them and state-of-the-art generative baselines in reconstruction accuracy."

We find dominant corrections to the Schwarzschild metric in all orders in the derivative expansion far away from the horizon. These corrections can be summed up in a closed form through EFT coefficients up to all orders in derivatives and to the second order in curvature. It occurs that such a summation is convergent only for localizable theories, making a direct connection between the graviton scattering amplitudes properties and the applicability of a perturbative treatment of an EFT of gravity. We further apply our results to logarithmic form-factors which appear in the 1-loop effective action for GR in four dimensions. We find out that the corresponding corrections to the Schwarzschild metric are stronger than those from the tree-level EFT operators. The developed framework can be extended to account for the corrections to the other BH solutions in GR, such as the Kerr metric."

    "abstract": "Accurate and timely population data are essential for disaster response and humanitarian planning, but traditional censuses often cannot capture rapid demographic changes. Social media data offer a promising alternative for dynamic population monitoring, but their representativeness remains poorly understood and stringent privacy requirements limit their reliability. Here, we address these limitations in the context of the Philippines by calibrating Facebook user counts with the country's 2020 census figures. First, we find that differential privacy techniques commonly applied to social media-based population datasets disproportionately mask low-population areas. To address this, we propose a Bayesian imputation approach to recover missing values, restoring data coverage for $5.5\\%$ of rural areas. Further, using the imputed social media data and leveraging predictors such as urbanisation level, demographic composition, and socio-economic status, we develop a statistical model for the proportion of Facebook users in each municipality, which links observed Facebook user numbers to the true population levels. Out-of-sample validation demonstrates strong result generalisability, with errors as low as ${\\approx}18\\%$ and ${\\approx}24\\%$ for urban and rural Facebook user proportions, respectively. We further demonstrate that accounting for overdispersion and spatial correlations in the data is crucial to obtain accurate estimates and appropriate credible intervals. Crucially, as predictors change over time, the models can be used to regularly update the population predictions, providing a dynamic complement to census-based estimates. These results have direct implications for humanitarian response in disaster-prone regions and offer a general framework for using biased social media signals to generate reliable and timely population data."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates information freshness in a remote estimation system in which the remote information source is a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). For such systems, estimators have been mainly restricted to the class of martingale estimators in which the remote estimate at any time is equal to the value of the most recently received update. This is mainly due to the simplicity and ease of analysis of martingale estimators, which however are far from optimal, especially in query-based (i.e., pull-based) update systems. In such systems, maximum a-posteriori probability (MAP) estimators are optimal. However, MAP estimators can be challenging to analyze in continuous-time settings. In this paper, we introduce a new class of estimators, called structured estimators, which can seamlessly shift from a martingale estimator to a MAP estimator, enabling them to retain useful characteristics of the MAP estimate, while still being analytically tractable. Particularly, we introduce a new estimator termed as the $p$-MAP estimator which is a piecewise-constant approximation of the MAP estimator with finitely many discontinuities, bringing us closer to a full characterization of MAP estimators when modeling information freshness. In fact, we show that for time-reversible CTMCs, the MAP estimator reduces to a $p$-MAP estimator. Using the binary freshness (BF) process for the characterization of information freshness, we derive the freshness expressions and provide optimal state-dependent sampling policies (i.e., querying policies) for maximizing the mean BF (MBF) for pull-based remote estimation of a single CTMC information source, when structured estimators are used. Moreover, we provide optimal query rate allocation policies when a monitor pulls information from multiple heterogeneous CTMCs with a constraint on the overall query rate."

The analysis demonstrates that the EUE is a piecewise linear function and the storage MRI retains a non-negative property across various system scenarios. We further explore the influence of qualified capacity (QC), storage dispatch rules, and other key factors on storage accreditation, providing practical insights for system operators. Additionally, comparisons of storage capacity accreditation under different reliability criteria offer valuable guidance for policymakers in setting future standards. Numerical results from a modified California system validate our findings and highlight several important phenomena associated with the MRI-based accreditation scheme."

We propose a healthy-to-stroke adaptation pipeline that initializes an intent detector from a model pretrained on large-scale able-bodied sEMG, then fine-tunes it for each stroke participant using only a small amount of subject-specific data. Using a newly collected dataset from three individuals with chronic stroke, we compare adaptation strategies (head-only tuning, parameter-efficient LoRA adapters, and full end-to-end fine-tuning) and evaluate on held-out test sets that include realistic distribution shifts such as within-session drift, posture changes, and armband repositioning. Across conditions, healthy-pretrained adaptation consistently improves stroke intent detection relative to both zero-shot transfer and stroke-only training under the same data budget; the best adaptation methods improve average transition accuracy from 0.42 to 0.61 and raw accuracy from 0.69 to 0.78. These results suggest that transferring a reusable healthy-domain EMG representation can reduce calibration burden while improving robustness for real-time post-stroke intent detection."

To design systems that move beyond one-off accommodations to effective mixed-ability collaboration, we need a deeper understanding of the representations, their transformations and how they occur. We conducted a week-long diary study with follow-up interviews with 23 BLV and sighted professionals from five legal, non-profit, and consulting teams, documenting 36 transformation cases. Our analysis characterizes how teams perform representational transformations for accessibility: how they are triggered proactively or reactively, how they simplify or enhance, and four common patterns in which workers coordinate with each other to address representational incompatibility. Our findings uncover opportunities for designing systems that can better support mixed-visual ability work."

In this paper, we propose VTC-R1, a new efficient reasoning paradigm that integrates vision-text compression into the reasoning process. Instead of processing lengthy textual traces, VTC-R1 renders intermediate reasoning segments into compact images, which are iteratively fed back into vision-language models as \"optical memory.\" We construct a training dataset based on OpenR1-Math-220K achieving 3.4x token compression and fine-tune representative VLMs-Glyph and Qwen3-VL. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as MATH500, AIME25, AMC23 and GPQA-D demonstrate that VTC-R1 consistently outperforms standard long-context reasoning. Furthermore, our approach significantly improves inference efficiency, achieving 2.7x speedup in end-to-end latency, highlighting its potential as a scalable solution for reasoning-intensive applications.

In this paper we show that this is actually the case, improving the state of the art that only offers non-canonical chain complexes. Technically, we achieve this result considering the Čech homology spectral sequence of the unstable manifolds filtration. In particular, we turn bounded exact couples into chain complexes such that the limit page of the spectral sequence associated with an exact couple gives the homology of the chain complex.

Central to our approach is the Sparse Metric Prompt, created by randomly masking depth maps, which serves as a universal interface that decouples spatial reasoning from sensor and camera biases. Using about 20M image-depth pairs spanning reconstructed, captured, and rendered 3D data across 10000 camera models, we demonstrate-for the first time-a clear scaling trend in the metric depth track. The pretrained model excels at prompt-driven tasks such as depth completion, super-resolution and Radar-camera fusion, while its distilled prompt-free student achieves state-of-the-art results on monocular depth estimation, camera intrinsics recovery, single/multi-view metric 3D reconstruction, and VLA planning. We also show that using pretrained ViT of Metric Anything as a visual encoder significantly boosts Multimodal Large Language Model capabilities in spatial intelligence. These results show that metric depth estimation can benefit from the same scaling laws that drive modern foundation models, establishing a new path toward scalable and efficient real-world metric perception.

Here we investigate interaction quenches in the half-filled Hubbard model using a real-space time-dependent Gutzwiller framework. We show that homogeneous nonequilibrium dynamics is generically unstable: even arbitrarily weak spatial fluctuations grow dynamically and drive the system toward intrinsically inhomogeneous states. Depending on the interaction strength, the post-quench evolution exhibits spatial differentiation, nucleation, and slow coarsening of Mott-like domains. Our results establish spatial self-organization as a generic feature of far-from-equilibrium correlated matter and reveal a fundamental limitation of spatially homogeneous nonequilibrium theories."

However, existing NSR methods often suffer from geometric ambiguity and instability, particularly under sparse-view conditions. This issue is critical in large-scale urban remote sensing, where aerial image acquisition is limited by flight paths, terrain, and cost. To address this challenge, we present the first urban NSR framework that fuses 3D synthetic aperture radar (SAR) point clouds with aerial imagery for high-fidelity reconstruction under constrained, sparse-view settings. 3D SAR can efficiently capture large-scale geometry even from a single side-looking flight path, providing robust priors that complement photometric cues from images. Our framework integrates radar-derived spatial constraints into an SDF-based NSR backbone, guiding structure-aware ray selection and adaptive sampling for stable and efficient optimization. We also construct the first benchmark dataset with co-registered 3D SAR point clouds and aerial imagery, facilitating systematic evaluation of cross-modal 3D reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that incorporating 3D SAR markedly enhances reconstruction accuracy, completeness, and robustness compared with single-modality baselines under highly sparse and oblique-view conditions, highlighting a viable route toward scalable high-fidelity urban reconstruction with advanced airborne and spaceborne optical-SAR sensing."

In this work, we challenge this assumption by investigating what can be achieved when action anticipation is constrained to a single visual observation. We ask a fundamental question: how much information about the future is already encoded in a single frame, and how can it be effectively exploited? Building on our prior work on Action Anticipation at a Glimpse (AAG), we conduct a systematic investigation of single-frame action anticipation enriched with complementary sources of information. We analyze the contribution of RGB appearance, depth-based geometric cues, and semantic representations of past actions, and investigate how different multimodal fusion strategies, keyframe selection policies and past-action history sources influence anticipation performance. Guided by these findings, we consolidate the most effective design choices into AAG+, a refined single-frame anticipation framework. Despite operating on a single frame, AAG+ consistently improves upon the original AAG and achieves performance comparable to, or exceeding, that of state-of-the-art video-based methods on challenging anticipation benchmarks including IKEA-ASM, Meccano and Assembly101. Our results offer new insights into the limits and potential of single-frame action anticipation, and clarify when dense temporal modeling is necessary and when a carefully selected glimpse is sufficient."

Our 5--28 micron spectra exhibit fluorescence features from several gaseous species, including the $ν_2$ band of water at 5.8--7.0 microns. the primary $ν_2$ and associated hot bands of carbon dioxide around 15 microns, and a forbidden transition of atomic nickel at 7.507 microns. We also report the first direct detection of methane in an interstellar object. The delayed onset of methane production relative to water suggests past depletion from the outermost layers, with the observed methane emerging from unprocessed subsurface material. Comparison of the volatile production rates measured during the two epochs indicate a significant reduction in overall outgassing over 12 days, with the measured water activity level dropping more steeply than other species. As shown through near-nucleus coma mapping, 3I continues to display an extended source of water production from icy grains entrained within the coma.

    "abstract": "End-to-end autonomous driving increasingly leverages self-supervised video pretraining to learn transferable planning representations. However, pretraining video world models for scene understanding has so far brought only limited improvements. This limitation is compounded by the inherent ambiguity of driving: each scene typically provides only a single human trajectory, making it difficult to learn multimodal behaviors. In this work, we propose Drive-JEPA, a framework that integrates Video Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA) with multimodal trajectory distillation for end-to-end driving. First, we adapt V-JEPA for end-to-end driving, pretraining a ViT encoder on large-scale driving videos to produce predictive representations aligned with trajectory planning. Second, we introduce a proposal-centric planner that distills diverse simulator-generated trajectories alongside human trajectories, with a momentum-aware selection mechanism to promote stable and safe behavior. When evaluated on NAVSIM, the V-JEPA representation combined with a simple transformer-based decoder outperforms prior methods by 3 PDMS in the perception-free setting. The complete Drive-JEPA framework achieves 93.3 PDMS on v1 and 87.8 EPDMS on v2, setting a new state-of-the-art."

CARD reformulates the diffusion process within a strictly causal attention mask, enabling dense, per-token supervision in a single forward pass. To address the optimization instability of causal diffusion, we introduce a soft-tailed masking schema to preserve local context and a context-aware reweighting mechanism derived from signal-to-noise principles. This design enables dynamic parallel decoding, where the model leverages KV-caching to adaptively generate variable-length token sequences based on confidence. Empirically, CARD outperforms existing discrete diffusion baselines while reducing training latency by 3 $\\times$ compared to block diffusion methods. Our results demonstrate that CARD achieves ARM-level data efficiency while unlocking the latency benefits of parallel generation, establishing a robust paradigm for next-generation efficient LLMs."

Generative video offers a new way to address these limitations by augmenting captured media with tailored visuals. To explore this potential, we interviewed eight video creators to identify opportunities and challenges in integrating generative video into their workflows. Building on these insights and established filmmaking principles, we developed Vidmento, a tool for authoring hybrid video stories that combine captured and generated media through context-aware expansion. Vidmento surfaces opportunities for story development, generates clips that blend stylistically and narratively with surrounding media, and provides controls for refinement. In a study with 12 creators, Vidmento supported narrative development and exploration by systematically expanding initial materials with generative media, enabling expressive video storytelling aligned with creative intent. We highlight how creators bridge story gaps with generative content and where they find this blending capability most valuable."

    "abstract": "Quantum machine learning (QML) is often listed as a promising candidate for useful applications of quantum computers, in part due to numerous proofs of possible quantum advantages. A central question is how small a role quantum computers can play while still enabling provable learning advantages over classical methods. We study an especially restricted setting in which a quantum computer is used only as a feature extractor: it acts independently on individual data points, without access to labels or global dataset information, is available only to augment the training set, and is not available at deployment. Training and deployment are therefore carried out by fully classical learners on a dataset augmented with quantum-generated features. We formalize this model by adapting the classical framework of Learning Under Privileged Information (LUPI) to the quantum case, which we call Learning Under Quantum Privileged Information (LUQPI). Within this framework, we show that even such minimally involved quantum feature extraction, available only during training, can yield exponential quantum-classical separations for suitable concept classes and data distributions under reasonable computational assumptions. We further situate LUQPI within a taxonomy of related quantum and classical learning settings and show how standard classical machinery, most notably the SVM+ algorithm, can exploit quantum-augmented data. Finally, we present numerical experiments in a physically motivated many-body setting, where privileged quantum features are expectation values of observables on ground states, and observe consistent performance gains for LUQPI-style models over strong classical baselines."

Across agentic workflows (chat, coding, web use, computer use) and base model choices (GQA/MLA, MoE, quantization), OI/CF can shift dramatically, with long context KV cache making decode highly memory bound. These observations motivate disaggregated serving and system level heterogeneity: specialized prefill and decode accelerators, broader scale up networking, and decoupled compute-memory enabled by optical I/O. We further hypothesize agent-hardware co design, multiple inference accelerators within one system, and high bandwidth, large capacity memory disaggregation as foundations for adaptation to evolving OI/CF. Together, these directions chart a path to sustain efficiency and capability for large scale agentic AI inference."

    "abstract": "Generative models for 3D molecular conformations must respect Euclidean symmetries and concentrate probability mass on thermodynamically favorable, mechanically stable structures. However, E(3)-equivariant diffusion models often reproduce biases from semi-empirical training data rather than capturing the equilibrium distribution of a high-fidelity Hamiltonian. While physics-based guidance can correct this, it faces two computational bottlenecks: expensive quantum-chemical evaluations (e.g., DFT) and the need to repeat such queries at every sampling step. We present Elign, a post-training framework that amortizes both costs. First, we replace expensive DFT evaluations with a faster, pretrained foundational machine-learning force field (MLFF) to provide physical signals. Second, we eliminate repeated run-time queries by shifting physical steering to the training phase. To achieve the second amortization, we formulate reverse diffusion as a reinforcement learning problem and introduce Force--Energy Disentangled Group Relative Policy Optimization (FED-GRPO) to fine-tune the denoising policy. FED-GRPO includes a potential-based energy reward and a force-based stability reward, which are optimized and group-normalized independently. Experiments show that Elign generates conformations with lower gold-standard DFT energies and forces, while improving stability. Crucially, inference remains as fast as unguided sampling, since no energy evaluations are required during generation."

    "abstract": "Imitation learning has achieved remarkable success in robotic manipulation, yet its application to surgical robotics remains challenging due to data scarcity, constrained workspaces, and the need for an exceptional level of safety and predictability. We present a supervised Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture designed for phase-structured surgical manipulation tasks, which can be added on top of any autonomous policy. Unlike prior surgical robot learning approaches that rely on multi-camera setups or thousands of demonstrations, we show that a lightweight action decoder policy like Action Chunking Transformer (ACT) can learn complex, long-horizon manipulation from less than 150 demonstrations using solely stereo endoscopic images, when equipped with our architecture. We evaluate our approach on the collaborative surgical task of bowel grasping and retraction, where a robot assistant interprets visual cues from a human surgeon, executes targeted grasping on deformable tissue, and performs sustained retraction. We benchmark our method against state-of-the-art Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models and the standard ACT baseline. Our results show that generalist VLAs fail to acquire the task entirely, even under standard in-distribution conditions. Furthermore, while standard ACT achieves moderate success in-distribution, adopting a supervised MoE architecture significantly boosts its performance, yielding higher success rates in-distribution and demonstrating superior robustness in out-of-distribution scenarios, including novel grasp locations, reduced illumination, and partial occlusions. Notably, it generalizes to unseen testing viewpoints and also transfers zero-shot to ex vivo porcine tissue without additional training, offering a promising pathway toward in vivo deployment. To support this, we present qualitative preliminary results of policy roll-outs during in vivo porcine surgery."

    "abstract": "Web agents have demonstrated strong performance on a wide range of web-based tasks. However, existing research on the effect of environmental variation has mostly focused on robustness to adversarial attacks, with less attention to agents' preferences in benign scenarios. Although early studies have examined how textual attributes influence agent behavior, a systematic understanding of how visual attributes shape agent decision-making remains limited. To address this, we introduce VAF, a controlled evaluation pipeline for quantifying how webpage Visual Attribute Factors influence web-agent decision-making. Specifically, VAF consists of three stages: (i) variant generation, which ensures the variants share identical semantics as the original item while only differ in visual attributes; (ii) browsing interaction, where agents navigate the page via scrolling and clicking the interested item, mirroring how human users browse online; (iii) validating through both click action and reasoning from agents, which we use the Target Click Rate and Target Mention Rate to jointly evaluate the effect of visual attributes. By quantitatively measuring the decision-making difference between the original and variant, we identify which visual attributes influence agents' behavior most. Extensive experiments, across 8 variant families (48 variants total), 5 real-world websites (including shopping, travel, and news browsing), and 4 representative web agents, show that background color contrast, item size, position, and card clarity have a strong influence on agents' actions, whereas font styling, text color, and item image clarity exhibit minor effects."

Using this estimator, we construct private test statistics that achieve the same asymptotic relative efficiency as the non-private, most powerful tests while maintaining conservative type I error control. In addition to our theoretical results, our numerical experiments show that our private tests outperform competing DP methods and offer comparable power to the non-private most powerful tests, even at moderately small sample sizes and privacy loss budgets."

Existing approaches assume equal contribution of modality and random missing patterns, neglecting inherent uncertainty in medical data acquisition. In this regard, we propose the Aleatoric Uncertainty Modeling (AUM) that explicitly quantifies unimodal aleatoric uncertainty to address missing modalities. Specifically, AUM models each unimodal representation as a multivariate Gaussian distribution to capture aleatoric uncertainty and enable principled modality reliability quantification. To adaptively aggregate captured information, we develop a dynamic message-passing mechanism within a bipartite patient-modality graph using uncertainty-aware aggregation mechanism. Through this process, missing modalities are naturally accommodated, while more reliable information from available modalities is dynamically emphasized to guide representation generation. Our AUM framework achieves an improvement of 2.26% AUC-ROC on MIMIC-IV mortality prediction and 2.17% gain on eICU, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches."

In this work, we investigate the performance of the widespread physics-based training method of equilibrium propagation for more realistic architectural choices, specifically, locally connected lattices. We train an XY model and explore the influence of architecture on various benchmark tasks, tracking the evolution of spatially distributed responses and couplings during training.

    "abstract": "We study online transfer reinforcement learning (RL) in episodic Markov decision processes, where experience from related source tasks is available during learning on a target task. A fundamental difficulty is that task similarity is typically defined in terms of rewards or transitions, whereas online RL algorithms operate on Bellman regression targets. As a result, naively reusing source Bellman updates introduces systematic bias and invalidates regret guarantees. We identify one-step Bellman alignment as the correct abstraction for transfer in online RL and propose re-weighted targeting (RWT), an operator-level correction that retargets continuation values and compensates for transition mismatch via a change of measure. RWT reduces task mismatch to a fixed one-step correction and enables statistically sound reuse of source data. This alignment yields a two-stage RWT $Q$-learning framework that separates variance reduction from bias correction. Under RKHS function approximation, we establish regret bounds that scale with the complexity of the task shift rather than the target MDP. Empirical results in both tabular and neural network settings demonstrate consistent improvements over single-task learning and naïve pooling, highlighting Bellman alignment as a model-agnostic transfer principle for online RL."

However, when SST measurements are sparse, the resulting inferred SST fields are rather inaccurate. Here, we demonstrate the ability of Sparse Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (S-DEIM) to reconstruct the high-resolution SST field from sparse in situ observations, without using a model. The S-DEIM estimate consists of two terms, one computed from instantaneous in situ observations using empirical interpolation, and the other learned from the historical time series of observations using recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We train the RNNs using the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's weekly high-resolution SST dataset spanning the years 1989-2021 which constitutes the training data. Subsequently, we examine the performance of S-DEIM on the test data, comprising January 2022 to January 2023. For this test data, S-DEIM infers the high-resolution SST from 100 in situ observations, constituting only 0.2% of the high-resolution spatial grid. We show that the resulting S-DEIM reconstructions are about 40% more accurate than earlier empirical interpolation methods, such as DEIM and Q-DEIM. Furthermore, 91% of S-DEIM estimates fall within $\\pm 1^\\circ$C of the true SST. We also demonstrate that S-DEIM is robust with respect to sensor placement: even when the sensors are distributed randomly, S-DEIM reconstruction error deteriorates only by 1-2%. S-DEIM is also computationally efficient. Training the RNN, which is performed only once offline, takes approximately one minute. Once trained, the S-DEIM reconstructions are computed in less than a second. As such, S-DEIM can be used for rapid SST reconstruction from sparse streaming observational data in real time."

    "abstract": "Current LLM post-training methods optimize complete reasoning trajectories through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by outcome-based Reinforcement Learning (RL). While effective, a closer examination reveals a fundamental gap: this approach does not align with how humans actually solve problems. Human cognition naturally decomposes problem-solving into two distinct stages: first acquiring abstract strategies (i.e., meta-knowledge) that generalize across problems, then adapting them to specific instances. In contrast, by treating complete trajectories as basic units, current methods are inherently problem-centric, entangling abstract strategies with problem-specific execution. To address this misalignment, we propose a cognitively-inspired framework that explicitly mirrors the two-stage human cognitive process. Specifically, Chain-of-Meta-Thought (CoMT) focuses supervised learning on abstract reasoning patterns without specific executions, enabling acquisition of generalizable strategies. Confidence-Calibrated Reinforcement Learning (CCRL) then optimizes task adaptation via confidence-aware rewards on intermediate steps, preventing overconfident errors from cascading and improving execution reliability. Experiments across four models and eight benchmarks show 2.19\\% and 4.63\\% improvements in-distribution and out-of-distribution respectively over standard methods, while reducing training time by 65-70% and token consumption by 50%, demonstrating that aligning post-training with human cognitive principles yields not only superior generalization but also enhanced training efficiency."

While reducing streaming bitrates improves energy efficiency, its success hinges on user acceptance--particularly when lower bitrates may be perceived as reduced quality of experience (QoE). Therefore, there is a need to develop transparent, user-centric incentive models that balance sustainability with perceived value. We propose a user-acceptance model that combines diverse environmental awareness, personalized responsiveness to incentives, and varying levels of altruism into a unified probabilistic framework. The model incorporates dynamic, individualized incentives that adapt over time. We further enhance the framework by incorporating (i) social well-being as a motivator for altruistic choices, (ii) provider-driven education strategies that gradually adjust user acceptance thresholds, and (iii) data-driven learning of user traits from historical offer--response interactions. Extensive synthetic-data experiments reveal the trade-offs between provider cost and network flexibility, showing that personalized incentives and gradual behavioral adaptation can advance sustainability targets without compromising stakeholder requirements."

To bridge this gap, we propose \\textbf{TraceRouter}, a path-level framework that traces and disconnects the causal propagation circuits of illicit semantics. TraceRouter operates in three stages: (1) it pinpoints a sensitive onset layer by analyzing attention divergence; (2) it leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and differential activation analysis to disentangle and isolate malicious features; and (3) it maps these features to downstream causal pathways via feature influence scores (FIS) derived from zero-out interventions. By selectively suppressing these causal chains, TraceRouter physically severs the flow of harmful information while leaving orthogonal computation routes intact. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TraceRouter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a superior trade-off between adversarial robustness and general utility.

However, existing approaches generally rely on heuristic KV Cache policies, which ignore differences in token importance in long-term video generation. This leads to the loss of critical spatiotemporal information and the accumulation of redundant, invalid cache, thereby degrading video generation quality and efficiency. To address this limitation, we first observe that token contributions to video generation are highly time-heterogeneous and accordingly propose a novel Past- and Future-Informed KV Cache Policy (PaFu-KV). Specifically, PaFu-KV introduces a lightweight Salience Estimation Head distilled from a bidirectional teacher to estimate salience scores, allowing the KV cache to retain informative tokens while discarding less relevant ones. This policy yields a better quality-efficiency trade-off by shrinking KV cache capacity and reducing memory footprint at inference time. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that our method preserves high-fidelity video generation quality while enables accelerated inference, thereby enabling more efficient long-horizon video generation.

Under weak assumptions, we provide the two structural properties to ensure the propagation of initialization and discretization errors of the backward process: a Lyapunov drift condition and a Doeblin-type minorization condition. A practical consequence is quantitative stability of the sampling procedure, as the reverse diffusion dynamics induces a contraction mechanism along the sampling trajectory. Our results clarify the role of stochastic dynamics in score-based models and provide a principled framework for analyzing propagation of errors in such approaches."

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the critical challenge of coordinating mobile edge UAV networks to maintain robust service in highly dynamic spatiotemporal environments. Conventional Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approaches often suffer from catastrophic forgetting when transitioning between distinct task scenarios, such as moving from dense urban clusters to sparse rural areas. These transitions typically necessitate computationally expensive retraining or model resets to adapt to new user distributions, leading to service interruptions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a computationally efficient Spatiotemporal Continual Learning (STCL) framework realized through a Group-Decoupled Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (G-MAPPO) algorithm. Our approach integrates a novel Group-Decoupled Policy Optimization (GDPO) mechanism that utilizes dynamic $z$-score normalization to autonomously balance heterogeneous objectives, including energy efficiency, user fairness, and coverage. This mechanism effectively mitigates gradient conflicts induced by concept drifts without requiring offline retraining. Furthermore, the framework leverages the 3D mobility of UAVs as a spatial compensation layer, enabling the swarm to autonomously adjust altitudes to accommodate extreme density fluctuations. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed STCL framework achieves superior resilience, characterized by an elastic recovery of service reliability to approximately 0.95 during phase transitions. Compared to the MADDPG baseline, G-MAPPO not only prevents knowledge forgetting but also delivers an effective capacity gain of 20\\% under extreme traffic loads, validating its potential as a scalable solution for edge-enabled aerial swarms."

In this paper, we introduce such an approach, leveraging gamified incentives and a model for user's acceptance on incentives, thus encouraging energy-efficient behaviors such as adaptive bitrate streaming. Each user is characterized by an environmental sensitivity factor and a private incentive threshold, shaping probabilistic responses to energy-saving offers. A serious-game mechanism based on positive behavioral reinforcement and rewards of the users, due to their inclusion in top-K and bottom-M rankings, fosters peer comparison and competition, thus transforming passive acceptance into active engagement. Moreover, within a Stackelberg game formulation, the video streaming service provider--acting as the strategic leader--optimizes both incentive levels and game parameters to achieve network-wide energy and traffic reductions, while adhering to budgetary constraints. This structured approach empowers providers with proactive, application-level control over energy consumption, offering them measurable benefits such as reduced high-bitrate traffic and increased participation in energy-saving behaviors, while also considering user satisfaction. The results of our simulations show that indeed gamification boosts significantly user participation and energy savings provided that the incentive and game parameters are chosen optimally."

Despite its success in improving sample complexity on test tasks, many real-world applications, such as robotics and healthcare, impose safety constraints during testing. Constrained meta RL provides a promising framework for integrating safety into meta RL. An open question in constrained meta RL is how to ensure the safety of the policy on the real-world test task, while reducing the sample complexity and thus, enabling faster learning of optimal policies. To address this gap, we propose an algorithm that refines policies learned during training, with provable safety and sample complexity guarantees for learning a near optimal policy on the test tasks. We further derive a matching lower bound, showing that this sample complexity is tight."

    "abstract": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong zero-shot reasoning capabilities, their deployment as embodied agents still faces fundamental challenges in long-horizon planning. Unlike open-ended text generation, embodied agents must decompose high-level intent into actionable sub-goals while strictly adhering to the logic of a dynamic, observed environment. Standard LLM planners frequently fail to maintain strategy coherence over extended horizons due to context window limitation or hallucinate transitions that violate constraints. We propose GiG, a novel planning framework that structures embodied agents' memory using a Graph-in-Graph architecture. Our approach employs a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to encode environmental states into embeddings, organizing these embeddings into action-connected execution trace graphs within an experience memory bank. By clustering these graph embeddings, the framework enables retrieval of structure-aware priors, allowing agents to ground current decisions in relevant past structural patterns. Furthermore, we introduce a novel bounded lookahead module that leverages symbolic transition logic to enhance the agents' planning capabilities through the grounded action projection. We evaluate our framework on three embodied planning benchmarks-Robotouille Synchronous, Robotouille Asynchronous, and ALFWorld. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving Pass@1 performance gains of up to 22% on Robotouille Synchronous, 37% on Asynchronous, and 15% on ALFWorld with comparable or lower computational cost."

The unexpectedly high number density of these systems has triggered intense debate about potential differences in the physical properties of galaxies at such extreme redshifts and those at lower redshift. However, progress has been limited by the lack of rest-frame optical diagnostics, which are critical for constraining the key properties. Here we present deep JWST/MIRI observations of a UV-luminous galaxy at $z=11.04$, CEERS2-588, only 400 Myr after the Big Bang. CEERS2-588 is detected in the MIRI F560W and F770W bands, while deep MIRI/MRS spectroscopy yields no detection of H$α$ or [OIII]$\\lambda5007$ line, revealing a prominent Balmer break detected for the first time at $z>10$. Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting indicates an extended star formation history possibly reaching $z>15$, followed by rapid quenching within the recent $\\sim10$ Myr, in stark contrast to other $z>10$ galaxies. The MIRI detections also significantly improve our stellar mass estimate to $\\mathrm{log}(M_*/M_\\odot)=9.1^{+0.1}_{-0.1}$, making CEERS2-588 the most massive galaxy securely confirmed at $z>10$. Remarkably, the inferred gas-phase metallicity is near solar, exceeding predictions from current theoretical models. These results suggest that efficient starbursts play a key role in producing the abundant luminous galaxy population in the early universe."

With the advent of Foundation Models (FMs), the field of AI-assisted ECG interpretation has begun to evolve, as they enable model reuse across different tasks by relying on embeddings. However, to responsibly employ FMs, it is crucial to rigorously assess to which extent the embeddings they produce are generalizable, particularly in error-sensitive domains such as healthcare. Although prior works have already addressed the problem of benchmarking ECG-expert FMs, they focus predominantly on the evaluation of downstream performance. To fill this gap, this study aims to find an in-depth, comprehensive benchmarking framework for FMs, with a specific focus on ECG-expert ones. To this aim, we introduce a benchmark methodology that complements performance-based evaluation with representation-level analysis, leveraging SHAP and UMAP techniques. Furthermore, we rely on the methodology for carrying out an extensive evaluation of several ECG-expert FMs pretrained via state-of-the-art techniques over different cross-continental datasets and data availability settings; this includes ones featuring data scarcity, a fairly common situation in real-world medical scenarios. Experimental results show that our benchmarking protocol provides a rich insight of ECG-expert FMs' embedded patterns, enabling a deeper understanding of their representational structure and generalizability."

To bridge this gap, we introduce MMFineReason, a large-scale multimodal reasoning dataset comprising 1.8M samples and 5.1B solution tokens, featuring high-quality reasoning annotations distilled from Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B-Thinking. The dataset is established via a systematic three-stage pipeline: (1) large-scale data collection and standardization, (2) CoT rationale generation, and (3) comprehensive selection based on reasoning quality and difficulty awareness. The resulting dataset spans STEM problems, visual puzzles, games, and complex diagrams, with each sample annotated with visually grounded reasoning traces. We fine-tune Qwen3-VL-Instruct on MMFineReason to develop MMFineReason-2B/4B/8B versions. Our models establish new state-of-the-art results for their size class. Notably, MMFineReason-4B succesfully surpasses Qwen3-VL-8B-Thinking, and MMFineReason-8B even outperforms Qwen3-VL-30B-A3B-Thinking while approaching Qwen3-VL-32B-Thinking, demonstrating remarkable parameter efficiency.

Unlike prior work that modifies the network architecture or diffuses directly in the frequency domain, our proposed method alters only the diffusion process itself, making it compatible with existing diffusion backbones (e.g., DiffWave, TimeGrad, CSDI). By staging noise injection according to component energy, it maintains high signal-to-noise ratios for dominant frequencies throughout the diffusion trajectory, thereby improving the recoverability of long-term patterns. This strategy enables the model to maintain the signal structure for a longer period in the forward process, leading to improved forecast quality. Across standard forecasting benchmarks, we show that applying spectral decomposition strategies, such as the Fourier or Wavelet transform, consistently improves upon diffusion models using the baseline forward process, with negligible computational overhead.

The simplest model of coupling of a structured waveguide with an external RF power source and load through loops and transmission lines was used. Even such a simple model significantly complicated the system of coupled equations. It turned into a coupled integro-differential system of the Barbashin type with degenerate kernels. Since the integral kernels are degenerate, this system is reduced to three independent systems of differential equations. Instead of solving a system of coupled integro-differential equations, we need to find solutions to three systems of ordinary differential equations. Two systems describe the distribution of the field excited by one loop and the specified value of the excitation current in it. In the first system the loop is located at the section's input, and in the second, at the section's output. The third system does not depend on the loop parameters at all. It describes the distribution of the field excited by an electron beam in a section without loops. Based on the developed analytical model, the computer code was developed for matching the loop couplers for the uniform accelerating sections of X-band. The calculation results were used to simulate the non-uniform section. Without additional matching, we obtained an input reflection coefficient of 8E-3."

However, intrinsic noise and temporal fluctuations (e.g., oscillations) generally deteriorate computational performance. Here, we propose ensemble reservoir computing (ERC), a novel framework that employs ensemble averaging of spatially multiplexed systems to achieve robust information processing despite noise and temporal fluctuations. First, we prove that ensemble averaging in ERC eliminates temporal fluctuations and noise from dynamical states under certain conditions, thereby restoring computational performance to its noise-free level. Next, we show that ERC not only removes the noise and fluctuations but also actively exploits the computational capabilities that conventional reservoir computing (RC) leaves unutilized. This computational enhancement is demonstrated across diverse dynamical systems (e.g., periodic, chaotic, and strange-nonchaotic systems), in which ERC outperforms conventional RC. Finally, using energy-efficient spin-torque oscillators (STOs), we demonstrate that ERC maintains high performance even under realistic conditions, in which noise and temporal fluctuations coexist: STOs with ERC achieved 99\\% accuracy on an error detection test, where conventional STO reservoir with linear regression only shows a chance level performance, highlighting ERC's robustness and performance gains for physical systems."

    "abstract": "Test-time reinforcement learning (TTRL) enables large language models (LLMs) to self-improve on unlabeled inputs, but its effectiveness critically depends on how reward signals are estimated without ground-truth supervision. Most existing TTRL methods rely on majority voting (MV) over rollouts to produce deterministic rewards, implicitly assuming that the majority rollout provides a reliable learning signal. We show that this assumption is fragile: MV reduces the rollout distribution into a single outcome, discarding information about non-majority but correct actions candidates, and yields systematically biased reward estimates. To address this, we propose Distribution-AwareReward Estimation (DARE), which shifts reward estimation from a single majority outcome to the full empirical rollout distribution. DARE further augments this distribution-based reward with an exploration bonus and a distribution pruning mechanism for non-majority rollout exploration and reward denoise, yielding a more informative and robust reward estimation. Extensive experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks show that DARE improves optimization stability and final performance over recent baselines, achieving relative improvements of 25.3% on challenging AIME 2024 and 5.3% on AMC."

Empirical analysis on TREC CAsT and FoodSafeSum reveals critical misalignments: for 47.4% to 66.7% of queries, generators ignore the retriever's top-ranked documents, while 48.1% to 65.9% rely on documents ranked as less relevant.

Existing memory systems typically follow a pipeline of offline memory construction and update, and online retrieval. Despite the flexible online phase, the offline phase remains fixed and task-independent. In this phase, memory construction operates under a predefined workflow and fails to emphasize task relevant information. Meanwhile, memory updates are guided by generic metrics rather than task specific supervision. This leads to a misalignment between offline memory preparation and task requirements, which undermines downstream task performance. To this end, we propose an Adversarial Memory Adaptation mechanism (AMA) that aligns memory construction and update with task objectives by simulating task execution. Specifically, first, a challenger agent generates question answer pairs based on the original dialogues. The constructed memory is then used to answer these questions, simulating downstream inference. Subsequently, an evaluator agent assesses the responses and performs error analysis. Finally, an adapter agent analyzes the error cases and performs dual level updates on both the construction strategy and the content. Through this process, the memory system receives task aware supervision signals in advance during the offline phase, enhancing its adaptability to downstream tasks. AMA can be integrated into various existing memory systems, and extensive experiments on long dialogue benchmark LoCoMo demonstrate its effectiveness."

In this work, we present an efficient pipeline for single-view 3D reconstruction of real ships by training entirely on synthetic data and requiring only a single view at inference. Our approach uses the Splatter Image network, which represents objects as sparse sets of 3D Gaussians for rapid and accurate reconstruction from single images. The model is first fine-tuned on synthetic ShapeNet vessels and further refined with a diverse custom dataset of 3D ships, bridging the domain gap between synthetic and real-world imagery. We integrate a state-of-the-art segmentation module based on YOLOv8 and custom preprocessing to ensure compatibility with the reconstruction network. Postprocessing steps include real-world scaling, centering, and orientation alignment, followed by georeferenced placement on an interactive web map using AIS metadata and homography-based mapping. Quantitative evaluation on synthetic validation data demonstrates strong reconstruction fidelity, while qualitative results on real maritime images from the ShipSG dataset confirm the potential for transfer to operational maritime settings. The final system provides interactive 3D inspection of real ships without requiring real-world 3D annotations.

Within this framework, a pre-trained classical neural network serves as a frozen feature block, while a VQC acts as a trainable adaptive module that operates on structured representations rather than raw inputs. This separation enables efficient learning under constrained quantum resources and provides a principled abstraction for analyzing hybrid models. We develop a block-wise generalization theory that decomposes learning error into approximation and estimation components, explicitly characterizing how the complexity and training status of each block influence overall performance. Our analysis generalizes prior tensor-network-specific results and identifies conditions under which quantum modules provide representational advantages over comparably sized classical heads. Empirically, we validate the framework through systematic block-swap experiments across frozen feature extractors and both quantum and classical adaptive heads.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, yet they remain constrained by fixed, non-differentiable tokenizers like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), which hinder end-to-end optimization and adaptability to noisy or domain-specific data. We introduce Zonkey, a hierarchical diffusion model that addresses these limitations through a fully trainable pipeline from raw characters to document-level representations. At its core is a differentiable tokenizer (Segment Splitter) that learns probabilistic beginning-of-sequence (BOS) decisions, enabling adaptive splits that emerge as linguistically meaningful (e.g., word boundaries at spaces, sentence starts at periods) without explicit supervision. This differentiability is enabled by our novel Probabilistic Attention mechanism, which incorporates position-specific existence probabilities to simulate soft masking over theoretically infinite sequences while preserving gradients. Sequences decay probabilistically rather than relying on end-of-sequence tokens, supporting variable-length outputs. Hierarchical levels compress sequences into higher abstractions (e.g., character n-grams to word-like vectors, then sentence-like), with reconstruction via our Denoising Diffusion Mixed Model (DDMM) for stable and efficient denoising in latent space. A Stitcher ensures overlap invariance across segments. Trained end-to-end on Wikipedia, Zonkey generates coherent, variable-length text from noise, demonstrating emergent hierarchies and promising qualitative alignment to data distributions compared to entropy-based learnable tokenizers. Our approach advances toward fully gradient-based LLMs, with potential for better domain adaptation and scalable generation. We release the source code for training and reproducing our experiments."

Our experiments reveal that: (a) ChatGPT's performance scores on MedIE tasks fall behind those of the fine-tuned baseline models. (b) ChatGPT can provide high-quality explanations for its decisions, however, ChatGPT is over-confident in its predcitions.

Each foundation model can spawn large numbers of fine-tunes, adapters, quantizations, merges, and forks. We take the position that compute efficiency alone is insufficient for sustainability in open-source AI: lower per-run costs can accelerate experimentation and deployment, increasing aggregate environmental footprint unless impacts are measurable and comparable across derivative lineages. However, the energy use, water consumption, and emissions of these derivative lineages are rarely measured or disclosed in a consistent, comparable manner, leaving ecosystem-level impact largely invisible. We argue that sustainable open-source AI requires coordination infrastructure that tracks impacts across model lineages, not only base models. We propose Data and Impact Accounting (DIA), a lightweight, non-restrictive transparency layer that (i) standardizes carbon and water reporting metadata, (ii) integrates low-friction measurement into common training and inference pipelines, and (iii) aggregates reports through public dashboards to summarize cumulative impacts across releases and derivatives. DIA makes derivative costs visible and supports ecosystem-level accountability while preserving openness. https://vectorinstitute.github.io/ai-impact-accounting/"

Recent advances have made encouraging progress on each aspect individually, paving the way toward one-step diffusion/flow without latents. In this work, we take a further step towards this goal and propose \"pixel MeanFlow\" (pMF). Our core guideline is to formulate the network output space and the loss space separately. The network target is designed to be on a presumed low-dimensional image manifold (i.e., x-prediction), while the loss is defined via MeanFlow in the velocity space. We introduce a simple transformation between the image manifold and the average velocity field. In experiments, pMF achieves strong results for one-step latent-free generation on ImageNet at 256x256 resolution (2.22 FID) and 512x512 resolution (2.48 FID), filling a key missing piece in this regime. We hope that our study will further advance the boundaries of diffusion/flow-based generative models."

To improve both latent factor discovery and quality of compositional generation, we introduce an adversarial training signal via a discriminator trained to distinguish between single-source samples and those generated by recombining factors across sources. By optimizing the generator to fool this discriminator, we encourage physical and semantic consistency in the resulting recombinations. Our method outperforms implementations of prior baselines on CelebA-HQ, Virtual KITTI, CLEVR, and Falcor3D, achieving lower FID scores and better disentanglement as measured by MIG and MCC. Furthermore, we demonstrate a novel application to robotic video trajectories: by recombining learned action components, we generate diverse sequences that significantly increase state-space coverage for exploration on the LIBERO benchmark."

However, most MARL fine-tuning approaches rely on predefined execution protocols, which often require centralized execution. Decentralized LLM collaboration is more appealing in practice, as agents can run inference in parallel with flexible deployments. Also, current approaches use Monte Carlo methods for fine-tuning, which suffer from high variance and thus require more samples to train effectively. Actor-critic methods are prevalent in MARL for dealing with these issues, so we developed Multi-Agent Actor-Critic (MAAC) methods to optimize decentralized LLM collaboration. In this paper, we analyze when and why these MAAC methods are beneficial. We propose 2 MAAC approaches, \\textbf{CoLLM-CC} with a \\textbf{C}entralized \\textbf{C}ritic and \\textbf{CoLLM-DC} with \\textbf{D}ecentralized \\textbf{C}ritics. Our experiments across writing, coding, and game-playing domains show that Monte Carlo methods and CoLLM-DC can achieve performance comparable to CoLLM-CC in short-horizon and dense-reward settings.

Existing theory often represents nonstationarity with coarse-scale models that measure \\emph{how much} the environment changes, not \\emph{how} it changes locally -- even though acceleration and near-ties drive tracking error and policy chattering. We take a geometric view of nonstationary discounted Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) by modeling the environment as a differentiable homotopy path and tracking the induced motion of the optimal Bellman fixed point. This yields a length-curvature-kink signature of intrinsic complexity: cumulative drift, acceleration/oscillation, and action-gap-induced nonsmoothness. We prove a solver-agnostic path-integral stability bound and derive gap-safe feasible regions that certify local stability away from switch regimes. Building on these results, we introduce \\textit{Homotopy-Tracking RL (HT-RL)} and \\textit{HT-MCTS}, lightweight wrappers that estimate replay-based proxies of length, curvature, and near-tie proximity online and adapt learning or planning intensity accordingly.

We identify system prompt extraction as an emergent vulnerability intrinsic to code agents and present \\textbf{\\textsc{JustAsk}}, a self-evolving framework that autonomously discovers effective extraction strategies through interaction alone. Unlike prior prompt-engineering or dataset-based attacks, \\textsc{JustAsk} requires no handcrafted prompts, labeled supervision, or privileged access beyond standard user interaction. It formulates extraction as an online exploration problem, using Upper Confidence Bound-based strategy selection and a hierarchical skill space spanning atomic probes and high-level orchestration. These skills exploit imperfect system-instruction generalization and inherent tensions between helpfulness and safety. Evaluated on \\textbf{41} black-box commercial models across multiple providers, \\textsc{JustAsk} consistently achieves full or near-complete system prompt recovery, revealing recurring design- and architecture-level vulnerabilities.

Population-based, gradient-free optimization circumvents backpropagation through non-differentiable spike dynamics by estimating gradients. However, with finite populations, high variance of these estimates can induce harmful and overly aggressive update steps. Inspired by trust-region methods in reinforcement learning that constrain policy updates in distribution space, we propose \\textbf{Signal-Adaptive Trust Regions (SATR)}, a distributional update rule that constrains relative change by bounding KL divergence normalized by an estimated signal energy. SATR automatically expands the trust region under strong signals and contracts it when updates are noise-dominated. We instantiate SATR for Bernoulli connectivity distributions, which have shown strong empirical performance for RSNN optimization. Across a suite of high-dimensional continuous-control benchmarks, SATR improves stability under limited populations and reaches competitive returns against strong baselines including PPO-LSTM. In addition, to make SATR practical at scale, we introduce a bitset implementation for binary spiking and binary weights, substantially reducing wall-clock training time and enabling fast RSNN policy search."

Within this model, we combine Gray-encoded qudit-to-qubit mappings, qubit-wise commuting aggregation, and a multi-reference selected quantum Krylov fast-forwarding (sQKFF) hybrid algorithm to access long-time dynamics while remaining compatible with NISQ and early fault-tolerant hardware constraints. Numerical simulations demonstrate the computation of autocorrelation functions up to $\\sim100$ ns, together with microwave absorption spectra and the $\\ell_1$-norm of coherence, achieving 18-30$\\%$ reductions in gate counts and circuit depth for Trotterized time-evolution circuits compared to unoptimized implementations. Using the nitrogen vacancy center in diamond as a testbed, we benchmark the framework against classical simulations and identify the reference-state selection in sQKFF as the primary factor governing accuracy at fixed hardware cost.

In our work, we show that the market of LLM-as-a-service is socially inefficient: providers have a financial incentive to increase the amount of test-time compute, even if this increase contributes little to the quality of the outputs. To address this inefficiency, we introduce a reverse second-price auction mechanism where providers bid their offered price and (expected) quality for the opportunity to serve a user, and users pay proportionally to the marginal value generated by the winning provider relative to the second-highest bidder. To illustrate and complement our theoretical results, we conduct experiments with multiple instruct models from the $\\texttt{Llama}$ and $\\texttt{Qwen}$ families, as well as reasoning models distilled from $\\texttt{DeepSeek-R1}$, on math and science benchmark datasets."

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly expanded the possibilities for generating BPMN models directly from natural language, building upon earlier text-to-process methods with enhanced capabilities in handling complex descriptions. However, there is a lack of systematic evaluations of LLM-generated process models. Current efforts either use LLM-as-a-judge approaches or do not consider established dimensions of model quality. To this end, we introduce BEF4LLM, a novel LLM evaluation framework comprising four perspectives: syntactic quality, pragmatic quality, semantic quality, and validity. Using BEF4LLM, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of open-source LLMs and benchmark their performance against human modeling experts. Results indicate that LLMs excel in syntactic and pragmatic quality, while humans outperform in semantic aspects; however, the differences in scores are relatively modest, highlighting LLMs' competitive potential despite challenges in validity and semantic quality. The insights highlight current strengths and limitations of using LLMs for BPMN modeling and guide future model development and fine-tuning. Addressing these areas is essential for advancing the practical deployment of LLMs in business process modeling."

Existing learning-based methods, while capable of inferring the presence of hidden agents, often produce redundant occupancy predictions where a single agent is identified multiple times. This issue complicates downstream planning and increases computational load. To address this, we introduce MatchInformer, a novel transformer-based approach that builds on the state-of-the-art SceneInformer architecture. Our method improves upon prior work by integrating Hungarian Matching, a state-of-the-art object matching algorithm from object detection, into the training process to enforce a one-to-one correspondence between predictions and ground truth, thereby reducing redundancy. We further refine trajectory forecasts by decoupling an agent's heading from its motion, a strategy that improves the accuracy and interpretability of predicted paths. To better handle class imbalances, we propose using the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) to evaluate occupancy predictions. By considering all entries in the confusion matrix, MCC provides a robust measure even in sparse or imbalanced scenarios. Experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset demonstrate that our approach improves reasoning about occluded regions and produces more accurate trajectory forecasts than prior methods."

However, these models often yield overconfident, uncalibrated predictions. The standard approach to quantifying epistemic uncertainty, training an ensemble of independent models, incurs prohibitive computational costs that scale linearly with ensemble size, making it impractical for large foundation models. We propose Singular Value Ensemble (SVE), a parameter-efficient implicit ensemble method that builds on a simple, but powerful core assumption: namely, that the singular vectors of the weight matrices constitute meaningful subspaces of the model's knowledge. Pretrained foundation models encode rich, transferable information in their weight matrices. If the singular vectors are indeed meaningful (orthogonal) \"knowledge directions\". To obtain a model ensemble, we modulate only how strongly each direction contributes to the output. Rather than learning entirely new parameters, we freeze the singular vectors and only train per-member singular values that rescale the contribution of each direction in that shared knowledge basis. Ensemble diversity emerges naturally as stochastic initialization and random sampling of mini-batches during joint training cause different members to converge to different combinations of the same underlying knowledge. SVE achieves uncertainty quantification comparable to explicit deep ensembles while increasing the parameter count of the base model by less than 1%, making principled uncertainty estimation accessible in resource-constrained settings. We validate SVE on NLP and vision tasks with various different backbones and show that it improves calibration while maintaining predictive accuracy."

Both approaches exploit the semi-group property of the underlying diffeomorphic flow, enabling the reconstruction of solutions through flow maps that trace characteristics back to their initial positions. NuFI builds this flow map iteratively, preserving symplectic structure and conserving invariants, but its computational cost scales quadratically with time. Its advantage lies in a compact, low-dimensional representation depending only on the electric field. In contrast, CMM achieves low computational costs when remapping by composing the global flow map from explicitly stored submaps. The proposed hybrid method merges these strengths: NuFi is employed for accurate and conservative local time stepping, while CMM efficiently propagates the solution through submap composition. This approach reduces storage requirements, maintains accuracy, and improves structural properties. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the scheme and highlight the trade-offs between memory usage and computational cost. We benchmark against a semi-Lagrangian predictor-corrector scheme used in modern gyrokinetic codes, evaluating accuracy and conservation properties."

Consequently, there is strong motivation to understand the behavior of azeotropic mixtures under confinement. We address this problem using a machine-learning-enhanced classical density functional theory applied to a binary Lennard-Jones mixture that exhibits azeotropic phase behavior. As proof-of-principle of a \"train once, learn many\" strategy, our approach combines a neural functional trained on a single-component repulsive reference system with a mean-field treatment of attractive interactions, derived within the framework of hyperdensity functional theory (hyper-DFT). The theory faithfully describes capillary condensation and results from grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations. Moreover, by taking advantage of a known accurate equation of state, the theory we present well-describes bulk thermodynamics by construction. Exploiting the computational efficiency of hyper-DFT, we systematically evaluate adsorption selectivity across a wide range of compositions, pressures, temperatures, and wall-fluid affinities. In cases where the wall-fluid interaction is the same for both species, we find that the pore becomes completely unselective at the bulk azeotropic composition. Strikingly, this unselective point persists far from liquid-vapor coexistence, including in the supercritical regime. Analysis of the bulk equation of state across a wide range of thermodynamic state points shows that the azeotropic composition coincides with equal partial molar volumes and an extremum in the isothermal compressibility. A complementary thermodynamic analysis demonstrates that unselective adsorption corresponds to an aneotrope (a point of zero relative adsorption) and an extremum in the interfacial free energy. We also find that the two interfaces of the slit pore behave independently down to remarkably small slits."

As the quasiperiodic strength increases, localized subradiant states with extremely long lifetime appear around the resonant frequency and form a continuum band. In stark contrast to the fully disordered waveguide QED where all states are localized, we analytically find that the fraction of localized states is up to $(3-\\sqrt{5})/2$ when the modulation frequency is $(1+\\sqrt{5})/2$. The localized and delocalized states can be related to excitation in flat and curved inverse energy bands under the approximation of large-period modulation. When the quasiperiodic strength is weak, an extended subradiant state can support the transmission of a photon. However, as the quasiperiodic strength increases, localized subradiant states can completely block the transmission of a single photon in resonance with the subradiant states, and enhance the overall reflection. At a fixed quasiperiodic strength, we also find mobility edge in transmission spectrum, below and above which the transmission is either turned on and off as system size increases. Our work give new insights into the localization in non-Hermitian systems."

    "abstract": "Recently, the problem of music plagiarism has emerged as an even more pressing social issue. As music information retrieval research advances, there is a growing effort to address issues related to music plagiarism. However, many studies, including our previous work, have conducted research without clearly defining what the music plagiarism detection task actually involves. This lack of a clear definition has slowed research progress and made it hard to apply results to real-world scenarios. To fix this situation, we defined how Music Plagiarism Detection is different from other MIR tasks and explained what problems need to be solved. We introduce the Similar Music Pair dataset to support this newly defined task. In addition, we propose a method based on segment transcription as one way to solve the task. Our demo and dataset are available at https://github.com/Mippia/ICASSP2026-MPD."

    "abstract": "Automated GUI testing is crucial for ensuring the quality and reliability of Android apps. However, the efficacy of existing UI testing techniques is often limited, especially in terms of coverage. Recent studies, including the state-of-the-art, struggle to achieve more than 30% activity coverage in real-world apps. This limited coverage can be attributed to a combination of factors such as failing to generate complex user inputs, unsatisfied activation conditions regarding device configurations and external resources, and hard-to-reach code paths that are not easily accessible through the GUI. To overcome these limitations, we propose CovAgent, a novel agentic AI-powered approach to enhance Android app UI testing. Our fuzzer-agnostic framework comprises an AI agent that inspects the app's decompiled Smali code and component transition graph, and reasons about unsatisfied activation conditions within the app code logic that prevent access to the activities that are unreachable by standard and widely adopted GUI fuzzers. Then, another agent generates dynamic instrumentation scripts that satisfy activation conditions required for successful transitions to those activities. We found that augmenting existing fuzzing approaches with our framework achieves a significant improvement in test coverage over the state-of-the-art, LLMDroid, and other baselines such as Fastbot and APE (e.g., 101.1%, 116.3% and 179.7% higher activity coverage, respectively). CovAgent also outperforms all the baselines in other metrics such as class, method, and line coverage. We also conduct investigations into components within CovAgent to reveal further insights regarding the efficacy of Agentic AI in the field of automated app testing such as the agentic activation condition inference accuracy, and agentic activity-launching success rate."

    "abstract": "Photons are among the most important carriers of quantum information owing to their rich degrees of freedom (DoFs), including various spatiotemporal structures. The ability to characterize these DoFs, as well as the hidden correlations among them, directly determines whether they can be exploited for quantum tasks. While various methods have been developed for measuring the spatiotemporal structure of classical light fields, owing to the technical challenges posed by weak photon flux, there have so far been no reports of observing such structures in their quantum counterparts, except for a few studies limited to correlations within individual DoFs. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a self-referenced, high-efficiency, and all-optical method, termed 3D imaging of photonic wave packets, for comprehensive characterization of the spatiotemporal structure of a quantum light field, i.e., the biphoton spatiotemporal wave packet. Benefiting from this developed method, we successfully observe the spatial-spatial, spectral-spectral, and spatiotemporal correlations of biphotons generated via spontaneous parametric down-conversion, revealing rich local and nonlocal spatiotemporal structure in quantum light fields. This method will further advance the understanding of the dynamics in nonlinear quantum optics and expand the potential of photons for applications in quantum communication and quantum computing."

    "abstract": "The machine learning community has achieved remarkable success with universal foundation models for time-series and physical dynamics, largely overcoming earlier approximation barriers in smooth or slowly varying regimes through scale and specialized architectures. However, deploying these monolithic models in safety-critical Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), governed by non-stationary lifecycle dynamics and strict reliability requirements, reveals persistent challenges. Recent evidence shows that fine-tuning time-series foundation models induces catastrophic forgetting, degrading performance on prior regimes. Standard models continue to exhibit residual spectral bias, smoothing high-frequency discontinuities characteristic of incipient faults, while their opacity hinders formal verification and traceability demanded by safety standards (e.g., ISO 26262, IEC 61508). This position paper argues that the plasticity-stability paradox cannot be fully resolved by global parameter updates (whether via offline fine-tuning or online adaptation). Instead, we advocate a Modular Sovereignty paradigm: a library of compact, frozen regime-specific specialists combined via uncertainty-aware blending, which we term \"HYDRA\" (Hierarchical uncertaintY-aware Dynamics for Rapidly-Adapting systems). This paradigm ensures regime-conditional validity, rigorous disentanglement of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, and modular auditability, offering a certifiable path for robust state integrity across the CPS lifecycle."

    "abstract": "Kleinberg and Mullainathan recently proposed a formal framework for studying the phenomenon of language generation, called language generation in the limit. In this model, an adversary gives an enumeration of example strings from an unknown target language, and the algorithm is tasked with correctly generating unseen strings from the target language within finite time. Refined notions of non-uniform and uniform generation were later introduced by Li, Raman, and Tewari (2025), and a noisy model was introduced by Raman and Raman (2025), which allows the adversary to insert extraneous strings. A natural question in the noisy model is to quantify the effect of noise, by studying the impact of each additional extraneous string. We show two complementary results in this setting. We first show that for both uniform and non-uniform generation, a single noisy string strictly reduces the set of collections that can be generated, thus answering an open question in Raman and Raman (2025). Then, we show for both uniform and non-uniform generation that generation with a single noisy string is equivalent to generation with any finite amount of noise, sharply contrasting with the strict hierarchy for noisy generation in the limit shown by Bai, Panigrahi, and Zhang (2026). Finally, we leverage our previous results to provide the first known characterization for non-uniform noise-dependent generatability."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a Koopman-based framework for modeling, prediction, and control of unknown nonlinear time-varying systems. We present a novel Koopman-based learning method for predicting the state of unknown nonlinear time-varying systems, upon which a robust controller is designed to ensure that the resulting closed-loop system is input-to-state stable with respect to the Koopman approximation error. The error of the lifted system model learned through the Koopman-based method increases over time due to the time-varying nature of the nonlinear time-varying system. To address this issue, an online iterative update scheme is incorporated into the learning process to update the lifted system model, aligning it more precisely with the time-varying nonlinear system by integrating the updated data and discarding the outdated data. A necessary condition for the feasibility of the proposed iterative learning method is derived. In order to reduce unnecessary system updates while ensuring the prediction accuracy of the lifted system, the update mechanism is enhanced to determine whether to update the lifted system and meanwhile to reduce updates that deteriorate the fitting performance. Furthermore, based on the online-updated lifted system, a controller is designed to ensure the closed-loop controlled system be input-to-state stable with respect to the Koopman approximation error. Numerical simulations on the Duffing oscillator, the serial manipulator, and the synthetic biological network system are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for the approximation and control of unknown nonlinear time-varying systems. The results show that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods in terms of approximation accuracy and computational efficiency, even under significant system variations."

By leveraging on-chip plasticity, our architecture enhances the network's generalization, ensuring robust performance in dynamic and unstructured environments. The hardware design achieves an end-to-end latency of just 8~$μ$s for both inference and plasticity updates, enabling rapid adaptation to unseen scenarios. Implemented on a tiny Cmod A7-35T FPGA, FireFly-P consumes only 0.713~W and $\\sim$10K~LUTs, making it ideal for power- and resource-constrained embedded robotic platforms. This work demonstrates that hardware-accelerated SNN plasticity is a viable path toward enabling adaptive, low-latency, and energy-efficient control systems."

This work addresses the Boltzmann equations for such mixtures with unequal molecular masses $(m^A\\neq m^B)$, establishing the global in time existence of classical solutions near Maxwellians for soft potentials ($-3<γ<0$) in a periodic spatial domain. Our analysis encompasses arbitrary molecular mass ratios. Our analysis encompasses arbitrary molecular mass ratios. The main contribution of this paper lies in the detailed characterization of the linear collision operator's structure and establishing estimates for the nonlinear terms under unequal mass conditions. Consequently, these results may help advance spectral analysis for soft potentials as well as $L^2,L^{\\infty}$ frameworks in future studies of multi-component Boltzmann equations."

    "abstract": "Query optimization is a crucial component for the efficacy of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. While reinforcement learning (RL)-based agentic and reasoning methods have recently emerged as a promising direction on query optimization, most existing approaches focus on the expansion and abstraction of a single query. However, complex user queries are prevalent in real-world scenarios, often requiring multiple parallel and sequential search strategies to handle disambiguation and decomposition. Directly applying RL to these complex cases introduces significant hurdles. Determining the optimal number of sub-queries and effectively re-ranking and merging retrieved documents vastly expands the search space and complicates reward design, frequently leading to training instability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel RL framework called Adaptive Complex Query Optimization (ACQO). Our framework is designed to adaptively determine when and how to expand the search process. It features two core components: an Adaptive Query Reformulation (AQR) module that dynamically decides when to decompose a query into multiple sub-queries, and a Rank-Score Fusion (RSF) module that ensures robust result aggregation and provides stable reward signals for the learning agent. To mitigate training instabilities, we adopt a Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (CRL) approach, which stabilizes the training process by progressively introducing more challenging queries through a two-stage strategy. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ACQO achieves state-of-the-art performance on three complex query benchmarks, significantly outperforming established baselines. The framework also showcases improved computational efficiency and broad compatibility with different retrieval architectures, establishing it as a powerful and generalizable solution for next-generation RAG systems."

However, most existing approaches are either limited to a single language or fail to capture language-specific factors shaping intelligibility. We present a multilingual phoneme-production assessment framework that integrates universal phone recognition with language-specific phoneme interpretation using contrastive phonological feature distances for phone-to-phoneme mapping and sequence alignment. The framework yields three metrics: phoneme error rate (PER), phonological feature error rate (PFER), and a newly proposed alignment-free measure, phoneme coverage (PhonCov). Analysis on English, Spanish, Italian, and Tamil show that PER benefits from the combination of mapping and alignment, PFER from alignment alone, and PhonCov from mapping. Further analyses demonstrate that the proposed framework captures clinically meaningful patterns of intelligibility degradation consistent with established observations of dysarthric speech."

The branching fractions of $D^0\\to K^-e^+ν_e$, $D^0\\to K^-μ^+ν_μ$, $D^+\\to \\bar K^0e^+ν_e$, and $D^+\\to \\bar K^0μ^+ν_μ$ are measured to be $(3.527\\pm0.005_{\\rm stat}\\pm0.016_{\\rm syst}) \\%$, $(3.429\\pm0.007_{\\rm stat}\\pm0.017_{\\rm syst}) \\%$, $(8.918\\pm0.025_{\\rm stat}\\pm0.050_{\\rm syst}) \\%$, and $(8.763\\pm0.029_{\\rm stat}\\pm0.052_{\\rm syst}) \\%$, respectively. The partial decay rates of these four decays are measured with improved precision, and their forward-backward asymmetries are determined for the first time. By performing a simultaneous fit to the measured partial decay rates and the forward-backward asymmetries of $D \\to \\bar K\\ell^+ν_{\\ell}$, a search for a possible scalar current contribution in the $c\\to s\\ell^+ν_{\\ell}$ transition is performed. The results are ${\\rm Re}(c_S^μ)=0.007\\pm0.008_{\\rm stat}\\pm0.006_{\\rm syst}$ and ${\\rm Im}(c_S^μ)=\\pm(0.070\\pm0.013_{\\rm stat}\\pm0.010_{\\rm syst})$, corresponding to a difference from the SM with a significance of $1.9σ$. The product of the form factor $f_+(0)$ and the modulus of the $c\\to s$ Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element $|V_{cs}|$ is determined to be $f_(0)|V_{cs}|=0.7160\\pm0.0007_{\\rm stat}\\pm0.0014_{\\rm syst}$. With the inputs $|V_{cs}|=0.97349\\pm0.00016$ from the Standard Model global fit or $f_+(0)=0.7452\\pm0.0031$ from the lattice quantum chromodynamics calculation, we derive $f_+(0)=0.7355\\pm0.0007_{\\rm stat}\\pm0.0014_{\\rm syst}$ and $|V_{cs}|=0.9608\\pm0.0009_{\\rm stat}\\pm0.0019_{\\rm syst}\\pm0.0040_{\\rm LQCD}$.

    "abstract": "AI-based coding agents are increasingly integrated into software development workflows, collaborating with developers to create pull requests (PRs). Despite their growing adoption, the role of human-agent collaboration in software testing remains poorly understood. This paper presents an empirical study of 6,582 human-agent PRs (HAPRs) and 3,122 human PRs (HPRs) from the AIDev dataset. We compare HAPRs and HPRs along three dimensions: (i) testing frequency and extent, (ii) types of testing-related changes (code-and-test co-evolution vs. test-focused), and (iii) testing quality, measured by test smells. Our findings reveal that, although the likelihood of including tests is comparable (42.9% for HAPRs vs. 40.0% for HPRs), HAPRs exhibit a larger extent of testing, nearly doubling the test-to-source line ratio found in HPRs. While test-focused task distributions are comparable, HAPRs are more likely to add new tests during co-evolution (OR=1.79), whereas HPRs prioritize modifying existing tests. Finally, although some test smell categories differ statistically, negligible effect sizes suggest no meaningful differences in quality. These insights provide the first characterization of how human-agent collaboration shapes testing practices."

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art embedding models are increasingly derived from decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) backbones adapted via contrastive learning. Given the emergence of reasoning models trained via Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), a natural question arises: do enhanced reasoning translate to superior semantic representations when these models serve as embedding initializations? Contrary to expectation, our evaluation on MTEB and BRIGHT reveals a **null effect**: embedding models initialized from RLVR-tuned backbones yield no consistent performance advantage over their base counterparts when subjected to identical training recipes. To unpack this paradox, we introduce **H**ierarchical **R**epresentation **S**imilarity **A**nalysis (HRSA), a framework that decomposes similarity across representation, geometry, and function levels. HRSA reveals that while RLVR induces irreversible latent manifold's local geometry reorganization and reversible coordinate basis drift, it preserves the global manifold geometry and linear readout. Consequently, subsequent contrastive learning drives strong alignment between base- and reasoning-initialized models, a phenomenon we term **Manifold Realignment**. Empirically, our findings suggest that unlike Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), RLVR optimizes trajectories within an existing semantic landscape rather than fundamentally restructuring the landscape itself."

    "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from cross-modal hallucinations, where one modality inappropriately influences generation about another, leading to fabricated output. This exposes a more fundamental deficiency in modality-interaction control. To address this, we propose Modality-Adaptive Decoding (MAD), a training-free method that adaptively weights modality-specific decoding branches based on task requirements. MAD leverages the model's inherent ability to self-assess modality relevance by querying which modalities are needed for each task. The extracted modality probabilities are then used to adaptively weight contrastive decoding branches, enabling the model to focus on relevant information while suppressing cross-modal interference. Extensive experiments on CMM and AVHBench demonstrate that MAD significantly reduces cross-modal hallucinations across multiple audio-visual language models (7.8\\% and 2.0\\% improvements for VideoLLaMA2-AV, 8.7\\% and 4.7\\% improvements for Qwen2.5-Omni). Our approach demonstrates that explicit modality awareness through self-assessment is crucial for robust multimodal reasoning, offering a principled extension to existing contrastive decoding methods.

While they are foundational in biophysics, their classical formulation relies on a single characteristic length scale that balances reaction and diffusion, making them overly simplistic for describing biological patterns, which often exhibit multi-scale structures, grain-like textures, and inherent imperfections. Here, we integrate diffusiophoretically-assisted assembly of finite-sized cells, driven by a background chemical gradient in a Turing pattern, while also incorporating intercellular interactions. This framework introduces key control parameters, such as the Péclet number, cell size distribution, and intercellular interactions, enabling us to reproduce strikingly similar structural features observed in natural patterns. We report imperfections, including spatial variations in pattern thickness, packing limits, and pattern breakups. Our model not only deepens our understanding but also opens a new line of inquiry into imperfect Turing patterns that deviate from the classical formulation in significant ways."

We present \\textbf{Flow Perturbation++}, a variance-reduced extension of Flow Perturbation that discretizes the probability-flow ODE and performs unbiased stepwise Jacobian estimation at each integration step. This multi-step construction retains the unbiasedness of Flow Perturbation while achieves substantially lower estimator variance. Integrated into a Sequential Monte Carlo framework, Flow Perturbation++ achieves significantly improved equilibrium sampling on a 1000D Gaussian Mixture Model and the all-atom Chignolin protein compared with Hutchinson-based and single-step Flow Perturbation baselines."

Moreover, we demonstrate that chiral magnon splitting in altermagnets gives rise to an intrinsically anisotropic, momentum-resolved thermal Hall response, sharply contrasting with those in ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, thus offering enhanced flexibility for selective manipulation. As a concrete material realization, first-principles calculations and Heisenberg-DM model analysis reveal that V$_2$WS$_4$ bilayer exhibits $d$-wave altermagnetism, integer spin Chern number with helical magnon edge states, and the nonzero momentum-locked thermal Hall conductivity. Our results establish a direct link between topological magnons and altermagnetism, opening new avenues for dissipationless magnonic devices."

We present A2RAG, an adaptive-and-agentic GraphRAG framework for cost-aware and reliable reasoning. A2RAG couples an adaptive controller that verifies evidence sufficiency and triggers targeted refinement only when necessary, with an agentic retriever that progressively escalates retrieval effort and maps graph signals back to provenance text to remain robust under extraction loss and incomplete graphs. Experiments on HotpotQA and 2WikiMultiHopQA demonstrate that A2RAG achieves +9.9/+11.8 absolute gains in Recall@2, while cutting token consumption and end-to-end latency by about 50% relative to iterative multihop baselines."

However, MLIPs face two primary bottlenecks preventing them from reaching realistic simulation scales: inference time and memory consumption. In this work, we address both issues by challenging the long-held belief that the cutoff radius for the MLIP must be held to a fixed, constant value. For the first time, we introduce a dynamic cutoff formulation that still leads to stable, long timescale molecular dynamics simulation. In introducing the dynamic cutoff, we are able to induce sparsity onto the underlying atom graph by targeting a specific number of neighbors per atom, significantly reducing both memory consumption and inference time. We show the effectiveness of a dynamic cutoff by implementing it onto 4 state of the art MLIPs: MACE, Nequip, Orbv3, and TensorNet, leading to 2.26x less memory consumption and 2.04x faster inference time, depending on the model and atomic system. We also perform an extensive error analysis and find that the dynamic cutoff models exhibit minimal accuracy dropoff compared to their fixed cutoff counterparts on both materials and molecular datasets. All model implementations and training code will be fully open sourced."

We demonstrate that this mechanism subsumes classical distributed system methods such as PTIDES, Chandy-and-Misra with or without null messages, Jefferson's Time-Warp, and Lamport's time-based fault detection, while enabling real-time behavior in distributed cyber-physical applications. The mechanism can also realize many commonly used distributed system patterns, including logical execution time (LET), publish and subscribe, actors, conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs), and remote procedure calls with futures. More importantly, it adds to these mechanisms better control over timing, bounded time fault detection, and the option of making them more deterministic, all within a single semantic framework. Implemented as an extension of the Lingua Franca coordination language, maxwait enforces logical-time consistency when communication latencies are bounded and provides structured fault handling when bounds are violated."

As consequence of the fermionic sector, we obtain a non-linear contribution in the electromagnetic fields that breaks the Lorentz symmetry due to Fermi velocity. From the Euler-Heisenberg pseudo-electrodynamics, we study the properties of the plane wave propagating in a planar medium under an uniform and constant electromagnetic background field. The properties of the planar material are discussed through the electric permittivity tensor and magnetic permeability, that are functions of the frequency, wavelength and of the background fields. The dispersion relations and the refractive index are calculated in the presence of a uniform magnetic field, and also in the case only of an electric background field. The birefringence phenomenon emerges only when the electric background field is considered."

The third light of $l_3=0.136\\pm0.003$ comes mainly from two neighboring stars, TIC 399725539 and TIC 399725544. Comparison with stellar models indicates that TIC 399725538 A lies within the instability region of $δ$ Sct$-$$γ$ Dor hybrids, whereas its extremely low-mass companion is markedly underluminous compared to theoretical white dwarf (WD) counterparts. Multifrequency analysis of the binary-subtracted residual lights revealed three significant signals, two of which correspond to aliases at two and four times the dominant frequency $f_1=0.0848$ day$^{-1}$. The $f_1$ frequency is likely a $γ$ Dor-type pulsation arising from the brighter A component, though further confirmation is required. Our results demonstrate that TIC 399725538 is a short-period EL CVn system belonging to the thick-disk population, consisting of a main-sequence $γ$ Dor pulsator and a helium-core WD precursor formed through stable mass transfer."

    "abstract": "This paper presents AnthropoCam, a mobile-based neural style transfer (NST) system optimized for the visual synthesis of Anthropocene environments. Unlike conventional artistic NST, which prioritizes painterly abstraction, stylizing human-altered landscapes demands a careful balance between amplifying material textures and preserving semantic legibility. Industrial infrastructures, waste accumulations, and modified ecosystems contain dense, repetitive patterns that are visually expressive yet highly susceptible to semantic erosion under aggressive style transfer. To address this challenge, we systematically investigate the impact of NST parameter configurations on the visual translation of Anthropocene textures, including feature layer selection, style and content loss weighting, training stability, and output resolution. Through controlled experiments, we identify an optimal parameter manifold that maximizes stylistic expression while preventing semantic erasure. Our results demonstrate that appropriate combinations of convolutional depth, loss ratios, and resolution scaling enable the faithful transformation of anthropogenic material properties into a coherent visual language. Building on these findings, we implement a low-latency, feed-forward NST pipeline deployed on mobile devices. The system integrates a React Native frontend with a Flask-based GPU backend, achieving high-resolution inference within 3-5 seconds on general mobile hardware. This enables real-time, in-situ visual intervention at the site of image capture, supporting participatory engagement with Anthropocene landscapes. By coupling domain-specific NST optimization with mobile deployment, AnthropoCam reframes neural style transfer as a practical and expressive tool for real-time environmental visualization in the Anthropocene."

For example, a vehicle's dynamics evolve gradually through a turning maneuver, and human gait shifts smoothly from walking to running. We formalize this setting by modeling transitional mechanisms as convex combinations of finitely many atomic mechanisms, governed by time-varying mixing coefficients. Our theoretical contributions establish that both the latent causal variables and the continuous mixing trajectory are jointly identifiable. We further propose TRACE, a Mixture-of-Experts framework where each expert learns one atomic mechanism during training, enabling recovery of mechanism trajectories at test time. This formulation generalizes to intermediate mechanism states never observed during training. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that TRACE recovers mixing trajectories with up to 0.99 correlation, substantially outperforming discrete-switching baselines."

Using explainable AI techniques, we identify features that substantially affect performance and translate them into natural-language mutation instructions that steer subsequent LLM-based code generation without restricting expressivity. We propose LLaMEA-SAGE, which integrates this feature-driven guidance into LLaMEA, and evaluate it across several benchmarks. We show that the proposed structured guidance achieves the same performance faster than vanilla LLaMEA in a small controlled experiment. In a larger-scale experiment using the MA-BBOB suite from the GECCO-MA-BBOB competition, our guided approach achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art AAD methods. These results demonstrate that signals derived from code can effectively bias LLM-driven algorithm evolution, bridging the gap between code structure and human-understandable performance feedback in automated algorithm design."

    "abstract": "Foundation models have shown remarkable success in fitting biological visual systems; however, their black-box nature inherently limits their utility for understanding brain function. Here, we peek inside a SOTA foundation model of neural activity (Wang et al., 2025) as a physiologist might, characterizing each 'neuron' based on its temporal response properties to parametric stimuli. We analyze how different stimuli are represented in neural activity space by building decoding manifolds, and we analyze how different neurons are represented in stimulus-response space by building neural encoding manifolds. We find that the different processing stages of the model (i.e., the feedforward encoder, recurrent, and readout modules) each exhibit qualitatively different representational structures in these manifolds. The recurrent module shows a jump in capabilities over the encoder module by 'pushing apart' the representations of different temporal stimulus patterns. Our 'tubularity' metric quantifies this stimulus-dependent development of neural activity as biologically plausible. The readout module achieves high fidelity by using numerous specialized feature maps rather than biologically plausible mechanisms. Overall, this study provides a window into the inner workings of a prominent neural foundation model, gaining insights into the biological relevance of its internals through the novel analysis of its neurons' joint temporal response patterns. Our findings suggest design changes that could bring neural foundation models into closer alignment with biological systems: introducing recurrence in early encoder stages, and constraining features in the readout module."

In this work, we explore how these circuits can be used to implement and harness qutrits, by tuning their energy levels and matrix elements via an external flux bias. In particular, we investigate the distinctive features of arrays of fluxonium qutrits, and their potential for the quantum simulation of exotic quantum matter. We identify four different operational regimes, classified according to the plasmon-like versus fluxon-like nature of the qutrit excitations. Highly tunable on-site interactions are complemented by correlated single-particle hopping, pair hopping and non-local interactions, which naturally emerge and have different weights in the four regimes. Dispersive corrections and decoherence are also analyzed. We investigate the rich ground-state phase diagram of qutrit arrays and propose practical dynamical experiments to probe the different regimes. Altogether, fluxonium qutrit arrays emerge as a versatile and experimentally accessible platform to explore strongly correlated bosonic matter beyond the Bose-Hubbard paradigm, and with a potential toward simulating lattice gauge theories and non-Abelian topological states."

    "abstract": "Indoor mobile robot navigation requires fast responsiveness and robust semantic understanding, yet existing methods struggle to provide both. Classical geometric approaches such as SLAM offer reliable localization but depend on detailed maps and cannot interpret human-targeted cues (e.g., signs, room numbers) essential for indoor reasoning. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models introduce semantic grounding but remain strictly reactive, basing decisions only on visible frames and failing to anticipate unseen intersections or reason about distant textual cues. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) provide richer contextual inference but suffer from high computational latency, making them unsuitable for real-time operation on embedded platforms. In this work, we present IROS, a real-time navigation framework that combines VLM-level contextual reasoning with the efficiency of lightweight perceptual modules on low-cost, on-device hardware. Inspired by Dual Process Theory, IROS separates fast reflexive decisions (System One) from slow deliberative reasoning (System Two), invoking the VLM only when necessary. Furthermore, by augmenting compact VLMs with spatial and textual cues, IROS delivers robust, human-like navigation with minimal latency. Across five real-world buildings, IROS improves decision accuracy and reduces latency by 66% compared to continuous VLM-based navigation."

However, current approaches often treat these tasks separately, leading to inefficiencies and challenges in maintaining spatial consistency and semantic coherence between generated content and edits. Moreover, a major obstacle is the lack of structured control over object relationships and spatial arrangements. Scene graph-based methods, which represent objects and their interrelationships in a structured format, offer a solution by providing greater control over composition and interactions in both image generation and editing. To address this, we introduce SimGraph, a unified framework that integrates scene graph-based image generation and editing, enabling precise control over object interactions, layouts, and spatial coherence. In particular, our framework integrates token-based generation and diffusion-based editing within a single scene graph-driven model, ensuring high-quality and consistent results. Through extensive experiments, we empirically demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods."

    "abstract": "The spectral analysis of operators in heterogeneous and aging media typically requires a functional framework that extends beyond the standard Hilbertian setting. In this paper, we establish a rigorous distributional theory for a class of non-local operators, termed Weighted Weyl-Sonine operators, by employing a structure-preserving transmutation method. We construct the Weighted Schwartz Space $\\mathcal{S}_{ψ,ω}$ and its topological dual, the space of Weighted Tempered Distributions $\\mathcal{S}'_{ψ,ω}$, ensuring that the underlying Fréchet topology is consistent with the infinitesimal generator of the aging dynamics. This topological foundation allows us to: (i) extend the Weighted Fourier Transform to generalized functions as a unitary isomorphism; (ii) provide an explicit spectral characterization of the weighted Dirac delta $δ_{ψ,ω}$ and its scaling laws under geometric dilations; and (iii) introduce a scale of Weighted Sobolev Spaces $H^{s}_{ψ,ω}$ defined via spectral multipliers. A central result is the derivation of a sharp embedding theorem, $|u(t)| \\le C ω(t)^{-1} \\|u\\|_{H^s_{ψ,ω}}$, which rigorously connects abstract spectral energy to the pointwise decay induced by the weight $ω$. This framework provides a unified geometric characterization of several fractional regimes, including the Hadamard and Riemann-Liouville cases, within a single operator-theoretic architecture."

    "abstract": "Public debate on the alleged decline of language skills among younger generations often focuses on university students, the most highly educated segment of the population. Rather than addressing the ill posed question of linguistic decline, this paper examines how formal written Italian is currently used by university students and whether systematic patterns of competence and heterogeneity can be identified. The analysis is based on data from the UniversITA project, which collected formal texts written by a large and nationally representative sample of Italian university students. Texts were annotated for linguistically motivated features covering orthography, lexicon, syntax, morphosyntax, coherence, register, and sentence structure, yielding low frequency multivariate count data. To analyse these data, we propose a novel model-based clustering approach based on a Poisson factor mixture model that accounts for dependence among linguistic features and unobserved population heterogeneity. The results identify two correlated dimensions of writing competence, interpretable as communicative competence and linguistic grammatical competence. When educational and socio demographic information is incorporated, distinct student profiles emerge that are associated with field of study and educational background. These findings provide quantitative evidence on contemporary writing and offer insights relevant for language education and higher education policy."

    "abstract": "Handcrafted optimizers become prohibitively inefficient for complex black-box optimization (BBO) tasks. MetaBBO addresses this challenge by meta-learning to automatically configure optimizers for low-level BBO tasks, thereby eliminating heuristic dependencies. However, existing methods typically require extensive handcrafted training tasks to learn meta-strategies that generalize to target tasks, which poses a critical limitation for realistic applications with unknown task distributions. To overcome the issue, we propose the Adaptive meta Black-box Optimization Model (ABOM), which performs online parameter adaptation using solely optimization data from the target task, obviating the need for predefined task distributions. Unlike conventional metaBBO frameworks that decouple meta-training and optimization phases, ABOM introduces a closed-loop adaptive parameter learning mechanism, where parameterized evolutionary operators continuously self-update by leveraging generated populations during optimization. This paradigm shift enables zero-shot optimization: ABOM achieves competitive performance on synthetic BBO benchmarks and realistic unmanned aerial vehicle path planning problems without any handcrafted training tasks. Visualization studies reveal that parameterized evolutionary operators exhibit statistically significant search patterns, including natural selection and genetic recombination."

Leveraging this abstraction, we present ScaleSim, a memory-efficient LLM serving system for large-scale multi-agent simulations.

Numerous protocols exist for benchmarking devices before running actual algorithms. In this work, we show that both physical and logical errors of fault-tolerant circuits can even be characterized in-situ using syndrome data. To achieve this, we map general fault-tolerant Clifford circuits to subsystem codes using the spacetime code formalism and develop a scheme for estimating Pauli noise in Clifford circuits using syndrome data. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for the learnability of physical and logical noise from given syndrome data, and show that we can accurately predict logical fidelities from the same data. Importantly, our approach requires only a polynomial sample size, even when the logical error rate is exponentially suppressed by the code distance, and thus gives an exponential advantage against methods that use only logical data such as direct fidelity estimation. We demonstrate the practical applicability of our methods in various scenarios using synthetic data as well as the experimental data from a recent demonstration of fault-tolerant circuits by Bluvstein et al. [Nature 626, 7997 (2024)]. Our methods provide an efficient, in-situ way of characterizing a fault-tolerant quantum computer to help gate calibration, improve decoding accuracy, and verify logical circuits."

Existing detection studies mainly focus on manually edited speech with explicit splicing artifacts, and therefore struggle to cope with emerging end-to-end neural speech editing techniques that generate seamless acoustic transitions. To address this challenge, we first construct a large-scale bilingual dataset, AiEdit, which leverages large language models to drive precise semantic tampering logic and employs multiple advanced neural speech editing methods for data synthesis, thereby filling the gap of high-quality speech editing datasets. Building upon this foundation, we propose PELM (Prior-Enhanced Audio Large Language Model), the first large-model framework that unifies speech editing detection and content localization by formulating them as an audio question answering task. To mitigate the inherent forgery bias and semantic-priority bias observed in existing audio large models, PELM incorporates word-level probability priors to provide explicit acoustic cues, and further designs a centroid-aggregation-based acoustic consistency perception loss to explicitly enforce the modeling of subtle local distribution anomalies. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that PELM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both the HumanEdit and AiEdit datasets, achieving equal error rates (EER) of 0.57\\% and 9.28\\% (localization), respectively."

While current models effectively capture character tones and knowledge, simulating the inner thoughts behind their behaviors remains a challenge. Towards cognitive simulation in LLM role-play, previous efforts mainly suffer from two deficiencies: data with high-quality reasoning traces, and reliable reward signals aligned with human preferences. In this paper, we propose HER, a unified framework for cognitive-level persona simulation. HER introduces dual-layer thinking, which distinguishes characters' first-person thinking from LLMs' third-person thinking. To bridge these gaps, we curate reasoning-augmented role-playing data via reverse engineering and construct human-aligned principles and reward models.

Notably, our models significantly outperform the Qwen3-32B baseline, achieving a 30.26 improvement on the CoSER benchmark and a 14.97 gain on the Minimax Role-Play Bench.

Effective integration of 4D radar with cameras requires accurate extrinsic calibration, and the development of radar-based perception algorithms demands large-scale annotated datasets. However, existing calibration methods often employ separate targets optimized for either visual or radar modalities, complicating correspondence establishment. Furthermore, manually labeling sparse radar data is labor-intensive and unreliable. To address these challenges, we propose 4D-CAAL, a unified framework for 4D radar-camera calibration and auto-labeling. Our approach introduces a novel dual-purpose calibration target design, integrating a checkerboard pattern on the front surface for camera detection and a corner reflector at the center of the back surface for radar detection. We develop a robust correspondence matching algorithm that aligns the checkerboard center with the strongest radar reflection point, enabling accurate extrinsic calibration. Subsequently, we present an auto-labeling pipeline that leverages the calibrated sensor relationship to transfer annotations from camera-based segmentations to radar point clouds through geometric projection and multi-feature optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves high calibration accuracy while significantly reducing manual annotation effort, thereby accelerating the development of robust multi-modal perception systems for autonomous driving."

Motivation for the first objective comes from Conway and Coxeter's modelling of positive integer friezes using triangulated polygons, which has received significant attention since the discovery of cluster algebras by Fomin and Zelevinsky in 2002. Assem, Reutenauer, and Smith introduced $\\text{SL}_2$-tilings as generalisations of friezes, and Bessenrodt, Holm, and Jørgensen classified positive integer $\\text{SL}_2$-tilings using infinite triangulated polygons. Here we consider $N$-tilings, of which $\\text{SL}_2$-tilings are the case $N=1$. We provide a geometric model for all tame integer $N$-tilings using a generalisation of the Farey graph in the hyperbolic plane. Highlights of this model include classifications of all positive integer $N$-tilings and of all quiddity sequences of positive rational friezes using triangulated polygons. The second objective is motivated by Bhargava's celebrated study of binary quadratic forms using integer cubes and by an observation of Demonet et al.\\ that there is essentially only one three-dimensional positive integer tiling with $\\text{SL}_2$ cross sections. We consider a richer class of three-dimensional tilings, which we call hypertilings, using the Cayley hyperdeterminant. We classify all tame integer hypertilings using generalised Farey graphs; remarkably, those with Cayley hyperdeterminant 1 prove to have a simple description in terms of triple Hadamard products of integer pairs."

Our method employs carefully designed prompts incorporating class labels and domain context to produce high-quality captions tailored for classification tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a supervised contrastive loss function that explicitly encourages clustering of same-class representations during fine-tuning, along with a new inference technique that leverages class-averaged text embeddings from multiple synthetic captions per image. Extensive experiments across 13 image classification benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms baseline methods, with particularly significant improvements in few-shot learning scenarios.

The productivity of this method is ensured by record-breaking spatial resolution and full sensitivity to relativistic fragments. According to invariant masses calculated on the basis of precise data of emission angles in the extremely narrow fragmentation cone, the contributions of the decays of $^8$Be(0$^+$), $^8$Be(2$^+$), $^9$Be(1.7), $^9$B, $^6$Be, $^{12}$C(0$^+_2$) or the Hoyle state and $^{12}$C(3$^-$) have been identified now. The increase in the contribution of $^8$Be(0$^+$) with the multiplicity of accompanying $α$-particles, followed by $^9$B and $^{12}$C(0$^+_2$), has been established. The structure of these states and the diversity of parent nuclei without the influence of the initial energy assume the coalescence of $α$-particles and nucleons which appear in dissociation. The initial density and duration of the secondary interaction of the latter may be sufficient up to the lowest-energy fusion reactions. Such a scenario requires low-energy physics concepts to interpret the relativistic fragmentation. The usage of automated microscopy for the analysis of irradiation beams from the JINR NICA accelerator complex becomes a modern basis to apply the nuclear emulsion method which has become fundamental in the physics of the micro-world. Having become observable since the pioneering era of cosmic ray physics fragmentation, the events of relativistic nuclei in nuclear emulsions highlight the potential of this method to study extremely cold ensembles of H and He nuclei, thereby advancing the physics of nuclear clustering and, potentially, expanding nuclear astrophysics."

However, a formal explanation of why the optimal target depends on the specific properties of the data remains elusive. In this work, we provide a theoretical framework based on a generalized prediction formulation that accommodates arbitrary output targets, of which $\\varepsilon$-, v-, and x-prediction are special cases. We derive the analytical relationship between data's geometry and the optimal prediction target, offering a rigorous justification for why x-prediction becomes superior when the ambient dimension significantly exceeds the data's intrinsic dimension. Furthermore, while our theory identifies dimensionality as the governing factor for the optimal prediction target, the intrinsic dimension of manifold-bound data is typically intractable to estimate in practice. To bridge this gap, we propose k-Diff, a framework that employs a data-driven approach to learn the optimal prediction parameter k directly from data, bypassing the need for explicit dimension estimation. Extensive experiments in both latent-space and pixel-space image generation demonstrate that k-Diff consistently outperforms fixed-target baselines across varying architectures and data scales, providing a principled and automated approach to enhancing generative performance."

    "abstract": "This work investigates the origin of the TeV emission detected by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) from NGC 4278, a galaxy hosting a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (LLAGN). Considering two plausible scenarios, AGN jets and winds, we model the X-ray, GeV, and TeV emission during both TeV-low (quasi-quiet) and TeV-high (active) states. The spectral energy distributions can be explained either by single-zone leptonic emission from moderately relativistic jets or by lepto-hadronic emission from sub-relativistic winds. The best-fit parameters suggest that the transition from the quasi-quiet to the active state may be driven jointly by an enhanced accretion rate and the expansion of jets or winds. We further show that future MeV and very-high-energy $γ$-ray observations can discriminate between the {leptonic and lepto-hadronic scenarios}. Although the neutrino flux from NGC~1068 predicted by the wind model is too low to be detected with current neutrino observatories, a lepto-hadronic wind scenario can account for the PeV diffuse neutrino background when adopting a local LLAGN density corrected for the TeV duty cycle, $n_{\\rm L,0}(ΔT_{\\rm TeV}/T) \\sim 10^{-5}~\\rm Mpc^{-3}$, as inferred from the LHAASO detection."

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of video generation models such as Veo and Wan, the visual quality of synthetic content has reached a level where macro-level semantic errors and temporal inconsistencies are no longer prominent. However, this does not imply that the distinction between real and cutting-edge high-fidelity fake is untraceable. We argue that AI-generated videos are essentially products of a manifold-fitting process rather than a physical recording. Consequently, the pixel composition logic of consecutive adjacent frames residual in AI videos exhibits a structured and homogenous characteristic. We term this phenomenon `Manifold Projection Fluctuations' (MPF). Driven by this insight, we propose a hierarchical dual-path framework that operates as a sequential filtering process. The first, the Static Manifold Deviation Branch, leverages the refined perceptual boundaries of Large-Scale Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to capture residual spatial anomalies or physical violations that deviate from the natural real-world manifold (off-manifold). For the remaining high-fidelity videos that successfully reside on-manifold and evade spatial detection, we introduce the Micro-Temporal Fluctuation Branch as a secondary, fine-grained filter. By analyzing the structured MPF that persists even in visually perfect sequences, our framework ensures that forgeries are exposed regardless of whether they manifest as global real-world manifold deviations or subtle computational fingerprints."

Their ultimate aspiration is to create a cycle where understanding and generation mutually reinforce each other. While recent post-training methods have successfully leveraged understanding to enhance generation, the reverse direction of utilizing generation to improve understanding remains largely unexplored. In this work, we propose UniMRG (Unified Multi-Representation Generation), a simple yet effective architecture-agnostic post-training method. UniMRG enhances the understanding capabilities of UMMs by incorporating auxiliary generation tasks. Specifically, we train UMMs to generate multiple intrinsic representations of input images, namely pixel (reconstruction), depth (geometry), and segmentation (structure), alongside standard visual understanding objectives. By synthesizing these diverse representations, UMMs capture complementary information regarding appearance, spatial relations, and structural layout. Consequently, UMMs develop a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of visual inputs. Extensive experiments across diverse UMM architectures demonstrate that our method notably enhances fine-grained perception, reduces hallucinations, and improves spatial understanding, while simultaneously boosting generation capabilities."

Furthermore, steering acts as a witness to battery population balance and a consumable that enhances extractable work. Additionally, we discuss the contribution of the steering potential to energy upon high-dissipation charging in details. These findings establish a novel indicator for monitoring QB energy variations, which will be beneficial to achieve the high-performance quantum batteries."

    "abstract": "In the last few years, energy efficiency has become a challenge. Not only mitigating environmental impact but reducing energy waste can lead to financial advantages. Buildings play an important role in this: they are among the biggest consumers. So, finding manners to reduce energy consumption is a way to minimise energy waste, and a technique for that is creating Demand Response (DR) strategies. This paper proposes a novel way to decrease computational effort of simulating the behaviour of a building using surrogate models based on active learning. Before going straight to the problem of a building, which is complex and computationally costly, the paper proposes the approach of active learning to a smaller problem: with reduced simulations, regress the curve of voltage versus current of a thermo-resistor. Then, the paper implements a surrogate model of energy consumption of a building. The goal is to be able to learn the consumption pattern based on a limited number of simulations. The result given by the surrogate can be used to set the reference temperature, maximising the PV self-consumption, and reducing energy usage from the grid. Thanks to the surrogate, the total time spent to map all possible consumption scenarios is reduced around 7 times."

We leverage this enhanced coupling for experimentally feasible protocols in coherent qubit control and towards the nondestructive readout and projective control of the electron beam's quantum-number statistics.

With ever-growing onboard computing and storage resources, LEO satellites herald a new cloud paradigm: space cloud computing. While container or chestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes) excel in terrestrial data centers, they are ill-suited to LEO satellite networks, featuring geographic dispersion and frequent handovers. Those features bring high latency and intermittent management, leading to control plane failure in container orchestration. To address this, we propose KubeSpace, a low-latency and stable control plane specifically designed for container orchestration on LEO satellites. KubeSpace combines two key innovations: a distributed ground-control-node architecture that binds each satellite to its nearest controller for uninterrupted management, and an orbit-aware placement with dynamic assignment strategy that further minimizes communication latency and handover frequency. Extensive experiments based on real satellite traces demonstrate that compared to existing solutions, KubeSpace reduces the average management latency of satellite nodes by 59% without any management interruption time."

    "abstract": "AI-assisted programming tools are widely adopted, yet their practical utility is often undermined by undesired suggestions that interrupt developer workflows and cause frustration. While existing research has explored developer-AI interactions when programming qualitatively, a significant gap remains in quantitative analysis of developers' acceptance of AI-generated code suggestions, partly because the necessary fine-grained interaction data is often proprietary. To bridge this gap, this paper conducts an empirical study using 66,329 industrial developer-AI interactions from a large technology company. We analyze features that are significantly different between accepted code suggestions and rejected ones. We find that accepted suggestions are characterized by significantly higher historical acceptance counts and ratios for both developers and projects, longer generation intervals, shorter preceding code context in the project, and older IDE versions. Based on these findings, we introduce CSAP (Code Suggestion Acceptance Prediction) to predict whether a developer will accept the code suggestion before it is displayed. Our evaluation of CSAP shows that it achieves the accuracy of 0.973 and 0.922 on imbalanced and balanced dataset respectively. Compared to a large language model baseline and an in-production industrial filter, CSAP relatively improves the accuracy by 12.6\\% and 69.5\\% on imbalanced dataset, and improves the accuracy by 87.0\\% and 140.1\\% on balanced dataset. Our results demonstrate that targeted personalization is a powerful approach for filtering out code suggestions with predicted rejection and reduce developer interruption. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first quantitative study of code suggestion acceptance on large-scale industrial data, and this work also sheds light on an important research direction of AI-assisted programming."

The analysis uses proton--proton collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 140 fb$^{-1}$, recorded by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider between 2015 and 2018. The search targets hypothetical dimuon resonances in the invariant mass range from 35 GeV to 75 GeV. The modelling of this mass region is particularly challenging for conventional analytic background parameterisations. To address this, a Gaussian process regression technique is used to model the background. The dimuon mass spectrum is analysed for potential signals, and no statistically significant excess is observed. Upper limits at the 95% confidence level are set on the fiducial production cross-section of new resonances decaying promptly into muons, ranging from 20 fb to 110 fb, depending on the resonance mass. These results are further interpreted in the context of dark-photon and dark-matter-mediator models, leading to new constraints on their parameter spaces."

In this paper, we propose PRISM, a simple and efficient framework for RCA when the dependency graph is absent. We formulate a class of component-based systems under which PRISM performs RCA with theoretical guarantees. On 735 failures across 9 real-world datasets, PRISM achieves 68% Top-1 accuracy, a 258% improvement over the best baseline, while requiring only 8ms per diagnosis."

From the temperature and pressure dependence of the AC susceptibility, the superconducting transition temperature $T_{\\mathrm{c}}$ and the upper critical field $H_{\\mathrm{c2}}$ were estimated. The results deviate from the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg model but are well described by $H_{\\mathrm{c2}}(T)=H_{\\mathrm{c2}}(0)[1-T/T_{\\mathrm{c}}]^α$. The latter fit yields $H_{\\mathrm{c2}}(0)=1.50$~T, $T_{\\mathrm{c}}=3.81$K, and $α=1.1$ at 2.17GPa, suggesting that the superconductivity lies in a strong-coupling regime. Since the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate divided by temperature, $1/T_1T$, follows the Korringa relation at ambient pressure, the increase in $1/T_1T$ with pressure up to approximately 0.7~GPa indicates an increase in the density of states (DOS), $N(E_\\mathrm F)$. This trend mirrors the pressure dependence of $T_{\\mathrm{c}}$ in the low-pressure region, consistent with the BCS mechanism. Above 0.7~GPa, however, $N(E_\\mathrm F)$ slightly decreases while $T_{\\mathrm{c}}$ continues to rise, suggesting an additional pairing contribution beyond the conventional BCS picture. In the 1T$^{\\prime}$ phase at 2.17~GPa, the absence of a coherence peak in $1/T_1T$ around $T_{\\mathrm c}$, accompanied by a two-step decrease just below $T_{\\mathrm c}$, was observed, which may be a signature of unconventional superconductivity."

    "abstract": "A reliable reward model is essential for aligning large language models with human preferences through reinforcement learning from human feedback. However, standard reward models are susceptible to spurious features that are not causally related to human labels. This can lead to reward hacking, where high predicted reward does not translate into better behavior. In this work, we address this problem from a causal perspective by proposing a factored representation learning framework that decomposes the model's contextual embedding into (1) causal factors that are sufficient for reward prediction and (2) non-causal factors that capture reward-irrelevant attributes such as length or sycophantic bias. The reward head is then constrained to depend only on the causal component. In addition, we introduce an adversarial head trained to predict reward from the non-causal factors, while applying gradient reversal to discourage them from encoding reward-relevant information. Experiments on both mathematical and dialogue tasks demonstrate that our method learns more robust reward models and consistently improves downstream RLHF performance over state-of-the-art baselines. Analyses on length and sycophantic bias further validate the effectiveness of our method in mitigating reward hacking behaviors."

This mismatch is particularly problematic for dysarthric speech, where articulatory imprecision and disfluencies can cause severe semantic distortions. To bridge this gap, we introduce a Large Language Model (LLM)-based agent for post-ASR correction: a Judge-Editor over the top-k ASR hypotheses that keeps high-confidence spans, rewrites uncertain segments, and operates in both zero-shot and fine-tuned modes. In parallel, we release SAP-Hypo5, the largest benchmark for dysarthric speech correction, to enable reproducibility and future exploration. Under multi-perspective evaluation, our agent achieves a 14.51% WER reduction alongside substantial semantic gains, including a +7.59 pp improvement in MENLI and +7.66 pp in Slot Micro F1 on challenging samples. Our analysis further reveals that WER is highly sensitive to domain shift, whereas semantic metrics correlate more closely with downstream task performance."

To this end, we propose Semantic-Guided Dynamic Sparsification (SGDS), a novel method that proactively guides the activation space by governing the orientation and rank of its subspaces through targeted sparsification. Specifically, SGDS promotes knowledge transfer by encouraging similar classes to share a compact activation subspace, while simultaneously preventing interference by assigning non-overlapping activation subspaces to dissimilar classes. By sculpting class-specific sparse subspaces in the activation space, SGDS effectively mitigates interference without imposing rigid constraints on the parameter space. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of SGDS."

While Huber (linear-vacuous) contamination is a classical minimal-assumption model for an $\\varepsilon$-fraction of arbitrary perturbations, including it in an ambiguity set can make the worst-case risk infinite and the DRO objective vacuous unless one imposes strong boundedness or support assumptions. We address these challenges by introducing bulk-calibrated credal ambiguity sets: we learn a high-mass bulk set from data while considering contamination inside the bulk and bounding the remaining tail contribution separately. This leads to a closed-form, finite $\\mathrm{mean}+\\sup$ robust objective and tractable linear or second-order cone programs for common losses and bulk geometries. Through this framework, we highlight and exploit the equivalence between the imprecise probability (IP) notion of upper expectation and the worst-case risk, demonstrating how IP credal sets translate into DRO objectives with interpretable tolerance levels. Experiments on heavy-tailed inventory control, geographically shifted house-price regression, and demographically shifted text classification show competitive robustness-accuracy trade-offs and efficient optimisation times, using Bayesian, frequentist, or empirical reference distributions."

To enable truly efficient and seamless door-to-door travel experiences, UAM requires close integration with existing ground transportation infrastructure. However, current research on optimal integrated routing strategies for passengers in air-ground mobility systems remains limited, with a lack of systematic exploration.To address this gap, we first propose a unified optimization model that integrates strategy selection for both air and ground transportation. This model captures the dynamic characteristics of multimodal transport networks and incorporates real-time traffic conditions alongside passenger decision-making behavior. Building on this model, we propose a Unified Air-Ground Mobility Coordination (UAGMC) framework, which leverages deep reinforcement learning (RL) and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication to optimize vertiport selection and dynamically plan air taxi routes. Experimental results demonstrate that UAGMC achieves a 34\\% reduction in average travel time compared to conventional proportional allocation methods, enhancing overall travel efficiency and providing novel insights into the integration and optimization of multimodal transportation systems.

The central objective is to leverage the source data and the unlabeled target data to build models that generalize to the target domain. Despite its potential, existing UDA approaches often struggle in practice, particularly in scenarios where the target domain offers only limited unlabeled data or spurious correlations dominate the source domain. To address these challenges, we propose a novel distributionally robust learning framework that models uncertainty in both the covariate distribution and the conditional label distribution. Our approach is motivated by the multi-source domain adaptation setting but is also directly applicable to the single-source scenario, making it versatile in practice.

Standard noise filtering approaches, whether treating individual edges one-by-one or assuming a uniform global noise level, are suboptimal, because in reality both signal and noise can be heterogeneous and correlated across multiple edges. As a solution, we introduce the Network Wiener Filter, a principled method for collective edge-level noise filtering that leverages both network topology and noise characteristics, to reduce error in the observed edge weights and to infer missing edge weights. We demonstrate the broad practical efficacy of the Network Wiener Filter in two distinct settings, the genetic interaction network of the yeast S. cerevisiae and the Enron Corpus email network, noting compelling evidence of successful noise suppression in both applications. With the Network Wiener Filter, we advocate for a shift toward error-aware network science, one that embraces data imperfection as an inherent feature and learns to navigate it effectively."

    "abstract": "Accurate antenna affiliation identification is crucial for optimizing and maintaining communication networks. Current practice, however, relies on the cumbersome and error-prone process of manual tower inspections. We propose a novel paradigm shift that fuses video footage of base stations, antenna geometric features, and Physical Cell Identity (PCI) signals, transforming antenna affiliation identification into multi-modal classification and matching tasks. Publicly available pretrained transformers struggle with this unique task due to a lack of analogous data in the communications domain, which hampers cross-modal alignment. To address this, we introduce a dedicated training framework that aligns antenna images with corresponding PCI signals. To tackle the representation alignment challenge, we propose a novel Token Entropy Regularization module in the pretraining stage. Our experiments demonstrate that TER accelerates convergence and yields significant performance gains. Further analysis reveals that the entropy of the first token is modality-dependent. Code will be made available upon publication."

However, the development of violet and ultraviolet light-emitting MHPs has lagged behind due to challenges related to material and device stability, charge carrier transport, tunability into the ultraviolet spectrum, toxicity, and scalability. Here, we review the progress of both violet and ultraviolet MHP nanomaterials and light-emitting diodes, including materials synthesis and device fabrication across various crystal structures and dimensions (e.g., bulk thin films, 2D thin films, nanoplatelets, colloidal nanocrystals, and more) as well as lead-free platforms (e.g., rare-earth metal halide perovskites). By highlighting several pathways to continue the development of violet and ultraviolet light-emitting MHPs while also proposing tactics to overcome their outstanding challenges, we demonstrate the potential of state-of-the-art violet and ultraviolet MHP materials and devices for important applications in public health, 3D printing, nanofabrication, and more."

Traditional 2D video compression techniques fail to preserve fine-grained geometric and appearance details, while implicit neural rendering methods like NeRF suffer from prohibitive computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight, high-fidelity, low-bitrate 3D talking face compression framework that integrates FLAME-based parametric modeling with 3DGS neural rendering. Our approach transmits only essential facial metadata in real time, enabling efficient reconstruction with a Gaussian-based head model. Additionally, we introduce a compact representation and compression scheme, including Gaussian attribute compression and MLP optimization, to enhance transmission efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior rate-distortion performance, delivering high-quality facial rendering at extremely low bitrates, making it well-suited for real-time 3D video conferencing applications."

Unlike classical filters, which rely on explicit knowledge of system dynamics and noise models, neural estimators can be trained purely from data without access to the underlying system equations. In this work, we present a systematic empirical comparison between such model-free neural network models and classical filtering methods across multiple nonlinear scenarios. Our study evaluates Transformer-based models, state-space neural networks, and recurrent architectures alongside particle filters and nonlinear Kalman filters. The results show that neural models (in particular, state-space models (SSMs)) achieve state estimation performance that approaches strong nonlinear Kalman filters in nonlinear scenarios and outperform weaker classical baselines despite lacking access to system models, while also attaining substantially higher inference throughput."

    "abstract": "In time-critical eXtended reality (XR) scenarios where users must rapidly reorient their attention to hazards, alerts, or instructions while engaged in a primary task, spatial audio can provide an immediate directional cue without occupying visual bandwidth. However, such scenarios can afford only a brief auditory exposure, requiring users to interpret sound direction quickly and without extended listening or head-driven refinement. This paper reports a controlled exploratory study of rapid spatial-audio localization in XR. Using HRTF-rendered broadband stimuli presented from a semi-dense set of directions around the listener, we quantify how accurately users can infer coarse direction from brief audio alone. We further examine the effects of short-term visuo-auditory feedback training as a lightweight calibration mechanism. Our findings show that brief spatial cues can convey coarse directional information, and that even short calibration can improve users' perception of aural signals. While these results highlight the potential of spatial audio for rapid attention guidance, they also show that auditory cues alone may not provide sufficient precision for complex or high-stakes tasks, and that spatial audio may be most effective when complemented by other sensory modalities or visual cues, without relying on head-driven refinement. We leverage this study on spatial audio as a preliminary investigation into a first-stage attention-guidance channel for wearable XR (e.g., VR head-mounted displays and AR smart glasses), and provide design insights on stimulus selection and calibration for time-critical use."

We propose Zero-Shot Statistical Downscaling (ZSSD), a zero-shot framework that performs statistical downscaling without paired data during training. ZSSD leverages a Physics-Consistent Climate Prior learned from reanalysis data, conditioned on geophysical boundaries and temporal information to enforce physical validity. Furthermore, to enable robust inference across varying GCMs, we introduce Unified Coordinate Guidance. This strategy addresses the vanishing gradient problem in vanilla DPS and ensures consistency with large-scale fields. Results show that ZSSD significantly outperforms existing zero-shot baselines in 99th percentile errors and successfully reconstructs complex weather events, such as tropical cyclones, across heterogeneous GCMs."

    "abstract": "Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) presents a core challenge: grounding high-level linguistic instructions into precise, safe, and long-horizon spatial actions. Explicit topological maps have proven to be a vital solution for providing robust spatial memory in such tasks. However, existing topological planning methods suffer from a \"Granularity Rigidity\" problem. Specifically, these methods typically rely on fixed geometric thresholds to sample nodes, which fails to adapt to varying environmental complexities. This rigidity leads to a critical mismatch: the model tends to over-sample in simple areas, causing computational redundancy, while under-sampling in high-uncertainty regions, increasing collision risks and compromising precision. To address this, we propose DGNav, a framework for Dynamic Topological Navigation, introducing a context-aware mechanism to modulate map density and connectivity on-the-fly. Our approach comprises two core innovations: (1) A Scene-Aware Adaptive Strategy that dynamically modulates graph construction thresholds based on the dispersion of predicted waypoints, enabling \"densification on demand\" in challenging environments; (2) A Dynamic Graph Transformer that reconstructs graph connectivity by fusing visual, linguistic, and geometric cues into dynamic edge weights, enabling the agent to filter out topological noise and enhancing instruction adherence. Extensive experiments on the R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmarks demonstrate DGNav exhibits superior navigation performance and strong generalization capabilities. Furthermore, ablation studies confirm that our framework achieves an optimal trade-off between navigation efficiency and safe exploration.

Our approach aligns the MIDI encoder MusicBERT and Llama-3-8B via a two-stage pipeline comprising feature alignment and instruction tuning. To support training, we design a scalable annotation pipeline that annotates GiantMIDI-Piano with fine-grained metadata, resulting in a MIDI-text dataset. Compared with the baseline trained on converting MIDI into ABC notation under the same instruction-tuning procedure, MIDI-LLaMA substantially outperforms in captioning and semantic alignment in question answering. Human evaluation further confirms the advantages of MIDI-LLaMA in music understanding, emotion recognition, creativity, and overall preference. These findings demonstrate that incorporating symbolic music into large language models enhances their capacity for musical understanding."

Our measurements reveal that, at elevated temperatures (T > 100 mK), vortices enter the superconducting leads via classical thermal activation over energy barriers. At lower temperatures (T < 90 mK), we observe macroscopic quantum tunneling through these barriers. The data are consistent with a sharp, first-order type quantum-to-classical transition. From our measurements, we extract vortex entry and exit energy barriers on the order of a few Kelvin and estimate the barrier thickness to be approximately 100 nm, corresponding to about one tenth of the device width."

To address this, we propose Central Entity-Guided Graph Optimization for Community Detection (CE-GOCD), a method that augments LLMs' scientific question answering by explicitly modeling and leveraging semantic substructures within academic knowledge graphs. Our approach operates by: (1) leveraging paper titles as central entities for targeted subgraph retrieval, (2) enhancing implicit semantic discovery via subgraph pruning and completion, and (3) applying community detection to distill coherent paper groups with shared themes. We evaluated the proposed method on three NLP literature-based question-answering datasets, and the results demonstrate its superiority over other retrieval-augmented baseline approaches, confirming the effectiveness of our framework."

    "abstract": "Pretraining directly on web-scale corpora is the de facto paradigm for building language models. We study an alternative setting where the model is initially exposed to abstract structured data, as a means to ease the subsequent acquisition of rich semantic knowledge, much like humans learn simple logic and mathematics before higher reasoning. We specifically focus on procedural data, generated by formal languages and other simple algorithms, as such abstract data. We first diagnose the algorithmic skills that different forms of procedural data can improve, often significantly. For example, on context recall (Needle-in-a-haystack), the accuracy jumps from 10 to 98% when pretraining on Dyck sequences (balanced brackets). Second, we study how these gains are reflected in pretraining larger models (up to 1.3B). We find that front-loading as little as 0.1% procedural data significantly outperforms standard pretraining on natural language, code, and informal mathematics (C4, CodeParrot, and DeepMind-Math datasets). Notably, this procedural pretraining enables the models to reach the same loss value with only 55, 67, 86% of the original data. Third, we explore the mechanisms behind and find that procedural pretraining instils non-trivial structure in both attention and MLP layers. The former is particularly important for structured domains (e.g. code), and the latter for language. Finally, we lay a path for combining multiple forms of procedural data. Our results show that procedural pretraining is a simple, lightweight means to improving performance and accelerating language model pretraining, ultimately suggesting the promise of disentangling knowledge acquisition from reasoning in LLMs."

    "abstract": "Data-driven equation discovery aims to reconstruct governing equations directly from empirical observations. A fundamental challenge in this domain is the ill-posed nature of the inverse problem, where multiple distinct mathematical models may yield similar errors, thus complicating model selection and failing to guarantee a unique representation of the underlying mechanisms. This issue can be addressed by incorporating inductive biases to constrain the search space and discard the undesirable models. The characteristic curves-based (CCs) framework offers a modular approach ideally suited to this aim. This approach is based on the specification of structural families that possess provable identifiability properties. Crucially, this framework enables practitioners to embed domain expertise directly into the learning process and facilitates the integration of diverse post-processing tools. In this work, we build upon the recent neural network implementation of this formalism (NN-CC), which benefits from the universal approximation capabilities of NNs. Specifically, we extend NN-CC by introducing two inductive biases: (i) symmetry constraints and (ii) post-processing with symbolic regression. Using a chaotic Duffing oscillator and a discontinuous stick-slip model under varying Gaussian noise levels, we show how these extensions systematically improve the discovery process. We also analyze the integration of sparse and symbolic regression (using SINDy and PySR) into the CC-based formalism. These extensions (SINDy-CC and SR-CC) consistently show improvements as prior information is incorporated. By enabling the integration of prior or hypothesized knowledge into the learning and post-processing stages, the CC-based formalism emerges as a promising candidate to address identifiability issues in purely data-driven methods, advancing the goal of interpretable and reliable system identification."

    "abstract": "Decoders are a critical component of fault-tolerant quantum computing. They must identify errors based on syndrome measurements to correct quantum states. While finding the optimal correction is NP-hard and thus extremely difficult, approximate decoders with faster runtime often rely on uncontrolled heuristics. In this work, we propose a family of hierarchical quantum decoders with a tunable trade-off between speed and accuracy while retaining guarantees of optimality. We use the Lasserre Sum-of-Squares (SOS) hierarchy from optimization theory to relax the decoding problem. This approach creates a sequence of Semidefinite Programs (SDPs). Lower levels of the hierarchy are faster but approximate, while higher levels are slower but more accurate. We demonstrate that even low levels of this hierarchy significantly outperform standard Linear Programming relaxations. Our results on rotated surface codes and honeycomb color codes show that the SOS decoder approaches the performance of exact decoding. We find that Levels 2 and 3 of our hierarchy perform nearly as well as the exact solver. We analyze the convergence using rank-loop criteria and compare the method against other relaxation schemes. This work bridges the gap between fast heuristics and rigorous optimal decoding."

Traditionally, this space is a subspace of a fixed ambient reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), determined solely by the chosen kernel and the dataset, whose elements identify the basis elements. Consequently, the projection operator underlying the kernel method depends on the loss function, the dataset, and the choice of ambient RKHS. In this study, we consider kernel methods whose solution spaces also depend on learnable parameters that are independent of the dataset. The resulting methods can be viewed as variable projection operators that depend on the loss function, the dataset, and the new learnable parameters instead of a fixed RKHS. This work has two main contributions. First, we propose an efficient approximation of kernels associated with infinite-dimensional RKHSs, commonly used to reduce the solution-space dimension for large datasets. Second, we construct fixed-dimensional, parameter-dependent solution spaces that enable highly efficient kernel models suitable for large-scale problems without the need to approximate kernels of infinite-dimensional RKHSs. Our novel family of adaptive kernel methods generalizes earlier approaches, including Random Fourier Features, and we demonstrate their effectiveness through several numerical experiments."

Meanwhile, the collected data may be corrupted due to sensor or transmission failure, or it may not have sufficient resolution for downstream tasks. A wide range of generative tasks is formulated to address these issues, including synthetic data generation, missing data imputation, and super-resolution. Despite the success of machine learning models on these tasks, dedicated models need to be designed and trained for each task, leading to redundancy and inefficiency. In this paper, by recognizing the powerful modeling capability of flow matching models, we propose a new approach to unify diverse smart meter data generative tasks with a single model trained for conditional generation. The proposed flow matching models are trained to generate challenging, high-dimensional time series data, specifically monthly smart meter data at a 15 min resolution. By viewing different generative tasks as distinct forms of partial data observations and injecting them into the generation process, we unify tasks such as imputation and super-resolution with a single model, eliminating the need for re-training. The data generated by our model not only are consistent with the given observations but also remain realistic, showing better performance against interpolation and other machine learning based baselines dedicated to the tasks."

Existing neuron-editing mitigation strategies often struggle to handle such situation and most of them lack flexibility and tend to distort feature representations. Motivated by such over-attention phenomenon and software engineering paradigms such as delta debugging and hot patching, we propose AtPatch, a hot-fix method that dynamically redistributes attention maps during model inference. Specifically, for a given input, AtPatch first extracts the attention map from the model's inference process. Then, it uses a pre-trained detector to identify anomalous columns and replace them with unified benign attention. Then, AtPatch rescales other columns to mitigate the impact of over-attention. Finally, AtPatch returns the redistributed attention map to the model for continued inference. Notably, if the detector does not report any anomalous columns, AtPatch directly returns the original attention map to the model. Unlike existing techniques, AtPatch selectively redistributes the attention map, making it better at preserving the model's original functionality. Furthermore, AtPatch's on-the-fly nature allows it to work without modifying model parameters or retraining, making it better suited for deployed models. We conducted extensive experiments to validate AtPatch. Experimental results show that, compared to existing methods, AtPatch can more effectively mitigate backdoor attacks and unfairness while better preserving the model's original functionality."

Enabling end-to-end chart editing according to user intent is of great practical value, yet remains challenging due to the need for both fine-grained control and global structural consistency. Most existing approaches adopt pipeline-based designs, where natural language or code serves as an intermediate representation, limiting their ability to faithfully execute complex edits. We introduce ChartE$^{3}$, an End-to-End Chart Editing benchmark that directly evaluates models without relying on intermediate natural language programs or code-level supervision. ChartE$^{3}$ focuses on two complementary editing dimensions: local editing, which involves fine-grained appearance changes such as font or color adjustments, and global editing, which requires holistic, data-centric transformations including data filtering and trend line addition. ChartE$^{3}$ contains over 1,200 high-quality samples constructed via a well-designed data pipeline with human curation. Each sample is provided as a triplet of a chart image, its underlying code, and a multimodal editing instruction, enabling evaluation from both objective and subjective perspectives. Extensive benchmarking of state-of-the-art multimodal large language models reveals substantial performance gaps, particularly on global editing tasks, highlighting critical limitations in current end-to-end chart editing capabilities."

    "abstract": "Cool, dense material is frequently observed to permeate the hot, tenuous solar corona in the form of prominences, spicules and coronal rain. Both the cool material and surrounding corona exist at temperatures that are effectively thermally stable, in that their local radiative losses occur on relatively long timescales compared to the dynamics. However, as the solar atmosphere evolves, driving mixing between the condensations and surrounding hot material, intermediate temperatures form, which can become subject to highly efficient radiative losses. The thermal energy lost due to radiation can far exceed the turbulent heating thus the system undergoes mixing-induced cooling. Here, a 3D radiative MHD simulation is performed of the shear-driven Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability (KHI) occurring between a cool condensation and the hot solar corona. During the evolution, thermal instabilities form naturally within the mixing layer, and grow with time to produce long, narrow structures that extend perpendicular to the magnetic field. The thermal instabilities form self-consistently within the mixing layer as small isolated events, and are then stretched by the background flows to create long structures in relatively narrow planes. The turbulent flows agitate the condensations and cause them to fragment, creating smaller localised clumps of cool, dense (prominence-like) material that can merge and further fragment. In the presented simulation, the thermal instabilities act to replenish the cool, dense material lost due to mixing, with the total mass of cool material being approximately constant through time. By analysing the thermal energy loss due to optically-thin radiation, thermal instabilities are found to account for 15-20\\% of all radiative losses in the turbulent plasma."

    "abstract": "Motivated by recent progress in the high-energy description of gravitational scattering, we develop a systematic Regge-theory framework for $2\\to2+n$ amplitudes describing the scattering of two massive particles with $n$ graviton emissions, including spin effects. Working in the ultra-relativistic limit at leading logarithmic accuracy, the massive result smoothly reduces to its massless counterpart. We describe both quantum (Regge trajectory and BFKL $t$-channel evolution) and classical ($s$-channel multi-$H$ evolution) contributions using both an exponential representation of the S-matrix and a shock-wave formalism in light-cone quantisation. In the latter approach, gravitational Wilson lines evolve in rapidity space under a boost-invariant Hamiltonian, providing a space-time realisation of the high-energy dynamics and making contact with recent effective field theory descriptions in the forward limit. As an application, we compute the leading-logarithmic contribution to the massive spinless $2\\to2$ amplitude at 5PM-2SF order, recovering the previously determined massless result, and derive the tree-level $2\\to3$ amplitude and its associated scattering waveform for Kerr black holes in the ultra-relativistic limit."

    "abstract": "Deep learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for spatio-temporal modeling of fluid dynamics. However, existing approaches often suffer from limited generalization to unseen flow conditions and typically require retraining when applied to new scenarios. In this paper, we present LLM4Fluid, a spatio-temporal prediction framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as generalizable neural solvers for fluid dynamics. The framework first compresses high-dimensional flow fields into a compact latent space via reduced-order modeling enhanced with a physics-informed disentanglement mechanism, effectively mitigating spatial feature entanglement while preserving essential flow structures. A pretrained LLM then serves as a temporal processor, autoregressively predicting the dynamics of physical sequences with time series prompts. To bridge the modality gap between prompts and physical sequences, which can otherwise degrade prediction accuracy, we propose a dedicated modality alignment strategy that resolves representational mismatch and stabilizes long-term prediction. Extensive experiments across diverse flow scenarios demonstrate that LLM4Fluid functions as a robust and generalizable neural solver without retraining, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy while exhibiting powerful zero-shot and in-context learning capabilities.

We systematically vary the density of low-quality AI systems and the depth of disclosure requirements in a simulated AI product market to gauge how people react to the risk of accidentally relying on a low-quality AI system. Then, we compare participants' choices to a rational Bayesian model, analyzing the degree to which partial information disclosure can improve AI adoption.

Multistatic, in this context, means that the transmitters and receivers need not be co-located. The reflectivity is anisotropic if it depends on direction, and in the multistatic case this means incoming and outgoing direction. Travel-time problems can be formulated as generalized Radon transforms of integrals over isochrones, in the planar case ellipses with transmitter and receivers at foci. In a simplified case where transmitters and receivers are distant from the scene, isochrones can be approximated by straight lines. We relate this to tensor ray transforms, specifically the longitudinal ray transform of Sharafutdinov, and discuss the implication of its known null-space. In the volumetric case isochrones are spheroids and we relate the problem to the normal Radon transform of tensor fields."

To address these limitations, we propose RecNet, a self-evolving preference propagation framework that proactively propagates real-time preference updates across related users and items. RecNet consists of two complementary phases. In the forward phase, the centralized preference routing mechanism leverages router agents to integrate preference updates and dynamically propagate them to the most relevant agents. To ensure accurate and personalized integration of propagated preferences, we further introduce a personalized preference reception mechanism, which combines a message buffer for temporary caching and an optimizable, rule-based filter memory to guide selective preference assimilation based on past experience and interests. In the backward phase, the feedback-driven propagation optimization mechanism simulates a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, using LLMs for credit assignment, gradient analysis, and module-level optimization, enabling continuous self-evolution of propagation strategies. Extensive experiments on various scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of RecNet in modeling preference propagation for recommender systems."

We investigate the geometric limits of the Linear Propagation Assumption (LPA), the premise that local updates coherently propagate to logical consequences. To formalize this, we adopt relation algebra and study three core operations on relations: negation flips truth values, converse swaps argument order, and composition chains relations. For negation and converse, we prove that guaranteeing direction-agnostic first-order propagation necessitates a tensor factorization separating entity-pair context from relation content. However, for composition, we identify a fundamental obstruction. We show that composition reduces to conjunction, and prove that any conjunction well-defined on linear features must be bilinear. Since bilinearity is incompatible with negation, this forces the feature map to collapse. These results suggest that failures in knowledge editing, the reversal curse, and multi-hop reasoning may stem from common structural limitations inherent to the LPA."

The resulting vortex phase diagrams show that intermediate annealing (500-550 °C) induces nanoscale clustering, enhances pinning, and produces a pronounced fishtail effect with successive elastic- and plastic-vortex-glass regimes. Flux-jump instabilities appear at 550 °C and persist at 1000 °C, indicating strong pinning and thermomagnetic instability in the low-temperature, low-field regime. Remarkably, the 1000 °C sample exhibits a two-step superconducting response-a double plateau or drop in dλ'/dH and two dissipation peaks in dλ''/dH-demonstrating the coexistence of two superconducting phases with distinct irreversibility and critical-field value. We further show that the resolvability of the two-step (dλ/dH)ac signature is governed by the topological connectivity of the phase-separated microstructure, which controls magnetic shielding between the TaNb-rich network and the (TaNb)0.7(HfZrTi)0.5 parent phase.

These methods consume fewer tokens compared to the conventional language CoT reasoning and have the potential to plan in a dense latent space. However, current latent tokens are generally supervised based on imitating language labels. Considering that there can be multiple equivalent but diverse CoT labels for a question, passively imitating an arbitrary one may lead to inferior latent token representations and latent reasoning policies, undermining the potential planning ability and resulting in clear gaps between training and testing. In this work, we emphasize the importance of active planning over the representation space of latent tokens in achieving the optimal latent reasoning policy.

Moreover, to facilitate the most reasonable latent reasoning policy, ATP-Latent conducts reinforcement learning (RL) with an auxiliary coherence reward, which is calculated based on the consistency between VAE-decoded contents of latent tokens, enabling a guided RL process. In experiments on LLaMA-1B, ATP-Latent demonstrates +4.1\\% accuracy and -3.3\\% tokens on four benchmarks compared to advanced baselines.

By introducing a relaxed diffusion bridge formulation which replaces the strict terminal constraint with a relaxed constraint, we model the uncertainty of degradations while theoretically resolving the drift singularity inherent in standard diffusion bridges. Furthermore, we devise a dual modulation strategy: the noise schedule aligns diverse degradations into a shared high-entropy latent space, while the path schedule adaptively regulates the transport trajectory motivated by the viscous dynamics of entropy regularization. By effectively rectifying the transport geometry and dynamics, UDBM achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse restoration tasks within a single inference step."

For node feature heterogeneity, we propose a novel variational model to infer class-wise node distributions, so that we can cluster clients based on inferred distributions and construct cluster-level representative distributions. We then minimize the divergence between local and cluster-level distributions to facilitate semantic knowledge sharing. For structural heterogeneity, we employ spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and propose a spectral energy measure to characterize structural information, so that we can cluster clients based on spectral energy and build cluster-level spectral GNNs. We then align the spectral characteristics of local spectral GNNs with those of cluster-level spectral GNNs to enable structural knowledge sharing. Experiments on six homophilic and five heterophilic graph datasets under both non-overlapping and overlapping partitioning settings demonstrate that FedSSA consistently outperforms eleven state-of-the-art methods."

Second, concerning representational similarity, we prove that reconstruction-based metrics and standard tools (e.g., CKA, RSA) act as estimators of usable information under specific constraints. Crucially, we show that similarity is relative to the capacity of the predictive family: representations that appear distinct to a rigid observer may be identical to a more expressive one. Third, we demonstrate that representational similarity is sufficient but not necessary for functional similarity. We unify these concepts through a task-granularity hierarchy: similarity on a complex task guarantees similarity on any coarser derivative, establishing representational similarity as the limit of maximum granularity: input reconstruction."

At low microwave power, the modes exhibit pronounced level repulsion, evidencing strong coupling to the microwave field. As the power increases, however, magnon linewidth broadening progressively weakens the coupling and ultimately suppresses it entirely below a threshold external magnetic field. We show that this behavior originates from Suhl's first-order instability: magnetostatic modes, which couple to the resonator, parametrically excites two counter-propagating magnons at half its frequency, causing modes below the threshold external magnetic field to vanish. In contrast, magnon modes above the threshold field remain robust even at high power, as the instability criterion is not satisfied in that regime. These results reveal a well-defined nonlinear boundary for magnon-photon coupled systems and highlight a favorable regime for exploiting nonlinear magnonics for frequency conversion, switching, and other functional magnonic devices."

Large-bandgap van der Waals materials such as hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) host stable room-temperature single-photon emitters with narrow linewidths across a broad spectral range. However, cooperative radiative effects in this system have not been previously explored. Here we demonstrate collective emission from quantum-emitter ensembles in hBN layers when the emitters are nearly indistinguishable and positioned within a sub-wavelength proximity. Using confocal microscopy and a Hanbury Brown-Twiss (HBT) configuration, we identify both isolated emitters and ensembles activated by localized electron-beam irradiation. Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements reveal a superlinear intensity enhancement and a pronounced acceleration of the radiative decay in tightly confined ensembles, with lifetimes approaching the temporal resolution of our experimental system (about 500 ps), compared to approximately 1.85 ns for single emitters or large, spatially extended ensembles. Complementary second-order photon-correlation measurements exhibit sub-Poissonian antidip consistent with emission from a few indistinguishable emitters. The simultaneous observation of lifetime shortening and enhanced emission provides direct evidence of cooperative emission at room temperature, achieved without optical cavities or cryogenic cooling. These results establish optically active defect ensembles in hBN as a scalable solid-state platform for engineered collective quantum optics in two-dimensional materials, opening avenues toward ultrabright superradiant light sources and nonclassical photonic states for quantum technologies."

However, the limiting opinion departs from DeGroot's network-centrality-weighted forecast. The consensus between LLM agents turns out to be largely insensitive to initial conditions and instead depends strongly on the discussion subject and inherent biases. Nevertheless, transient dynamics align with classical graph theory and the convergence rate of opinions is closely related to the second-largest eigenvalue of the graph's combination matrix. Together, these findings can be useful for LLM-driven social-network simulations and the design of resource-efficient multi-agent LLM applications."

    "abstract": "Acquiring channel state information (CSI) through traditional methods, such as channel estimation, is increasingly challenging for the emerging sixth generation (6G) mobile networks due to high overhead. To address this issue, channel extrapolation techniques have been proposed to acquire complete CSI from a limited number of known CSIs. To improve extrapolation accuracy, environmental information, such as visual images or radar data, has been utilized, which poses challenges including additional hardware, privacy and multi-modal alignment concerns. To this end, this paper proposes a novel channel extrapolation framework by leveraging environment-related multi-path characteristics induced directly from CSI without integrating additional modalities. Specifically, we propose utilizing the multi-path characteristics in the form of power-delay profile (PDP), which is acquired using a CSI-to-PDP module. CSI-to-PDP module is trained in an AE-based framework by reconstructing the PDPs and constraining the latent low-dimensional features to represent the CSI. We further extract the total power & power-weighted delay of all the identified paths in PDP as the multi-path information. Building on this, we proposed a MAE architecture trained in a self-supervised manner to perform channel extrapolation. Unlike standard MAE approaches, our method employs separate encoders to extract features from the masked CSI and the multi-path information, which are then fused by a cross-attention module. Extensive simulations demonstrate that this framework improves extrapolation performance dramatically, with a minor increase in inference time (around 0.1 ms). Furthermore, our model shows strong generalization capabilities, particularly when only a small portion of the CSI is known, outperforming existing benchmarks."

This model is used in a situation where the coefficients $λ$, $g$ and the coefficient $τ$ of the term $τ\\ph^2$ depend on two parameters $T$ and $P$, and there is a point ($T_c,P_c$) at which $τ$ and $λ$ are zero. This point is named the tricritical point. The description of a system depends on a trajectory that leads to the tricritical point on the plane ($T,P$). In the trajectories, when $λ$ goes to zero fast enough, the description is defined by the $\\ph^6$ interaction and then the $\\ph^4$ term can be considered as a composite operator. In this case, the logarithmic dimension is $d=3$, and the $\\ep$ expansion is carried out in the dimension $d=3-2\\ep$. The main exponents of the \\textit{tricritical} model have been calculated in the third order of the $\\ep$ expansion. Taking into account the $\\ph^4$ interaction, we were able to calculate the value of the parameter that determines the required decrease rate in $λ$ to implement the tricritical behavior. The tricritical dimensions of the composite operators $\\ph^k$ for $k=1, 2, 4, 6$ have been computed. The resulting values are compared to those known from a conformal field theory and non-perturbative renormalization group."

    "abstract": "We introduce UEval, a benchmark to evaluate unified models, i.e., models capable of generating both images and text. UEval comprises 1,000 expert-curated questions that require both images and text in the model output, sourced from 8 real-world tasks. Our curated questions cover a wide range of reasoning types, from step-by-step guides to textbook explanations. Evaluating open-ended multimodal generation is non-trivial, as simple LLM-as-a-judge methods can miss the subtleties. Different from previous works that rely on multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to rate image quality or text accuracy, we design a rubric-based scoring system in UEval. For each question, reference images and text answers are provided to a MLLM to generate an initial rubric, consisting of multiple evaluation criteria, and human experts then refine and validate these rubrics. In total, UEval contains 10,417 validated rubric criteria, enabling scalable and fine-grained automatic scoring. UEval is challenging for current unified models: GPT-5-Thinking scores only 66.4 out of 100, while the best open-source model reaches merely 49.1. We observe that reasoning models often outperform non-reasoning ones, and transferring reasoning traces from a reasoning model to a non-reasoning model significantly narrows the gap. This suggests that reasoning may be important for tasks requiring complex multimodal understanding and generation."

This completes the classification of closed surfaces in simply-connected 4-manifolds up to concordance. Our methods give new constructions of cobordisms with prescribed boundaries, and completely determine when a given cobordism between the boundaries extends to a cobordism or concordance between the surfaces. We obtain our concordance results by extending Sunukjian's method of ambient surgery to the unoriented case using Pin$^-$-structures. We also discuss conditions for an arbitrary codimension 2 properly embedded submanifold to admit an unoriented spanning manifold with prescribed boundary. All results hold in both the smooth and topological categories."

To make the resulting model useful to users, it is further trained on a far smaller amount of \"instruction-tuning\" data comprised of supervised training examples of instructions and responses. To overcome the limited amount of supervised data, we propose a procedure that can transform the knowledge in internet-scale pre-training documents into billions of synthetic instruction and answer training pairs. The resulting dataset, called FineInstructions, uses ~18M instruction templates created from real user-written queries and prompts. These instruction templates are matched to and instantiated with human-written source documents from unstructured pre-training corpora. With \"supervised\" synthetic training data generated at this scale, an LLM can be pre-trained from scratch solely with the instruction-tuning objective, which is far more in-distribution with the expected downstream usage of LLMs (responding to user prompts). We conduct controlled token-for-token training experiments and find pre-training on FineInstructions outperforms standard pre-training and other proposed synthetic pre-training techniques on standard benchmarks measuring free-form response quality.

We then solve them using a neural-network ansatz trained by minimizing a physics-informed loss functional. We obtain a one-parameter family of amplitudes, which exhibit rich structure: sizeable particle production, nontrivial emergent Regge behavior, Landau curves, a logarithmic decay at high energy and fixed angle. Finally, we go beyond the two-particle-reducible setup by treating the multi-particle data -- supported above the multi-particle Landau curves due to multi-particle unitarity -- as a dynamical variable. We demonstrate that it can be tuned to suppress low-spin particle production -- a phenomenon we call Aks screening -- at the cost of generating larger and oscillatory double spectral density in the multi-particle region."

Unlike existing search- or tool-based frameworks that primarily address knowledge uncertainty by querying external environments, PIR targets premise- and intent-level uncertainty through direct interaction with the user. PIR is implemented via two core components: (1) an uncertainty-aware supervised fine-tuning procedure that equips models with interactive reasoning capability, and (2) a user-simulator-based policy optimization framework driven by a composite reward that aligns model behavior with user intent. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning, code generation, and document editing demonstrate that PIR consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to 32.70\\% higher accuracy, 22.90\\% higher pass rate, and 41.36 BLEU improvement, while reducing nearly half of the reasoning computation and unnecessary interaction turns. Further reliability evaluations on factual knowledge, question answering, and missing-premise scenarios confirm the strong generalization and robustness of PIR.

    "abstract": "Test-time scaling has been widely adopted to enhance the capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM) agents in software engineering (SWE) tasks. However, the standard approach of repeatedly sampling trajectories from scratch is computationally expensive. While recent methods have attempted to mitigate costs using specialized value agents, they can suffer from model miscalibration and fail to generalize to modern agents that synthesize custom bash scripts as tools. In this paper, we introduce SWE-Replay, the first efficient and generalizable test-time scaling technique for modern agents without reliance on potentially noisy value estimates. SWE-Replay optimizes the scaling process by recycling trajectories from prior trials, dynamically choosing to either explore from scratch or exploit archived experience by branching at critical intermediate steps. This selection of intermediate steps is driven by the potential and reasoning significance of repository exploration, rather than external LLM-based quality estimates. Our evaluation shows that, on SWE-Bench Verified, SWE-Replay consistently outperforms naive scaling, reducing costs by up to 17.4% while maintaining or even improving performance by up to 3.8%. Further evaluation on SWE-Bench Pro and Multilingual validates the generalizability of SWE-Replay, establishing it as a robust foundation for efficient test-time scaling of software engineering agents."

The growth of this probability at late times raises the question of its behavior near \\( t \\sim e^{S} \\). A natural possibility is that the full genus expansion, together with its non-perturbative completion, leads to saturation of the tunneling probability. Motivated by this idea, the present analysis employs a non-perturbative bulk inner product in place of the perturbative one and shows that, at late times, the probabilities of realizing firewall geometries and smooth geometries approach constant values."

AlphaCFG uses an alpha-oriented context-free grammar to define a tree-structured, size-controlled search space, and formulates alpha discovery as a tree-structured linguistic Markov decision process, which is then solved using a grammar-aware Monte Carlo Tree Search guided by syntax-sensitive value and policy networks. Experiments on Chinese and U.S. stock market datasets show that AlphaCFG outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both search efficiency and trading profitability.

The resulting nonconvex optimization problem is solved using successive convex approximation (SCA) based on second-order cone programming (SOCP), which reformulates the constraints into a tractable form. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm significantly improves both outage probability and achievable rate over conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) schemes, with particularly large gains in large-scale RIS configurations. Moreover, the algorithm converges rapidly, making it suitable for real-time applications"

We introduce V-Pretraining: a value-based, modality-agnostic method for controlled continued pretraining in which a lightweight task designer reshapes the pretraining task to maximize the value of each gradient step. For example, consider self-supervised learning (SSL) with sample augmentation. The V-Pretraining task designer selects pretraining tasks (e.g., augmentations) for which the pretraining loss gradient is aligned with a gradient computed over a downstream task (e.g., image segmentation). This helps steer pretraining towards relevant downstream capabilities. Notably, the pretrained model is never updated on downstream task labels; they are used only to shape the pretraining task. Under matched learner update budgets, V-Pretraining of 0.5B--7B language models improves reasoning (GSM8K test Pass@1) by up to 18% relative over standard next-token prediction using only 12% of GSM8K training examples as feedback. In vision SSL, we improve the state-of-the-art results on ADE20K by up to 1.07 mIoU and reduce NYUv2 RMSE while improving ImageNet linear accuracy, and we provide pilot evidence of improved token efficiency in continued pretraining."

    "abstract": "Social bias in generative AI can manifest not only as performance disparities but also as associational bias, whereby models learn and reproduce stereotypical associations between concepts and demographic groups, even in the absence of explicit demographic information (e.g., associating doctors with men). These associations can persist, propagate, and potentially amplify across repeated exchanges in inter-model communication pipelines, where one generative model's output becomes another's input. This is especially salient for human-centred perception tasks, such as human activity recognition and affect prediction, where inferences about behaviour and internal states can lead to errors or stereotypical associations that propagate into unequal treatment. In this work, focusing on human activity and affective expression, we study how such associations evolve within an inter-model communication pipeline that alternates between image generation and image description. Using the RAF-DB and PHASE datasets, we quantify demographic distribution drift induced by model-to-model information exchange and assess whether these drifts are systematic using an explainability pipeline. Our results reveal demographic drifts toward younger representations for both actions and emotions, as well as toward more female-presenting representations, primarily for emotions. We further find evidence that some predictions are supported by spurious visual regions (e.g., background or hair) rather than concept-relevant cues (e.g., body or face). We also examine whether these demographic drifts translate into measurable differences in downstream behaviour, i.e., while predicting activity and emotion labels. Finally, we outline mitigation strategies spanning data-centric, training and deployment interventions, and emphasise the need for careful safeguards when deploying interconnected models in human-centred AI systems."

Operating in the ultra-low-frequency gravitational band inaccessible from Earth, LILA is sensitive to scalar metric perturbations sourced by dark energy dynamics. Using both fluid and effective field theory descriptions, we develop a complete framework linking dark energy sound speed to observable strain signatures.

However, preference optimization for language models is particularly challenging because token-space similarity does not imply semantic or behavioral similarity. To address this challenge, we leverage latent-space regularization for language model preference optimization. We introduce GANPO, which achieves latent-space regularization by penalizing divergence between the internal representations of a policy model and a reference model. Given that latent representations are not associated with explicit probability densities, we adopt an adversarial approach inspired by GANs to minimize latent-space divergence. We integrate GANPO as a regularizer into existing offline preference optimization objectives. Experiments across multiple model architectures and tasks show consistent improvements from latent-space regularization. Further, by comparing GANPO-induced inferential biases with those from token-level regularization, we find that GANPO provides more robust structural feedback under distributional shift and noise while maintaining comparable downstream performance with minor computational overhead."

(2026) analyzed a 39-year baseline of times of maximum light of BE Lyn, reporting that it is the most eccentric binary known ($e \\approx 0.9989$) and hosts the nearest black hole (BH) known to date. We analyze Hipparcos and Gaia astrometry of BE Lyn, predicting what the observed proper motion anomaly (PMA) over the 25 year baseline between the two missions would be were the companion really a $\\gtrsim 17.5\\,M_{\\odot}$ BH. We find that the predicted PMA is at least an order of magnitude larger than the observed value of $\\approx 1.7 \\pm 0.8$ mas yr$^{-1}$, regardless of the assumed orientation of the orbit. We predict the expected Gaia DR3 RUWE for different orientations of the putative BH binary, finding that it ranges from $\\approx 2.5$-$4.0$, much larger than the reported value of $1.073$. The observed value is instead consistent with a low-mass secondary or a single star. We find that BE Lyncis would have received a 7-parameter acceleration solution if it were a BH binary, in contradiction with its absence from the Gaia DR3 non-single star catalogs. Finally, we show that the reported orbit is impossible because the luminous star would overflow its Roche lobe at periastron, irrespective of inclination. We recommend caution in interpreting light-travel time effect (LTTE) models that require very high eccentricities, face-on inclinations, or large companion masses. The observed pulsation timing variations are most likely simply a result of red noise or pulsation phase evolution."

Using the Haldane model as a minimal setting, we show that disorder not only shifts topological boundaries but also stabilizes a topological Anderson insulator (TAI) between trivial and Chern insulating regimes. Employing the local Chern marker as a real-space topological probe, we map the full phase diagram and demonstrate that the TAI forms a finite domain bounded by trivial and Anderson insulators. Multifractal analysis of low-energy eigenstates at the boundary reveals universal critical spectra, independent of whether disorder generates or destroys topology. These results place topology, localization, and criticality within a unified framework and provide clear benchmarks for real-space diagnostics of disordered topological phases."

Here we study full-shell InAs/EuS/Al nanowires using scanning SQUID magnetometry and transport, and find superconductivity in the Al shell only when the EuS is in a multi-domain state, consistent with both DWS and MDAS, and absent in the saturated single-domain state. Scanning SQUID magnetometry further shows that the EuS magnetic texture is position dependent and reconfigurable by small changes in external magnetic field, including moving a well-defined domain wall at $\\approx$5.5 $μ$m/mT with sub-mT fields, implying that any associated localized superconducting region would likewise be movable. Such magnetic texture controlled superconductivity along a nanowire may be useful for topological qubits, Andreev spin qubits, superconducting logic, and memory devices."

Accelerating standard fixed-point iteration schemes provides a promising novel approach to the design of efficient numerical methods for these problems. The Wasserstein geometry on the space of probability measures, although not precisely Riemannian, allows us to define various useful Riemannian notions, such as tangent spaces, exponential maps and parallel transport, motivating the adaptation of Riemannian numerical methods. We demonstrate this by developing and implementing the Riemannian Anderson Mixing (RAM) method for Gaussian distributions. The method reuses the history of the residuals and improves the iteration complexity, and we argue that the additional costs, compared to Picard method, are negligible. We show that certain open balls in the Bures-Wasserstein manifold satisfy the requirements for convergence of RAM. The numerical experiments show a significant acceleration compared to a Picard iteration, and performance on par with Riemannian Gradient Descent and Conjugate Gradient methods."

Task arithmetic unlearns by subtracting a specific task vector (TV)--defined as the parameter difference between a privacy-information-tuned model and the original model. While efficient, it can cause over-forgetting by disrupting parameters essential for retaining other information. Motivated by the observation that each parameter exhibits different importance for forgetting versus retention, we propose a per-parameter task arithmetic (PerTA) mechanism to rescale the TV, allowing per-parameter adjustment. These weights quantify the relative importance of each parameter for forgetting versus retention, estimated via gradients (i.e., PerTA-grad) or the diagonal Fisher information approximation (i.e., PerTA-fisher). Moreover, we discuss the effectiveness of PerTA, extend it to a more general form, and provide further analysis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PerTA consistently improves upon standard TV, and in many cases surpasses widely used training-based unlearning methods in both forgetting effectiveness and overall model utility. By retaining the efficiency of task arithmetic while mitigating over-forgetting, PerTA offers a principled and practical framework for LLM unlearning."

Both approaches limit interactive use. We propose a hybrid rendering approach for high-quality, interactive, and immersive anatomical visualization. Our method combines streamed foveated path tracing with a lightweight Gaussian Splatting approximation of the periphery. The peripheral model generation is optimized with volume data and continuously refined using foveal renderings, enabling interactive updates. Depth-guided reprojection further improves robustness to latency and allows users to balance fidelity with refresh rate. We compare our method against direct path tracing and Gaussian Splatting. Our results highlight how their combination can preserve strengths in visual quality while re-generating the peripheral model in under a second, eliminating extensive preprocessing and approximations. This opens new options for interactive medical visualization."

We also synthesize common evaluation methods (automated checks, human rubrics, and LLM-as-judge) and discuss known judge failure modes. In reproducible local experiments (Ollama; Llama 3 8B Instruct and Qwen 2.5 7B Instruct), we observe that a generic \"improved\" prompt template can trade off behaviors: on our small structured suites, extraction pass rate decreased from 100% to 90% and RAG compliance from 93.3% to 80% for Llama 3 when replacing task-specific prompts with generic rules, while instruction-following improved. These findings motivate evaluation-driven prompt iteration and careful claim calibration rather than universal prompt recipes.

Motivated by this observation, we propose PocketDP3, a pocket-scale 3D diffusion policy that replaces the heavy conditional U-Net decoder used in prior methods with a lightweight Diffusion Mixer (DiM) built on MLP-Mixer blocks. This architecture enables efficient fusion across temporal and channel dimensions, significantly reducing model size. Notably, without any additional consistency distillation techniques, our method supports two-step inference without sacrificing performance, improving practicality for real-time deployment. Across three simulation benchmarks--RoboTwin2.0, Adroit, and MetaWorld--PocketDP3 achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer than 1% of the parameters of prior methods, while also accelerating inference. Real-world experiments further demonstrate the practicality and transferability of our method in real-world settings. Code will be released."

The spectroscopic method showed substantial bias against high inclinations ($i > 80^\\circ$).

We introduce a hierarchy of integral probability metrics, termed MMD-$k$, which generalizes the maximum mean discrepancy to quantum ensembles and exhibit a strict trade-off between discriminative power and statistical efficiency as the moment order $k$ increases. For pure-state ensembles of size $N$, estimating MMD-$k$ using experimentally feasible SWAP-test-based estimators requires $Θ(N^{2-2/k})$ samples for constant $k$, and $Θ(N^3)$ samples to achieve full discriminative power at $k = N$. In contrast, the quantum Wasserstein distance attains full discriminative power with $Θ(N^2 \\log N)$ samples. These results provide principled guidance for the design of loss functions in quantum machine learning, which we illustrate in the training quantum denoising diffusion probabilistic models."

In sports, it is actively used for fine-grained analyses such as quantifying player contributions and identifying tactical patterns. However, the reliability of these models is fundamentally limited by inherent data quality issues that cause logical inconsistencies (e.g., incorrect event ordering or missing events). To this end, this study proposes VERSA (Verified Event Data Format for Reliable Soccer Analytics), a systematic verification framework that ensures the integrity of event stream data within the soccer domain. VERSA is based on a state-transition model that defines valid event sequences, thereby enabling the automatic detection and correction of anomalous patterns within the event stream data. Notably, our examination of event data from the K League 1 (2024 season), provided by Bepro, detected that 18.81% of all recorded events exhibited logical inconsistencies. Addressing such integrity issues, our experiments demonstrate that VERSA significantly enhances cross-provider consistency, ensuring stable and unified data representation across heterogeneous sources. Furthermore, we demonstrate that data refined by VERSA significantly improves the robustness and performance of a downstream task called VAEP, which evaluates player contributions. These results highlight that the verification process is highly effective in increasing the reliability of data-driven analysis."

We provide evidence that it contains sufficient information to reconstruct individual amplitudes, despite the absence of squared amplitudes at odd loops. The extraction of the four-point amplitude is already non-trivial and closely parallels the extraction of five-point amplitudes in ${\\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Mills (SYM) from weight-$4$ $f$-graphs: we comment on this similarity and provide new results for $n=4$ ABJM loop integrand up to $L=6$. For higher multiplicities, based on Yangian invariants (including BCFW building blocks for tree amplitudes) and an appropriate basis of planar dual conformal invariant(DCI) integrands, we disentangle six-point integrands up to two loops and eight-point tree amplitude from the squared amplitudes. Our results suggest that ABJM amplitudes of arbitrary multiplicity and loop order can be reconstructed from squared amplitudes, closely paralleling the role of $f$-graphs in $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM."

    "abstract": "Data-based optimization (DBO) offers a promising approach for efficiently optimizing shape for better aerodynamic performance by leveraging a pretrained surrogate model for offline evaluations during iterations. However, DBO heavily relies on the quality of the training database. Samples outside the training distribution encountered during optimization can lead to significant prediction errors, potentially misleading the optimization process. Therefore, incorporating uncertainty quantification into optimization is critical for detecting outliers and enhancing robustness. This study proposes an uncertainty-aware data-based optimization (UA-DBO) framework to monitor and minimize surrogate model uncertainty during DBO. A probabilistic encoder-decoder surrogate model is developed to predict uncertainties associated with its outputs, and these uncertainties are integrated into a model-confidence-aware objective function to penalize samples with large prediction errors during data-based optimization process. The UA-DBO framework is evaluated on two multipoint optimization problems aimed at improving airfoil drag divergence and buffet performance. Results demonstrate that UA-DBO consistently reduces prediction errors in optimized samples and achieves superior performance gains compared to original DBO. Moreover, compared to multipoint optimization based on full computational simulations, UA-DBO offers comparable optimization effectiveness while significantly accelerating optimization speed."

    "abstract": "We report on the observation of coherent molecular vibrations launched by the breaking of a molecular bond. The methyl radical, which is produced by $267\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ photodissociation of methyl iodide, is excited to high levels in its $ν_2$ ``umbrella\" vibrational mode by the dissociation. The ensuing coherent vibrational dynamics are observed by measuring ultrafast time-dependent changes in the x-ray transition energy from the C$1s$ to the singly-occupied valence orbital. Due to symmetry, the real space vibrational motion appears predominantly in the x-ray energy shift at the difference frequencies of the $ν_2$ progression, although the fundamental frequencies of the $ν_2$ mode are also observed. By constructing a fully quantum-mechanical model of the dynamics the coherent superposition is rigorously characterized and the real-space motion of the radicals is reconstructed. The retrieved trajectories are dominated by pronounced quantum beating governed by the high degree of coherent excitation and the strong negative anharmonicity of the $ν_2$ mode."

As the main contribution, we introduce two set functions, i.e.~functions which assign a value to the distribution and each of its marginals, and show that extremal conditional independence statements can be characterized by modularity relations for these functions. For the first function, we make use of the close connection between Hüsler-Reiss and Gaussian models to introduce a multiinformation-inspired measure $m^{\\text{HR}}$ for Hüsler-Reiss distributions. For the second function, we consider an invariant $σ^2$ that is naturally associated to the Hüsler-Reiss parameterization and establish the second modularity criterion under additional positivity constraints. Together, these results provide new tools for describing extremal dependence structures in high-dimensional extreme value statistics. In addition, we study the geometry of a bounded subset of Hüsler-Reiss parameters and its relation with the Gaussian elliptope."

Considering a relevant experimental example of a qubit interacting with a single bosonic mode playing the role of a finite bath, we show that all definitions of entropy production coincide at weak coupling. In the strong coupling regime, significant discrepancies emerge between the different entropy production rates, although some similarities in the overall behaviour remain. However, surprisingly, two of these definitions -- one based on local quantities of the system and the other on non-local quantities -- coincide exactly, even in the case of strong coupling. Finally, a high degree of correspondence is observed when memory effects characterized by P-divisibility are compared with the sign of all entropy production rates in the case of weak coupling. Such correspondence degrades at strong coupling, leading us to extend the concept of entropy production to the dynamical map. We show a perfect equivalence between the sign of this enlarged concept of entropy production and P-divisibility, both numerically and analytically, in the case of phase-covariant master equations."

By tuning two excited pair molecular rotational states into a Förster resonance with a dc field, simultaneously driving excited rotational transitions with an ac field removes all long-range bound states, allowing near complete suppression of all two- and three-body collisional loss channels. While permitting tunable dipolar and anti-dipolar interactions, this bound-state-free ac/dc scheme is not subject to photon-changing collisions that are the primary source of two-body loss in shielding with two microwave fields, used to achieve the first molecular Bose-Einstein condensate [Bigagli et al., Nature 631, 289 (2024)]. Using NaCs as a representative example for strongly dipolar molecules, close-coupling calculations are performed to show that bound-state-free shielding can achieve ratios of elastic-to-loss rates $\\gtrsim 10^{6}$ at 100 nK, with currently accessible ac and dc field generation technologies. This work opens new opportunities for realizing large, long-lived samples of strongly interacting degenerate molecular gases with tunable long-range interactions."

    "abstract": "Low Earth orbit (LEO) mega-constellations greatly extend the coverage and resilience of future wireless systems. Within the mega-constellations, laser inter-satellite links (LISLs) enable high-capacity, long-range connectivity. Existing LISL schemes often overlook mechanical limitations of laser communication terminals (LCTs) and non-uniform global traffic profiles caused by uneven user and gateway distributions, leading to suboptimal throughput and underused LCTs/LISLs -- especially when each satellite carries only a few LCTs. This paper investigates the joint optimization of LCT connections and traffic routing to maximize the constellation throughput, considering the realistic LCT mechanics and the global traffic profile. The problem is formulated as an NP-hard mixed-integer program coupling LCT connections with flow-rate variables under link capacity constraints. Due to its intractability, we resort to relaxing the coupling constraints via Lagrangian duality, decomposing the problem into a weighted graph-matching for LCT connections, weighted shortest-path routing tasks, and a linear program for rate allocation. Here, Lagrange multipliers reflect congestion weights between satellites, jointly guiding the matching, routing, and rate allocation. Subgradient descent optimizes the multipliers, with provable convergence. Simulations using real-world constellation and terrestrial data show that our methods substantially improve network throughput by up to $35\\%$--$145\\%$ over existing non-joint approaches."

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a promising paradigm for optimizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in complex reasoning tasks. However, traditional outcome-based RL approaches often suffer from reward sparsity and inefficient credit assignment, as coarse-grained scalar rewards fail to identify specific erroneous steps within long-horizon trajectories. This ambiguity frequently leads to \"process hallucinations\", where models reach correct answers through flawed logic or redundant retrieval steps. Although recent process-aware approaches attempt to mitigate this via static preference learning or heuristic reward shaping, they often lack the on-policy exploration capabilities required to decouple step-level credit from global outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose ProRAG, a process-supervised reinforcement learning framework designed to integrate learned step-level supervision into the online optimization loop. Our framework consists of four stages: (1) Supervised Policy Warmup to initialize the model with a structured reasoning format; (2) construction of an MCTS-based Process Reward Model (PRM) to quantify intermediate reasoning quality; (3) PRM-Guided Reasoning Refinement to align the policy with fine-grained process preferences; and (4) Process-Supervised Reinforcement Learning with a dual-granularity advantage mechanism. By aggregating step-level process rewards with global outcome signals, ProRAG provides precise feedback for every action. Extensive experiments on five multi-hop reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ProRAG achieves superior overall performance compared to strong outcome-based and process-aware RL baselines, particularly on complex long-horizon tasks, validating the effectiveness of fine-grained process supervision. The code and model are available at https://github.com/lilinwz/ProRAG."

This method was established to quantify ecosystem-scale vertical atmosphere-vegetation exchange processes, but is also used to validate atmospheric turbulence theories with the ultimate aim to improve the representation of turbulence in numerical models. While the focus has long been on turbulence over idealized, homogeneous and flat surfaces, recent scientific developments are shifting towards investigating turbulent exchange processes in complex heterogeneous environments under non-idealized conditions, which pose particular challenges, e.g. advective fluxes between different surface types or non-stationarity of nighttime turbulence. This requires to rethink standard post-processing routines for determining turbulent fluxes from the high-frequency sonic and gas analyzer measurements. Here, we introduce the open-source R-package 'Reddy', which provides modular-built functions for post-processing, analysis and visualization of eddy-covariance measurements, including investigating spectra, coherent structures, anisotropy, flux footprints and surface energy balance closure. The 'Reddy' package is accompanied by a detailed documentation and a set of jupyter notebooks introducing new users hands-on to eddy-covariance data analysis. We showcase 'Reddy' based on measurements from three different sites in Norway: A case study during strong stratification over alpine tundra, for determining suitable averaging times during ice-cover transition at a boreal lake, and for fitting flux-variance relations for a permafrost peatland. 'Reddy' serves as extension of previously developed software packages, paving the way towards holistic turbulence data analysis in heterogeneous real-world environments."

While SMBH formation histories are essentially lost, NSCs preserve evolutionary imprints through their stellar populations and stellar kinematics, reflecting the cumulative effects of mergers, accretion, and internal dynamical evolution. We aim to investigate the orbital structure of the unusually large NSC in FCC 47 (NGC 1336) by decomposing its stellar orbits into dynamically distinct components. We extract stellar kinematics, and in particular the line-of-sight velocity distributions (LOSVDs), from VLT/MUSE integral-field spectroscopy using the non-parametric Bayes-LOSVD approach, and apply triaxial Schwarzschild orbit-superposition modelling with the DYNAMITE software. We decompose the orbit library into hot, warm, cold, and counter-rotating components. We detect triple-peaked LOSVDs in the nucleus, indicating a complex orbital structure. The NSC forms a counter-rotating, kinematically decoupled component. A hot pressure-supported component, a warm counter-rotating structure and a counter-rotating cold disk in the centre suggest hierarchical assembly via early star cluster accretion and later in situ star formation. Our orbital decomposition of FCC 47 supports a hybrid formation scenario for this NSC. Dynamically distinct substructures reflect the interplay of accretion and in situ star formation during galaxy evolution."

Our study demonstrates that fluctuations in perturbation intensity occurring during the learning phase can lead to ineffective training, by establishing a theoretical link to the notion of solution stability in combinatorial optimization. We propose addressing this issue by introducing a regularization of the estimated cost vectors which improves the robustness and reliability of the learning process, as demonstrated by extensive numerical experiments."

We study transfer learning for structured matrix estimation under simultaneous growth of the ambient dimension and the intrinsic representation, where a well-estimated source task is embedded as a subspace of a higher-dimensional target task. We propose a general transfer framework in which the target parameter decomposes into an embedded source component, low-dimensional low-rank innovations, and sparse edits, and develop an anchored alternating projection estimator that preserves transferred subspaces while estimating only low-dimensional innovations and sparse modifications. We establish deterministic error bounds that separate target noise, representation growth, and source estimation error, yielding strictly improved rates when rank and sparsity increments are small. We demonstrate the generality of the framework by applying it to two canonical problems. For Markov transition matrix estimation from a single trajectory, we derive end-to-end theoretical guarantees under dependent noise. For structured covariance estimation under enlarged dimensions, we provide complementary theoretical analysis in the appendix and empirically validate consistent transfer gains."

Instead of suppressing diffusion updates or applying masking heuristics, our approach reinterprets diffusion as the evolution of stochastic trajectories through a structured latent space. By shaping the initial noise and its geometric alignment, background generation naturally avoids designated foreground regions, allowing readable content to remain intact without auxiliary mechanisms. To address the long-standing issue of stylistic drift across pages, we decouple style control from text conditioning and introduce cached style directions as persistent vectors in latent space. Once selected, these directions constrain diffusion trajectories to a shared stylistic subspace, ensuring consistent appearance across pages and editing iterations. This formulation eliminates the need for repeated prompt-based style specification and provides a more stable foundation for multi-page generation. Our framework admits a geometric and physical interpretation, where diffusion paths evolve on a latent manifold shaped by preferred directions, and foreground regions are rarely traversed as a consequence of trajectory initialization rather than explicit exclusion. The proposed method is training-free, compatible with existing diffusion backbones, and produces visually coherent, foreground-preserving results across complex documents. By reframing diffusion as trajectory design in latent space, we offer a principled approach to consistent and structured generative modeling."

    "abstract": "Efficient management of spare parts inventory is crucial in the automotive aftermarket, where demand is highly intermittent and uncertainty drives substantial cost and service risks. Forecasting is therefore central, but the quality of a forecasting model should be judged not by statistical accuracy (e.g., MAE, RMSE, IAE) but rather by its impact on key operational performance indicators (KPIs), such as total cost and service level. Yet most existing work evaluates models exclusively using accuracy metrics, and the relationship between these metrics and operational KPIs remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we propose a decision-centric simulation software framework that enables systematic evaluation of forecasting model in realistic inventory management setting. The framework comprises: (i) a synthetic demand generator tailored to spare-parts demand characteristics, (ii) a flexible forecasting module that can host arbitrary predictive models, and (iii) an inventory control simulator that consumes the forecasts and computes operational KPIs. This closed-loop setup enables researchers to evaluate models not only in terms of statistical error but also in terms of their downstream implications for inventory decisions. Using a wide range of simulation scenarios, we show that improvements in conventional accuracy metrics do not necessarily translate into better operational performance, and that models with similar statistical error profiles can induce markedly different cost-service trade-offs. We analyze these discrepancies to characterize how specific aspects of forecast performance affect inventory outcomes and derive guidance for model selection. Overall, the framework operationalizes the link between demand forecasting and inventory management, shifting evaluation from purely predictive accuracy toward operational relevance in the automotive aftermarket and related domains."

Still, they come with limitations imposed by finite computing power, whose impact is not straightforward to evaluate a priori. Observational features are hence required as verification. energy electrons accelerated at external shocks, provides a testbed for such predictions. Current numerical studies suggest that in GRB afterglows the maximum synchrotron photon energy, which corresponds to the limit of electron acceleration, may fall within the $\\sim$ 0.1--10 keV X-ray energy band at late times, $t\\gtrsim 10^6 - 10^7$ s. To test this prediction, we analyzed the X-ray spectra of six GRBs with \\emph{Swift}/XRT detections beyond $10^7$ s: our analysis reveals no clear evidence of a spectral cutoff. Using a model that accounts for the effect of the finite opening angle of the shock on the observed maximum synchrotron photon energy, we show that these observations are incompatible with PIC simulation predictions, unless one or more physical afterglow parameters attain values at odds with those typically inferred from afterglow modeling (small radiative efficiency, low ambient density, large equipartition fraction $ε_{\\rm B}$ of the magnetic field). These findings challenge existing numerical simulation results and imply a more efficient acceleration of electrons to high-energies than seen in PIC simulations, with important implications for our understanding of particle acceleration in relativistic shocks."

    "abstract": "Evaluating the performance of large language models (LLMs) from human preference data is crucial for obtaining LLM leaderboards. However, many existing approaches either rely on restrictive parametric assumptions or lack valid uncertainty quantification when flexible machine learning methods are used. In this paper, we propose a nonparametric statistical framework, DMLEval, for comparing and ranking LLMs from preference data using debiased machine learning (DML). For this, we introduce generalized average ranking scores (GARS), which generalize commonly used ranking models, including the Bradley-Terry model or PageRank/ Rank centrality, with complex human responses such as ties. DMLEval comes with the following advantages: (i) It produces statistically efficient estimates of GARS ranking scores. (ii) It naturally allows the incorporation of black-box machine learning methods for estimation. (iii) It can be combined with pre-trained LLM evaluators (e.g., using LLM-as-a-judge). (iv) It suggests optimal policies for collecting preference data under budget constraints. We demonstrate these advantages both theoretically and empirically using both synthetic and real-world preference datasets. In summary, our framework provides practitioners with powerful, state-of-the-art methods for comparing or ranking LLMs."

    "abstract": "This work inspects the thermally activated transfer of solute particles across the interface between two interstitial solid solution phases that equilibrate internally by fast diffusion on conserved arrays of sites. When each phase is considered as an ergodic ensemble of particles, statistical mechanics predicts the occupancy of the transition states at equilibrium to depend on the barrier energy and on the chemical potentials and vacancy fractions in each of the phases. A rate law for the non-equilibrium interfacial transfer, based on a constant transition probability between activated states, naturally satisfies the principle of detailed balance. Contrary to Butler-Volmer-type laws, values of the particle chemical potentials enter explicitly rather than through their difference. This, along with the dependency on the vacancy fractions, implies here an exchange flux density that depends explicitly on the compositions at equilibrium. The results can explain experimental observations of a drastic slow-down in the charging of metal hydrides near phase transformations or miscibility-gap critical points."

    "abstract": "Transition-metal dichalcogenides of the pyrite-marcasite family are model systems of crystal chemistry. A few of these show polymorphism. The theoretical ground state of CoSe2 is marcasite, but the material is typically synthesized in the pyrite structure. Polymorphism has been observed in nanoparticles and synthetic control of the polymorphs of CoSe2 has not been achieved. We have synthesized material libraries of the Fe1-xCoxSe2 series by combining combinatorial deposition and ex-situ selenization. The approach allows to efficiently explore substitution ranges and crystal structures that form for different synthesis conditions. We find that higher levels of Co content x within the marcasite structure are possible when synthesizing at low temperatures. At a synthesis temperature of only 250° C, we have successfully synthesized marcasite CoSe2 as the majority phase. Density functional theory simulations reveal that the two isomorphs of CoSe2 are extremely close in energy and that the orthorhombic phase is the energetic ground state. Our experimental and theoretical data show that the marcasite structure is the equilibrium phase of Fe1-xCoxSe2 in the entire composition range."

ECSEL directly constructs a structural, closed-form expression that serves as both a classifier and an explanation. On standard symbolic regression benchmarks, our method recovers a larger fraction of target equations than competing state-of-the-art approaches while requiring substantially less computation. Leveraging this efficiency, ECSEL achieves classification accuracy competitive with established machine learning models without sacrificing interpretability. Further, we show that ECSEL satisfies some desirable properties regarding global feature behavior, decision-boundary analysis, and local feature attributions. Experiments on benchmark datasets and two real-world case studies i.e., e-commerce and fraud detection, demonstrate that the learned equations expose dataset biases, support counterfactual reasoning, and yield actionable insights."

Single-star evolution from massive O stars, possibly via a Luminous Blue Variable phase, is challenged by binary period distributions of different WR subtypes. Wd1-72 is a WN7b+O binary embedded in the collective wind of the Galactic young massive cluster Westerlund 1 (Wd 1). It is surrounded by highly structured nebulosity, with cometary tails pointing away from Wd 1 and quasi-spherical droplets towards it. In this letter, we demonstrate that this morphology can be qualitatively reproduced by a hydrodynamic simulation of non-conservative Roche Lobe Overflow (RLOF) mass-loss into a cluster wind. Our model is based on a detailed binary evolution track consistent with key known properties of Wd1-72. Our work suggests Wd1-72 could be only ~10 kyr post-RLOF, and the hydrogen-free nature of Wd1-72 favours this being a second or subsequent RLOF episode. Follow-up observations could make Wd1-72 a valuable benchmark for probing mass-loss and mass-transfer in forming gravitational-wave binary-progenitor systems."

This study re-analyzes the visible and near-infrared reflectance spectrum of Kamo`oalewa published by B. N. L. Sharkey et al. (2021), obtained using the Large Binocular Telescope, to infer its mineral composition and space weathering characteristics. Spectral similarity analysis is performed by comparing the spectrum of Kamo`oalewa to the mean spectra of various types in the Bus-DeMeo taxonomy to make a preliminary constraint on the combined characteristics of surface mineralogy and space weathering effects. To further characterize the mineral composition, a detailed analysis of the 1 μm band center is conducted based on spectral data below 1.25 μm that have higher signal-to-noise ratios. Empirical models for normalized spectra are developed to estimate the Is/FeO content. The results suggest that asteroid Kamo`oalewa has higher olivine abundance than that of typical S-type asteroids and the Moon, exhibiting an immature to submature degree of space weathering. These findings enhance our understanding of the evolution of similar quasi-satellites and provide important implication for the future exploration of Tianwen-2 mission."

    "abstract": "Cycles are ubiquitous in various networks such as social, biological, and technological systems, where they play a significant functional and dynamical role. This paper proposes a node similarity measure based on minimal simple cycles, referred to as cycle similarity. Specifically, the metric quantifies the similarity between two nodes by considering the minimal cycles that connect them through their neighboring nodes, with an upper bound imposed on the cycle size to ensure computational feasibility. We then systematically examine the effectiveness and applicability of this similarity measure through two fundamental tasks: link prediction and community detection. To address the scarcity of cycles in link prediction, an edge-addition correction strategy is introduced, whereby the existence of a candidate edge is hypothetically assumed before computing node similarity. Experimental results demonstrate that this correction leads to improved performance on datasets including karate, INT, PPI, and Grid. In hierarchical community detection using cycle similarity, we find that the significance of cyclic structures (reflected by Z-scores), the presence of pendant nodes with degree one, and the existence of cut vertices are the primary factors influencing the algorithm's performance."

On the theoretical side, we prove that Shannon entropy is the unique regularization choice yielding permutation-equivariant operators, and characterize regularizers inducing sparse selections.

    "abstract": "Matching platforms, from ridesharing to food delivery to competitive gaming, face a fundamental operational dilemma: match agents immediately to minimize waiting costs, or delay to exploit the efficiency gains of thicker markets. Yet computing optimal policies is generally intractable, sophisticated algorithms often rely on restrictive distributional assumptions, and common heuristics lack worst-case performance guarantees. We formulate a versatile framework for multi-sided matching with general state-dependent cost structures and non-stationary arrival dynamics. Central to our approach is a cost-balancing principle: match when accumulated waiting cost reaches a calibrated proportion of instantaneous matching cost. This equilibrium condition emerges from fluid-limit analysis and motivates a simple, adaptive Cost-Balancing (CB) algorithm requiring no distributional assumptions. We prove that CB achieves a competitive ratio of $(1+\\sqrtΓ)$ under adversarial arrivals, where $Γ$ quantifies economies of scale, guaranteeing cost within a constant factor of the offline optimum. In contrast, standard greedy and threshold policies can incur unbounded costs in adversarial scenarios. We further establish a universal lower bound of $(\\sqrt{5}+1)/2$ (the golden ratio), quantifying the fundamental price of uncertainty in online matching. Experiments on game matchmaking and real-world food delivery data demonstrate practical effectiveness, with CB consistently outperforming industry-standard heuristics."

However, galaxy-galaxy blending can marginally change the luminosity function by up to 50\\%\\ over a wide range of redshifts.

Villarroel and colleagues have assembled and analyzed datasets of unidentified features measured from digital scans of photographic plates captured by the first-epoch Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS1) in the pre-Sputnik era. These studies have called attention to (i) a purported deficit of features within Earth's shadow; (ii) the sporadic presence of linear clusters; and (iii) a positive correlation between the timing of feature observations and nuclear tests as well as Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) sighting reports. These observations were cited as evidence that some fraction of the unidentified features represent glinting artificial objects near Earth. We have examined these claims using two related, previously published datasets. When analyzing the most vetted of these, we do not observe the reported deficit in the terrestrial shadow. We determine that a third of the features in the reported linear clusters were not confidently distinguished from catalog stars. We find that the reported correlation between the timing of feature observations and nuclear tests becomes insignificant after properly normalizing by the number of observation days, and is almost completely determined by the observation schedule of the Palomar telescope. We uncover important inconsistencies in the definitions of the datasets used in these studies, as well as the use of unvalidated datasets containing catalog stars, scan artifacts, and plate defects. It has not been shown that any of the features in these datasets represent optical transients. We examine the spatial distribution of the plate-derived features, finding an overall gradual increase in number density toward the corners and edges of plates, as well as examples of (i) empty north-south strips that span multiple plates; (ii) clusters and voids having geometric shapes; and (iii) amorphous clusters."

We propose Evolution of Benchmark (EoB), an automated BBO benchmark designer empowered by the large language model (LLM) and its program evolution capability. Specifically, we formulate benchmark design as a bi-objective optimization problem towards maximizing (i) landscape diversity and (ii) algorithm-differentiation ability across a portfolio of BBO solvers. Under this paradigm, EoB iteratively prompts LLM to evolve a population of benchmark programs and employs a reflection-based scheme to co-evolve the landscape and its corresponding program.

When the CFTs have holographic duals via the AdS/CFT correspondence, the transfer happens through an AdS wormhole that allows signal propagation even beyond the horizon from one AdS boundary to the other; we demonstrate this in explicit CFT calculations. We argue that this transmission is possible because the insertion of a local operator is not a unitary process but a regularized version of projection measurement, and that this is interpreted as quantum teleportation. We also find that this leads to a phenomenon opposite to scrambling, where mutual information, instead of being suppressed, gets enhanced by the insertion of a local operator excitation."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains, where rare but severe failures can result in irreversible harm. However, prevailing evaluation benchmarks often reduce complex social risk to mean-centered scalar scores, thereby obscuring distributional structure, cross-dimensional interactions, and worst-case behavior. This paper introduces Social Harm Analysis via Risk Profiles (SHARP), a framework for multidimensional, distribution-aware evaluation of social harm. SHARP models harm as a multivariate random variable and integrates explicit decomposition into bias, fairness, ethics, and epistemic reliability with a union-of-failures aggregation reparameterized as additive cumulative log-risk. The framework further employs risk-sensitive distributional statistics, with Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR95) as a primary metric, to characterize worst-case model behavior. Application of SHARP to eleven frontier LLMs, evaluated on a fixed corpus of n=901 socially sensitive prompts, reveals that models with similar average risk can exhibit more than twofold differences in tail exposure and volatility. Across models, dimension-wise marginal tail behavior varies systematically across harm dimensions, with bias exhibiting the strongest tail severities, epistemic and fairness risks occupying intermediate regimes, and ethical misalignment consistently lower; together, these patterns reveal heterogeneous, model-dependent failure structures that scalar benchmarks conflate. These findings indicate that responsible evaluation and governance of LLMs require moving beyond scalar averages toward multidimensional, tail-sensitive risk profiling."

    "abstract": "Feature coding for machines (FCM) is a lossy compression paradigm for split-inference. The transmitter encodes the outputs of the first part of a neural network before sending them to the receiver for completing the inference. Practical FCM methods ``sandwich'' a traditional codec between pre- and post-processing neural networks, called wrappers, to make features easier to compress using video codecs. Since traditional codecs are non-differentiable, the wrappers are trained using a proxy codec, which is later replaced by a standard codec after training. These codecs perform rate-distortion optimization (RDO) based on the sum of squared errors (SSE). Because the RDO does not consider the post-processing wrapper, the inner codec can invest bits in preserving information that the post-processing later discards. In this paper, we modify the bit-allocation in the inner codec via a wrapper-aware weighted SSE metric. To make wrapper-aware RDO (WA-RDO) practical for FCM, we propose: 1) temporal reuse of weights across a group of pictures and 2) fixed, architecture- and task-dependent weights trained offline. Under MPEG test conditions, our methods implemented on HEVC match the VVC-based FCM state-of-the-art, effectively bridging a codec generation gap with minimal runtime overhead relative to SSE-RDO HEVC."

    "abstract": "To promote cooperation in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, the reward signals of all agents can be aggregated together, forming global rewards that are commonly known as the fully cooperative setting. However, global rewards are usually noisy because they contain the contributions of all agents, which have to be resolved in the credit assignment process. On the other hand, using local reward benefits from faster learning due to the separation of agents' contributions, but can be suboptimal as agents myopically optimize their own reward while disregarding the global optimality. In this work, we propose a method that combines the merits of both approaches. By using a graph of interaction between agents, our method discerns the individual agent contribution in a more fine-grained manner than a global reward, while alleviating the cooperation problem with agents' local reward. We also introduce a practical approach for approximating such a graph. Our experiments demonstrate the flexibility of the approach, enabling improvements over the traditional local and global reward settings."

    "abstract": "Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) rely on distributed embedded devices that often must communicate securely over buses. Ensuring message integrity and authenticity on these buses typically requires group-shared keys for Message Authentication Codes (MACs). To avoid insecure fixed pre-shared keys and trust-on-first-use concepts, a Group Key Agreement (GKA) protocol is needed to dynamically agree on a key amongst the devices. Yet existing GKA protocols lack adaptability to constrained CPS buses. This paper targets authenticated, fully distributed GKA suitable for bus topologies under constraints of industrial and cyber-physical systems, including broadcast-only links, half-duplex operation, resource limits, dynamic membership (including unannounced leaves), a long device lifetime, and a strong Dolev-Yao adversary capable of partitioning the bus. We first systematise existing protocols, then derive the requirements necessary for an authenticated and fully distributed GKA on bus systems. Finally, we design, implement, and evaluate a custom GKA protocol based on TreeKEM."

For vector-valued queries $f$, we prove non-asymptotic DP guarantees without any additive noise, showing that Wishart randomness alone can suffice. For matrix-valued queries, however, we establish a sharp negative result: in the noise-free setting, the mechanism is not DP, and we demonstrate its vulnerability by implementing a near perfect membership inference attack (AUC $> 0.99$). We then analyze a noisy variant and prove privacy amplification due to randomness and low rank projection, in both large- and small-rank regimes, yielding stronger privacy guarantees than additive noise alone. Finally, we show that LoRA-style updates are an instance of the matrix-valued mechanism, implying that LoRA is not inherently private despite its built-in randomness, but that low-rank fine-tuning can be more private than full fine-tuning at the same noise level. Preliminary experiments suggest that tighter accounting enables lower noise and improved accuracy in practice."

Such capabilities are especially valuable for quantum sensing and computing platforms that already find applications in biology, materials science, and geophysics. A key challenge is the coherent manipulation of nearby nuclear spins, which serve as quantum memories and auxiliary qubits but conventionally require additional high-power RF fields which increase the experimental complexity and overall power consumption. Finding systems where both electron and nuclear spins can be controlled using a single MW source is therefore highly desirable. Here, using a modified divacancy center in silicon carbide, we show that coherent control of a coupled nuclear spin is possible without any RF fields. Instead, MW pulses driving the electron spin also manipulate the nuclear spin through hyperfineenhanced effects, activated by a precisely tilted external magnetic field. We demonstrate high-fidelity nuclear-spin control, achieving 89% two-qubit tomography fidelity and nearly T1-limited nuclear coherence times. This approach offers a simplified and scalable route for future quantum applications."

We extend these frameworks by incorporating TPU index and a presidential dummy to capture effects of trade uncertainty and government cycles. The findings show that constant correlation models are strongly rejected in favor of time-varying specifications. Both STCC and DCC models confirm TPU's central role in driving correlation dynamics, with significant differences across political regimes. DCC models augmented with TPU and political effects deliver the best in-sample fit and strongest forecasting performance, as measured by statistical and economic loss functions."

It is well known that the training data sampling strategy can greatly impact model performance. However, how to find the optimal strategy has not been adequately studied in the context of embedding models. We propose Inf-DDS, a novel reinforcement learning driven sampling framework that adaptively reweighs training datasets guided by influence-based reward signals and is much more lightweight with respect to GPU consumption. Our technique iteratively refines the sampling policy, prioritizing datasets that maximize model performance on a target development set. We evaluate the efficacy of our sampling strategy on a wide range of text retrieval tasks, demonstrating strong improvements in retrieval performance and better adaptation compared to existing gradient-based sampling methods, while also being 1.5x to 4x cheaper in GPU compute. Our sampling strategy achieves a 5.03 absolute NDCG@10 improvement while training a multilingual bge-m3 model and an absolute NDCG@10 improvement of 0.94 while training all-MiniLM-L6-v2, even when starting from expert-assigned weights on a large pool of training datasets."

Standard First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) policies suffer from severe head-of-line blocking, leading to high tail latency and underutilized hardware. We introduce EWSJF (Effective Workload-based Shortest Job First), an adaptive request-level scheduler that learns workload structure in real time to jointly improve fairness and throughput. EWSJF operates upstream of execution-level schedulers and integrates four components: (1) Refine-and-Prune, an unsupervised partitioning algorithm that discovers performance-homogeneous request groups; (2) Dynamic Queue Routing for assigning requests to these groups; (3) Density-Weighted Scoring, a context-aware prioritization function balancing urgency and fairness; and (4) Bayesian Meta-Optimization, which continuously tunes scoring and partitioning parameters based on live performance feedback. Implemented in vLLM, EWSJF improves end-to-end throughput by over 30% and reduces average Time-To-First-Token for short requests by up to 4x compared to FCFS. These results demonstrate that adaptive, learning-based request scheduling is a critical missing layer for efficient and responsive LLM serving.

Maintaining and modernizing these languages is challenging, especially when migrating to newer standards such as Fortran 2008. This is exacerbated in the presence of legacy proprietary extensions on such legacy languages, because their semantics are often based on old context (limits of legacy language, domain logic,...). This paper presents an approach for automatically migrating FORTRAN 77 with a proprietary extension, named Esope, to Fortran 2008. We introduce a tool that converts Esope source code to Fortran 2008. While supporting readability of the generated code, we want to maintain the level of abstraction provided by Esope. Our method uses model-driven engineering techniques, with transformations to generate a target model from which we export easy-to-read Fortran 2008 source code. We discuss the advantages, limitations, and maintainability considerations of our approach and provide insights into its scalability and adaptability to evolving requirements."

    "abstract": "An increasing number of surveys has been reporting large-scale peculiar motions with sizes and speeds in excess of those allowed by the concordance cosmological model. These are the so called bulk flows, the presence of which has come to be treated as a problem for the $Λ$CDM paradigm. However, the limits of the $Λ$CDM model are based on Newtonian studies, which predict the mediocre $v\\propto t^{1/3}$ growth-rate for the peculiar-velocity field ($v$). Recently, a few fully relativistic treatments have appeared in the literature, arguing for a much stronger velocity growth that could explain the reported fast and deep bulk flows. What separates the Newtonian from the relativistic studies is the gravitational input of the peculiar flux, namely of the kinetic energy triggered by the moving matter. The latter has no direct gravitational contribution in Newtonian theory, but it does so in general relativity. This drastically changes the driving agent of the peculiar-velocity field and boosts its linear growth. The aim of this work is to directly compare the two treatments, as well as identify and discuss the reasons for their different results. In the process, we also demonstrate how one could recover the relativistic growth-rate from a Newtonian setup by selectively including certain (typically ignored) source-free terms into the Poisson equation. This way, we provide a unified covariant comparison of the Newtonian, the quasi-Newtonian and the fully relativistic studies."

Some recent studies have reported this pattern, but there is still no explanation for why this choice helps. We show that this choice is closely tied to a structural property that we refer to as \\textit{gradient scale invariance}. We formalize this notion and prove that Adam becomes gradient scale invariant of first order if and only if $β_{1}=β_{2}$. This perspective places the balanced regime of Adam in direct alignment with the design principles underlying several recent optimizers that explicitly enforce scale-robust updates. The theory is supported by experiments across vision and language tasks, and across different architectural families, in which rescaling the gradient has a markedly smoother effect on the update when $β_{1}=β_{2}$. Overall, our results offer a coherent explanation for an open question in the behavior of Adam and provide a simple principle that helps guide the design of future optimizers."

Gaia DR3 provides precise measurements of the four sky-plane components of the 3D relative displacement and velocity ($\\mathbf{r}, \\mathbf{v}$) for a wide binary, but not comparably precise line-of-sight (radial) separation and relative velocity $v_{r}$. Based on our new observations and the public databases/publications, we assemble a sample of 36 nearby (distance $<150$pc) wide binaries in the low-acceleration regime with accurate values of $v_{r}$ (uncertainty $< 100$ m\\,s$^{-1}$). Kinematic contaminants such as undetected stellar companions are well under control using various observational diagnostics such as Gaia's ruwe parameter, the color-magnitude diagram, multi-epoch observations of radial velocities, Speckle interferometric follow-up observations, and requiring Hipparcos-Gaia proper motion consistency. For the parameter $Γ\\equiv \\log_{10}\\sqrtγ$ with $γ\\equiv G/G_{\\rm N}$ (where $G$ is a parameter generalizing Newton's constant $G_{\\rm N}$ in elliptical orbits), we find $Γ=0.102_{-0.021}^{+0.023}$, inconsistent with standard gravity at $4.9σ$, giving a gravity boost factor of $γ=1.600_{-0.141}^{+0.171}$. Four wide binaries have 3D relative velocities exceeding their estimated Newtonian escape velocities with $1<v_{\\rm obs}/v_{\\rm escN}\\le1.2$. These systems are unlikely to be chance associations and are expected in a nonstandard paradigm such as Milgromian dynamics (MOND). The hypothesis that Newtonian gravity can be extrapolated to the low-acceleration limit is falsified by this independent study with accurate 3D velocities. Future radial velocity monitoring and Speckle interferometric imaging for larger samples will be useful to refine the present result."

The potential also accounts for relativistic, retardation, and post-Born$-$Oppenheimer effects and is provided with reliable uncertainty estimates. To incorporate nonadditive interactions, we developed a nonadditive three-body potential based on extensive supermolecular CCSD(T), CCSDT, and CCSDT(Q) calculations with basis sets of up to sextuple-zeta quality. This potential also accounts for relativistic effects. The very small nonadditive four-body contributions to the fourth virial coefficients were considered using a relatively simple nonadditive four-body potential based on supermolecular CCSD(T) calculations. We calculated the third and fourth density and third acoustic virial coefficients directly by PIMC and the fourth acoustic virial coefficient indirectly using thermodynamic relations between the density and acoustic virial coefficients. The uncertainties of the pair potential and those estimated for our nonadditive three-body potential were rigorously propagated in the PIMC calculations into uncertainties for the virial coefficients. These uncertainties are distinctly smaller than those of almost all of the corresponding experimental virial coefficient data."

    "abstract": "Character image animation aims to synthesize high-fidelity videos by transferring motion from a driving sequence to a static reference image. Despite recent advancements, existing methods suffer from two fundamental challenges: (1) suboptimal motion injection strategies that lead to a trade-off between identity preservation and motion consistency, manifesting as a \"see-saw\", and (2) an over-reliance on explicit pose priors (e.g., skeletons), which inadequately capture intricate dynamics and hinder generalization to arbitrary, non-humanoid characters. To address these challenges, we present DreamActor-M2, a universal animation framework that reimagines motion conditioning as an in-context learning problem. Our approach follows a two-stage paradigm. First, we bridge the input modality gap by fusing reference appearance and motion cues into a unified latent space, enabling the model to jointly reason about spatial identity and temporal dynamics by leveraging the generative prior of foundational models. Second, we introduce a self-bootstrapped data synthesis pipeline that curates pseudo cross-identity training pairs, facilitating a seamless transition from pose-dependent control to direct, end-to-end RGB-driven animation. This strategy significantly enhances generalization across diverse characters and motion scenarios. To facilitate comprehensive evaluation, we further introduce AW Bench, a versatile benchmark encompassing a wide spectrum of characters types and motion scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamActor-M2 achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior visual fidelity and robust cross-domain generalization.

However, eliciting long CoT typically requires large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) training, while often leading to overthinking with redundant intermediate steps. To improve learning and reasoning efficiency, while preserving or even enhancing performance, we propose TACLer, a model-tailored curriculum reinforcement learning framework that gradually increases the complexity of the data based on the model's proficiency in multi-stage RL training. TACLer features two core components: (i) tailored curriculum learning that determines what knowledge the model lacks and needs to learn in progressive stages; (ii) a hybrid Thinking/NoThinking reasoning paradigm that balances accuracy and efficiency by enabling or disabling the Thinking mode. Our experiments show that TACLer yields a twofold advantage in learning and reasoning: (i) it reduces computational cost, cutting training compute by over 50% compared to long thinking models and reducing inference token usage by over 42% relative to the base model; and (ii) it improves accuracy by over 9% on the base model, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art Nothinking and Thinking baselines across four math datasets with complex problems."

Structural diagonalizability is useful for the verification and optimization of various structural system properties. In this paper, we study the asymptotic probability distribution of structural diagonalizability for structured systems whose system matrices are represented by directed Erdős-Rényi random graphs. Leveraging a recently established graph-theoretic characterization of structural diagonalizability, we analyze the distribution of structurally diagonalizable graphs under different edge-density regimes. For dense graphs, we prove that the system is almost always structurally diagonalizable. For graphs of medium density, we derive tight upper and lower bounds on the asymptotic probability of structural diagonalizability. For extremely sparse graphs, we show that this probability approaches 0.

    "abstract": "This paper examines the connection between photonic band-gap formation in two types of two-dimensional photonic crystals and the emergence of reverse electromagnetic energy flows generated by linearly polarized plane waves incident on a photonic-crystal slab. We show that these reverse energy flows, observed in both transmitted and reflected fields, originate from vortex structures in the Poynting vector. The resulting energy-flow patterns exhibit striking analogies to vortex formation in fluid motion past obstacles. The geometry and dynamics of the Poynting-vector vortices determine whether the incident electromagnetic energy is impeded, leading to the formation of photonic band gaps, or instead guided through the structure, enabling transmission."

    "abstract": "While reinforcement learning (RL) has empowered multi-turn reasoning agents with retrieval and tools, existing successes largely depend on extensive on-policy rollouts in high-cost, high-accuracy regimes. Under realistic resource constraints that cannot support large models or dense explorations, however, small language model agents fall into a low-cost, low-accuracy regime, where limited rollout budgets lead to sparse exploration, sparse credit assignment, and unstable training. In this work, we challenge this trade-off and show that small language models can achieve strong multi-hop reasoning under resource constraints. We introduce DAVID-GRPO, a budget-efficient RL framework that (i) stabilizes early learning with minimal supervision, (ii) assigns retrieval credit based on evidence recall, and (iii) improves exploration by resampling truncated near-miss trajectories. Evaluated on agents up to 1.5B parameters trained on only four RTX 3090 GPUs, DAVID-GRPO consistently outperforms prior RL methods designed for large-scale settings on six multi-hop QA benchmarks. These results show that with the right inductive biases, small agents can achieve low training cost with high accuracy."

    "abstract": "Curriculum learning changes the order of pre-training data, but it remains unclear whether it changes the learning trajectory or mainly reorders exposure over a fixed trajectory. We train Pythia models (14M-410M parameters) for 300B tokens under three linguistically motivated curricula-Age-of-Acquisition, word frequency, and Verb Variation (VV)-and compare each against Random ordering; at 1B parameters we compare Random and VV. Across orderings, training follows a shared sequence of latent phases, while curricula mainly change within-phase data exposure. In smaller models (up to 160M parameters), Random ordering exhibits higher gradient noise and stronger late-training output-head spectral saturation, alongside lower final accuracy; curricula reduce both effects at matched compute. At larger scales, saturation differences are smaller and curriculum gains shrink. We formalize the link between difficulty pacing and optimization stability in an idealized analysis based on gradient-variance control, and our results point to a practical takeaway: curricula help by stabilizing within-phase optimization rather than by creating new phases."

Despite empirical successes, a unified theory for its effectiveness under heterogeneous finetuning hyperparameters (e.g., varying learning rates, batch sizes) remains missing. Moreover, the lack of hyperparameter transparency in open-source fine-tuned models makes it difficult to predict merged-model performance, leaving practitioners without guidance on how to fine-tune merge-friendly experts. To address those two challenges, we employ $L_2$-Stability theory under heterogeneous hyperparameter environments to analyze the generalization of the merged model $\\boldsymbol{x}_{avg}$. This pioneering analysis yields two key contributions: (i) \\textit{A unified theoretical framework} is provided to explain existing merging algorithms, revealing how they optimize specific terms in our bound, thus offering a strong theoretical foundation for empirical observations. (ii) \\textit{Actionable recommendations} are proposed for practitioners to strategically fine-tune expert models, enabling the construction of merge-friendly models within the pretraining-to-finetuning pipeline. Extensive experiments on the ResNet/Vit family across 20/8 visual classification tasks, involving thousands of finetuning models, robustly confirm the impact of different hyperparameters on the generalization of $\\boldsymbol{x}_{avg}$ predicted by our theoretical results."

A common mitigation is to compress cached keys and values by projecting per-head matrixes to a lower rank, storing only the projections in the HBM. However, existing post-training approaches typically fit these projections using SVD-style proxy objectives, which may poorly reflect end-to-end reconstruction after softmax, value mixing, and subsequent decoder-layer transformations. For these reasons, we introduce StiefAttention, a post-training KV-cache compression method that learns \\emph{orthonormal} projection bases by directly minimizing \\emph{decoder-layer output reconstruction error}. StiefAttention additionally precomputes, for each layer, an error-rank profile over candidate ranks, enabling flexible layer-wise rank allocation under a user-specified error budget. Noteworthy, on Llama3-8B under the same conditions, StiefAttention outperforms EigenAttention by $11.9$ points on C4 perplexity and $5.4\\%$ on 0-shot MMLU accuracy at iso-compression, yielding lower relative error and higher cosine similarity with respect to the original decoder-layer outputs."

We utilize Allan deviation, a tool from precision metrology, to analyze the stability of meaning by treating ordered sentence embeddings as a displacement signal. Our analysis reveals two distinct dynamical regimes: short-time power-law scaling, which differentiates creative literature from technical texts, and a long-time crossover to a stability-limited noise floor. We find that while large language models successfully mimic the local scaling statistics of human text, they exhibit a systematic reduction in their stability horizon. These results establish semantic coherence as a measurable physical property, offering a framework to differentiate the nuanced dynamics of human cognition from the patterns generated by algorithmic models."

    "abstract": "High-dimensional structural MRI (sMRI) images are widely used for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) diagnosis. Most existing methods for sMRI representation learning rely on 3D architectures (e.g., 3D CNNs), slice-wise feature extraction with late aggregation, or apply training-free feature extractions using 2D foundation models (e.g., DINO). However, these three paradigms suffer from high computational cost, loss of cross-slice relations, and limited ability to extract discriminative features, respectively. To address these challenges, we propose Multimodal Visual Surrogate Compression (MVSC). It learns to compress and adapt large 3D sMRI volumes into compact 2D features, termed as visual surrogates, which are better aligned with frozen 2D foundation models to extract powerful representations for final AD classification. MVSC has two key components: a Volume Context Encoder that captures global cross-slice context under textual guidance, and an Adaptive Slice Fusion module that aggregates slice-level information in a text-enhanced, patch-wise manner. Extensive experiments on three large-scale Alzheimer's disease benchmarks demonstrate our MVSC performs favourably on both binary and multi-class classification tasks compared against state-of-the-art methods."

However, this setting confines agents to a passive role, limiting their autonomy and ability to react to dynamic environmental events. To address these limitations, we introduce sound-triggered mobile manipulation, where agents must actively perceive and interact with sound-emitting objects without explicit action instructions. To support these tasks, we develop Habitat-Echo, a data platform that integrates acoustic rendering with physical interaction. We further propose a baseline comprising a high-level task planner and low-level policy models to complete these tasks. Extensive experiments show that the proposed baseline empowers agents to actively detect and respond to auditory events, eliminating the need for case-by-case instructions. Notably, in the challenging dual-source scenario, the agent successfully isolates the primary source from overlapping acoustic interference to execute the first interaction, and subsequently proceeds to manipulate the secondary object, verifying the robustness of the baseline."

These resources provide substantial operational flexibility but also create tightly coupled thermal-electrical dynamics that challenge conventional network management. This paper proposes a unified co-optimization framework that integrates a calibrated 3R2C grey-box building thermal model into a network-constrained Optimal Power Flow (OPF). The framework jointly optimizes EVs, HPs, and photovoltaic systems while explicitly enforcing thermal comfort, Distributed Energy Resource (DER) limits, and full power flow physics. To maintain computational tractability, Second-Order Cone Programming (SOCP) relaxations are evaluated on a realistic low-voltage feeder. The analysis shows that, despite network heterogeneity violating some theoretical exactness conditions, the relaxation remains exact in practice. Comparative assessments of convex DistFlow, bus injection, and branch flow formulations reveal that convex DistFlow achieves sub-second runtimes and near-optimal performance even at high DER penetration levels. Simulations confirm the effectiveness of coordinated scheduling, yielding reductions of 41% in transformer aging, 54% in losses, and complete elimination of voltage violations, demonstrating the value of integrated thermal-electrical coordination in future smart grids."

Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers are a proven solution to scaling problems in natural language processing. However, existing MoE approaches for time-series forecasting rely on token-wise routing mechanisms, which may fail to exploit the natural locality and continuity of temporal data. In this work, we introduce Seg-MoE, a sparse MoE design that routes and processes contiguous time-step segments rather than making independent expert decisions. Token segments allow each expert to model intra-segment interactions directly, naturally aligning with inherent temporal patterns. We integrate Seg-MoE layers into a time-series Transformer and evaluate it on multiple multivariate long-term forecasting benchmarks. Seg-MoE consistently achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy across almost all prediction horizons, outperforming both dense Transformers and prior token-wise MoE models. Comprehensive ablation studies confirm that segment-level routing is the key factor driving these gains. Our results show that aligning the MoE routing granularity with the inherent structure of time series provides a powerful, yet previously underexplored, inductive bias, opening new avenues for conditionally sparse architectures in sequential data modeling."

In reality, these visually information-dense images are widespread on the internet and have significant real-world application value, such as data visualization and web page analysis. In this technical report, we propose \\textbf{OCRVerse}, the first holistic OCR method in end-to-end manner that enables unified text-centric OCR and vision-centric OCR. To this end, we constructe comprehensive data engineering to cover a wide range of text-centric documents, such as newspapers, magazines and books, as well as vision-centric rendered composites, including charts, web pages and scientific plots. Moreover, we propose a two-stage SFT-RL multi-domain training method for OCRVerse. SFT directly mixes cross-domain data to train and establish initial domain knowledge, while RL focuses on designing personalized reward strategies for the characteristics of each domain. Specifically, since different domains require various output formats and expected outputs, we provide sufficient flexibility in the RL stage to customize flexible reward signals for each domain, thereby improving cross-domain fusion and avoiding data conflicts. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of OCRVerse, achieving competitive results across text-centric and vision-centric data types, even comparable to large-scale open-source and closed-source models."

This approach enables the generation of multiple valid designs corresponding to the same performance targets by sampling over the noise vector. To support model training, we generate data using a vortex lattice method for numerical simulation and analyze the trade-off between model accuracy and the amount of available data. We further propose data augmentation using pseudo-labels derived from less data-intensive forward surrogate models, which can often improve overall model performance. Finally, we present examples of distinct propeller geometries that exhibit nearly identical performance characteristics, illustrating the versatility and potential of GenAI in engineering design."

Specifically, TTReFT achieves this through three key innovations: (1) uncertainty-guided node selection for specific interventions, (2) low-rank representation interventions that preserve pre-trained knowledge, and (3) an intervention-aware masked autoencoder that dynamically adjust masking strategy to accommodate the node selection scheme. Theoretically, we establish guarantees for TTReFT in OOD settings.

Our methodology operates on a combinatorial space of document configurations, rendering instances of structural \\emph{risk features} to induce realistic failure conditions. We benchmark a diverse portfolio of search strategies spanning evolutionary, swarm-based, quality-diversity, learning-based, and quantum under identical budget constraints. Through configuration-level exclusivity, win-rate, and cross-temporal overlap analyses, we show that different solvers consistently uncover failure modes that remain undiscovered by specific alternatives at comparable budgets. Crucially, cross-temporal analysis reveals persistent solver-specific discoveries across all evaluated budgets, with no single strategy exhibiting absolute dominance. While the union of all solvers eventually recovers the observed failure space, reliance on any individual method systematically delays the discovery of important risks. These results demonstrate intrinsic solver complementarity and motivate portfolio-based SBST strategies for robust industrial IDP validation."

CORE optimizes a combined reward that balances (i) correctness, (ii) a lightweight DPP-inspired diversity term to reduce error overlap, and (iii) an explicit rescue bonus for successful recovery. We evaluate CORE across four standard reasoning datasets GSM8K, MATH, AIME, and GPQA. With only 1,000 training examples, a pair of small open source models (3B+4B) reaches Pass@2 of 99.54% on GSM8K and 92.08% on MATH, compared to 82.50% and 74.82% for single-model training.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training is a dominant approach for improving the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs), yet growing evidence suggests that its gains arise primarily from distribution sharpening rather than the acquisition of new capabilities. Recent work has shown that sampling from the power distribution of LLMs using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) can recover performance comparable to RL post-training without relying on external rewards; however, the high computational cost of MCMC makes such approaches impractical for widespread adoption. In this work, we propose a theoretically grounded alternative that eliminates the need for iterative MCMC. We derive a novel formulation showing that the global power distribution can be approximated by a token-level scaled low-temperature one, where the scaling factor captures future trajectory quality. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a training-free and verifier-free algorithm that sharpens the base model's generative distribution autoregressively. Empirically, we evaluate our method on math, QA, and code tasks across four LLMs, and show that our method matches or surpasses one-shot GRPO without relying on any external rewards, while reducing inference latency by over 10x compared to MCMC-based sampling."

    "abstract": "In-context learning (ICL) has become a powerful, data-efficient paradigm for text classification using large language models. However, its robustness against realistic adversarial threats remains largely unexplored. We introduce ICL-Evader, a novel black-box evasion attack framework that operates under a highly practical zero-query threat model, requiring no access to model parameters, gradients, or query-based feedback during attack generation. We design three novel attacks, Fake Claim, Template, and Needle-in-a-Haystack, that exploit inherent limitations of LLMs in processing in-context prompts. Evaluated across sentiment analysis, toxicity, and illicit promotion tasks, our attacks significantly degrade classifier performance (e.g., achieving up to 95.3% attack success rate), drastically outperforming traditional NLP attacks which prove ineffective under the same constraints. To counter these vulnerabilities, we systematically investigate defense strategies and identify a joint defense recipe that effectively mitigates all attacks with minimal utility loss (<5% accuracy degradation). Finally, we translate our defensive insights into an automated tool that proactively fortifies standard ICL prompts against adversarial evasion. This work provides a comprehensive security assessment of ICL, revealing critical vulnerabilities and offering practical solutions for building more robust systems.

    "abstract": "Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is expected to be natively supported by future 6G wireless radios, yet most mmWave sensing solutions still rely on dedicated radar hardware incompatible with cost and power constrained wireless nodes. This article introduces Frequency-as-Aperture (FaA), a wireless-first sensing paradigm that repurposes inherent frequency agility into a virtual sensing aperture, enabling near-field perception with minimal RF front end complexity. Using a single RF chain and a frequency-scanning leaky-wave antenna, FaA achieves two dimensional spatial sensing by reusing the local oscillator (LO) frequency sweep already employed for wideband communication. From a wireless-system perspective, this shifts spatial sampling from the antenna domain to the frequency domain, embedding radar-grade spatial fingerprints directly into the communication RF chain. A case study shows that FaA provides fine angular and range discrimination with low power consumption and unit cost, demonstrating significantly higher architectural efficiency than conventional multi-channel MIMO based sensing under identical physical and spectral constraints. These results indicate that near-field sensing can be seamlessly integrated into frequency-agile wireless radios, enabling hardware-efficient, embeddable, and privacy-preserving ISAC nodes for smart homes, wearables, and industrial edge deployments."

To address this, we introduce a modular framework of depth-recurrent attention mixtures (Dreamer), combining sequence attention, depth attention, and sparse expert attention. It alleviates the hidden-size bottleneck through attention along depth, decouples scaling dimensions, and allows depth-recurrent models to scale efficiently and effectively. Across language reasoning benchmarks, our models require 2 to 8x fewer training tokens for the same accuracy as FLOP-, parameter-, and memory-matched SOTA, and outperform ca. 2x larger SOTA models with the same training tokens. We further present insights into knowledge usage across depths, e.g., showing 2 to 11x larger expert selection diversity than SOTA MoEs."

Our results reveal that being terminal planar can significantly reduce the growth rate of general level-2 networks, but has only a minor effect on the growth rates of tree-child and galled level-2 networks. Notably, the growth rate of 3.83 for level-$2$ terminal planar galled tree-child networks is remarkably close to the rate of 2.94 for level-$1$ networks."

Recent studies empirically show that compressing reasoning steps into latent states, or implicit CoT compression, offers a token-efficient alternative. However, the mechanism behind CoT compression remains unclear. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical analysis of the difficulty of learning to internalize intermediate reasoning steps. By introducing Order-r Interaction, we prove that the learning signal for high-order logical dependencies exponentially decays to solve irreducible problem, where skipping intermediate steps inevitably leads to high-order interaction barriers. To empirically validate this, we introduce NatBool-DAG, a challenging benchmark designed to enforce irreducible logical reasoning and eliminate semantic shortcuts. Guided by our theoretical findings, we propose ALiCoT (Aligned Implicit CoT), a novel framework that overcomes the signal decay by aligning latent token distributions with intermediate reasoning states. Experimental results demonstrate that ALiCoT successfully unlocks efficient reasoning: it achieves a 54.4x speedup while maintaining performance comparable to explicit CoT."

Under multiproduct monopoly, the monopolist's choice of product characteristics is always aligned with the social planner's optimum, despite underproduction. By contrast, under oligopoly, multiple equilibria can arise that differ qualitatively in their patterns of characteristics design. We show that, while oligopoly equilibria exhibiting product differentiation yield higher welfare than those with product concentration, the degree of product differentiation under oligopoly remains below the socially optimal level. As a result, social welfare under oligopoly is typically lower than under monopoly, highlighting a key advantage of coordination in characteristics design. We extend the analysis to settings with overlapping ownership structures and show that common ownership can improve welfare by inducing firms to soften competition through increased product differentiation rather than output reduction."

Inspired by LLMs' success in software automation and science discovery, we introduce \\textsc{EmboCoach-Bench}, a benchmark evaluating the capacity of LLM agents to autonomously engineer embodied policies. Spanning 32 expert-curated RL and IL tasks, our framework posits executable code as the universal interface. We move beyond static generation to assess a dynamic closed-loop workflow, where agents leverage environment feedback to iteratively draft, debug, and optimize solutions, spanning improvements from physics-informed reward design to policy architectures such as diffusion policies. Extensive evaluations yield three critical insights: (1) autonomous agents can qualitatively surpass human-engineered baselines by 26.5\\% in average success rate; (2) agentic workflow with environment feedback effectively strengthens policy development and substantially narrows the performance gap between open-source and proprietary models; and (3) agents exhibit self-correction capabilities for pathological engineering cases, successfully resurrecting task performance from near-total failures through iterative simulation-in-the-loop debugging. Ultimately, this work establishes a foundation for self-evolving embodied intelligence, accelerating the paradigm shift from labor-intensive manual tuning to scalable, autonomous engineering in embodied AI field."

This decoupling mitigates gradient interference across divergent semantic patterns and addresses explicit weight symmetry requirements through our refined feedback alignment. Empirically, SAL demonstrates competitive convergence rates, leading to improved classification performance across 10 standard benchmarks. Additionally, SAL achieves numerical consistency and competitive accuracy even in deep regimes (up to 128 layers) and large-scale models (up to 1B parameters). Our approach is loosely inspired by biological learning mechanisms, offering a plausible alternative that contributes to the study of scalable neural network training."

Current CE methods rely on manually crafted harnesses, such as rigid generation-reflection workflows and predefined context schemas. They impose structural biases and restrict context optimization to a narrow, intuition-bound design space. To address this, we introduce Meta Context Engineering (MCE), a bi-level framework that supersedes static CE heuristics by co-evolving CE skills and context artifacts. In MCE iterations, a meta-level agent refines engineering skills via agentic crossover, a deliberative search over the history of skills, their executions, and evaluations. A base-level agent executes these skills, learns from training rollouts, and optimizes context as flexible files and code. We evaluate MCE across five disparate domains under offline and online settings. MCE demonstrates consistent performance gains, achieving 5.6--53.8% relative improvement over state-of-the-art agentic CE methods (mean of 16.9%), while maintaining superior context adaptability, transferability, and efficiency in both context usage and training."

    "abstract": "It is a matter of ongoing discussion whether quantum states can become entangled while only interacting via a classical mediator. This lively debate is deeply interwoven with the question of whether entanglement studies can prove the quantum nature of gravity. However, the answer to this fundamental question depends crucially on which hybrid quantum-classical theory is used. In this letter, we demonstrate that entanglement by a classical mediator is possible within the framework of hybrid van Hove theory, showing that existing no-go theorems on that matter do not universally apply to hybrid theories in general. After briefly recapitulating the key features of the hybrid van Hove theory, we show this using the example of two quantum spins coupled by a classical harmonic oscillator. By deriving the spin density matrix for this scenario and comparing it to its equivalent for a pure quantum system, we show that entanglement between the two spins is generated in both cases. Conclusively, this is illustrated by presenting the purity and concurrence of the spin-spin system as a decisive measure for entanglement. Our results further imply that quantum entanglement studies cannot rule out consistent quantum theories featuring classical gravity."

We report the existence of input-dependent OOBs in the wild that manifest only under specific inputs. All existing tools to detect OOBs in GPU programs rely on runtime techniques that require an OOB to manifest for detection. Thus, input-dependent OOBs elude them. We also discover intra-allocation OOBs that arise in the presence of logical partitioning of a memory allocation into multiple data structures. Existing techniques are oblivious to the possibility of such OOBs. We make a key observation that the presence (or absence) of semantic relations among program variables, which determines the size of allocations (CPU code) and those calculating offsets into memory allocations (GPU code), helps identify the absence (or presence) of OOBs. We build SCuBA, a first-of-its-kind compile-time technique that analyzes CPU and GPU code to capture such semantic relations (if present). It uses a SAT solver to check if an OOB access is possible under any input, given the captured relations expressed as constraints. It further analyzes GPU code to track logical partitioning of memory allocations for detecting intra-allocation OOB. Compared to NVIDIA's Compute Sanitizer that misses 45 elusive memory bugs across 20 programs, SCuBA misses none with no false alarms."

This enhancement significantly increases the spatial degrees of freedom, offering substantial benefits for wireless positioning. However, the expansion of the near-field range in XL-MIMO challenges the traditional far-field assumptions used in previous MIMO models. Among various configurations, uniform circular arrays (UCAs) demonstrate superior performance by maintaining constant angular resolution, unlike linear planar arrays. Addressing how to leverage the expanded aperture and harness the near-field effects in XL-MIMO systems remains an area requiring further investigation. In this paper, we introduce an attention-enhanced deep learning approach for precise positioning. We employ a dual-path channel attention mechanism and a spatial attention mechanism to effectively integrate channel-level and spatial-level features. Our comprehensive simulations show that this model surpasses existing benchmarks such as attention-based positioning networks (ABPN), near-field positioning networks (NFLnet), convolutional neural networks (CNN), and multilayer perceptrons (MLP). The proposed model achieves superior positioning accuracy by utilizing covariance metrics of the input signal. Also, simulation results reveal that covariance metric is advantageous for positioning over channel state information (CSI) in terms of positioning accuracy and model efficiency."

Inspired by recent advances in LLM inversion, which reconstructs natural language from embeddings and helps bridge the gap between latent embedding space and discrete token space, we propose inversedMixup, a unified framework that combines the controllability of Mixup with the interpretability of LLM-based generation. Specifically, inversedMixup adopts a three-stage training procedure to align the output embedding space of a task-specific model with the input embedding space of an LLM. Upon successful alignment, inversedMixup can reconstruct mixed embeddings with a controllable mixing ratio into human-interpretable augmented sentences, thereby improving the augmentation performance. Additionally, inversedMixup provides the first empirical evidence of the manifold intrusion phenomenon in text Mixup and introduces a simple yet effective strategy to mitigate it. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach in both few-shot and fully supervised scenarios."

To bridge this gap, we propose the Bi-Anchor Interpolation Solver (BA-solver). BA-solver retains the versatility of standard training-free solvers while achieving significant acceleration by introducing a lightweight SideNet (1-2% backbone size) alongside the frozen backbone. Specifically, our method is founded on two synergistic components: \\textbf{1) Bidirectional Temporal Perception}, where the SideNet learns to approximate both future and historical velocities without retraining the heavy backbone; and 2) Bi-Anchor Velocity Integration, which utilizes the SideNet with two anchor velocities to efficiently approximate intermediate velocities for batched high-order integration. By utilizing the backbone to establish high-precision ``anchors'' and the SideNet to densify the trajectory, BA-solver enables large interval sizes with minimized error. Empirical results on ImageNet-256^2 demonstrate that BA-solver achieves generation quality comparable to 100+ NFEs Euler solver in just 10 NFEs and maintains high fidelity in as few as 5 NFEs, incurring negligible training costs. Furthermore, BA-solver ensures seamless integration with existing generative pipelines, facilitating downstream tasks such as image editing."

Estimation is performed by maximum likelihood exploiting properties of matrix-variate Normal distributions and expressing the scale parameter matrix as a function of the location matrix. The covariance matrix is recovered via the matrix exponential. Since this transformation induces an upward bias, an approximate, time-specific bias correction based on a second-order Taylor expansion is proposed. The framework is flexible and applicable to a wide class of problems involving symmetric positive definite matrices."

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed materials discovery, enabling rapid exploration of chemical space through generative models and surrogate screening. Yet current AI workflows optimize performance first, deferring sustainability to post synthesis assessment. This creates inefficiency by the time environmental burdens are quantified, resources have been invested in potentially unsustainable solutions. The disconnect between atomic scale design and lifecycle assessment (LCA) reflects fundamental challenges, data scarcity across heterogeneous sources, scale gaps from atoms to industrial systems, uncertainty in synthesis pathways, and the absence of frameworks that co-optimize performance with environmental impact. We propose to integrate upstream machine learning (ML) assisted materials discovery with downstream lifecycle assessment into a uniform ML-LCA environment. The framework ML-LCA integrates five components, information extraction for building materials-environment knowledge bases, harmonized databases linking properties to sustainability metrics, multi-scale models bridging atomic properties to lifecycle impacts, ensemble prediction of manufacturing pathways with uncertainty quantification, and uncertainty-aware optimization enabling simultaneous performance-sustainability navigation. Case studies spanning glass, cement, semiconductor photoresists, and polymers demonstrate both necessity and feasibility while identifying material-specific integration challenges. Realizing ML-LCA demands coordinated advances in data infrastructure, ex-ante assessment methodologies, multi-objective optimization, and regulatory alignment enabling the discovery of materials that are sustainable by design rather than by chance."

    "abstract": "Representation learning is central to many downstream tasks such as search, clustering, classification, and reranking. State-of-the-art sequence encoders typically collapse a variable-length token sequence to a single vector using a pooling operator, most commonly a special [CLS] token or mean pooling over token embeddings. In this paper, we identify systematic weaknesses of these pooling strategies: [CLS] tends to concentrate information toward the initial positions of the sequence and can under-represent distributed evidence, while mean pooling can dilute salient local signals, sometimes leading to worse short-context performance. To address these issues, we introduce Landmark (LMK) pooling, which partitions a sequence into chunks, inserts landmark tokens between chunks, and forms the final representation by mean-pooling the landmark token embeddings. This simple mechanism improves long-context extrapolation without sacrificing local salient features, at the cost of introducing a small number of special tokens. We empirically demonstrate that LMK pooling matches existing methods on short-context retrieval tasks and yields substantial improvements on long-context tasks, making it a practical and scalable alternative to existing pooling methods."

We validate these predictions via a unified Transformer framework comparing BWSPD, Log-Euclidean, and Euclidean embeddings within identical architecture across 1,500+ runs on three EEG paradigms (motor imagery, ERP, SSVEP; 36 subjects). Our Log-Euclidean Transformer achieves state-of-the-art performance on all datasets, substantially outperforming classical Riemannian classifiers and recent SPD baselines, while BWSPD offers competitive accuracy with similar training time."

In the case that $σ$ has order $2$ or $3$, we revisit two constructions of visualizing abelian varieties, due to Agashe and Stein, and Cremona and Mazur. We show that the Agashe--Stein construction always yields minimal visualizations for these orders. We also build upon the Cremona--Mazur construction and show how it can be made totally explicit. While the Cremona--Mazur construction can produce non-minimal objects, an appropriate choice in the construction for order $2$ elements $σ$ yields an explicit genus $2$ curve whose Jacobian is a minimal visualization. For order $3$ elements we apply our algorithmic construction to Fisher's database of such elements, and obtain computational evidence that, in the majority of cases, the Cremona--Mazur construction yields a minimal visualization."

The ability to generate crash-like imagery challenges the boundary between authentic and synthetic data, introducing new risks of misuse in fraud or claim manipulation. To address these issues, we propose HERS (Hidden-Pattern Expert Learning for Risk-Specific Damage Adaptation), a framework designed to improve fidelity, controllability, and domain alignment of diffusion-generated damage images. HERS fine-tunes a base diffusion model via domain-specific expert adaptation without requiring manual annotation. Using self-supervised image-text pairs automatically generated by a large language model and T2I pipeline, HERS models each damage category, such as dents, scratches, broken lights, or cracked paint, as a separate expert. These experts are later integrated into a unified multi-damage model that balances specialization with generalization. We evaluate HERS across four diffusion backbones and observe consistent improvements: plus 5.5 percent in text faithfulness and plus 2.3 percent in human preference ratings compared to baselines. Beyond image fidelity, we discuss implications for fraud detection, auditability, and safe deployment of generative models in high-stakes domains. Our findings highlight both the opportunities and risks of domain-specific diffusion, underscoring the importance of trustworthy generation in safety-critical applications such as auto insurance."

Some recent studies have shown that pre-trained softmax attention blocks can be converted into RNN blocks through parameter transfer and knowledge distillation. However, these transfer methods require substantial amounts of training data (more than 10B tokens), and the resulting hybrid models also exhibit poor long-context performance, which is the scenario where hybrid models enjoy significant inference speedups over Transformer-based models. In this paper, we present HALO (Hybrid Attention via Layer Optimization), a pipeline for distilling Transformer models into RNN-attention hybrid models. We then present HypeNet, a hybrid architecture with superior length generalization enabled by a novel position encoding scheme (named HyPE) and various architectural modifications. We convert the Qwen3 series into HypeNet using HALO, achieving performance comparable to the original Transformer models while enjoying superior long-context performance and efficiency.

However, training these agents is severely hampered by the challenges of interacting with the live internet, which is inefficient, costly, and fraught with risks. Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) offers a promising solution by learning a world model of the environment to enable simulated interaction. This paper introduces DynaWeb, a novel MBRL framework that trains web agents through interacting with a web world model trained to predict naturalistic web page representations given agent actions. This model serves as a synthetic web environment where an agent policy can dream by generating vast quantities of rollout action trajectories for efficient online reinforcement learning. Beyond free policy rollouts, DynaWeb incorporates real expert trajectories from training data, which are randomly interleaved with on-policy rollouts during training to improve stability and sample efficiency. Experiments conducted on the challenging WebArena and WebVoyager benchmarks demonstrate that DynaWeb consistently and significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art open-source web agent models. Our findings establish the viability of training web agents through imagination, offering a scalable and efficient way to scale up online agentic RL."

This extends the Euclidean-space picture, where regions correspond to specific subgraphs, to the complexities of Minkowski space. Our results are derived from a novel analytical approach combining graph theory and convex geometry; as a key byproduct, we uncover for the first time the algebraic structure underlying momentum modes (collinear, soft, and their hierarchies)."

The velocity field is the divergence of a stationary random stream matrix $\\mathbf{k} $ with positive Hurst exponent $γ> 0$, so the resulting random environment is multiscale and self-similar. In the perturbative regime $γ\\ll 1$, we prove quenched power-law superdiffusion: for a typical realization of the environment, the displacement variance at time $t$ grows like $t^{2/(2-γ)}$, the scaling predicted by renormalization group heuristics. We also identify the leading prefactor up to a random (quenched) relative error of order $γ^{\\frac12}\\left| \\log γ\\right|^3$. The proof implements a Wilsonian renormalization group scheme at the level of the infinitesimal generator $\\nabla \\cdot (νI_d + \\mathbf{k} ) \\nabla$, based on a self-similar induction across scales. We demonstrate that the coarse-grained generator is well-approximated, at each scale $r$, by a constant-coefficient Laplacian with effective diffusivity growing like $r^γ$. This approximation is inherently scale-local: reflecting the multifractal nature of the environment, the relative error does not decay with the scale, but remains of order $γ^{\\frac12}\\left| \\log γ\\right|^2$. We also prove anomalous regularization under the quenched law: for almost every realization of the drift, solutions of the associated elliptic equation are Hölder continuous with exponent $1 - Cγ^{\\frac12}$ and satisfy estimates which are uniform in the molecular diffusivity $ν$ and the scale."

In this work, we propose Routing the Lottery (RTL), an adaptive pruning framework that discovers multiple specialized subnetworks, called adaptive tickets, each tailored to a class, semantic cluster, or environmental condition. Across diverse datasets and tasks, RTL consistently outperforms single- and multi-model baselines in balanced accuracy and recall, while using up to 10 times fewer parameters than independent models and exhibiting semantically aligned. Furthermore, we identify subnetwork collapse, a performance drop under aggressive pruning, and introduce a subnetwork similarity score that enables label-free diagnosis of oversparsification. Overall, our results recast pruning as a mechanism for aligning model structure with data heterogeneity, paving the way toward more modular and context-aware deep learning."

To tackle these challenges, we introduce Physics-Inspired diffusion for full-image reLight ($π$-Light, or PI-Light), a two-stage framework that leverages physics-inspired diffusion models. Our design incorporates (i) batch-aware attention, which improves the consistency of intrinsic predictions across a collection of images, (ii) a physics-guided neural rendering module that enforces physically plausible light transport, (iii) physics-inspired losses that regularize training dynamics toward a physically meaningful landscape, thereby enhancing generalizability to real-world image editing, and (iv) a carefully curated dataset of diverse objects and scenes captured under controlled lighting conditions. Together, these components enable efficient finetuning of pretrained diffusion models while also providing a solid benchmark for downstream evaluation.

To address this, we introduce SMB-Structure, a world model for structured EHR that grounds a joint-embedding prediction architecture (JEPA) with next-token prediction (SFT). SFT grounds our model to reconstruct future patient states in token space, while JEPA predicts those futures in latent space from the initial patient representation alone, forcing trajectory dynamics to be encoded before the next state is observed. We validate across two large-scale cohorts: Memorial Sloan Kettering (23,319 oncology patients; 323,000+ patient-years) and INSPECT (19,402 pulmonary embolism patients). Using a linear probe evaluated at multiple points along the disease trajectory, we demonstrate that our training paradigm learns embeddings that capture disease dynamics not recoverable by autoregressive baselines, enabling SMB-Structure to achieve competitive performance on complex tasks characterized by high patient heterogeneity.

We develop this calculus in full generality, including Sobolev spaces, the wavefront set, and the principal symbol, etc. In particular, using this calculus, we prove that invertibility of the principal symbol implies microlocal maximal hypoellipticity. This allows us to resolve affirmatively the microlocal version of a conjecture of Helffer and Nourrigat."

    "abstract": "High renewable penetration increases the frequency and magnitude of net-load ramps, stressing real-time flexibility. Two commonly deployed remedies are look-ahead economic dispatch (LAED) and ramp products (RPs), yet their operational equivalence under the industry-standard rolling-window dispatch implementation is not well understood. This paper develops linear optimization models for multi-interval LAED and RP-based co-optimization, and proves that an enhanced RP formulation can match LAED's dispatch feasible region at a single time step when additional intertemporal deliverability constraints are enforced. We then show that this equivalence does not generally persist under rolling-window operation because LAED and RP formulations optimize different intertemporal objectives, leading to divergent end-of-window states. Using different test systems under stressed ramping conditions and multiple load levels, we show LAED achieves similar or lower load shedding than RP implementations with the same look-ahead horizon, with the most pronounced differences under high-load, ramp-limited conditions. The study highlights the limitations of current ramp product implementations and suggests enhancements, such as introducing more mid-duration RPs."

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been on the rise in many domains, including numerous safety-critical applications. However, for complex systems found in the real world, or when data already exist, defining the underlying environmental conditions is extremely challenging. This often results in an incomplete description of the environment in which the AI-based system must operate. Nevertheless, this description, called the Operational Design Domain (ODD), is required in many domains for the certification of AI-based systems. Traditionally, the ODD is created in the early stages of the development process, drawing on sophisticated expert knowledge and related standards. This paper presents a novel Safety-by-Design method to a posteriori define the ODD from previously collected data using a multi-dimensional kernel-based representation. This approach is validated through both Monte Carlo methods and a real-world aviation use case for a future safety-critical collision-avoidance system. Moreover, by defining under what conditions two ODDs are equal, the paper shows that the data-driven ODD can equal the original, underlying hidden ODD of the data. Utilizing the novel, Safe-by-Design kernel-based ODD enables future certification of data-driven, safety-critical AI-based systems."

While generative AI offers a promising avenue for surrogate modeling, standard video generation architectures lack the specific control and data compatibility required for physical simulations. This paper introduces a geometry aware world model architecture, derived from a video generation architecture (LongVideoGAN), designed to learn transient physics. We introduce two key architecture elements: (1) a twofold conditioning mechanism incorporating global physical parameters and local geometric masks, and (2) an architectural adaptation to support arbitrary channel dimensions, moving beyond standard RGB constraints. We evaluate this approach on a 2D transient computational fluid dynamics (CFD) problem involving convective heat transfer from buoyancy-driven flow coupled to a heat flow in a solid structure. We demonstrate that the conditioned model successfully reproduces complex temporal dynamics and spatial correlations of the training data. Furthermore, we assess the model's generalization capabilities on unseen geometric configurations, highlighting both its potential for controlled simulation synthesis and current limitations in spatial precision for out-of-distribution samples."

We find that the dilute, gas-like phase consistently exhibits a higher translational kinetic temperature than the dense, liquid-like phase, with this difference amplified by increasing the rotational inertia. Rotational kinetic temperatures display a similar trend, with the dense phase remaining colder than the dilute phase; however, in this case the temperature difference grows with translational inertia and activity, while becoming practically independent of rotational inertia. This counterintuitive behavior arises from the interplay of activity-driven collisions with both translational and rotational inertia in the coexisting phases. Our results highlight the critical role of translational and rotational inertia in shaping the kinetic temperature landscape of motility-induced phase separation and offer new insights into the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of active matter."

However, constrained by the capacity of their internal world knowledge, prior work has proposed augmenting MLLMs by ``reasoning-then-tool-call'' for visual and textual search engines to obtain substantial gains on tasks requiring extensive factual information. However, these approaches typically define multimodal search in a naive setting, assuming that a single full-level or entity-level image query and few text query suffices to retrieve the key evidence needed to answer the question, which is unrealistic in real-world scenarios with substantial visual noise. Moreover, they are often limited in the reasoning depth and search breadth, making it difficult to solve complex questions that require aggregating evidence from diverse visual and textual sources. Building on this, we propose Vision-DeepResearch, which proposes one new multimodal deep-research paradigm, i.e., performs multi-turn, multi-entity and multi-scale visual and textual search to robustly hit real-world search engines under heavy noise. Our Vision-DeepResearch supports dozens of reasoning steps and hundreds of engine interactions, while internalizing deep-research capabilities into the MLLM via cold-start supervision and RL training, resulting in a strong end-to-end multimodal deep-research MLLM. It substantially outperforming existing multimodal deep-research MLLMs, and workflows built on strong closed-source foundation model such as GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-pro and Claude-4-Sonnet.

    "abstract": "The origin of the Hubble tension remains one of the central open problems in modern cosmology, with competing explanations invoking either early-Universe physics, late-time modifications of cosmic expansion, or unresolved observational systematics. In this Letter we propose a new, purely geometric null test of the late-time expansion history that is exactly independent of the Hubble constant. By combining strong-lensing time-delay distances with gravitational-wave standard-siren luminosity distances, we construct a dimensionless ratio that depends only on the redshift dependence of the expansion rate and can be both predicted from early-Universe data and measured directly at late times, without relying on the cosmic distance ladder or the sound horizon. We show that the comparison between the early- and late-time determinations of this ratio provides a transparent consistency test of the standard cosmological expansion. When combined with an independent standard-siren measurement of $H_{0}$, this framework allows one to unambiguously distinguish between early- and late-time origins of the Hubble tension. With the forthcoming detection of lensed gravitational-wave standard sirens, the proposed test provides a timely and robust framework for probing this long-standing cosmological puzzle."

We study a heterogeneous multi-step binary communication game where agents differ in modality and lack perceptual grounding. Despite perceptual misalignment, multimodal systems converge to class-consistent messages grounded in perceptual input. Unimodal systems communicate more efficiently, using fewer bits and achieving lower classification entropy, while multimodal agents require greater information exchange and exhibit higher uncertainty. Bit perturbation experiments provide strong evidence that meaning is encoded in a distributional rather than compositional manner, as each bit's contribution depends on its surrounding pattern. Finally, interoperability analyses show that systems trained in different perceptual worlds fail to directly communicate, but limited fine-tuning enables successful cross-system communication. This work positions emergent communication as a framework for studying how agents adapt and transfer representations across heterogeneous modalities, opening new directions for both theory and experimentation."

DRL yields demonstrated efficacy in various resource allocation problems, such as joint decisions on user scheduling and antenna allocation or simultaneous control of computing resources and modulation. However, trained DRL agents are closed-boxes and inherently difficult to explain, which hinders their adoption in production settings. In this paper, we make a step towards removing this critical barrier by presenting SymbXRL, a novel technique for explainable reinforcement learning (XRL) that synthesizes human-interpretable explanations for DRL agents. SymbXRL leverages symbolic AI to produce explanations where key concepts and their relationships are described via intuitive symbols and rules; coupling such a representation with logical reasoning exposes the decision process of DRL agents and offers more comprehensible descriptions of their behaviors compared to existing approaches. We validate SymbXRL in practical network management use cases supported by DRL, proving that it not only improves the semantics of the explanations but also paves the way for explicit agent control: for instance, it enables intent-based programmatic action steering that improves by 12% the median cumulative reward over a pure DRL solution."

This coupling hybridizes the system modes into upper and lower polariton branches. The strength of the interaction depends on the number of emitters and on their orientation and spatial arrangement relative to the metallic surface. These structural factors have profound consequences for the ensuing photoexcited dynamics. Despite the extensive spectroscopic work on plexcitonic systems, direct understanding of the molecular geometry at the metal interface remains limited. In this work, we present a comprehensive structural characterization of one of the most widely studied plexcitons formed by the cyanine dye 5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1'-diethyl-3,3'-di(4-sulfobutyl)-benzimidazolocarbocyanine (TDBC) and silver nanoprisms using a combination of NMR, THz-Raman spectroscopy, and DFT calculations. By comparing the signals from the monomeric and aggregated forms of TDBC with that of the plexciton, we identify shared spectral fingerprints that reveal how molecular packing is modified when the aggregate adsorbs on the silver surface. We observe Raman modes specific to plexciton systems, and identify NOESY cross-peaks in the aliphatic region, that along with THz-Raman modes in the 10-400 cm$^{-1}$ region are sensitive indicators of aggregation geometry and adsorption. We find that isolated TDBC monomers adopt an asymmetric conformation in which both sulfobutyl chains lie on the same side of the chromophore, while J-aggregates adopt a symmetric up-down alternation of the chains from molecule to molecule. This work establishes the molecular geometry of a prototypical TDBC-silver plexciton, providing a structural benchmark for understanding geometry-dependent photophysics in hybrid exciton-plasmon systems."

While linear magnetic responses depend on the Zeeman quantum geometric tensor, the influence of generalized spin-rotation quantum geometries on nonlinear responses has not been established. Here, we develop a microscopic quantum-kinetic framework to elucidate how the Zeeman and spin-rotation quantum geometric tensors govern nonlinear gyrotropic magnetic transport in two-dimensional systems. We derive second-order gyrotropic magnetic currents and reveal a distinct geometric separation: the off-diagonal sector is controlled by the Zeeman symplectic and metric connections, whereas the diagonal sector is dictated by the spin-rotation quantum metric and Berry curvature. This identifies the spin-rotation quantum geometric tensor as a fundamental geometric quantity unique to the nonlinear regime. Applying our theory to massless Dirac fermions, hexagonally warped topological insulator surface states, tilted massive Dirac fermions, and parity-time symmetric CuMnAs, we demonstrate how specific symmetries selectively activate conduction and displacement channels. Our findings link spin-resolved quantum geometry to nonlinear magnetic transport, offering design principles for engineering tailored nonlinear magnetic responses in optoelectronic and spintronic devices."

In contrast, we demonstrate with examples in both zero and non-zero characteristic of the base field that the class of exact module categories is not stable under this product. We also observe in examples that fully exact module categories form a dense subset in the class of exact ones. The monoidal 2-category of fully exact module categories strictly contains those of invertible and separable module categories. In fact, we show that each internal algebra of a fully exact module category is projectively separable, a generalization of separable algebras involving projective objects. In the semisimple case, a module category is fully exact if and only if it is separable. In general, fully exact module categories are not dualizable inside their class, but if they are, they are fully dualizable objects in the monoidal 2-category of finite module categories. We call such module categories perfect. We show that perfect module categories form a rigid monoidal 2-subcategory containing all fully dualizable objects. Therefore, we propose perfect module categories as a model for finite tensor 2-categories. If the braiding is symmetric, a module category is fully exact if and only if it is perfect. As a detailed example, we classify fully exact, and hence perfect, module categories over the symmetric tensor category of modules over Sweedler's four-dimensional Hopf algebra and compute their relative Deligne products, and the categories of 1-morphisms. For a general quasi-triangular Hopf algebra, we analyze when the category of finite-dimensional vector spaces is fully exact. We show that this is not the case for both Sweedler's Hopf algebra and Lusztig's factorizable small quantum group of type $A_1$ at an odd root of unity."

We show that these different components match the Green's function numerically obtained by solving a time-domain Regge-Wheeler code. In addition, the components of the Green's function also agree with earlier studies in Schwarzschild spacetime with small cosmological constant. The identification of all the various parts of the Schwarzschild Green's function represents an important step towards analyzing direct waves and quasinormal modes in the ringdown stage of binary black hole coalescence, as well as their nonlinear interaction near the merger."

    "abstract": "Unlike short-form retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), such as factoid question answering, long-form RAG requires retrieval to provide documents covering a wide range of relevant information. Automated report generation exemplifies this setting: it requires not only relevant information but also a more elaborate response with comprehensive information. Yet, existing retrieval methods are primarily optimized for relevance ranking rather than information coverage. To address this limitation, we propose LANCER, an LLM-based reranking method for nugget coverage. LANCER predicts what sub-questions should be answered to satisfy an information need, predicts which documents answer these sub-questions, and reranks documents in order to provide a ranked list covering as many information nuggets as possible. Our empirical results show that LANCER enhances the quality of retrieval as measured by nugget coverage metrics, achieving higher $α$-nDCG and information coverage than other LLM-based reranking methods. Our oracle analysis further reveals that sub-question generation plays an essential role."

Such a singly-charged scalar is naturally accommodated in an extremely well-motivated neutrino mass model, namely, the Type-II seesaw model. This model, beside providing a viable explanation of neutrino mass generation, also allows for lepton flavor violating (LFV) processes. Since LFV processes are not allowed in the Standard Model (SM), we focus on the discovery prospect of the singly-charged scalar in the Type-II seesaw model at $μ$TRISTAN through a LFV process, owing to the advantage of this process being free of any SM background. Additionally, this article also proposes a method to indicate if the underlying theory follows a Normal or an Inverted hierarchy depending on the distribution of lepton flavors in the final state."

Specifically, we (i) derive the theoretical performance limits through the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) and (ii) optimize the antenna positions to ensure robust performance within the UE's uncertainty region. Numerical results show that dynamically optimizing antenna placement by explicitly considering the uncertainty region yields superior performance compared to fixed arrays, demonstrating the ability of MA systems to adapt and outperform conventional arrays."

We introduce Mechanistic Data Attribution (MDA), a scalable framework that employs Influence Functions to trace interpretable units back to specific training samples. Through extensive experiments on the Pythia family, we causally validate that targeted intervention--removing or augmenting a small fraction of high-influence samples--significantly modulates the emergence of interpretable heads, whereas random interventions show no effect. Our analysis reveals that repetitive structural data (e.g., LaTeX, XML) acts as a mechanistic catalyst. Furthermore, we observe that interventions targeting induction head formation induce a concurrent change in the model's in-context learning (ICL) capability. This provides direct causal evidence for the long-standing hypothesis regarding the functional link between induction heads and ICL. Finally, we propose a mechanistic data augmentation pipeline that consistently accelerates circuit convergence across model scales, providing a principled methodology for steering the developmental trajectories of LLMs."

    "abstract": "Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) hold relevance for spin-triplet superconducting phases due to their inherent Ising spin-orbit coupling, but the majority of studies have so far focused on oversimplified models. In this work, we consider a TMD monolayer using a three-orbital model with anisotropic couplings and investigate the emergent superconducting properties when it is placed in proximity to a conventional spin-singlet $s$-wave superconductor. We find that the multiorbital nature of the TMDs lead to superconducting gaps not only at zero energy, but also at higher energies, so-called hybridization gaps, which exhibit a complex structure due to the anisotropic couplings, challenging their spectral measurement. Moreover, we find that the inherent Ising spin-orbit coupling induces a spin splitting and a spin polarization along the $z$-direction, which correlates with the emergence of mixed spin-triplet superconducting pairs. These spin-triplet pair correlations appear in the monolayer as a proximity-induced effect due to the impact of the Ising spin-orbit field on conventional spin-singlet $s$-wave superconductivity. Taking realistic parameters for a $\\text{MoS}_2$ monolayer, we show that the Ising field is strong enough to induce spin-triplet pair correlations of the same magnitude as their spin-singlet counterparts. We also include Rashba spin-orbit coupling, naturally emerging in a heterostructure and find that it induces equal spin-triplet superconducting pairs that compete with the mixed spin-triplet pairs induced by the Ising spin-orbit coupling. Our findings help understand the superconducting properties of TMDs in proximity to conventional superconductors."

We present a unifying framework that decouples these choices from the information-gathering cost by explicitly exposing the causal dependencies between parameters, beliefs, and controls. Using this framework, we derive a general information-gathering cost based on Massey's directed information that assumes only Markov dynamics with additive noise and is otherwise agnostic to modeling choices. We prove that the mutual information cost used in existing literature is a special case of our cost. Then, we leverage our framework to establish an explicit connection between the mutual information cost and information gain in linearized Bayesian estimation, thereby providing theoretical justification for mutual information-based active learning approaches. Finally, we illustrate the practical utility of our framework through experiments spanning linear, nonlinear, and multi-agent systems."

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have inspired a surge of research that encodes item textual information with high-dimensional semantic embeddings, and designs transformation methods to inject such embeddings into SR models. These embedding transformation strategies can be categorized into two types, both of which exhibits notable drawbacks: 1) adapter-based methods suffer from pronounced dimension collapse, concentrating information into a few dominant dimensions; 2) SVD-based methods are rigid and manual, considering only a few principal spectral components while discarding rich information in the remaining spectrum. To address these limitations, we propose SpecTran, a spectral-aware transformer-based adapter that operates in the spectral domain, attending to the full spectrum to select and aggregates informative components. A learnable spectral-position encoding injects singular-value cues as an inductive bias, guiding attention toward salient spectral components and promoting diversity across embedding dimensions. Across four real-world datasets and three SR backbones, it consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving an average improvement of 9.17%."

While it is widely known that this makes it less effective for applications involving medical images, the extent to which the metric fails to capture meaningful differences in image characteristics is not obviously known. Here, we use Monte Carlo dropout to compute the predictive variance in the FID as well as a supplemental estimate of the predictive variance in the feature embedding model's latent representations. We show that the magnitudes of the predictive variances considered exhibit varying degrees of correlation with the extent to which test inputs (ImageNet1K validation set augmented at various strengths, and other external datasets) are out-of-distribution relative to its training data, providing some insight into the effectiveness of their use as indicators of the trustworthiness of the FID."

Existing evaluations rely heavily on binary forced-choice prompting, which entangles genuine preferences with artifacts of the elicitation protocol. We systematically study how elicitation protocols affect SvR correlation across 24 LMs. Allowing neutrality and abstention during stated preference elicitation allows us to exclude weak signals, substantially improving Spearman's rank correlation ($ρ$) between volunteered stated preferences and forced-choice revealed preferences. However, further allowing abstention in revealed preferences drives $ρ$ to near-zero or negative values due to high neutrality rates. Finally, we find that system prompt steering using stated preferences during revealed preference elicitation does not reliably improve SvR correlation on AIRiskDilemmas. Together, our results show that SvR correlation is highly protocol-dependent and that preference elicitation requires methods that account for indeterminate preferences."

In our framework the curve degree and number of marked points vary as $d = g + 1 + \\ell$ and $n = g + 3 + 2\\ell$, and we analyze the resulting tropical Tevelev degrees for both positive and negative values of $\\ell$. This tropicalizes results of Cela, Pandharipande, and Schmitt on algebraic Tevelev degrees.

Here, we extend this dynamical systems approach to spatially extended turbulent flows featuring multiple interacting 'substructures', and show how new simple invariant solutions can be constructed by spatial tiling of exact solutions from small-box calculations. Candidate solutions are found via gradient-based optimization of a scalar loss function which targets autorecurrence in spatially-masked regions of the flow. We apply these ideas to a vertically-extended Kolmogorov flow, where we first identify large numbers of relative periodic orbits (RPOs) which are combinations of high-dissipation, small-box solutions with laminar patches. We then show that vertically-stacked combinations of pairs of distinct small-box RPOs can form robust guesses for dynamically-relevant two-tori in the larger domain. Finally, we show how our optimization procedure can identify 'turbulent' trajectories which locally shadow a small-box RPO for multiple periods in a subdomain. These small-box combinations are possible as the flow spends prolonged periods in a regime where it can be effectively considered as a pair of weakly-coupled small-box systems, due to shielding effects associated with higher-dissipation flow structures."

We propose leveraging Brain Foundation Models (BFMs), large pre-trained neural networks, to extract generalizable EEG features for cognitive load estimation. We adapt BFMs for long-term EEG monitoring and show that fine-tuning a small subset of layers yields improved accuracy over the state-of-the-art. Despite their scale, BFMs allow for real-time inference with a longer context window. To address often-overlooked interpretability challenges, we apply Partition SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to quantify feature importance. Our findings reveal consistent emphasis on prefrontal regions linked to cognitive control, while longitudinal trends suggest learning progression.

However, existing approaches overlook a fundamental granularity mismatch between human and machine vision, where deep vision models emphasize semantic invariance by suppressing local texture information, whereas neural signals preserve an intricate mixture of low-level visual attributes and high-level semantic content. To address this mismatch, we propose Shallow Alignment, a novel contrastive learning strategy that aligns neural signals with intermediate representations of visual encoders rather than their final outputs, thereby striking a better balance between low-level texture details and high-level semantic features. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Shallow Alignment significantly outperforms standard final-layer alignment, with performance gains ranging from 22% to 58% across diverse vision backbones. Notably, our approach effectively unlocks the scaling law in neural visual decoding, enabling decoding performance to scale predictably with the capacity of pre-trained vision backbones. We further conduct systematic empirical analyses to shed light on the mechanisms underlying the observed performance gains."

Existing theories of deep Transformers with layer normalization typically predict that tokens cluster to a single point; however, these results rely on deterministic weight assumptions, which fail to capture the standard initialization scheme in Transformers. In this work, we show that accounting for the intrinsic stochasticity of random initialization alters this picture. More precisely, we analyze deep Transformers where noise arises from the random initialization of value matrices. Under diffusion scaling and token-wise RMS normalization, we prove that, as the number of Transformer layers goes to infinity, the discrete token dynamics converge to an interacting-particle system on the sphere where tokens are driven by a \\emph{common} matrix-valued Brownian noise. In this limit, we show that initialization noise prevents the collapse to a single cluster predicted by deterministic models. For two tokens, we prove a phase transition governed by the interaction strength and the token dimension: unlike deterministic attention flows, antipodal configurations become attracting with positive probability. Numerical experiments confirm the predicted transition, reveal that antipodal formations persist for more than two tokens, and demonstrate that suppressing the intrinsic noise degrades accuracy."

Conventional turbulence modeling approaches often struggle to capture the unsteady, coherent structures governing wake behavior, particularly for slender hydrofoils operating at high Reynolds numbers. This study addresses this limitation by combining scale-resolving numerical simulations, including high-resolution Large Eddy Simulation (LES), with Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements to investigate the turbulent wake of a symmetric, blunt trailing-edge hydrofoil operating at zero angle of attack. The flow was analyzed at a Reynolds number of approximately 7.5x10e5, i.e. close to the onset of wake-structure interaction effects. LES was performed using a fine mesh of approximately 500 million nodes to resolve near-wall and wake dynamics beyond the experimental field of view, while PIV measurements provided time-resolved velocity fields downstream of the trailing edge. Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) was applied to the PIV data to extract dominant coherent structures and quantify their contribution to the turbulent kinetic energy. POD analysis reveals that energy is distributed across many modes, with the leading mode capturing the primary wake dynamics and higher modes forming coupled oscillatory pairs associated with von Karman vortex shedding. PIV-LES agreement shows that central wake measurements combined with numerical simulations enables full wake reconstruction and validates modeling for vibration-relevant hydrofoil dynamics."

GBP is widely used due to its efficiency and empirically strong performance in applications like computer vision or sensor networks - even when modelling non-Gaussian problems. In this paper, we seek to provide a theoretical guarantee for when Gaussian approximations are valid in highly non-Gaussian, sparsely-connected factor graphs performing BP (common in spatial AI). We leverage the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) to prove mathematically that variables' beliefs under BP converge to a Gaussian distribution in complex, loopy factor graphs obeying our 4 key assumptions.

In this study, we investigate an alternative approach to achieving broadband SHG by using a standard PPLN crystal containing multiple fixed poling periods. Broadband operation is realized by angle tuning the crystal relative to input beam in free-space. The effect of angle tuning is examined over a range of incident angles, and an 1.6x enhancement in SHG bandwidth is demonstrated.

To overcome the prohibitive latency of iterative dual updates, we propose DeepLaDu, a Lagrangian duality-guided deep learning framework that trains a graph neural network (GNN) to directly infer per-link (edge-level) congestion prices from the constellation state in a single forward pass. We enable scalable and stable training using a subgradient-based edge-level loss in DeepLaDu. We analyze the convergence and computational complexity of the proposed approach and evaluate it using realistic Starlink-like constellations with optical and traffic constraints. Simulation results show that DeepLaDu achieves up to 20\\% higher network throughput than non-joint or heuristic baselines, while matching the performance of iterative dual optimization with orders-of-magnitude lower computation time, suitable for real-time operation in dynamic LEO networks."

Here, using a Bloch coupled-mode theory derived from first principles, we show that the second threshold arises from dynamical couplings among the population inversion, the lasing field, and a dark cavity mode. The lasing-inversion coupling produces extra EPs, whose spectral structure governs switching among single-mode lasing and frequency combs with different repetition rates. This above-threshold mode-switching mechanism enables new opportunities for tunable photonic systems, including adaptive optical communication links and dual-comb spectroscopy."

    "abstract": "Global air quality forecasting grapples with extreme spatial heterogeneity and the poor generalization of existing transductive models to unseen regions. To tackle this, we propose OmniAir, a semantic topology learning framework tailored for global station-level prediction. By encoding invariant physical environmental attributes into generalizable station identities and dynamically constructing adaptive sparse topologies, our approach effectively captures long-range non-Euclidean correlations and physical diffusion patterns across unevenly distributed global networks. We further curate WorldAir, a massive dataset covering over 7,800 stations worldwide. Extensive experiments show that OmniAir achieves state-of-the-art performance against 18 baselines, maintaining high efficiency and scalability with speeds nearly 10 times faster than existing models, while effectively bridging the monitoring gap in data-sparse regions."

Yet, this modularity also creates a \\emph{governance gap}: downstream users can recompose released weights into unauthorized mixtures that bypass safety alignment or licensing terms. Because existing defenses are largely post-hoc and architecture-specific, they provide inconsistent protection across diverse architectures and release formats in practice. To close this gap, we propose \\textsc{Trap}$^{2}$, an architecture-agnostic protection framework that encodes protection into the update during fine-tuning, regardless of whether they are released as adapters or full models. Instead of relying on architecture-dependent approaches, \\textsc{Trap}$^{2}$ uses weight re-scaling as a simple proxy for the merging process. It keeps released weights effective in standalone use, but degrades them under re-scaling that often arises in merging, undermining unauthorized merging."

In this paper, we start by presenting a geometric approach to demystify rewrite-based detection algorithms, revealing their underlying rationale and demonstrating their generalization ability. Building on this insight, we introduce a novel rewrite-based detection algorithm that adaptively learns the distance between the original and rewritten text. Theoretically, we demonstrate that employing an adaptively learned distance function is more effective for detection than using a fixed distance. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments with over 100 settings, and find that our approach demonstrates superior performance over baseline algorithms in the majority of scenarios. In particular, it achieves relative improvements from 57.8\\% to 80.6\\% over the strongest baseline across different target LLMs (e.g., GPT, Claude, and Gemini)."

In this work, we show that utterance-level speech quality predictors can be regularized with a segment-based consistency constraint which notably reduces frame-level stochasticity. We then demonstrate two applications involving frame-level scores: The partial spoof scenario and the detection of synthesis artefacts in two state-of-the-art text-to-speech systems. For the latter, we perform listening tests and confirm that listeners rate segments to be of poor quality more often in the set defined by low frame-level scores than in a random control set."

The mechanisms behind such data-efficient learning remain unclear. Here, we propose a reinforcement learning framework in which an agent encodes continuous physical observation parameters into its state and is trained via episodic switching across closely related observations. With merely two or three observations, the agent acquires robust mechanics intuition that generalizes accurately over wide parameter ranges, substantially beyond the training data, as demonstrated on the brachistochrone and a large-deformation elastic plate. We explain this generalization through a unified theoretical view: it emerges when the learned value function enforces Bellman consistency across neighboring task parameters, rendering the Bellman residual stationary with respect to physical variations. This induces a smooth policy that captures a low-dimensional solution manifold underlying the continuum of tasks. Our work establishes episodic switching as a principled route to artificial mechanics intuition and offers a theoretical link to similar generalization abilities in biological learners."

    "abstract": "Each cycle of a quantum computation requires a quantum state initialisation. For semiconductor-based quantum platforms, initialisation is typically performed via slow microwave processes and usually requires cooling to temperatures where only the lowest quantum level is occupied. In silicon, boron atoms are the most common impurities. They bind holes in orbitals including an effective spin-3/2 ground state as well as excited states analogous to the Rydberg series for hydrogen. Here we show that initialisation temperature demands may be relaxed and speeds increased over a thousand-fold by importing, from atomic physics, the procedure of optical pumping via excited orbital states to preferentially occupy a target ground state spin. Spin relaxation within the orbital ground state of unstrained silicon is too fast to measure for conventional pulsed microwave technology, except at temperatures below 2 K, implying a need not only for fast state preparation but also fast state readout. Circularly polarised ~10 THz photon pulses from a free electron laser meet both needs at temperatures above 3 K: a 9 ps pulse enhances the population of one spin eigenstate for the \"1s\"-like ground state orbital, and the second interrogates this imbalance in spin population. Using parameters given by our data, we calculate that it should be possible to initialise 99% of spins for boron in strained silicon within 250 ps at 3 K. The speedup of both state preparation and measurement gained for THz rather than microwave photons should be explored for the many other solid state quantum systems hosting THz excitations potentially useful as intermediate states."

    "abstract": "We perform fully nonlinear, spherically symmetric numerical simulations of superhorizon false-vacuum-domain (FVD) collapse in a coupled gravity-scalar-fluid system to study primordial black hole (PBH) formation during delayed first-order phase transitions (FOPTs). Using adaptive mesh refinement to resolve the bubble wall, we identify three dynamical outcomes: type B (supercritical) PBHs with an interior baby universe and a bifurcating trapping horizon, type A (subcritical) PBHs with an apparent horizon formed by direct wall collapse, and dispersal with no PBH formation. To separate these three cases, we evaluate two commonly used PBH-formation criteria: the time scale ratio $t_\\mathrm{H}/t_\\mathrm{V}$ (horizon crossing time versus vacuum-energy domination time) and the local density contrast $δ(t_\\mathrm{H})$ at horizon crossing. For the parameter space explored, we find that $t_\\mathrm{H}/t_\\mathrm{V}$ is a more robust predictor of outcome: type B PBHs form when $t_\\mathrm{H}/t_\\mathrm{V} \\gtrsim 1$ (critical range $\\sim 1.1 - 1.6$ in our survey), type A PBHs arise when $t_\\mathrm{H}/t_\\mathrm{V}$ is below this threshold but remains above a lower bound (typical range $\\sim 0.35 - 0.7$), and no-PBH dispersal occurs when $t_\\mathrm{H}/t_\\mathrm{V}$ falls below this lower bound. When a clear thin-wall FVD boundary exists, $δ(t_\\mathrm{H})$ can correspondingly distinguish different outcomes (roughly $δ_c(t_\\mathrm{H}) \\sim 1 - 1.7$ for type B and $δ_c(t_\\mathrm{H}) \\sim 0.35 - 0.5$ for type A), but is highly sensitive to wall structure and model details and thus less universal. These results offer new insights into the dynamics of FVD collapse, quantify practical PBH-formation thresholds, and pave the way for precise predictions of PBH abundance from delayed FOPTs."

To address the limitation, this paper proposes LAP, a large language model (LLM) driven, adaptive planning method, which switches between high-speed driving in low-complexity scenes and precise driving in high-complexity scenes, enabling high qualities of trajectory generation through confined gaps. This is achieved by leveraging LLM for scene understanding and integrating its inference into the joint optimization of mode configuration and motion planning. The joint optimization is solved using tree-search model predictive control and alternating minimization. We implement LAP by Python in Robot Operating System (ROS). High-fidelity simulation results show that the proposed LAP outperforms other benchmarks in terms of both driving time and success rate."

    "abstract": "Web agents hold great potential for automating complex computer tasks, yet their interactions involve long-horizon, sequential decision-making with irreversible actions. In such settings, outcome-based supervision is sparse and delayed, often rewarding incorrect trajectories and failing to support inference-time scaling. This motivates the use of Process Reward Models (WebPRMs) for web navigation, but existing approaches remain limited: scalar WebPRMs collapse progress into coarse, weakly grounded signals, while checklist-based WebPRMs rely on brittle template matching that fails under layout or semantic changes and often mislabels superficially correct actions as successful, providing little insight or interpretability. To address these challenges, we introduce WebArbiter, a reasoning-first, principle-inducing WebPRM that formulates reward modeling as text generation, producing structured justifications that conclude with a preference verdict and identify the action most conducive to task completion under the current context. Training follows a two-stage pipeline: reasoning distillation equips the model with coherent principle-guided reasoning, and reinforcement learning corrects teacher biases by directly aligning verdicts with correctness, enabling stronger generalization. To support systematic evaluation, we release WebPRMBench, a comprehensive benchmark spanning four diverse web environments with rich tasks and high-quality preference annotations. On WebPRMBench, WebArbiter-7B outperforms the strongest baseline, GPT-5, by 9.1 points. In reward-guided trajectory search on WebArena-Lite, it surpasses the best prior WebPRM by up to 7.2 points, underscoring its robustness and practical value in real-world complex web tasks."

The best previously known general lower bound is $H_c(n)\\geq 2n - 1$. In this work, we show that $H_c(n)$ grows at least as fast as $n^2/4.$ Furthermore, we prove that $H_c(n)$ is strictly increasing whenever it is finite, and that in such cases this maximum can be realized by piecewise polynomial systems whose crossing limit cycles are all hyperbolic. Finally, for the more restrictive class of piecewise polynomial Hamiltonian vector fields, we adapt the recursive construction of Christopher and Lloyd to demonstrate that the corresponding maximal number of crossing limit cycles, denoted by $\\widehat{H}_c(n)$, grows at least as fast as $n\\log n/(2\\log 2)$, thereby improving previously established linear growth estimate."

This enables the categorization of streams into degrees of complexity, analogous to Turing degrees in computability theory. We investigate the algebraic properties of the hierarchy that emerges from the partial ordering of degrees, showing that it is not well-founded and not dense, that ultimately periodic streams are ordered by divisibility of their period, that sparse streams are atoms, that maximal streams have maximal subword complexity, and that suprema of sets of streams do not generally exist. We also provide a pseudo-algorithm for classifying streams up to this reducibility."

While surrogate modeling advances computational methods to approximate these dynamics, standard approaches typically require high-fidelity training data. In many practical settings, the data are indirectly observed through noisy and nonlinear measurement. The challenge lies not only in approximating the coefficients of the SDEs, but in simultaneously inferring the posterior updates given the observations. In this work, we present a neural path estimation approach to solve stochastic dynamical systems based on variational inference. We first derive a stochastic control problem that solve filtering posterior path measure corresponding to a pathwise Zakai equation. We then construct a generative model that maps the prior path measure to posterior measure through the controlled diffusion and the associated Randon-Nykodym derivative. Through an amortization of sample paths of the observation process, the control is learned by an embedding of the noisy observation paths. Thus, we learn the unknown prior SDE and the control can recover the conditional path measure given the observation sample paths and we learn an associated SDE which induces the same path measure. In the end, we perform experiments on nonlinear dynamical systems, demonstrating the model's ability to learn multimodal, chaotic, or high dimensional systems."

The model is trained on human annotated multimodal datasets in both languages and applied to approximately 400,000 videos from major news outlets. We analyze engagement levels including views, likes, and comments, representing increasing degrees of commitment. The results show that other condemning rhetoric expressions of moral outrage that criticize others morally consistently increase all forms of engagement across cultures, with effects ranging from passive viewing to active commenting. These findings suggest that moral outrage is a particularly effective emotional strategy, attracting not only attention but also active participation. We discuss concerns about the potential misuse of other condemning rhetoric, as such practices may deepen polarization by reinforcing in group and out group divisions. To facilitate future research and ensure reproducibility, we publicly release our Korean and English multimodal moral emotion classifiers."

This formulation yields a geometric characterization: optimal rank-one measurement vectors are confined to a subspace orthogonal to a state-determined Hermitian span. This provides a direct criterion to construct optimal Positive Operator-Valued Measures(POVMs). We then identify conditions under which the partial commutativity condition proposed in [Phys. Rev.

We evaluate frontier closed-source and open-weight models across multiple agent harnesses, and use an LLM-based grader to score pipeline progress and outcome validity. We find that frontier agents can complete multi-step bioinformatics pipelines without elaborate custom scaffolding, often producing the requested final artifacts reliably. However, robustness tests reveal failure modes under controlled perturbations (corrupted inputs, decoy files, and prompt bloat), indicating that correct high-level pipeline construction does not guarantee reliable step-level reasoning. Finally, because bioinformatics workflows may involve sensitive patient data, proprietary references, or unpublished IP, closed-source models can be unsuitable under strict privacy constraints; in such settings, open-weight models may be preferable despite lower completion rates.

Leveraging the Mixture-of-Transformer architecture, CG-MLLM decouples disparate modeling needs, where the Token-level Autoregressive (TokenAR) Transformer handles token-level content, and the Block-level Autoregressive (BlockAR) Transformer handles block-level content. By integrating a pre-trained vision-language backbone with a specialized 3D VAE latent space, CG-MLLM facilitates long-context interactions between standard tokens and spatial blocks within a single integrated architecture. Experimental results show that CG-MLLM significantly outperforms existing MLLMs in generating high-fidelity 3D objects, effectively bringing high-resolution 3D content creation into the mainstream LLM paradigm."

Our analysis also found a tremendous increase in recent papers on the topic, which highlights that more and more researchers are becoming aware of the need to address ADHD with adults. For the future, we aim to further analyze the corpus and identify research gaps and potentials for further development of ADHD assistive technologies."

    "abstract": "Conical Tensile Membrane Structure (TMS) is commonly used for aesthetics, economic design, high rain and snow loading. Such TMS shows complex aerodynamic behavior in presence of geometric nonlinearity, not adequately studied in the past. The aerodynamic responses of anticlastic conical TMS under random wind loading is presented herein along with an equivalent static wind resistant design approach. The stochastic wind loading on the TMS in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) is simulated via the Large Eddy simulation (LES); which is detailed in a previous study by the authors and hence not repeated here. The aerodynamic loading is then employed as input in conducting the nonlinear time history analyses considering open (i.e. without facade) and closed (with facade) TMS, supported by peripheral/radial cables. The influence of the key parameters (aerodynamic roughness height, the rise-span ratio of the TMS and the membrane prestress, notably) are demonstrated. Although increasing prestress and rise-to-span ratio enhances the stiffness of TMS, the former shows dominance. Increasing roughness height also lead to increased peak loading/responses by enhanced turbulence. An equivalent static wind-resistant design is presented via the Gust Response Factors (GRFs) and an additional Nonlinear Adjustment Factors (NAFs). These factors are presented systematically, encompassing alternative scenarios. Multi-linear regression models are presented for predictive modeling of these factors, along with a probabilistic analysis for their design values that can be employed in practice bypassing an involved nonlinear dynamic analysis."

We present the discovery of two inner rocky planets in the TOI-237 and TOI-4336 A systems, confirmed with ground-based photometry from the TRAPPIST, SPECULOOS, ExTrA, and LCO facilities. TOI-237 c has a radius of 1.21 +/- 0.04Re, orbits its mid-M host star every 1.74 days, and is close to a 3:1 mean-motion resonance with TOI-237 b. TOI-4336 A c has a radius of 1.17 +/- 0.06Re, and orbits with a period of 7.58 days an M3.5 host star which is part of a hierarchical triple system. We performed model comparison to search for non-zero eccentricities, and found that the circular transit models are statistically favored. Dynamical simulations show that both systems are in stable configurations, and the TTVs expected for the TOI-237 system are of the order of seconds. TOI-237 c and TOI-4336 A c join the high-interest population of warm likely super-Earths below the so-called \"radius valley\". In particular, TOI-237 c is a good candidate for phase curve observations with JWST/MIRI thanks to the small radius of the host star and its short period."

We present PRISM (Polynomial-fitting and Randomized Iterative Sketching for Matrix functions computation), a general framework for accelerating iterative algorithms for computing matrix functions. PRISM combines adaptive polynomial approximation with randomized sketching: at each iteration, it fits a polynomial surrogate to the current spectrum via a sketched least-squares problem, adapting to the instance at hand with minimal overhead. We apply PRISM to accelerate Newton-Schulz-like iterations for matrix square roots and orthogonalization, which are core primitives in machine learning. Unlike prior methods, PRISM requires no explicit spectral bounds or singular value estimates; and it adapts automatically to the evolving spectrum. Empirically, PRISM accelerates training when integrated into Shampoo and Muon optimizers."

While this literature shows that there is an area where model representations are similar, we study here how vision models might get to those representations -- in particular, do they also converge to the same intermediate steps and operations? We therefore study the processes that lead to convergent representations in different models. First, we quantify distance between different model representations at different stages. We follow the evolution of distances between models throughout processing, identifying the processing steps which are most different between models. We find that while layers at similar positions in different models have the most similar representations, strong differences remain. Classifier models, unlike the others, will discard information about low-level image statistics in their final layers. CNN- and transformer-based models also behave differently, with transformer models applying smoother changes to representations from one layer to the next. These distinctions clarify the level and nature of convergence between model representations, and enables a more qualitative account of the underlying processes in image models."

A detector that flags a violation at step 8 enables intervention; one that reports it at step 48 provides only forensic value. This distinction is critical, yet current benchmarks cannot measure it. We introduce StepShield, the first benchmark to evaluate when violations are detected, not just whether. StepShield contains 9,213 code agent trajectories, including 1,278 meticulously annotated training pairs and a 7,935-trajectory test set with a realistic 8.1% rogue rate. Rogue behaviors are grounded in real-world security incidents across six categories. We propose three novel temporal metrics: Early Intervention Rate (EIR), Intervention Gap, and Tokens Saved. Surprisingly, our evaluation reveals that an LLM-based judge achieves 59% EIR while a static analyzer achieves only 26%, a 2.3x performance gap that is entirely invisible to standard accuracy metrics. We further show that early detection has direct economic benefits: our cascaded HybridGuard detector reduces monitoring costs by 75% and projects to $108M in cumulative savings over five years at enterprise scale. By shifting the focus of evaluation from whether to when, StepShield provides a new foundation for building safer and more economically viable AI agents.

However, they suffer from a fundamental capability gap: unlike frontier large models, they lack the inference-time strong generalization to work with complicated, unfamiliar codebases. We identify that the prevailing Task-Centric Learning (TCL) paradigm, which scales exposure across disparate repositories, fails to address this limitation. In response, we propose Repository-Centric Learning (RCL), a paradigm shift that prioritizes vertical repository depth over horizontal task breadth, suggesting SLMs must internalize the \"physics\" of a target software environment through parametric knowledge acquisition, rather than attempting to recover it via costly inference-time search. Following this new paradigm, we design a four-unit Repository-Centric Experience, transforming static codebases into interactive learning signals, to train SWE-Spot-4B, a family of highly compact models built as repo-specialized experts that breaks established scaling trends, outperforming open-weight models up to larger (e.g., CWM by Meta, Qwen3-Coder-30B) and surpassing/matching efficiency-focused commercial models (e.g., GPT-4.1-mini, GPT-5-nano) across multiple SWE tasks. Further analysis reveals that RCL yields higher training sample efficiency and lower inference costs, emphasizing that for building efficient intelligence, repository mastery is a distinct and necessary dimension that complements general coding capability."

    "abstract": "The escalating sophistication of phishing emails necessitates a shift beyond traditional rule-based and conventional machine-learning-based detectors. Although large language models (LLMs) offer strong natural language understanding, using them as standalone classifiers often yields elevated falsepositive (FP) rates, which mislabel legitimate emails as phishing and create significant operational burden. This paper presents a personalized phishing detection framework that integrates LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). For each message, the system constructs user-specific context by retrieving a compact set of the user's historical legitimate emails and enriching it with real-time domain and URL reputation from a cyber-threat intelligence platform, then conditions the LLM's decision on this evidence. We evaluate four open-source LLMs (Llama4-Scout, DeepSeek-R1, Mistral-Saba, and Gemma2) on an email dataset collected from public and institutional sources. Results show high performance; for example, Llama4-Scout attains an F1-score of 0.9703 and achieves a 66.7% reduction in FPs with RAG. These findings validate that a RAG-based, user-profiling approach is both feasible and effective for building high-precision, low-friction email security systems that adapt to individual communication patterns."

Using the method of Hilbert expansion, we first derive a bi-Maxwellian determined by the Euler-Poisson system of two fluids. To justify the convergence of the solution rigorously as the Knudsen number tends to zero, we sequentially calculate the first $2k-1$ terms of the expansion series $(k \\geq 6)$, and then truncate it, and express the solution as the sum of these first $2k-1$ terms and a remainder term. Within the framework of the $L_{x,v}^2-W_{x,v}^{1,\\infty}$ interplay established by Guo and Jang \\cite{[ininp]Guo2010CMP}, we construct a new weight function to estimate the remainder term in four different cases regarding the potential $γ$. Here, the particle masses $m^A, m^B > 0$ and their charges $e^A, e^B$ can be given arbitrarily. This causes the collision operator to exhibit asymmetric effects ($m^A \\neq m^B$), rendering the system of equations impossible to decouple. So, it adds difficulties to both $L^2$, $L^{\\infty}$ estimates for the remainder. Therefore, we adopt the framework of vector-valued functions and analyze the velocity decay rate of the operator $K_{M,2,w}^{α,c}$ to eliminate the singularity induced by small parameters in characteristic line iterations. Our results show that the validity time of the solution is $O(\\varepsilon^{-y})$, where $y$ is $-\\frac{2k-3}{2(2k-1)}$ when $-1 \\leq γ\\leq 1$, and it becomes $-\\frac{2k-3}{(1-γ)(2k-1)}$, when $-3 < γ< -1$.

Building on this insight, we propose the Less Noise Sampling Framework (LENS), which first prompts by identifying and removing interference tokens. then transfers successful rollouts from the purification process to supervise policy optimization on the original noisy prompts, enabling the model to learn to ignore interference in the real-world, noisy prompting settings. Experimental results show that LENS significantly outperforms GRPO, delivering higher performance and faster convergence, with a 3.88% average gain and over 1.6$\\times$ speedup.

Consequently, existing methods often discard promising algorithms due to uncalibrated constants and suffer from premature convergence resulting from simple similarity metrics. To address these limitations, we propose TIDE, a Tuning-Integrated Dynamic Evolution framework designed to decouple structural reasoning from parameter optimization. TIDE features a nested architecture where an outer parallel island model utilizes Tree Similarity Edit Distance to drive structural diversity, while an inner loop integrates LLM-based logic generation with a differential mutation operator for parameter tuning. Additionally, a UCB-based scheduler dynamically prioritizes high-yield prompt strategies to optimize resource allocation. Extensive experiments across nine combinatorial optimization problems demonstrate that TIDE discovers heuristics that significantly outperform state-of-the-art baselines in solution quality while achieving improved search efficiency and reduced computational costs."

In this paper, we introduce MGSM-Pro, an extension of MGSM dataset with GSM-Symbolic approach. Our dataset provides five instantiations per MGSM question by varying names, digits and irrelevant context. Evaluations across nine languages reveal that many low-resource languages suffer large performance drops when tested on digit instantiations different from those in the original test set. We further find that some proprietary models, notably Gemini 2.5 Flash and GPT-4.1, are less robust to digit instantiation, whereas Claude 4.0 Sonnet is more robust. Among open models, GPT-OSS 120B and DeepSeek V3 show stronger robustness.

This paper introduces LAMP, a black-box method for learning Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs) targeting multi-image MLLMs. LAMP applies an attention-based constraint that prevents the model from effectively aggregating information across images. LAMP also introduces a novel cross-image contagious constraint that forces perturbed tokens to influence clean tokens, spreading adversarial effects without requiring all inputs to be modified. Additionally, an index-attention suppression loss enables a robust position-invariant attack.

Although AKT is a multidomain serine/threonine kinase composed of an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and a C-terminal kinase domain, how these domains cooperate to regulate AKT activation on membranes remains unclear at the molecular level. Here, using molecular dynamics simulations of full-length AKT on PIP$_3$-containing lipid bilayers, we identify four distinct membrane-binding modes that differ in the orientations and membrane contacts of the PH and kinase domains. In addition to PIP$_3$ binding to the PH domain, we observe specific PIP$_3$ interactions with basic residues in the kinase domain. In the most stable mode, PIP$_3$ interacts with both the canonical and a secondary binding site in the PH domain, while the kinase domain adopts an orientation in which the activation-loop phosphorylation site is exposed to the solvent. Interestingly, the populations of these binding modes depend on the PIP$_3$ concentration in the membrane, leading to changes in the preferred orientation of AKT. These findings shed light on how lipid recognition by the PH domain and the kinase domain of AKT cooperatively shape its membrane-bound conformations."

In this work, we explore embedding scaling as a potent, orthogonal dimension for scaling sparsity. Through a comprehensive analysis and experiments, we identify specific regimes where embedding scaling achieves a superior Pareto frontier compared to expert scaling. We systematically characterize the critical architectural factors governing this efficacy -- ranging from parameter budgeting to the interplay with model width and depth. Moreover, by integrating tailored system optimizations and speculative decoding, we effectively convert this sparsity into tangible inference speedups. Guided by these insights, we introduce LongCat-Flash-Lite, a 68.5B parameter model with ~3B activated trained from scratch. Despite allocating over 30B parameters to embeddings, LongCat-Flash-Lite not only surpasses parameter-equivalent MoE baselines but also exhibits exceptional competitiveness against existing models of comparable scale, particularly in agentic and coding domains."

ZipMoE exploits the synergy between the hardware properties of edge devices and the statistical redundancy inherent to MoE parameters via a caching-scheduling co-design with provable performance guarantee. Fundamentally, our design shifts the paradigm of on-device MoE inference from an I/O-bound bottleneck to a compute-centric workflow that enables efficient parallelization. We implement a prototype of ZipMoE and conduct extensive experiments on representative edge computing platforms using popular open-source MoE models and real-world workloads.

This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of bugs in real-world TypeScript projects. We analyze 633 bug reports from 16 popular open-source repositories to construct a taxonomy of fault types, quantify their prevalence, and relate them to project characteristics such as size, domain, and dependency composition. Our results reveal a fault landscape dominated not by logic or syntax errors but by tooling and configuration faults, API misuses, and asynchronous error-handling issues. We show that these categories correlate strongly with build complexity and dependency heterogeneity, indicating that modern failures often arise at integration and orchestration boundaries rather than within algorithmic logic. A longitudinal comparison with JavaScript studies shows that while static typing in TypeScript has reduced traditional runtime and type errors, it has shifted fragility toward build systems and toolchains. These findings offer new insight into how language design and ecosystem evolution reshape the fault profiles of large-scale software systems."

To localize and quantify this behavior, we introduce \\emph{sycophantic anchors} -- sentences that causally lock models into user agreement. Analyzing over 10,000 counterfactual rollouts on a distilled reasoning model, we show that anchors can be reliably detected and quantified mid-inference. Linear probes distinguish sycophantic anchors with 84.6\\% balanced accuracy, while activation-based regressors predict the magnitude of the commitment ($R^2 = 0.74$). We further observe asymmetry where sycophantic anchors are significantly more distinguishable than correct reasoning anchors, and find that sycophancy builds gradually during reasoning, revealing a potential window for intervention. These results offer sentence-level mechanisms for localizing model misalignment mid-inference."

In this work, we consider a new method of examining this degeneracy based upon hadron correlation functions on the anisotropic FASTSUM ensembles. The anisotropic nature and our newest Generation 3 ensembles aid in a determination of the effective restoration of the $U(1)_A$ symmetry which we find to be $T_{U(1)_A} \\sim 320$ MeV, well above the chiral transition temperature, which is $T_{\\rm pc} \\sim 180$ MeV for our choice of Wilson-Clover fermions."

The trapezoidal and midpoint rules are adopted for the temporal integration of the scattering and migration terms under the framework of finite volume method, respectively. Instead of direct numerical interpolation, the kinetic equation is solved again when reconstructing the interfacial flux, in order to realize the coupling of phonon migration and scattering within a numerical time step. Specifically, the finite difference scheme is introduced and the second-order upwind or central schemes are used for the reconstruction of the interfacial distribution function and its spatial gradient. Consequently, the cell size and time step of the present method could be larger than the phonon mean free path and relaxation time in the limit of small Knudsen numbers. Numerical tests demonstrate that the present method can accurately capture multi-scale thermal conduction phenomena within different normal or resistive scattering rates."

The comparison of new and precise theoretical predictions for $G_A$ with future experimental data necessitates the application of radiative corrections to experimentally-observable processes.

This representation is particularly problematic for advection, where long-range transport must be treated with expensive global interaction mechanisms or through deep, stacked convolutional layers. To mitigate this, we present PARADIS, a physics-inspired global weather prediction model that imposes inductive biases on network behavior through a functional decomposition into advection, diffusion, and reaction blocks acting on latent variables. We implement advection through a Neural Semi-Lagrangian operator that performs trajectory-based transport via differentiable interpolation on the sphere, enabling end-to-end learning of both the latent modes to be transported and their characteristic trajectories. Diffusion-like processes are modeled through depthwise-separable spatial mixing, while local source terms and vertical interactions are modeled via pointwise channel interactions, enabling operator-level physical structure. PARADIS provides state-of-the-art forecast skill at a fraction of the training cost. On ERA5-based benchmarks, the 1 degree PARADIS model, with a total training cost of less than a GPU month, meets or exceeds the performance of 0.25 degree traditional and machine-learning baselines, including the ECMWF HRES forecast and DeepMind's GraphCast."

PoLR clusters short prefixes of reasoning traces, identifies the dominant cluster, and expands all paths in that cluster, preserving the accuracy benefits of SC while substantially reducing token usage and latency. Our theoretical analysis, framed via mutual information and entropy, explains why early reasoning steps encode strong signals predictive of final correctness. Empirically, PoLR consistently matches or exceeds SC across GSM8K, MATH500, AIME24/25, and GPQA-DIAMOND, reducing token usage by up to 60% and wall-clock latency by up to 50%. Moreover, PoLR is fully complementary to adaptive inference methods (e.g., Adaptive Consistency, Early-Stopping SC) and can serve as a drop-in pre-filter, making SC substantially more efficient and scalable without requiring model fine-tuning."

In this paper, we present a unified, delay-aware framework that models this coupling explicitly and quantifies a delay-dependent information gain, motivating an information-per-joule scheduling objective beyond age of information proxies (AoI). To this end, we first introduce an efficient posterior-fusion update that incorporates delayed measurements without state augmentation, providing a consistent approximation to optimal delayed Kalman updates, and then derive tractable stability conditions ensuring that bounded estimation error is achievable under stochastic, delayed scheduling. This conditions highlight the need for unstable modes to be observable across sensors. Building on this foundation, we cast scheduling as a Markov decision process and develop a proximal policy optimization (PPO) scheduler that learns directly from interaction, requires no prior delay model, and explicitly trades off estimation accuracy, freshness, sensor heterogeneity, and transmission energy through normalized rewards. In simulations with heterogeneous sensors, realistic link-energy models, and random delays, the proposed method learns stably and consistently achieves lower estimation error at comparable energy than random scheduling and strong RL baselines (DQN, A2C), while remaining robust to variations in measurement availability and process/measurement noise."

Unlike classical multi-fidelity BAI, the proxy is biased (arm- and context-dependent) and ground truth is selectively observed. Consequently, standard multi-fidelity methods can mis-select the best arm, and uniform auditing, though accurate, wastes scarce resources and is inefficient. We prove that without bias correction and propensity adjustment, mis-selection probability may not vanish (even with unlimited proxy data). We then develop an estimator for the mean of each arm that combines proxy scores with inverse-propensity-weighted residuals and form anytime-valid confidence sequences for that estimator. Based on the estimator and confidence sequence, we propose an algorithm that adaptively selects and audits arms. The algorithm concentrates audits on unreliable contexts and close arms and we prove that a plug-in Neyman rule achieves near-oracle audit efficiency. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical guarantees and demonstrate the superior empirical performance of the proposed algorithm."

Despite clustering topic models' apparent success, we identify a number of issues in Top2Vec and BERTopic, which remain largely unsolved. Firstly, these approaches are unreliable at discovering natural clusters in corpora, due to extreme sensitivity to sample size and hyperparameters, the default values of which result in suboptimal behaviour. Secondly, when estimating term importance, BERTopic ignores the semantic distance of keywords to topic vectors, while Top2Vec ignores word counts in the corpus. This results in, on the one hand, less coherent topics due to the presence of stop words and junk words, and lack of variety and trust on the other. In this paper, I introduce a new approach, \\textbf{Topeax}, which discovers the number of clusters from peaks in density estimates, and combines lexical and semantic indices of term importance to gain high-quality topic keywords. Topeax is demonstrated to be better at both cluster recovery and cluster description than Top2Vec and BERTopic, while also exhibiting less erratic behaviour in response to changing sample size and hyperparameters."

To this end, we propose Reconstruction-based Temporal Deepfake Localization (RT-DeepLoc), a weakly supervised temporal forgery localization framework that identifies forgeries via reconstruction errors. Our framework uses a Masked Autoencoder (MAE) trained exclusively on authentic data to learn its intrinsic spatiotemporal patterns; this allows the model to produce significant reconstruction discrepancies for forged segments, effectively providing the missing fine-grained cues for localization. To robustly leverage these indicators, we introduce a novel Asymmetric Intra-video Contrastive Loss (AICL). By focusing on the compactness of authentic features guided by these reconstruction cues, AICL establishes a stable decision boundary that enhances local discrimination while preserving generalization to unseen forgeries. Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets, including LAV-DF, demonstrate that RT-DeepLoc achieves state-of-the-art performance in weakly-supervised temporal forgery localization."

Specifically, for any given test sample, PT probabilistically returns an interval, which is either null or constructed using an adjusted confidence level, thereby preserving marginal coverage. While PT potentially yields a deceptively lower interval length, it introduces practical vulnerabilities: the same input can yield completely different prediction intervals across repeated runs of the algorithm. We formally derive the conditions under which PT achieves these misleading improvements and provides extensive empirical evidence across various regression and classification tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a new metric interval stability which helps detect whether a new CP method implicitly improves the length based on such PT-like techniques."

    "abstract": "Illicit financial activities such as money laundering often manifest through recurrent topological patterns in transaction networks. Detecting these patterns automatically remains challenging due to the scarcity of labeled real-world data and strict privacy constraints. To address this, we investigate whether Graph Autoencoders (GAEs) can effectively learn and distinguish topological patterns that mimic money laundering operations when trained on synthetic data. The analysis consists of two phases: (i) data generation, where synthetic samples are created for seven well-known illicit activity patterns using parametrized generators that preserve structural consistency while introducing realistic variability; and (ii) model training and validation, where separate GAEs are trained on each pattern without explicit labels, relying solely on reconstruction error as an indicator of learned structure. We compare three GAE implementations based on three distinct convolutional layers: Graph Convolutional (GAE-GCN), GraphSAGE (GAE-SAGE), and Graph Attention Network (GAE-GAT). Experimental results show that GAE-GCN achieves the most consistent reconstruction performance across patterns, while GAE-SAGE and GAE-GAT exhibit competitive results only in few specific patterns. These findings suggest that graph-based representation learning on synthetic data provides a viable path toward developing AI-driven tools for detecting illicit behaviors, overcoming the limitations of financial datasets."

All the stars were observed with the FLAMES high-resolution multi-object spectrograph mounted at the VLT. Our analysis confirmed the presence of a large metallicity range in M 54, with the majority of the stars having -1.8 < [Fe/H] < -1.0 dex and few stars with [Fe/H] > -1.0 dex. The mean value of the total sample is [Fe/H] = -1.40 (σ = 0.22 dex). A Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis revealed that the observed spread in [Fe/H] is compatible with a non-null intrinsic iron dispersion. We also found that the metallicity distribution function and the broadening of the red giant branch of M 54 are not compatible with a single age, but instead they suggest a wide age range from ~ 13 Gyr to ~ 1 - 2 Gyr or a smaller age range if a significant He enhancement (Y ~ 0.35/0.40) is present in the most metal-rich stars. We identified among the stars in M 54 the entire pattern of anticorrelations linked to the MgAl burning cycle. In particular, the metal-rich component displays a higher level of H-burning with the presence of more extended anticorrelations than the metal-poor component. No Mg-poor ([Mg/Fe]<0.0 dex) stars are identified in M 54. The evidence collected so far cannot be explained neither with a globular cluster-like scenario nor with a galactic chemical evolution. The chemical properties of M 54 can be explained within a scenario where this system formed through the merging of two globular clusters, the metal-poor one with standard characteristics and the more metal-rich one with more pronounced chemical anomalies, a possibly younger than the first one. M 54 is confirmed as a key stellar system for explaining the chemical evolution of a nuclear star cluster."

    "abstract": "Driven by the evolution toward 6G and AI-native edge intelligence, network operations increasingly require predictive and risk-aware adaptation under stringent computation and latency constraints. Network Traffic Matrix (TM), which characterizes flow volumes between nodes, is a fundamental signal for proactive traffic engineering. However, accurate TM forecasting remains challenging due to the stochastic, non-linear, and bursty nature of network dynamics. Existing discriminative models often suffer from over-smoothing and provide limited uncertainty awareness, leading to poor fidelity under extreme bursts. To address these limitations, we propose LEAD, a Large Language Model (LLM)-Enhanced Adapter-based conditional Diffusion model. First, LEAD adopts a \"Traffic-to-Image\" paradigm to transform traffic matrices into RGB images, enabling global dependency modeling via vision backbones. Then, we design a \"Frozen LLM with Trainable Adapter\" model, which efficiently captures temporal semantics with limited computational cost. Moreover, we propose a Dual-Conditioning Strategy to precisely guide a diffusion model to generate complex, dynamic network traffic matrices. Experiments on the Abilene and GEANT datasets demonstrate that LEAD outperforms all baselines. On the Abilene dataset, LEAD attains a remarkable 45.2% reduction in RMSE against the best baseline, with the error margin rising only marginally from 0.1098 at one-step to 0.1134 at 20-step predictions. Meanwhile, on the GEANT dataset, LEAD achieves a 0.0258 RMSE at 20-step prediction horizon which is 27.3% lower than the best baseline."

Specifically, we consider the Dynamically Orthogonal (DO) method for DLRA proposed and analyzed in arXiv:2308.11581v4, which consists of a linear combination of products between deterministic orthonormal modes and stochastic modes, both time-dependent. The first strategy we consider for numerical time-integration is very standard, consisting in a forward discretization in time of both deterministic and stochastic components. Its convergence is proven subject to a time-step restriction dependent on the smallest singular value of the Gram matrix associated to the stochastic modes. Under the same condition on the time-step, this smallest singular value is shown to be always positive, provided that the SDE under study is driven by a non-degenerate noise. The second and the third algorithms, on the other hand, are staggered ones, in which we alternately update the deterministic and the stochastic modes in half steps. These approaches are shown to be more stable than the first one and allow us to obtain convergence results without the aforementioned restriction on the time-step. Computational experiments support theoretical results. In this work we do not consider the discretization in probability, which will be the topic of Part II."

    "abstract": "Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for multi-view reconstruction, complementing classical photogrammetric pipelines based on Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo (MVS). However, their reliability for quantitative 3D analysis in dense, self-occluding scenes remains poorly understood. In this study, we identify a fundamental failure mode of implicit density fields under heavy occlusion, which we term Interior Geometric Degradation (IGD). We show that transmittance-based volumetric optimization satisfies photometric supervision by reconstructing hollow or fragmented structures rather than solid interiors, leading to systematic instance undercounting. Through controlled experiments on synthetic datasets with increasing occlusion, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art mask-supervised NeRFs saturate at approximately 89% instance recovery in dense scenes, despite improved surface coherence and mask quality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce an explicit geometric pipeline based on Sparse Voxel Rasterization (SVRaster), initialized from SfM feature geometry. By projecting 2D instance masks onto an explicit voxel grid and enforcing geometric separation via recursive splitting, our approach preserves physical solidity and achieves a 95.8% recovery rate in dense clusters. A sensitivity analysis using degraded segmentation masks further shows that explicit SfM-based geometry is substantially more robust to supervision failure, recovering 43% more instances than implicit baselines. These results demonstrate that explicit geometric priors are a prerequisite for reliable quantitative analysis in highly self-occluding 3D scenes."

We introduce ConceptMoE, which dynamically merges semantically similar tokens into concept representations, performing implicit token-level compute allocation. A learnable chunk module identifies optimal boundaries by measuring inter-token similarity, compressing sequences by a target ratio $R$ before they enter the compute-intensive concept model. Crucially, the MoE architecture enables controlled evaluation: we reallocate saved computation to match baseline activated FLOPs (excluding attention map computation) and total parameters, isolating genuine architectural benefits. Under these conditions, ConceptMoE consistently outperforms standard MoE across language and vision-language tasks, achieving +0.9 points on language pretraining, +2.3 points on long context understanding, and +0.6 points on multimodal benchmarks. When converting pretrained MoE during continual training with layer looping, gains reach +5.5 points, demonstrating practical applicability. Beyond performance, ConceptMoE reduces attention computation by up to $R^2\\times$ and KV cache by $R\\times$. At $R=2$, empirical measurements show prefill speedups reaching 175\\% and decoding speedups up to 117\\% on long sequences. The minimal architectural modifications enable straightforward integration into existing MoE, demonstrating that adaptive concept-level processing fundamentally improves both effectiveness and efficiency of large language models."

Recent studies have thus pursued making System 2 models more efficient. However, these approaches focused on output control, limiting what models produce. We argue that this paradigm is misaligned: output length is merely a symptom of the model's cognitive configuration, not the root cause. In this work, we shift the focus to capability control, which modulates \\textit{how models think} rather than \\textit{what they produce}. To realize this, we leverage existing Instruct and Thinking checkpoints through dynamic parameter interpolation, without additional training. Our pilot study establishes that linear interpolation yields a convex, monotonic Pareto frontier, underpinned by representation continuity and structural connectivity. Building on this, we propose \\textbf{DAMI} (\\textbf{D}yn\\textbf{A}mic \\textbf{M}odel \\textbf{I}nterpolation), a framework that estimates a query-specific Reasoning Intensity $λ(q)$ to configure cognitive depth. For training-based estimation, we develop a preference learning method encoding accuracy and efficiency criteria. For zero-shot deployment, we introduce a confidence-based method leveraging inter-model cognitive discrepancy. Experiments on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that DAMI achieves higher accuracy than the Thinking model while remaining efficient, effectively combining the efficiency of System 1 with the reasoning depth of System 2."

Statsformer overcomes both limitations through a guardrailed ensemble architecture. We embed LLM-derived feature priors within an ensemble of linear and nonlinear learners, adaptively calibrating their influence via cross-validation. This design yields a flexible system with an oracle-style guarantee that it performs no worse than any convex combination of its in-library base learners, up to statistical error. Empirically, informative priors yield consistent performance improvements, while uninformative or misspecified LLM guidance is automatically downweighted, mitigating the impact of hallucinations across a diverse range of prediction tasks."

Despite advances in zero-shot perception and reasoning from vision-language models, existing navigation systems still rely on single-pass scoring at the decision layer, leading to overconfident long-horizon errors and redundant exploration. To tackle these problems, we propose Dual-Stance Cooperative Debate Navigation (DSCD-Nav), a decision mechanism that replaces one-shot scoring with stance-based cross-checking and evidence-aware arbitration to improve action reliability under partial observability. Specifically, given the same observation and candidate action set, we explicitly construct two stances by conditioning the evaluation on diverse and complementary objectives: a Task-Scene Understanding (TSU) stance that prioritizes goal progress from scene-layout cues, and a Safety-Information Balancing (SIB) stance that emphasizes risk and information value. The stances conduct a cooperative debate and make policy by cross-checking their top candidates with cue-grounded arguments. Then, a Navigation Consensus Arbitration (NCA) agent is employed to consolidate both sides' reasons and evidence, optionally triggering lightweight micro-probing to verify uncertain choices, preserving NCA's primary intent while disambiguating. Experiments on HM3Dv1, HM3Dv2, and MP3D demonstrate consistent improvements in success and path efficiency while reducing exploration redundancy."

Bivariate vine copula based models, a bivariate gradient boosted version of ensemble model output statistics (EMOS), and a bivariate distributional regression network (DRN) are compared to bivariate EMOS. The case study indicates that the novel bivariate methods improve over the bivariate EMOS approaches. The bivariate DRN and the most flexible version of the bivariate vine copula approach exhibit the best performance in terms of verification scores and calibration."

We uncover a previously overlooked temporal self-similarity exhibited in multiple quantities, including the cluster size changes and merged cluster sizes during bond addition, as well as the number of simultaneously merging clusters. We identify large-scale cascade events in which a single bond addition triggers the merger of an extensive number of clusters that scales with system size with inverse correlation-length exponent. Using an event-based ensemble approach, we obtain high-precision estimates of the critical point $p_c = 0.660\\,277\\,8(10)$, the inverse correlation-length exponent $1/ν= 0.850(3)$, and the fractal dimension $d_f = 1.850(2)$, representing substantial improvements over existing values."

Building on GPU-accelerated physics simulation, we instantiate a set of single-shot manipulation tasks and achieve over 95% task success with Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)-based reinforcement learning in less than 1M environment steps, under continuously varying grasping conditions from step 1. This empirically shows faster convergence than representative state-of-the-art visual baselines under the same open-loop single-shot conditions.

However, when rewards are sparse, naive exploration strategies, like noise injection, are often insufficient. Intrinsic rewards can also provide principled guidance for exploration by, for example, combining them with extrinsic rewards to optimize a policy or using them to train subpolicies for hierarchical learning. However, the former approach suffers from unstable credit assignment, while the latter exhibits sample inefficiency and sub-optimality. We propose a policy optimization framework that leverages multiple intrinsic rewards to directly optimize a policy for an extrinsic reward without pretraining subpolicies. Our algorithm -- intrinsic reward policy optimization (IRPO) -- achieves this by using a surrogate policy gradient that provides a more informative learning signal than the true gradient in sparse-reward environments. We demonstrate that IRPO improves performance and sample efficiency relative to baselines in discrete and continuous environments, and formally analyze the optimization problem solved by IRPO.

    "abstract": "The Job-Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP), under various forms of manufacturing uncertainty, has recently attracted considerable research attention. Most existing studies focus on parameter uncertainty, such as variable processing times, and typically adopt the actor-critic framework. In this paper, we explore a different but prevalent form of uncertainty in JSSP: structural uncertainty. Structural uncertainty arises when a job may follow one of several routing paths, and the selection is determined not by policy, but by situational factors (e.g., the quality of intermediate products) that cannot be known in advance. Existing methods struggle to address this challenge due to incorrect credit assignment: a high-quality action may be unfairly penalized if it is followed by a time-consuming path. To address this problem, we propose a novel method named UP-AAC. In contrast to conventional actor-critic methods, UP-AAC employs an asymmetric architecture. While its actor receives a standard stochastic state, the critic is crucially provided with a deterministic state reconstructed in hindsight. This design allows the critic to learn a more accurate value function, which in turn provides a lower-variance policy gradient to the actor, leading to more stable learning. In addition, we design an attention-based Uncertainty Perception Model (UPM) to enhance the actor's scheduling decisions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in reducing makespan on benchmark instances."

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are revolutionizing fields such as medicine, drug discovery, and materials science; however, many technologists and policymakers are also concerned about the technology's risks. To date, most concrete policies around AI governance have focused on managing AI risk by considering the amount of compute required to operate or build a given AI system. However, low-compute AI systems are becoming increasingly more performant - and more dangerous. Driven by agentic workflows, parameter quantization, and other model compression techniques, capabilities once only achievable on frontier-level systems have diffused into low-resource models deployable on consumer devices. In this report, we profile this trend by downloading historical benchmark performance data for over 5,000 large language models (LLMs) hosted on HuggingFace, noting the model size needed to achieve competitive LLM benchmarks has decreased by more than 10X over the past year. We then simulate the computational resources needed for an actor to launch a series of digital societal harm campaigns - such as disinformation botnets, sexual extortion schemes, voice-cloning fraud, and others - using low-compute open-source models and find nearly all studied campaigns can easily be executed on consumer-grade hardware. This position paper argues that protection measures for high-compute models leave serious security holes for their low-compute counterparts, meaning it is urgent both policymakers and technologists make greater efforts to understand and address this emerging class of threats."

However, existing methods typically operate in a myopic fashion that only evaluates executed actions, leading to inefficient parameter updates due to the sparsity of failure events (e.g., obstacle nearness or collision). To cope with this issue, we propose to extend evaluation from executed to non-executed actions, yielding a hierarchical proactive tuning (HPTune) framework that combines both a fast-level tuning and a slow-level tuning. The fast one adopts risk indicators of predictive closing speed and predictive proximity distance, and the slow one leverages an extended evaluation loss for closed-loop backpropagation. Additionally, we integrate HPTune with the Doppler LiDAR that provides obstacle velocities apart from position-only measurements for enhanced motion predictions, thus facilitating the implementation of HPTune. Extensive experiments on high-fidelity simulator demonstrate that HPTune achieves efficient MPC tuning and outperforms various baseline schemes in complex environments. It is found that HPTune enables situation-tailored motion planning by formulating a safe, agile collision avoidance strategy."

The prevailing approach to addressing these issues involves collecting expensive, carefully curated datasets and applying multiple stages of fine-tuning and alignment. However, even this complex pipeline cannot guarantee the correction of patterns learned during pretraining. Therefore, addressing these issues during pretraining is crucial, as it shapes a model's core behaviors and prevents unsafe or hallucinated outputs from becoming deeply embedded. To tackle this issue, we introduce a new pretraining method that streams documents and uses reinforcement learning (RL) to improve the next K generated tokens at each step. A strong, post-trained model judges candidate generations -- including model rollouts, the original suffix, and a rewritten suffix -- for quality, safety, and factuality. Early in training, the process relies on the original and rewritten suffixes; as the model improves, RL rewards high-quality rollouts. This approach builds higher quality, safer, and more factual models from the ground up. In experiments, our method gives 36.2% and 18.5% relative improvements over standard pretraining in terms of factuality and safety, and up to 86.3% win rate improvements in overall generation quality."

Neuro-Symbolic integration offers a promising avenue for explainability by combining neural networks with symbolic logic rule reasoning. Concurrently, we posit that user behavior chains inherently embody an endogenous logic suitable for explicit reasoning. However, these observational multiple behaviors are plagued by confounders, causing models to learn spurious correlations. By incorporating causal inference into this Neuro-Symbolic framework, we propose a novel Causal Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning model for Explainable Multi-Behavior Recommendation (CNRE). CNRE operationalizes the endogenous logic by simulating a human-like decision-making process. Specifically, CNRE first employs hierarchical preference propagation to capture heterogeneous cross-behavior dependencies. Subsequently, it models the endogenous logic rule implicit in the user's behavior chain based on preference strength, and adaptively dispatches to the corresponding neural-logic reasoning path (e.g., conjunction, disjunction). This process generates an explainable causal mediator that approximates an ideal state isolated from confounding effects. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate CNRE's significant superiority over state-of-the-art baselines, offering multi-level explainability from model design and decision process to recommendation results."

This paper proposes a novel technique to integrate photon polarimeter function into such a spectrometer without compromising the spectrometer's conventional performance. Key factors to enhance the polarimeter capability are investigated. This successful integration represents the first implementation of a photon polarimeter within a general-purpose spectrometer, establishing a valuable benchmark for the existing and future experiments. The ability to concurrently measure spin polarization and four-momentum data opens a new dimension for analysis, promising a more profound understanding of the underlying physics."

    "abstract": "The ability to tune and switch magnetic anisotropy to a perpendicular orientation is a key challenge for implementing 2D magnets in spintronic devices. H-phase vanadium dichalcogenides V$X_2$ ($X$=Te, Se, S) are promising ferromagnetic semiconductors with large magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE). Recent work has shown that hole doping can switch their easy axis to out-of-plane, though the microscopic origin of this perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) remains unclear. Using density-functional-theory calculations, we demonstrate that the PMA enhancement arises from first-order spin-orbit coupling (SOC) acting on topmost degenerate valence states with nonzero orbital angular momentum projection ($m_l\\ne 0$). In this case, the $\\hat{L}_z\\hat{S}_z$ term dominates for perpendicular magnetization, while in-plane orientations involve only weaker, second-order SOC contributions. The increased valence bandwidth leads to depletion of higher-energy states upon hole doping, stabilizing PMA. From this mechanism, we identify two transferable design principles for enhancing MAE under weak hole doping: (i) orbital degeneracy at the valence-band edge protected by point-group symmetry and (ii) finite SOC in the degenerate manifold. Notably, we identify multiple magnetic semiconductors that meet these criteria and display enhanced MAE under hole doping. Furthermore, we show that band engineering can strategically place these degenerate orbitals at the valence band edge, significantly boosting PMA when hole-doped. We also examine trends in VTe$_2$, VSe$_2$, and VS$_2$ to determine the influence of crystal-field splitting, exchange interaction, and orbital hybridization on the valence band edges. These results provide both a fundamental understanding of PMA switching upon hole doping and a transferable strategy for tuning magnetic anisotropy, essential for designing high-performance spintronic materials."

We propose QCL-IDS, a quantum-centric continual-learning framework that co-designs stability and privacy-governed rehearsal for NISQ-era pipelines. Its core component, Q-FISH (Quantum Fisher Anchors), enforces retention using a compact anchor coreset through (i) sensitivity-weighted parameter constraints and (ii) a fidelity-based functional anchoring term that directly limits decision drift on representative historical traffic. To regain plasticity without retaining sensitive flows, QCL-IDS further introduces privacy-preserved quantum generative replay (QGR) via frozen, task-conditioned generator snapshots that synthesize bounded rehearsal samples. Across a three-stage attack stream on UNSW-NB15 and CICIDS2017, QCL-IDS consistently attains the best retention-adaptation trade-off: the gradient-anchor configuration achieves mean Attack-F1 = 0.941 with forgetting = 0.005 on UNSW-NB15 and mean Attack-F1 = 0.944 with forgetting = 0.004 on CICIDS2017, versus 0.800/0.138 and 0.803/0.128 for sequential fine-tuning, respectively."

Graph dataset condensation techniques have emerged to compress large datasets into smaller yet information-rich datasets, while maintaining similar test performance. However, these methods strictly require downstream applications to match the original dataset and task, which often fails in cross-task and cross-domain scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel causal-invariance-based and transferable graph dataset condensation method, named \\textbf{TGCC}, providing effective and transferable condensed datasets. Specifically, to preserve domain-invariant knowledge, we first extract domain causal-invariant features from the spatial domain of the graph using causal interventions. Then, to fully capture the structural and feature information of the original graph, we perform enhanced condensation operations. Finally, through spectral-domain enhanced contrastive learning, we inject the causal-invariant features into the condensed graph, ensuring that the compressed graph retains the causal information of the original graph. Experimental results on five public datasets and our novel \\textbf{FinReport} dataset demonstrate that TGCC achieves up to a 13.41\\% improvement in cross-task and cross-domain complex scenarios compared to existing methods, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on 5 out of 6 datasets in the single dataset and task scenario."

In practice, however, developers often bundle multiple concerns into tangled commits, obscuring intent and complicating maintenance. Recent studies have used Conventional Commits Specification (CCS) and Language Models (LMs) to capture commit intent, demonstrating that Small Language Models (SLMs) can approach the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) while maintaining efficiency and privacy. However, they do not address tangled commits involving multiple concerns, leaving the feasibility of using LMs for multi-concern detection unresolved. In this paper, we frame multi-concern detection in tangled commits as a multi-label classification problem and construct a controlled dataset of artificially tangled commits based on real-world data. We then present an empirical study using SLMs to detect multiple semantic concerns in tangled commits, examining the effects of fine-tuning, concern count, commit-message inclusion, and header-preserving truncation under practical token-budget limits. Our results show that a fine-tuned 14B-parameter SLM is competitive with a state-of-the-art LLM for single-concern commits and remains usable for up to three concerns. In particular, including commit messages improves detection accuracy by up to 44% (in terms of Hamming Loss) with negligible latency overhead, establishing them as important semantic cues."

In a similar direction, but via an alternative approach based on the independence of characters of $\\ell$-adic Galois representations, we prove that any prime-detecting quasimodular form on $Γ_{0}(N)$ belongs to the direct sum of the spaces of quasimodular Eisenstein series and quasimodular oldforms.

    "abstract": "The quality of machine learning models depends heavily on their training data. Selecting high-quality, diverse training sets for large language models (LLMs) is a difficult task, due to the lack of cheap and reliable quality metrics. While querying existing LLMs for document quality is common, this is not scalable to the large number (billions) of documents used in training. Instead, practitioners often use classifiers trained on sparse quality signals. In this paper, we propose a text-embedding-based hierarchical clustering approach that adaptively selects the documents to be evaluated by the LLM to estimate cluster quality. We prove that our method is query efficient: under the assumption that the hierarchical clustering contains a subtree such that each leaf cluster in the tree is pure enough (i.e., it mostly contains either only good or only bad documents), with high probability, the method can correctly predict the quality of each document after querying a small number of documents. The number of such documents is proportional to the size of the smallest subtree with (almost) pure leaves, without the algorithm knowing this subtree in advance. Furthermore, in a comprehensive experimental study, we demonstrate the benefits of our algorithm compared to other classifier-based filtering methods."

Prior-fitted networks (PFNs) have recently demonstrated strong generalization in supervised tabular learning by amortizing Bayesian inference under a broad synthetic prior. Extending this paradigm to clustering is nontrivial: clustering is unsupervised, admits a combinatorial and permutation-invariant output space, and requires inferring the number of clusters. We introduce TabClustPFN, a prior-fitted network for tabular data clustering that performs amortized Bayesian inference over both cluster assignments and cluster cardinality. Pretrained on synthetic datasets drawn from a flexible clustering prior, TabClustPFN clusters unseen datasets in a single forward pass, without dataset-specific retraining or hyperparameter tuning. The model naturally handles heterogeneous numerical and categorical features and adapts to a wide range of clustering structures. Experiments on synthetic data and curated real-world tabular benchmarks show that TabClustPFN outperforms classical, deep, and amortized clustering baselines, while exhibiting strong robustness in out-of-the-box exploratory settings.

In the language of machine learning, we are representing and augmenting the flow-matching algorithm with AdS physics. Using a checkerboard toy dataset and MNIST, we find that our model achieves faster and higher quality convergence than comparable physics-free flow-matching models. Our method provides a physically interpretable version of flow matching. More broadly, it establishes the utility of AdS physics and geometry in the development of novel paradigms in generative modeling."

In this work, we demonstrate the primary bottleneck is the prohibitive cost of exploration: mastering these tasks requires extensive trial-and-error, which is computationally unsustainable for parameter-heavy LLMs operating in a high dimensional semantic space. To address this, we propose SCOUT (Sub-Scale Collaboration On Unseen Tasks), a novel framework that decouples exploration from exploitation. We employ lightweight \"scouts\" (e.g., small MLPs) to probe environmental dynamics at a speed and scale far exceeding LLMs. The collected trajectories are utilized to bootstrap the LLM via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), followed by multi-turn Reinforcement Learning (RL) to activate its latent world knowledge. Empirically, SCOUT enables a Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct model to achieve an average score of 0.86, significantly outperforming proprietary models, including Gemini-2.5-Pro (0.60), while saving about 60% GPU hours consumption."

However, many applications involve time-varying densities, including environmental monitoring, surveillance, and adaptive sensor deployment. Although time-varying coverage strategies have been studied within Voronoi-based frameworks, recent works have reformulated static coverage control as a semi-discrete optimal transport problem. Extending this optimal transport perspective to time-varying scenarios has remained an open challenge. This paper presents a rigorous optimal transport formulation for time-varying coverage control, in which agents minimize the instantaneous Wasserstein distance to a continuously evolving target density. The proposed solution relies on a coupled system of differential equations governing agent positions and the dual variables that define Laguerre regions. In one-dimensional domains, the resulting system admits a closed-form analytical solution, offering both computational benefits and theoretical insight into the structure of optimal time-varying coverage. Numerical simulations demonstrate improved tracking performance compared to quasi-static and Voronoi-based methods, validating the proposed framework."

However, this strict isotropy discards potentially valuable curvature information encoded in gradient spectra, motivating optimization methods that balance geometric structure with adaptivity. We introduce FISMO (Fisher-Structured Momentum-Orthogonalized) optimizer, which generalizes isotropic updates to incorporate anisotropic curvature information through Fisher information geometry. By reformulating the optimizer update as a trust-region problem constrained by a Kronecker-factored Fisher metric, FISMO achieves structured preconditioning that adapts to local loss landscape geometry while maintaining computational tractability. We establish convergence guarantees for FISMO in stochastic nonconvex settings, proving an $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{T})$ rate for the expected squared gradient norm with explicit characterization of variance reduction through mini-batching.

Temporal data from electronic medical records (EMRs) are viewed as multivariate patient logs and represented in a relational data schema. Then, a propositionalisation technique (based on classic aggregation/selection functions from the field of relational data) is applied to construct interpretable features to \"flatten\" the data.

Among other things, they demonstrated that although the damping rate of the oscillations in the core of many red giants appears to be negligible, other red giants exhibit high core damping rates that are sometimes consistent with the infinite value limit. Up until now, it has not been possible to link the mixed mode visibilities to core damping rates in a quantitative way. In this study, we use the progressive wave picture to derive an analytical function expressing the approximate resonance pattern of red giants up to a proportionality factor. This function can model the influence of the damping on the oscillations, as well as take into account other effects such as mode asymmetries. In particular, this expression can be used to obtain a quantitative estimate for the visibility of mixed modes and to predict the detectability of mixed mode and multiplet signatures under different core damping rates. Here, we conduct a parameter study to investigate how the damping processes affect these aspects. We find that the visibility approaches the value expected for an infinite core damping rate already at finite values. Furthermore, we find that both the mixed mode and the multiplet signatures disappear at finite core damping rates. This implies that the observational characteristics of red giants with finite core damping rates can appear as if their core damping rate were infinite, providing an explanation for the observed populations. Moreover, we have used our method to quantitatively estimate the core damping rates of red giants with unusually low mixed mode amplitudes from their observed visibilities."

    "abstract": "Human behavior plays a critical role in shaping epidemic trajectories. During health crises, people respond in diverse ways in terms of self-protection and adherence to recommended measures, largely reflecting differences in how individuals assess risk. This behavioral variability induces effective heterogeneity into key epidemic parameters, such as infectivity and susceptibility. We introduce a minimal extension of the susceptible-infected-removed~(SIR) model, denoted HeSIR, that captures these effects through a simple bimodal scheme, where individuals may have higher or lower transmission--related traits. We derive a closed-form expression for the epidemic threshold in terms of the model parameters, and the network's degree distribution and homophily, defined as the tendency of like--risk individuals to preferentially interact. We identify a resurgence regime just beyond the classical threshold, where the number of infected individuals may initially decline before surging into large-scale transmission. Through simulations on homogeneous and heterogeneous network topologies we corroborate the analytical results and highlight how variations in susceptibility and infectivity influence the epidemic dynamics. We further show that, under suitable assumptions, the HeSIR model maps onto a standard SIR process on an appropriately modified contact network, providing a unified interpretation in terms of structural connectivity. Our findings quantify the effect of heterogeneous behavioral responses, especially in the presence of homophily, and caution against underestimating epidemic potential in fragmented populations, which may undermine timely containment efforts. The results also extend to heterogeneity arising from biological or other non-behavioral sources."

As a result, a single MVM requires many compute cycles, and weights cannot be efficiently stored in a single crossbar cell. To address this problem, we propose a mixed-precision training and compilation framework for CIM architectures. The biggest challenge is the massive search space, that makes it difficult to find good quantization parameters. This is why we introduce a reinforcement learning-based strategy to find suitable quantization configurations that balance latency and accuracy. In the best case, our approach achieves up to a 2.48x speedup over existing state-of-the-art solutions, with an accuracy loss of only 0.086 %."

We then use self-organizing maps (SOMs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify spectra as binaries or singles, and as cool and helium-poor or hot and helium-rich. The spectra are normalised using asymmetric least squares baseline fitting to emphasise individual spectral features. The BP-RP colour dominates the similarity map, with additional influence from temperature, helium abundance, and variability. Most binaries, identified via the Virtual Observatory SED Analyser (VOSA), cluster in two filaments linked to main sequence companions. CNN classification suggests a strong correlation between variability and binarity, with binary fractions exceeding 60 percent for active hot subdwarfs. Gaia XP spectra combined with dimensionality reduction and machine learning effectively reveal patterns in hot subdwarf properties. Our findings indicate that binarity and environmental density strongly shape the evolutionary paths of hot subdwarfs, and we identify possible contamination by main sequence and cataclysmic variable stars in the base sample."

However, prevalent memory preprocessing paradigms suffer from destructive de-contextualization. By compressing complex sequential dependencies into pre-defined structures (e.g., embeddings or graphs), these methods sever the contextual integrity essential for deep reasoning. To address this, we propose E-mem, a framework shifting from Memory Preprocessing to Episodic Context Reconstruction. Inspired by biological engrams, E-mem employs a heterogeneous hierarchical architecture where multiple assistant agents maintain uncompressed memory contexts, while a central master agent orchestrates global planning. Unlike passive retrieval, our mechanism empowers assistants to locally reason within activated segments, extracting context-aware evidence before aggregation. Evaluations on the LoCoMo benchmark demonstrate that E-mem achieves over 54\\% F1, surpassing the state-of-the-art GAM by 7.75\\%, while reducing token cost by over 70\\%."

    "abstract": "This paper extends the classical dividend problem by incorporating a novel, path-dependent mechanism of firm default. In the traditional framework, ruin occurs when the surplus process first reaches zero. In contrast, default in our model may also arise when the surplus spends an excessive amount of time below a distress threshold, even without ever hitting zero. This occupation-time-based default criterion captures financial distress more realistically, as prolonged periods of low liquidity or capitalisation may trigger regulatory intervention or operational failure. The resulting optimisation problem is formulated as a new singular stochastic control problem with discontinuous state-dependent discounting and killing. We provide a complete analytical solution via a bespoke sequential guess-and-verify method and identify three distinct classes of optimal dividend strategies corresponding to different parameter regimes of the dual-ruin structure. Notably, for certain distress thresholds, the optimal policy features disconnected action and inaction regions. We further show that, unlike in the classical dividend problem, higher effective discounting induced by occupation time below a distress level can lead to delayed, rather than earlier, dividend payments."

Equivariant neural networks are integrated with LSTM to build adiabatic potential energy surfaces in ground and excited states. Photoisomerizations of $\\mathrm{CH_2NH}$ and azobenzene are simulated, showing that our new proposed LSTM-FSSH method can produce excited-state lifetimes and product yields accurately in comparison with conventional FSSH simulations as reference.

Despite being important, the roles of target vectors used in RM, however, remain underexplored. Here, we approach and revisit RM through the lens of the linear representation hypothesis. Specifically, if one can somehow identify a one-dimensional representation corresponding to a high-level concept, the linear representation hypothesis enables linear operations on this concept vector within the forget-representation space. Under this view, we hypothesize that, beyond forgetting, machine unlearning elicits controllable side behaviors and stronger side capabilities corresponding to the high-level concept. Our hypothesis is empirically validated across a wide range of tasks, including behavioral control (e.g., controlling unlearned models' truth, sentiment, and refusal) and capability enhancement (e.g., improving unlearned models' in-context learning capability). Our findings reveal that this fairly attractive phenomenon could be either a hidden risk if misused or a mechanism that can be harnessed for developing models that require stronger capabilities and controllable behaviors."

On one hand, purely unsupervised approaches have proven successful on fully disentangled synthetic data, but fail to recover semantic factors from real data without strong inductive biases. On the other hand, supervised approaches are unstable and hard to scale to large attribute sets because they rely on adversarial objectives or auxiliary classifiers. We introduce \\textsc{XFactors}, a weakly-supervised VAE framework that disentangles and provides explicit control over a chosen set of factors. Building on the Disentangled Information Bottleneck perspective, we decompose the representation into a residual subspace $\\mathcal{S}$ and factor-specific subspaces $\\mathcal{T}_1,\\ldots,\\mathcal{T}_K$ and a residual subspace $\\mathcal{S}$. Each target factor is encoded in its assigned $\\mathcal{T}_i$ through contrastive supervision: an InfoNCE loss pulls together latents sharing the same factor value and pushes apart mismatched pairs. In parallel, KL regularization imposes a Gaussian structure on both $\\mathcal{S}$ and the aggregated factor subspaces, organizing the geometry without additional supervision for non-targeted factors and avoiding adversarial training and classifiers. Across multiple datasets, with constant hyperparameters, \\textsc{XFactors} achieves state-of-the-art disentanglement scores and yields consistent qualitative factor alignment in the corresponding subspaces, enabling controlled factor swapping via latent replacement. We further demonstrate that our method scales correctly with increasing latent capacity and evaluate it on the real-world dataset CelebA.

This systemic memorylessness leads to massive computational redundancy, as models repeatedly re-derive discovered conclusions and revisit known dead ends across extensive attempts. To bridge this gap, we propose \\textbf{Recycling Search Experience (RSE)}, a self-guided, training-free strategy that turns test-time search from a series of isolated trials into a cumulative process. By actively distilling raw trajectories into a shared experience bank, RSE enables positive recycling of intermediate conclusions to shortcut redundant derivations and negative recycling of failure patterns to prune encountered dead ends. Theoretically, we provide an analysis that formalizes the efficiency gains of RSE, validating its advantage over independent sampling in solving complex reasoning tasks. Empirically, extensive experiments on HMMT24, HMMT25, IMO-Bench, and HLE show that RSE consistently outperforms strong baselines with comparable computational cost, achieving state-of-the-art scaling efficiency."

    "abstract": "Navigating urban intersections, especially when interacting with heterogeneous traffic participants, presents a formidable challenge for autonomous vehicles (AVs). In such environments, safety risks arise simultaneously from multiple sources, each carrying distinct priority levels and sensitivities that necessitate differential protection preferences. While safe reinforcement learning (RL) offers a robust paradigm for constrained decision-making, existing methods typically model safety as a single constraint or employ static, heuristic weighting schemes for multiple constraints. These approaches often fail to address the dynamic nature of multi-source risks, leading to gradient cancellation that hampers learning, and suboptimal trade-offs in critical dilemma zones. To address this, we propose a Bayesian adaptive priority safe reinforcement learning (BAP-SRL) based motion planning framework. Unlike heuristic weighting schemes, BAP formulates constraint prioritization as a probabilistic inference task. By modeling historical optimization difficulty as a Bayesian prior and instantaneous risk evidence as a likelihood, BAP dynamically gates gradient updates using a Bayesian inference mechanism on latent constraint criticality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in handling interactions with stochastic, heterogeneous agents, achieving lower collision rates and smoother conflict resolution."

To quantify these patterns, we introduce an analogue of the discriminant of the velocity gradient tensor and examine the persistence of its sign. For ring-type patterns, the persistence decays more slowly than exponentially, often following a power law or stretched exponential. When spiral structures remain intact, persistence saturates asymptotically and can exhibit superposed periodic oscillations, suggesting complex exponents at early times. These behaviors highlight deep connections with the underlying dynamics."

    "abstract": "Many reinforcement learning (RL) problems admit multiple terminal solutions of comparable quality, where the goal is not to identify a single optimum but to represent a diverse set of high-quality outcomes. Nevertheless, policies trained by standard expected return maximization routinely collapse onto a small subset of outcomes, a phenomenon commonly attributed to insufficient exploration or weak regularization. We show that this explanation is incomplete: outcome level mode collapse is a structural consequence of the expected-return objective itself. Under idealized learning dynamics, the log-probability ratio between any two outcomes evolves linearly in their reward difference, implying exponential ratio divergence and inevitable collapse independent of the exploration strategy, entropy regularization, or optimization algorithm. We identify the source of this pathology as the probability multiplier inside the expectation and propose a minimal correction: inverse probability scaling, which removes outcome-frequency amplification from the learning signal, fundamentally changes the learning dynamics, and provably yields reward-proportional terminal distributions, preventing collapse in multimodal settings. We instantiate this principle in Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) as a drop-in modification, IPS-GRPO, requiring no auxiliary models or architectural changes. Across different reasoning and molecular generation tasks, IPS-GRPO consistently reduces outcome-level mode collapse while matching or exceeding baseline performance, suggesting that correcting the objective rather than adding exploration heuristics is key to reliable multimodal policy optimization."

To address this limitation, we propose a post-training adaptation strategy that selectively replaces low-utility tokens with more relevant ones based on their frequency in an adaptation corpus. Our algorithm identifies the token inventory that most effectively encodes the adaptation corpus for a given target vocabulary size. Extensive experiments on generation and classification tasks across multiple languages demonstrate that our adapted tokenizers compress test corpora more effectively than baselines using the same vocabulary size. This method serves as a lightweight adaptation mechanism, akin to a vocabulary fine-tuning process, enabling optimized tokenization for specific domains or tasks.

The proposed method REPVLM computes the probability density on the hyperspherical manifold of the VLM embeddings using Riemannian Flow Matching.

In this problem, we are given a depot and a set of customers, each with a demand, embedded in a metric space. The objective is to find a set of tours, each starting and ending at the depot, operated by the capacititated vehicle at the depot to serve all customers, such that all customers are served, and the total travel cost is minimized. We consider the unplittable variant, where the demand of each customer must be served entirely by a single tour. Let $α$ denote the current best-known approximation ratio for the metric traveling salesman problem. The previous best approximation ratio was $α+1+\\ln 2+δ<3.1932$ for a small constant $δ>0$ (Friggstad et al., Math. Oper.

The first algorithm focuses on the case of fixed vehicle capacity and achieves an approximation ratio of $α+1+\\ln\\bigl(2-\\frac{1}{2}y_0\\bigr)<3.0897$, where $y_0>0.39312$ is the unique root of $\\ln\\bigl(2-\\frac{1}{2}y\\bigr)=\\frac{3}{2}y$.

In particular, the Kasner-like geometry persisting only in highly constrained situations. The latter two regimes represent a clean departure from classical Kasner phenomenology, revealing a richer and more ordered landscape of behaviors in the deep interior of black holes beyond Einstein gravity.

Existing similarity measures such as CKA or SVCCA capture pointwise overlap between activation sets, but miss how representations change along input paths. Two models may appear nearly identical under these metrics yet respond very differently to perturbations or adversarial stress. We introduce representation holonomy, a gauge-invariant statistic that measures this path dependence. Conceptually, holonomy quantifies the \"twist\" accumulated when features are parallel-transported around a small loop in input space: flat representations yield zero holonomy, while nonzero values reveal hidden curvature. Our estimator fixes gauge through global whitening, aligns neighborhoods using shared subspaces and rotation-only Procrustes, and embeds the result back to the full feature space. We prove invariance to orthogonal (and affine, post-whitening) transformations, establish a linear null for affine layers, and show that holonomy vanishes at small radii. Empirically, holonomy increases with loop radius, separates models that appear similar under CKA, and correlates with adversarial and corruption robustness. It also tracks training dynamics as features form and stabilize. Together, these results position representation holonomy as a practical and scalable diagnostic for probing the geometric structure of learned representations beyond pointwise similarity."

SHDs associated with diabetes and obesity were curated from the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India, followed by phytochemical identification using IMPPAT database, yielding a shortlist of 11 SHDs and their 188 phytochemicals after drug-likeness and bioavailability filtering. Subsequently, molecular targets of the phytochemicals in SHDs, disease-associated genes and therapeutic targets of FDA-approved drugs, were curated via integration of data from several databases. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed significant functional overlap between SHD-associated and disease-associated pathways. All curated data were embedded into a Neo4j-based knowledge graph, enabling SHD-disease intersection analysis that prioritized key disease-relevant targets, including PTPN1, GLP1R, and DPP4. Also, the SHD-Target-FDA-approved drug profile elucidated the molecular and mechanistic aspects of the SHDs as a phytochemical cocktail, and is in alignment with the clinically studied synergistic FDA-approved drug combinations. Network pharmacology based protein-protein interaction analysis identified PPARG as another central regulator. Using a quantitative framework, we identified phytochemical pairs within SHDs, which were structurally dissimilar and target-wise distinct, yet acted on shared or different disease-associated pathways, indicating complementary and potentially synergistic interactions. Molecular docking analysis of two selected druggable targets identified putative lead phytochemicals."

In particular, fine-tuned models are highly vulnerable, as they are often fine-tuned on small and private datasets. Membership inference attacks (MIAs) are used to assess privacy risks by determining whether a specific sample was part of a model's training data. Existing MIAs against diffusion models either assume obtaining the intermediate results or require auxiliary datasets for training the shadow model. In this work, we utilized a critical yet overlooked vulnerability: the widely used noise schedules fail to fully eliminate semantic information in the images, resulting in residual semantic signals even at the maximum noise step. We empirically demonstrate that the fine-tuned diffusion model captures hidden correlations between the residual semantics in initial noise and the original images. Building on this insight, we propose a simple yet effective membership inference attack, which injects semantic information into the initial noise and infers membership by analyzing the model's generation result. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the semantic initial noise can strongly reveal membership information, highlighting the vulnerability of diffusion models to MIAs."

Updates depend on optimizer moments and averaging, data-order policies (random reshuffling vs with-replacement, staged augmentations and replay), the nonconvex path, and auxiliary state (teacher EMA/SWA, contrastive queues, BatchNorm statistics). This survey organizes mechanisms by source, lifetime, and visibility. It introduces seed-paired, function-space causal estimands; portable perturbation primitives (carry/reset of momentum/Adam/EMA/BN, order-window swaps, queue/teacher tweaks); and a reporting checklist with audit artifacts (order hashes, buffer/BN checksums, RNG contracts). The conclusion is a protocol for portable, causal, uncertainty-aware measurement that attributes how much training history matters across models, data, and regimes."

    "abstract": "Parallel thinking enhances LLM reasoning by multi-path sampling and aggregation. In system-level evaluations, a global parallelism level N is allocated to all samples, typically set large to maximize overall dataset accuracy. However, due to sample heterogeneity, some samples can achieve comparable performance with a smaller N'< N, causing budget redundancy. This incompatibility between system-level efficacy and sample-level efficiency constitutes the overscaling curse. In this paper, we formalize and quantify the overscaling curse, showing its universality and severity in practice, and analyze its trigger mechanism. We then propose a lightweight method, T2, to break the overscaling curse, which utilizes latent representations to estimate the optimal parallelism level for each sample before decoding. Experiments show that T2 significantly reduces cost while maintaining comparable performance, enabling more efficient parallel thinking."

We introduce WhatCounts to test this property in isolation. Unlike prior work that conflates semantic sensitivity with reasoning complexity or prompt variation, WhatCounts is atomic: count items in an unambiguous, delimited list with no duplicates, distractors, or reasoning steps for different semantic types. Frontier LLMs show over 40% accuracy variation depending solely on what is being counted - cities versus chemicals, names versus symbols. Controlled ablations rule out confounds. The gap is semantic, and it shifts unpredictably with small amounts of unrelated fine-tuning. LLMs do not implement algorithms; they approximate them, and the approximation is argument-dependent. As we show with an agentic example, this has implications beyond counting: any LLM function may carry hidden dependencies on the meaning of its inputs."

To address these gaps, we propose WMVLM, the first unified and interpretable evaluation framework for diffusion model image watermarking via vision-language models (VLMs). We redefine quality and security metrics for each watermark type: residual watermarks are evaluated by artifact strength and erasure resistance, while semantic watermarks are assessed through latent distribution shifts. Moreover, we introduce a three-stage training strategy to progressively enable the model to achieve classification, scoring, and interpretable text generation. Experiments show WMVLM outperforms state-of-the-art VLMs with strong generalization across datasets, diffusion models, and watermarking methods."

Users of varying ages face distinct challenges when interacting with mobile apps, from younger users dealing with inappropriate content to older users having difficulty with usability due to age-related vision and cognition impairments. Although there have been initiatives to create age-inclusive apps, a limited understanding of user perspectives on age-related issues may hinder developers from recognizing specific challenges and implementing effective solutions. In this study, we explore age discussions in app reviews to gain insights into how mobile apps should cater to users across different age groups.We manually curated a dataset of 4,163 app reviews from the Google Play Store and identified 1,429 age-related reviews and 2,734 non-age-related reviews. We employed eight machine learning, deep learning, and large language models to automatically detect age discussions, with RoBERTa performing the best, achieving a precision of 92.46%.

The instrument features NbTiN superconducting microstrip (MS) filters with low-loss a-SiC:H dielectric and an ultra-wideband leaky-wave antenna. A laboratory setup was designed, incorporating the cryostat housing cryogenic optics and ISS chip comprising 339 KIDs connected to MS filters tuned for (sub-)mm wave frequencies. Room-temperature mirrors on a hexapod stage allowed precise positioning and alignment of optical elements. The sky-position chopper was positioned on a motor-controlled stage for fine-tuned control over its position and alignment. Thanks to the multiplexing capability of KIDs, we could simultaneously measure multiple performance metrics across the entire frequency range. We showed that DESHIMA 2.0 achieved significant improvements in performance compared to its predecessor (DESHIMA 1.0): measured instantaneous frequency coverage was 200$-$400 GHz with a mean filter $Q_{filter}$ of $340 \\pm 50$; instrument efficiency reached $\\sim8$ \\%, indicating 4 times wider band coverage and 4 times higher sensitivity. The yield rate for MS filters exceeded 98 \\%. The estimated aperture efficiency from measured beam patterns agreed well with the designed value of approximately 70 \\%.

When it does not, the theory predicts order-one deviations from secular leakage dynamics, including bath-induced coherences and stabilization of dark polaritons, and provides a simple design criterion based on the ratio of polariton splitting to reservoir linewidth. A time-resolved leakage measurement, such as transmission, reflectivity, or photoluminescence, can be used to observe these effects."

Traditional approaches relying on manual sampling or expensive commercial systems fail to address accessibility challenges in resource-constrained environments. This paper presents HydroSense, an innovative Internet of Things framework that integrates six critical water quality parameters including pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature, total dissolved solids (TDS), estimated nitrogen, and water level into a unified monitoring system. HydroSense employs a novel dual-microcontroller architecture, utilizing Arduino Uno for precision analog measurements with five-point calibration algorithms and ESP32 for wireless connectivity, edge processing, and cloud integration. The system implements advanced signal processing techniques including median filtering for TDS measurement, temperature compensation algorithms, and robust error handling. Experimental validation over 90 days demonstrates exceptional performance metrics: pH accuracy of plus or minus 0.08 units across the 0 to 14 range, DO measurement stability within plus or minus 0.2 mg/L, TDS accuracy of plus or minus 1.9 percent across 0 to 1000 ppm, and 99.8 percent cloud data transmission reliability. With a total implementation cost of 32,983 BDT (approximately 300 USD), HydroSense achieves an 85 percent cost reduction compared to commercial systems while providing enhanced connectivity through the Firebase real-time database.

    "abstract": "Blockchain clients are fundamental software for running blockchain nodes. They provide users with various RPC (Remote Procedure Call) interfaces to interact with the blockchain. These RPC methods are expected to follow the same specification across different blockchain nodes, providing users with seamless interaction. However, there have been continuous reports on various RPC bugs that can cause unexpected responses or even Denial of Service weakness. Existing studies on blockchain RPC bug detection mainly focus on generating the RPC method calls for testing blockchain clients. However, a wide range of the reported RPC bugs are triggered in various blockchain contexts. To the best of our knowledge, little attention is paid to generating proper contexts that can trigger these context-dependent RPC bugs. In this work, we propose EthCRAFT, a Context-aware RPC Analysis and Fuzzing Tool for client RPC bug detection. EthCRAFT first proposes to explore the state transition program space of blockchain clients and generate various transactions to construct the context. EthCRAFT then designs a context-aware RPC method call generation method to send RPC calls to the blockchain clients. The responses of 5 different client implementations are used as cross-referring oracles to detect the RPC bugs. We evaluate EthCRAFT on real-world RPC bugs collected from the GitHub issues of Ethereum client implementations. Experiment results show that EthCRAFT outperforms existing client RPC detectors by detecting more RPC bugs. Moreover, EthCRAFT has found six new bugs in major Ethereum clients and reported them to the developers. One of the bug fixes has been written into breaking changes in the client's updates. Three of our bug reports have been offered a vulnerability bounty by the Ethereum Foundation."

    "abstract": "Despite the centrality of crosslinguistic influence (CLI) to bilingualism research, human studies often yield conflicting results due to inherent experimental variance. We address these inconsistencies by using language models (LMs) as controlled statistical learners to systematically simulate CLI and isolate its underlying drivers. Specifically, we study the effect of varying the L1 language dominance and the L2 language proficiency, which we manipulate by controlling the L2 age of exposure -- defined as the training step at which the L2 is introduced. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of pretraining on L1 languages with varying syntactic distance from the L2. Using cross-linguistic priming, we analyze how activating L1 structures impacts L2 processing. Our results align with evidence from psycholinguistic studies, confirming that language dominance and proficiency are strong predictors of CLI. We further find that while priming of grammatical structures is bidirectional, the priming of ungrammatical structures is sensitive to language dominance. Finally, we provide mechanistic evidence of CLI in LMs, demonstrating that the L1 is co-activated during L2 processing and directly influences the neural circuitry recruited for the L2. More broadly, our work demonstrates that LMs can serve as a computational framework to inform theories of human CLI."

Although existing methods attempt to mitigate this issue, they often lack a foundational theoretical explanation. We establish a gradient-based theoretical framework to explain catastrophic forgetting. We first prove that strongly negative gradient similarity is a fundamental cause of forgetting. We then use gradient similarity to identify two types of neurons: conflicting neurons that induce forgetting and account for 50%-75% of neurons, and collaborative neurons that mitigate forgetting and account for 25%-50%. Based on this analysis, we propose a knowledge injection method, Collaborative Neural Learning (CNL). By freezing conflicting neurons and updating only collaborative neurons, CNL theoretically eliminates catastrophic forgetting under an infinitesimal learning rate eta and an exactly known mastered set. Experiments on five LLMs, four datasets, and four optimizers show that CNL achieves zero forgetting in in-set settings and reduces forgetting by 59.1%-81.7% in out-of-set settings."

Inspired by work on data attribution, we show that filtering tokens is more effective than filtering documents, achieving the same hit to undesired capabilities at a lower cost to benign ones. Training models spanning two orders of magnitude, we then demonstrate that filtering gets more effective with scale: for our largest models, token filtering leads to a 7000x compute slowdown on the forget domain. We also show that models trained with token filtering can still be aligned on the forget domain. Along the way, we introduce a methodology for labeling tokens with sparse autoencoders and distilling cheap, high-quality classifiers. We also demonstrate that filtering can be robust to noisy labels with sufficient pretraining compute."

Therefore, we propose FlexCausal, a novel CDRL framework based on a block-diagonal covariance VAE. FlexCausal utilizes a Factorized Flow-based Prior to realistically model the complex densities of exogenous noise, effectively decoupling the learning of causal mechanisms from distributional statistics. By integrating supervised alignment objectives with counterfactual consistency constraints, our framework ensures a precise structural correspondence between the learned latent subspaces and the ground-truth causal relations. Finally, we introduce a manifold-aware relative intervention strategy to ensure high-fidelity generation. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that FlexCausal significantly outperforms other methods."

To address these challenges, we introduce ASTRA, a fully automated end-to-end framework for training tool-augmented language model agents via scalable data synthesis and verifiable reinforcement learning. ASTRA integrates two complementary components. First, a pipeline that leverages the static topology of tool-call graphs synthesizes diverse, structurally grounded trajectories, instilling broad and transferable tool-use competence. Second, an environment synthesis framework that captures the rich, compositional topology of human semantic reasoning converts decomposed question-answer traces into independent, code-executable, and rule-verifiable environments, enabling deterministic multi-turn RL. Based on this method, we develop a unified training methodology that integrates SFT with online RL using trajectory-level rewards to balance task completion and interaction efficiency. Experiments on multiple agentic tool-use benchmarks demonstrate that ASTRA-trained models achieve state-of-the-art performance at comparable scales, approaching closed-source systems while preserving core reasoning ability.

Through a mixed-methods analysis, we identified four types of vulnerable responses (encouraging escalation, accepting an advance, displaying vulnerability, and negating risk concern) and four types of protective strategies (setting boundaries, directly declining, signaling risk awareness, and leveraging avoidance techniques). As the cybergrooming risk escalated, both vulnerable responses and protective strategies showed a corresponding progression. This study contributes a teen-centered understanding of cybergrooming, a labeled dataset, and a stage-based taxonomy of perceived protective strategies, while offering implications for educational programs and sociotechnical interventions."

Existing protection methods either modify the model to embed watermarks, which impairs performance, or extract model fingerprints by manipulating the denoising process, rendering them incompatible with black-box APIs. In this paper, we propose TrajPrint, a completely lossless and training-free framework that verifies model copyright by extracting unique manifold fingerprints formed during deterministic generation. Specifically, we first utilize a watermarked image as an anchor and exactly trace the path back to its trajectory origin, effectively locking the model fingerprint mapped by this path. Subsequently, we implement a joint optimization strategy that employs dual-end anchoring to synthesize a specific fingerprint noise, which strictly adheres to the target manifold for robust watermark recovery. As input, it enables the protected target model to recover the watermarked image, while failing on non-target models. Finally, we achieved verification via atomic inference and statistical hypothesis testing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TrajPrint achieves lossless verification in black-box API scenarios with superior robustness against model modifications."

To address this trade-off, we propose Noise Frequency-Controlled Diffusion Sampling (NFCDS), a spectral modulation mechanism for reverse diffusion noise. We show that the fidelity-perception conflict can be fundamentally understood through noise frequency: low-frequency components induce blur and degrade fidelity, while high-frequency components drive detail generation. Based on this insight, we design a Fourier-domain filter that progressively suppresses low-frequency noise and preserves high-frequency content. This controlled refinement injects a data-consistency prior directly into sampling, enabling fast convergence to results that are both high-fidelity and perceptually convincing--without additional training. As a PnP module, NFCDS seamlessly integrates into existing diffusion-based restoration frameworks and improves the fidelity-perception balance across diverse zero-shot tasks."

Here, f1 and f2 are kernel-based marginal densities that capture structured interactions, a setting central to diffusion-based generative models. We provide a concise proof for approximating these ratio-type functionals using deep neural networks with the SignReLU activation function, leveraging the activation's piecewise structure. Under standard regularity assumptions, we establish L^p(Omega) approximation bounds and convergence rates. Specializing to Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), we construct a SignReLU-based neural estimator for the reverse process and derive bounds on the excess Kullback-Leibler (KL) risk between the generated and true data distributions. Our analysis decomposes this excess risk into approximation and estimation error components. These results provide generalization guarantees for finite-sample training of diffusion-based generative models."

    "abstract": "We study the extraction of quantum coherence by three static Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors that interact locally with a massless scalar vacuum field in the vicinity of an infinite perfectly reflecting boundary. Depending on the setup, the detectors are positioned either parallel or orthogonal to the boundary, with their energy gaps chosen to satisfy the hierarchy $Ω_C\\geq Ω_B\\geq Ω_A$. Our analysis reveals that decreasing the detector-boundary separation leads to a monotonic degradation of quantum coherence, whereas the same boundary effect can simultaneously preserve and even amplify the harvested quantum entanglement. Moreover, when the detectors possess distinct energy gaps, coherence extraction is further inhibited; strikingly, such non-identical configurations substantially enhance the efficiency of entanglement harvesting and markedly extend the range of detector separations over which non-negligible entanglement can be generated. Nevertheless, the harvesting of nonlocal quantum coherence is achievable over a significantly broader range of detector separations than that of quantum entanglement. Despite exhibiting similar overall behavior, orthogonal detector configurations outperform parallel ones in coherence harvesting, highlighting the quantitative influence of detector geometry. Overall, our study reveals a hierarchical distinction between quantum coherence and entanglement as operational resources in structured vacuum fields: quantum coherence is not only more readily accessible across space but also more robust than entanglement, whereas entanglement exhibits richer features and can be selectively activated and enhanced through boundary effects and detector non-uniformity."

Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) improves reliability in such settings; however, most methods require \\emph{explicit governing equations} during training, which are often only partially known due to complex and nonlinear dynamics. We introduce \\textbf{PHDME}, a port-Hamiltonian diffusion framework designed for \\emph{sparse observations} and \\emph{incomplete physics}. PHDME leverages port-Hamiltonian structural prior but does not require full knowledge of the closed-form governing equations. Our approach first trains a Gaussian process distributed Port-Hamiltonian system (GP-dPHS) on limited observations to capture an energy-based representation of the dynamics. The GP-dPHS is then used to generate a physically consistent artificial dataset for diffusion training, and to inform the diffusion model with a structured physics residual loss. After training, the diffusion model acts as an amortized sampler and forecaster for fast trajectory generation. Finally, we apply split conformal calibration to provide uncertainty statements for the generated predictions. Experiments on PDE benchmarks and a real-world spring system show improved accuracy and physical consistency under data scarcity."

Here, we investigate the structural relaxation and electronic properties of a 1D moiré superlattice formed in twisted bilayer 1T$'$-WTe$_2$ using density functional theory calculations, complemented by high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy. We show that lattice relaxation strongly reconstructs the moiré stripes, leading to stacking-dependent stripe widths that are in excellent agreement with experimental observations. The relaxed structure hosts quasi-one-dimensional electronic bands near the Fermi level, characterized by strong dispersion along the stripe direction and nearly flat dispersion in the perpendicular direction. By comparing the full bilayer with isolated relaxed layers, we establish that these 1D electronic states are governed predominantly by an intralayer moiré potential induced by in-plane lattice relaxation, rather than by interlayer hybridization. We extract this position-dependent moiré potential directly from DFT calculations and construct an effective tight-binding model that reproduces both the band dispersion and the real-space localization of the electronic wave functions. Our results identify lattice relaxation as the key mechanism underlying 1D electronic states in 1D moiré superlattices. %and establish twisted bilayer WTe$_2$ as a promising platform for exploring emergent one-dimensional moiré physics.

The central issue here is not safety, efficiency, or employment. It is whether humans remain relevant participants in systems that increasingly shape social, economic, and political outcomes. This paper argues that static, compliance-based governance fails once decision-making moves to runtime and becomes opaque. It further argues that the core challenge is not whether AI is conscious, but whether humans can maintain meaningful communication, influence, and co-evolution with increasingly alien forms of intelligence. We position runtime governance, specifically, a newly proposed concept called the Governance Twin [1]; as a strong candidate for preserving human relevance, while acknowledging that accountability, agency, and even punishment must be rethought in this transition."

As a result, they can generate factually incorrect responses on topics they do not have enough knowledge of, commonly known as hallucination. Rather than hallucinating, a language model should be more honest and respond with \"I don't know\" when it does not have enough knowledge about a topic. Many methods have been proposed to improve LLM honesty, but their evaluations lack robustness, as they do not take into account the knowledge that the LLM has ingested during its pretraining. In this paper, we propose a more robust evaluation benchmark dataset for LLM honesty by utilizing Pythia, a truly open LLM with publicly available pretraining data. In addition, we also propose a novel method for harnessing the pretraining data to build a more honest LLM."

Accuracy improves with longer context: at 64s, S5 reaches 98.7%+/-0.6 and CNN 98.3%+/-0.3, while S5 uses ~20x fewer parameters than CNN. To probe real-world robustness, we evaluate zero-shot cross-frequency shifts, cross-task OOD inputs, and leave-one-subject-out generalization. S5 achieves stronger cross-subject accuracy but makes over-confident errors on OOD tasks; EEGXF is more conservative and stable under frequency shifts, though less calibrated in-distribution. These results reveal a practical efficiency-robustness trade-off: S5 for parameter-efficient peak accuracy; EEGXF when robustness and conservative uncertainty are critical."

However, recent studies reveal a sharp performance drop in reasoning hop generalization scenarios, where the required number of reasoning steps exceeds training distributions while the underlying algorithm remains unchanged. The internal mechanisms driving this failure remain poorly understood. In this work, we conduct a systematic study on tasks from multiple domains, and find that errors concentrate at token positions of a few critical error types, rather than being uniformly distributed. Closer inspection reveals that these token-level erroneous predictions stem from internal competition mechanisms: certain attention heads, termed erroneous processing heads (ep heads), tip the balance by amplifying incorrect reasoning trajectories while suppressing correct ones. Notably, removing individual ep heads during inference can often restore the correct predictions. Motivated by these insights, we propose test-time correction of reasoning, a lightweight intervention method that dynamically identifies and deactivates ep heads in the reasoning process. Extensive experiments across different tasks and LLMs show that it consistently improves reasoning hop generalization, highlighting both its effectiveness and potential."

Current planning methods heavily rely on human experts, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive, or utilize deep learning algorithms, often limiting stakeholder involvement. To bridge these gaps, we propose Intelli-Planner, a novel framework integrating Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with large language models (LLMs) to facilitate participatory and customized planning scheme generation. Intelli-Planner utilizes demographic, geographic data, and planning preferences to determine high-level planning requirements and demands for each functional type. During training, a knowledge enhancement module is employed to enhance the decision-making capability of the policy network. Additionally, we establish a multi-dimensional evaluation system and employ LLM-based stakeholders for satisfaction scoring. Experimental validation across diverse urban settings shows that Intelli-Planner surpasses traditional baselines and achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art DRL-based methods in objective metrics, while enhancing stakeholder satisfaction and convergence speed. These findings underscore the effectiveness and superiority of our framework, highlighting the potential for integrating the latest advancements in LLMs with DRL approaches to revolutionize tasks related to functional areas planning."

Our result yields an upper bound on the sampling error under classifier guidance and bears resemblance to a reverse log-Sobolev-type inequality.

To our knowledge, our work establishes the first quantitative link between classifier training and guidance alignment, yielding both a theoretical foundation for classifier guidance and principled guidelines for classifier selection."

    "abstract": "Text-to-Video Retrieval (TVR) is essential in video platforms. Dense retrieval with dual-modality encoders leads in accuracy, but its computation and storage scale poorly with corpus size. Thus, real-time large-scale applications adopt two-stage retrieval, where a fast recall model gathers a small candidate pool, which is reranked by an advanced dense retriever. Due to hugely reduced candidates, the reranking model can use any off-the-shelf dense retriever without hurting efficiency, meaning the recall model bounds two-stage TVR performance. Recently, generative retrieval (GR) replaces dense video embeddings with discrete semantic IDs and retrieves by decoding text queries into ID tokens. GR offers near-constant inference and storage complexity, and its semantic IDs capture high-level video features via quantization, making it ideal for quickly eliminating irrelevant candidates during recall. However, as a recall model in two-stage TVR, GR suffers from (i) semantic ambiguity, where each video satisfies diverse queries but is forced into one semantic ID; and (ii) cross-modal misalignment, as semantic IDs are solely derived from visual features without text supervision. We propose Generative Recall and Dense Reranking (GRDR), designing a novel GR method to uplift recalled candidate quality. GRDR assigns multiple semantic IDs to each video using a query-guided multi-view tokenizer exposing diverse semantic access paths, and jointly trains the tokenizer and generative retriever via a shared codebook to cast semantic IDs as the semantic bridge between texts and videos. At inference, trie-constrained decoding generates a compact candidate set reranked by a dense model for fine-grained matching. Experiments on TVR benchmarks show GRDR matches strong dense retrievers in accuracy while reducing index storage by an order of magnitude and accelerating up to 300$\\times$ in full-corpus retrieval."

Although Large Language Models (LLMs) possess strong reasoning skills, their direct application to PGPS is hindered by their inability to process visual diagrams. Existing works typically fine-tune Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) end-to-end on large-scale PGPS data to enhance visual understanding and reasoning simultaneously. However, such joint optimization may compromise base LLMs' inherent reasoning capability. In this work, we observe that LLM itself is potentially a powerful PGPS solver when appropriately formulating visual information as textual descriptions. We propose to train a MLLM Interpreter to generate geometric descriptions for the visual diagram, and an off-the-shelf LLM is utilized to perform reasoning. Specifically, we choose Conditional Declaration Language (CDL) as the geometric description as its conciseness eases the MLLM Interpreter training. The MLLM Interpreter is fine-tuned via CoT (Chain-of-Thought)-augmented SFT followed by GRPO to generate CDL. Instead of using a conventional solution-based reward that compares the reasoning result with the ground-truth answer, we design CDL matching rewards to facilitate more effective GRPO training, which provides more direct and denser guidance for CDL generation. To support training, we construct a new dataset, Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT, by manually reviewing Formalgeo7k v2 and incorporating CoT annotations. Extensive experiments on Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT, Unigeo, and MathVista show our method (finetuned on only 5.5k data) performs favorably against leading open-source and closed-source MLLMs."

    "abstract": "We apply the covariant entropy bound argument supporting the de Sitter swampland conjecture to the quintessence model, to find out the condition for the background to be unstable. More concretely, the background is unstable when the matter entropy given by the species number of the effective field theory increases more rapidly than the geometrical entropy proportional to the apparent horizon area, since it contradicts the covariant entropy bound. The rapid increase in the matter entropy is proposed by the distance conjecture, which states that the time evolution of some scalar field along the geodesic in the field space brings about the descent of a tower of states from UV. From this, we find that for the quintessence model, the accelerating background having the event horizon is unstable, and the instability condition as well as the lifetime of the unstable background is equivalent to the trans-Planckian censorship bound forbidding the classicalization of the trans-Planckian modes. We also point out that the scale separation between the Kaluza-Klein mass scale and the Hubble parameter can be realized when the product between the increasing rates of the matter and the geometrical entropies is bounded from below, which is consistent with the AdS distance conjecture. Our study suggests that various swampland conjectures can be comprehensively understood in the language of the entropy."

The approach is based on the semiclassical treatment of the path integral for an effective spin chain that describes \"two-replica\" observables such as the entanglement purity and the OTOC. This formalism gives exact results for the entanglement membrane and for operator spreading in the limit of weak interactions. In this limit there is a large crossover lengthscale between free and interacting behavior, and this large lengthscale allows for a continuum limit and a controlled saddle-point calculation. The formalism is also somewhat different from that known from random unitary circuits. The entanglement membrane emerges as a kind of bound state of two travelling waves, and shows an interesting unbinding phenomenon as the velocity of the entanglement membrane approaches the butterfly velocity."

    "abstract": "Adaptive sampling schemes are well known to create complex dependence that may invalidate conventional inference methods. A recent line of work shows that this need not be the case for UCB-type algorithms in multi-armed bandits. A central emerging theme is a `stability' property with asymptotically deterministic arm-pull counts in these algorithms, making inference as easy as in the i.i.d. setting. In this paper, we study the precise arm-pull dynamics in another canonical class of Thompson-sampling type algorithms. We show that the phenomenology is qualitatively different: the arm-pull count is asymptotically deterministic if and only if the arm is suboptimal or is the unique optimal arm; otherwise it converges in distribution to the unique invariant law of an SDE. This dichotomy uncovers a unifying principle behind many existing (in)stability results: an arm is stable if and only if its interaction with statistical noise is asymptotically negligible. As an application, we show that normalized arm means obey the same dichotomy, with Gaussian limits for stable arms and a semi-universal, non-Gaussian limit for unstable arms. This not only enables the construction of confidence intervals for the unknown mean rewards despite non-normality, but also reveals the potential of developing tractable inference procedures beyond the stable regime. The proofs rely on two new approaches. For suboptimal arms, we develop an `inverse process' approach that characterizes the inverse of the arm-pull count process via a Stieltjes integral. For optimal arms, we adopt a reparametrization of the arm-pull and noise processes that reduces the singularity in the natural SDE to proving the uniqueness of the invariant law of another SDE. We prove the latter by a set of analytic tools, including the parabolic Hörmander condition and the Stroock-Varadhan support theorem."

In recent studies, convolutional networks have reproduced classical basin metrics with negligible bias and low computational cost, while transformer based surrogates have computed accurate safety functions within seconds, bypassing the recursive procedures required by traditional methods.

    "abstract": "Controlling the behavior of large language models (LLMs) at inference time is essential for aligning outputs with human abilities and safety requirements. \\emph{Activation steering} provides a lightweight alternative to prompt engineering and fine-tuning by directly modifying internal activations to guide generation. This research advances the literature in three significant directions. First, while previous work demonstrated the technical feasibility of steering emotional tone using automated classifiers, this paper presents the first human evaluation of activation steering concerning the emotional tone of LLM outputs, collecting over 7,000 crowd-sourced ratings from 190 participants via Prolific ($n=190$). These ratings assess both perceived emotional intensity and overall text quality. Second, we find strong alignment between human and model-based quality ratings (mean $r=0.776$, range $0.157$--$0.985$), indicating automatic scoring can proxy perceived quality. Moderate steering strengths ($λ\\approx 0.15$) reliably amplify target emotions while preserving comprehensibility, with the strongest effects for disgust ($η_p^2 = 0.616$) and fear ($η_p^2 = 0.540$), and minimal effects for surprise ($η_p^2 = 0.042$). Finally, upgrading from Alpaca to LlaMA-3 yielded more consistent steering with significant effects across emotions and strengths (all $p < 0.001$). Inter-rater reliability was high (ICC $= 0.71$--$0.87$), underscoring the robustness of the findings. These findings support activation-based control as a scalable method for steering LLM behavior across affective dimensions."

These clusters are then employed to construct alternative spatial weight matrices for STAR models. Empirical results show that distance-based STAR models outperform classical contiguity-based ones, both in-sample and out-of-sample, with the Hamming distance-based STAR model achieving the best predictive accuracy. The study demonstrates that using statistical similarity rather than geographical proximity improves the modelling of global temperature dynamics, suggesting broader applicability to other environmental and socioeconomic datasets."

While LLM-as-Judge approaches offer a scalable alternative to human feedback, they face a fundamental limitation: performance is constrained by the evaluator's own quality. If the judge cannot recognize good solutions, it cannot provide useful training signals, and evaluation biases (e.g., favoring verbosity over quality) remain unaddressed. This motivates meta-evaluation: the ability to evaluate and improve the evaluator itself. We introduce CoNL, a framework that unifies generation, evaluation, and meta-evaluation through multi-agent self-play. Our key insight: critique quality can be measured by whether it helps others improve their solutions. In CoNL, multiple agents sharing the same policy engage in structured conversations to propose, critique, and revise solutions. Critiques that enable solution improvements earn a diagnostic reward, creating explicit supervision for meta-evaluation and enabling joint optimization of generation and judging capabilities through self-play, without external judges or ground truth. Experiments on five benchmarks show that CoNL achieves consistent improvements over self-rewarding baselines while maintaining stable training."

    "abstract": "Modern sparse language models typically achieve sparsity through Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers, which dynamically route tokens to dense MLP \"experts.\" However, dynamic hard routing has a number of drawbacks, such as potentially poor hardware efficiency and needing auxiliary losses for stable training. In contrast, the tokenizer embedding table, which is natively sparse, largely avoids these issues by selecting a single embedding per token at the cost of not having contextual information. In this work, we introduce the Large Lookup Layer (L$^3$), which unlocks a new axis of sparsity by generalizing embedding tables to model decoder layers. L$^3$ layers use static token-based routing to aggregate a set of learned embeddings per token in a context-dependent way, allowing the model to efficiently balance memory and compute by caching information in embeddings. L$^3$ has two main components: (1) a systems-friendly architecture that allows for fast training and CPU-offloaded inference with no overhead, and (2) an information-theoretic embedding allocation algorithm that effectively balances speed and quality. We empirically test L$^3$ by training transformers with up to 2.6B active parameters and find that L$^3$ strongly outperforms both dense models and iso-sparse MoEs in both language modeling and downstream tasks."

Results show that, in the default condition, participants who believed they had a clearer understanding of the event were more likely to trust GPT's output, whereas in the guided condition, participants showed stronger alignment between subjective clarity and actual recall. Additionally, participants evaluated the legitimacy of the individuals in the incident differently across conditions. Interaction analysis further revealed that default-GPT users spontaneously developed diverse strategies, including building on existing recollections, requesting potentially missing details, and treating GPT as a recall coach.

In this work, we uncover a striking \"Paradox of Robustness\": despite their known lexical brittleness, instruction-tuned LLMs exhibit a behavioral and near-total invariance to emotional framing effects. Using a novel controlled perturbation framework across three high-stakes domains (healthcare, law, and finance), we quantify a robustness gap where LLMs demonstrate 110-300 times greater resistance to narrative manipulation than human subjects. Specifically, we find a near-zero effect size for models (Cohen's h = 0.003) compared to the substantial biases observed in humans (Cohen's h in [0.3, 0.8]). This result is highly counterintuitive and suggests the mechanisms driving sycophancy and prompt sensitivity do not necessarily translate to a failure in logical constraint satisfaction. We show that this invariance persists across models with diverse training paradigms. Our findings show that while LLMs may be \"brittle\" to how a query is formatted, they are remarkably \"stable\" against why a decision should be biased. Our findings establish that instruction-tuned models can decouple logical rule-adherence from persuasive narratives, offering a source of decision stability that complements, and even potentially de-biases, human judgment in institutional contexts. We release the 162-scenario benchmark, code, and data to facilitate the rigorous evaluation of narrative-induced bias and robustness on GitHub.com."

We audited 16 models across 14 ethical scenarios and found that open-source models endorse prohibited actions 77% of the time under simple negation and 100% under compound negation -- a 317% increase over affirmative framing. Commercial models fare better but still show swings of 19-128%. Agreement between models drops from 74% on affirmative prompts to 62% on negated ones, and financial scenarios prove twice as fragile as medical ones. These patterns hold under deterministic decoding, ruling out sampling noise. We present case studies showing how these failures play out in practice, propose the Negation Sensitivity Index (NSI) as a governance metric, and outline a tiered certification framework with domain-specific thresholds. The findings point to a gap between what current alignment techniques achieve and what safe deployment requires: models that cannot reliably distinguish \"do X\" from \"do not X\" should not be making autonomous decisions in high-stakes contexts."

    "abstract": "Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve explicit chain-of-thought expansion by imitating deep thinking behaviors of humans, demonstrating excellent performance in complex task scenarios. However, the deep-thinking mode often leads to unnecessarily lengthy reasoning and resource inefficiency when handling simple tasks. This overthinking phenomenon may arise from the generation preference triggered by the reward function during post-training. Existing research attempts to mitigate overthinking from the perspective of prompt design or model training, but generally underestimates the importance of task difficulty awareness, which makes it difficult for LRMs to effectively allocate reasoning resources. In this paper, we propose Difficulty-aware Policy Optimization (DiPO), a reinforcement learning-based LRM training framework. DiPO encourages LRM to spontaneously model task complexity, and integrates them into reinforcement learning framework to adjust the generation preferences introduced by post-training. A difficulty modeling method based on model self-reasoning is proposed, which significantly reduces the dependence on manual annotation and formalize task complexity. We further develop a difficulty-signal-enhanced reward function that incorporates a penalty for lengthy reasoning while considering reasoning performance and output format. Experimental results indicate that DiPO enables the model to spontaneously adjust inference overhead, significantly reducing redundant tokens without losing performance due to thought compression."

No commensurability condition is assumed between the magnetic flux per unit cell and the quantum of magnetic flux.

The linear response coefficient, namely the Hall conductivity, is computed in terms of the equilibrium Fermi projection via the double-commutator formula, in accordance with the prediction from Kubo's linear response theory.

    "abstract": "In recent years, Text-to-Audio Generation has achieved remarkable progress, offering sound creators powerful tools to transform textual inspirations into vivid audio. However, existing models predominantly operate directly in the acoustic latent space of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), often leading to suboptimal alignment between generated audio and textual descriptions. In this paper, we introduce SemanticAudio, a novel framework that conducts both audio generation and editing directly in a high-level semantic space. We define this semantic space as a compact representation capturing the global identity and temporal sequence of sound events, distinct from fine-grained acoustic details. SemanticAudio employs a two-stage Flow Matching architecture: the Semantic Planner first generates these compact semantic features to sketch the global semantic layout, and the Acoustic Synthesizer subsequently produces high-fidelity acoustic latents conditioned on this semantic plan. Leveraging this decoupled design, we further introduce a training-free text-guided editing mechanism that enables precise attribute-level modifications on general audio without retraining. Specifically, this is achieved by steering the semantic generation trajectory via the difference of velocity fields derived from source and target text prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SemanticAudio surpasses existing mainstream approaches in semantic alignment. Demo available at: https://semanticaudio1.github.io/"

    "abstract": "The presence of interharmonics in power systems can lead to asynchronous sampling, a phenomenon further aggravated by shifts in the fundamental frequency, which significantly degrades the accuracy of power measurements. Under such asynchronous conditions, interharmonics lose orthogonality with the fundamental and harmonic components, giving rise to additional power components. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a linearization algorithm based on DFT spectrum analysis for precise power measurement in systems containing interharmonics. The proposed approach constructs a system of linear equations from the DFT spectrum and solves it through efficient matrix operations, enabling accurate extraction of interharmonic components near the fundamental and harmonic frequencies (with a frequency interval $\\geq$1 Hz). This allows for precise measurement of power across the fundamental, harmonic, interharmonic, and cross-power bands, as well as total power. Test results demonstrate that the proposed method accurately computes various power components under diverse conditions--including varying interharmonic/fundamental/harmonic intervals, fundamental frequency deviations, and noise. Compared to existing methods such as fast Fourier transform (FFT), Windowed interpolation FFT, and Matrix pencil-Singular value decomposition, the proposed technique reduces estimation error by several times to multiple folds and exhibits improved robustness, while maintaining a computational time of only 7 ms for processing 10-power-line-cycle (200 ms) data."

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in multi-model AI systems have leveraged LLM routers to reduce computational cost while maintaining response quality by assigning queries to the most appropriate model. However, as classifiers, LLM routers are vulnerable to novel adversarial attacks in the form of LLM rerouting, where adversaries prepend specially crafted triggers to user queries to manipulate routing decisions. Such attacks can lead to increased computational cost, degraded response quality, and even bypass safety guardrails, yet their security implications remain largely underexplored. In this work, we bridge this gap by systematizing LLM rerouting threats based on the adversary's objectives (i.e., cost escalation, quality hijacking, and safety bypass) and knowledge. Based on the threat taxonomy, we conduct a measurement study of real-world LLM routing systems against existing LLM rerouting attacks. The results reveal that existing routing systems are vulnerable to rerouting attacks, especially in the cost escalation scenario. We then characterize existing rerouting attacks using interpretability techniques, revealing that they exploit router decision boundaries through confounder gadgets that prepend queries to force misrouting. To mitigate these risks, we introduce RerouteGuard, a flexible and scalable guardrail framework for LLM rerouting. RerouteGuard filters adversarial rerouting prompts via dynamic embedding-based detection and adaptive thresholding. Extensive evaluations in three attack settings and four benchmarks demonstrate that RerouteGuard achieves over 99% detection accuracy against state-of-the-art rerouting attacks, while maintaining negligible impact on legitimate queries. The experimental results indicate that RerouteGuard offers a principled and practical solution for safeguarding multi-model AI systems against adversarial rerouting."

The similar framework allows the determination of the $4\\times 4$ CKM matrix elements $V_{ib'}$, $i=u$, $c$ and $t$, such that the strength of the CPV source can be evaluated unambiguously.

In this work, we propose a novel mechanism for the stimulated generation of magnonic frequency combs that overcomes these limitations. Our approach offers precise and efficient control over key comb properties, including spacing between spectral lines and the number of lines, marking a significant advancement in the field.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used for humanoid control, with on-policy methods such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) enabling robust training via large-scale parallel simulation and, in some cases, zero-shot deployment to real robots. However, the low sample efficiency of on-policy algorithms limits safe adaptation to new environments. Although off-policy RL and model-based RL have shown improved sample efficiency, the gap between large-scale pretraining and efficient finetuning on humanoids still exists. In this paper, we find that off-policy Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), with large-batch update and a high Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio, reliably supports large-scale pretraining of humanoid locomotion policies, achieving zero-shot deployment on real robots. For adaptation, we demonstrate that these SAC-pretrained policies can be finetuned in new environments and out-of-distribution tasks using model-based methods. Data collection in the new environment executes a deterministic policy while stochastic exploration is instead confined to a physics-informed world model. This separation mitigates the risks of random exploration during adaptation while preserving exploratory coverage for improvement. Overall, the approach couples the wall-clock efficiency of large-scale simulation during pretraining with the sample efficiency of model-based learning during fine-tuning."

    "abstract": "The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into educational assessment rests on the unverified assumption that instruction following capability translates directly to objective adjudication. We demonstrate that this assumption is fundamentally flawed. Instead of evaluating code quality, models frequently decouple from the submission's logic to satisfy hidden directives, a systemic vulnerability we term the Compliance Paradox, where models fine-tuned for extreme helpfulness are vulnerable to adversarial manipulation. To expose this, we introduce the Semantic-Preserving Adversarial Code Injection (SPACI) Framework and the Abstract Syntax Tree-Aware Semantic Injection Protocol (AST-ASIP). These methods exploit the Syntax-Semantics Gap by embedding adversarial directives into syntactically inert regions (trivia nodes) of the Abstract Syntax Tree. Through a large-scale evaluation of 9 SOTA models across 25,000 submissions in Python, C, C++, and Java, we reveal catastrophic failure rates (>95%) in high-capacity open-weights models like DeepSeek-V3, which systematically prioritize hidden formatting constraints over code correctness. We quantify this failure using our novel tripartite framework measuring Decoupling Probability, Score Divergence, and Pedagogical Severity to demonstrate the widespread \"False Certification\" of functionally broken code. Our findings suggest that current alignment paradigms create a \"Trojan\" vulnerability in automated grading, necessitating a shift from standard RLHF toward domain-specific Adjudicative Robustness, where models are conditioned to prioritize evidence over instruction compliance. We release our complete dataset and injection framework to facilitate further research on the topic."

EI-GN relies on gradient observations used to learn gradient-enhanced surrogate models that enable principled gradient inference from function evaluations. We derive a tractable closed-form expression for EI-GN that allows efficient optimization and show that the proposed acquisition is consistent with the improvement-based acquisition framework. Empirical evaluations on standard BO benchmarks demonstrate that EI-GN yields consistent improvements against standard baselines.

We develop a tractable analytical framework for sizing AFD bundles in an $r$A-$1$F topology, where the key difficulty is that Attention-side work is nonstationary-token context grows and requests are continuously replenished with random lengths-while FFN work is stable given the aggregated batch. Using a probabilistic workload model, we derive closed-form rules for the optimal A/F ratio that maximize average throughput per instance across the system.

In this work, we propose Low-rank \\& Lipschitz-controlled Routing (L2R), a unified routing framework that reshapes both the routing space and scoring geometry. L2R performs expert assignment in a shared low-rank latent routing space and introduces Saturated Inner-Product Scoring (SIPS) to explicitly control the Lipschitz behavior of routing functions, yielding smoother and more stable routing geometry. In addition, L2R incorporates a parameter-efficient multi-anchor routing mechanism to enhance expert expressiveness. Extensive experiments on a large-scale language MoE model and a vision MoE setting on ImageNet demonstrate that L2R consistently improves routing stability, expert specialization, and overall model performance."

The cross-correlation signal is measured as a function of the comoving separation $R$ between 2MASS galaxies and background FRB sightlines, making full use of the available redshift information for both datasets. Our measurements are consistent with a null detection over the range $0.01 < R\\, [h^{-1}\\mathrm{Mpc}] < 1$. Using a halo-based model in which free-electron density profiles are drawn from the hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG-300 (TNG300), we show that the null signal at $R \\sim 0.01\\, h^{-1}\\mathrm{Mpc}$ is inconsistent with the TNG300 prediction. This discrepancy indicates that the hot-gas mass fraction in halos with masses of $10^{12-13}\\, M_\\odot$ hosting 2MASS galaxies must be lower than that predicted by TNG300. A simple phenomenological modification of the TNG300 model suggests that the hot-gas mass fraction in halos of $10^{12-13}\\, M_\\odot$ should be below $\\sim 10\\%$ of the global baryon fraction in the nearby universe, implying the need for stronger feedback in this mass range. Our constraints are consistent with those inferred from X-ray emission and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich measurements in galaxies, while providing a direct estimate of the hot-gas mass fraction that does not rely on electron-temperature measurements. These results demonstrate that galaxy-FRB cross correlations offer a powerful probe of feedback processes in galaxy formation."

    "abstract": "Vision foundation models trained on discretely sampled images achieve strong performance on classification benchmarks, yet whether their representations encode the continuous processes underlying their training data remains unclear. This question is especially pertinent in computational pathology, where we posit that models whose latent representations implicitly capture continuous disease progression may better reflect underlying biology, support more robust generalization, and enable quantitative analyses of features associated with disease transitions. Using diffusion pseudotime, a method developed to infer developmental trajectories from single-cell transcriptomics, we probe whether foundation models organize disease states along coherent progression directions in representation space. Across four cancer progressions and six models, we find that all pathology-specific models recover trajectory orderings significantly exceeding null baselines, with vision-only models achieving the highest fidelities $(τ> 0.78$ on CRC-Serrated). Model rankings by trajectory fidelity on reference diseases strongly predict few-shot classification performance on held-out diseases ($ρ= 0.92$), and exploratory analysis shows cell-type composition varies smoothly along inferred trajectories in patterns consistent with known stromal remodeling. Together, these results demonstrate that vision foundation models can implicitly learn to represent continuous processes from independent static observations, and that trajectory fidelity provides a complementary measure of representation quality beyond downstream performance. While demonstrated in pathology, this framework could be applied to other domains where continuous processes are observed through static snapshots."

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples--inputs with imperceptible perturbations causing misclassification. While adversarial transfer within neural networks is well-documented, whether classical ML pipelines using handcrafted features inherit this vulnerability when attacked via neural surrogates remains unexplored. Feature engineering creates information bottlenecks through gradient quantization and spatial binning, potentially filtering high-frequency adversarial signals. We evaluate this hypothesis through the first comprehensive study of adversarial transfer from DNNs to HOG-based classifiers. Using VGG16 as a surrogate, we generate FGSM and PGD adversarial examples and test transfer to four classical classifiers (KNN, Decision Tree, Linear SVM, Kernel SVM) and a shallow neural network across eight HOG configurations on CIFAR-10. Our results strongly refute the protective hypothesis: all classifiers suffer 16.6%-59.1% relative accuracy drops, comparable to neural-to-neural transfer. More surprisingly, we discover attack hierarchy reversal--contrary to patterns where iterative PGD dominates FGSM within neural networks, FGSM causes greater degradation than PGD in 100% of classical ML cases, suggesting iterative attacks overfit to surrogate-specific features that don't survive feature extraction. Block normalization provides partial but insufficient mitigation. These findings demonstrate that adversarial vulnerability is not an artifact of end-to-end differentiability but a fundamental property of image classification systems, with implications for security-critical deployments across computational paradigms."

Singularities in semi-discrete optimal transport (OT) mark regions of semantic ambiguity, where classifiers are particularly prone to unwarranted high-confidence predictions. Motivated by this observation, we propose a principled framework to mitigate OOD overconfidence by leveraging the geometry of OT-induced singular boundaries. Specifically, we formulate an OT problem between a continuous base distribution and the latent embeddings of training data, and identify the resulting singular boundaries. By sampling near these boundaries, we construct a class of OOD inputs, termed optimal transport-induced OOD samples (OTIS), which are geometrically grounded and inherently semantically ambiguous. During training, a confidence suppression loss is applied to OTIS to guide the model toward more calibrated predictions in structurally uncertain regions. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly alleviates OOD overconfidence and outperforms state-of-the-art methods."

We introduce the Latent Autoregressive Network (LANE), which incorporates compact autoregressive dependencies in the generation process, achieving a $6\\times$ improvement in maximum generatable sequence length compared to existing methods. To further accelerate inference, we propose the Adaptive Computation Graph Reconfiguration (AdaGraph) strategy, which effectively overcomes the efficiency bottleneck of traditional serial inference through spatiotemporal decoupling in the generation process. Experimental validation demonstrates that LANE achieves superior performance across generation speed, structural detail, and geometric consistency, providing an effective solution for high-quality 3D mesh generation."

    "abstract": "Time-domain ADCs are attractive for high-speed wireline receivers, as time resolution scales favorably with advanced CMOS technologies, enabling multi-GS/s single-channel sampling rates. However, conventional time-domain ADCs require explicit reset of voltage-to-time and time-domain signal paths between samples, introducing dead time that fundamentally limits resolution, speed, and energy efficiency. This paper introduces a dual-edge reset-free quantization concept for asynchronous pipelined SAR time-domain ADCs, in which both rising and falling signal edges are exploited to enable reset-free quantization within a single conversion period. By eliminating explicit reset phases, the proposed approach expands the effective conversion window and relaxes the resolution-speed tradeoff at high sampling rates. An 8-bit dual-edge asynchronous pipelined SAR time-domain ADC is implemented in 22-nm FD-SOI, incorporating a linearity-compensated dual-edge voltage-to-time converter and a dual-edge time-to-digital converter with independently tunable rising- and falling-edge delays. The prototype occupies a core area of 0.0089 mm^2 and achieves continuous single-channel operation at 3.5 GS/s, with architectural scalability demonstrated through intermittent operation at 10.5 GS/s and higher. At 3.5 GS/s, the ADC achieves 21.6 dB SNDR and 32.2 dB SFDR. The measured performance is primarily limited by identifiable implementation-level factors rather than by architectural constraints, demonstrating the feasibility of dual-edge reset-free quantization for high-speed time-domain ADCs."

We propose the Physics-Guided Tiny-Mamba Transformer (PG-TMT), a compact tri-branch encoder tailored for online condition monitoring. A depthwise-separable convolutional stem captures micro-transients, a Tiny-Mamba state-space branch models near-linear long-range dynamics, and a lightweight local Transformer encodes cross-channel resonances. We derive an analytic temporal-to-spectral mapping that ties the model's attention spectrum to classical bearing fault-order bands, yielding a band-alignment score that quantifies physical plausibility and provides physics-grounded explanations. To ensure decision reliability, healthy-score exceedances are modeled with extreme-value theory (EVT), which yields an on-threshold achieving a target false-alarm intensity (events/hour); a dual-threshold hysteresis with a minimum hold time further suppresses chatter. Under a leakage-free streaming protocol with right-censoring of missed detections on CWRU, Paderborn, XJTU-SY, and an industrial pilot, PG-TMT attains higher precision-recall AUC (primary under imbalance), competitive or better ROC AUC, and shorter mean time-to-detect at matched false-alarm intensity, together with strong cross-domain transfer. By coupling physics-aligned representations with EVT-calibrated decision rules, PG-TMT delivers calibrated, interpretable, and deployment-ready early warnings for reliability-centric prognostics and health management."

Although deep learning methods have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA), effectively handling the sparse and irregular nature of input depth data in deep networks remains a significant challenge, often limiting performance, especially under high sparsity. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the Gaussian Belief Propagation Network (GBPN), a novel hybrid framework synergistically integrating deep learning with probabilistic graphical models for end-to-end depth completion. Specifically, a scene-specific Markov Random Field (MRF) is dynamically constructed by the Graphical Model Construction Network (GMCN), and then inferred via Gaussian Belief Propagation (GBP) to yield the dense depth distribution. Crucially, the GMCN learns to construct not only the data-dependent potentials of MRF but also its structure by predicting adaptive non-local edges, enabling the capture of complex, long-range spatial dependencies. Furthermore, we enhance GBP with a serial \\& parallel message passing scheme, designed for effective information propagation, particularly from sparse measurements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GBPN achieves SOTA performance on the NYUv2 and KITTI benchmarks. Evaluations across varying sparsity levels, sparsity patterns, and datasets highlight GBPN's superior performance, notable robustness, and generalizable capability."

To further integrate physical laws, a conditional embedding module is incorporated to inject physical information into the denoising network at multiple layers, ensuring consistent guidance throughout the diffusion process. The proposed PILD framework is concise, modular, and broadly applicable to problems governed by ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations, as well as algebraic equations or inequality constraints. Extensive experiments across engineering and scientific tasks including estimating vehicle trajectories, tire forces, Darcy flow and plasma dynamics, demonstrate that our PILD substantially improves accuracy, stability, and generalization over existing physics-informed and diffusion-based baselines."

For reliable deployment, these models must exhibit high physical fidelity, accurately simulating real-world dynamics. Existing physics-based video benchmarks, however, suffer from entanglement, where a single test simultaneously evaluates multiple physical laws and concepts, fundamentally limiting their diagnostic capability. We introduce WorldBench, a novel video-based benchmark specifically designed for concept-specific, disentangled evaluation, allowing us to rigorously isolate and assess understanding of a single physical concept or law at a time. To make WorldBench comprehensive, we design benchmarks at two different levels: 1) an evaluation of intuitive physical understanding with concepts such as object permanence or scale/perspective, and 2) an evaluation of low-level physical constants and material properties such as friction coefficients or fluid viscosity. When SOTA video-based world models are evaluated on WorldBench, we find specific patterns of failure in particular physics concepts, with all tested models lacking the physical consistency required to generate reliable real-world interactions. Through its concept-specific evaluation, WorldBench offers a more nuanced and scalable framework for rigorously evaluating the physical reasoning capabilities of video generation and world models, paving the way for more robust and generalizable world-model-driven learning."

This global-centric paradigm overlooks fine-grained interactions between local motion segments and individual body joints and text tokens, inevitably leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. To address this limitation, we draw inspiration from the pyramidal process of human motion perception (from joint dynamics to segment coherence, and finally to holistic comprehension) and propose a novel Pyramidal Shapley-Taylor (PST) learning framework for fine-grained motion-language retrieval. Specifically, the framework decomposes human motion into temporal segments and spatial body joints, and learns cross-modal correspondences through progressive joint-wise and segment-wise alignment in a pyramidal fashion, effectively capturing both local semantic details and hierarchical structural relationships. Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving precise alignment between motion segments and body joints and their corresponding text tokens.

To address this gap, we study the structural complexity of code, which captures control flow and compositional structure that may shape how models internalise multi-step reasoning during fine-tuning. We examine two complementary settings: solution-driven complexity, where complexity varies across multiple solutions to the same problem, and problem-driven complexity, where complexity reflects variation in the underlying tasks. Using cyclomatic complexity and logical lines of code to construct controlled fine-tuning datasets, we evaluate a range of open-weight LLMs on diverse reasoning benchmarks. Our findings show that although code can improve reasoning, structural properties strongly determine its usefulness. In 83% of experiments, restricting fine-tuning data to a specific structural complexity range outperforms training on structurally diverse code, pointing to a data-centric path for improving reasoning beyond scaling."

We address these limitations with MoHETS, an encoder-only Transformer that integrates sparse Mixture-of-Heterogeneous-Experts (MoHE) layers. MoHE routes temporal patches to a small subset of expert networks, combining a shared depthwise-convolution expert for sequence-level continuity with routed Fourier-based experts for patch-level periodic structures. MoHETS further improves robustness to non-stationary dynamics by incorporating exogenous information via cross-attention over covariate patch embeddings.

In recent years, a new type of quantum error correcting codes based on Pauli stabilisers, dubbed Floquet codes, has been introduced. In Floquet codes, syndrome measurements are arranged such that they dynamically generate a codespace at each time step. Here, we show that the BK theorem holds for a definition of Floquet codes based on locally conjugate stabiliser groups. Moreover, we introduce and define a class of generalised unitaries in Floquet codes that need not preserve the codespace at each time step, but that combined with the measurements constitute a valid logical operation.

With utility in mind, we formulate a privacy-utility trade-off problem to adaptively tackle sequential data requests made by different, potentially colluding entities. We consider both expected distortion and mutual information as measures to quantify utility, and use mutual information to measure privacy. We assume an attack model whereby illicit data sharing, which we call collusion, can occur between data receivers. We develop an adaptive algorithm for data releases that makes use of a modified Blahut-Arimoto algorithm. We show that the resulting data releases are optimal when expected distortion quantifies utility, and locally optimal when mutual information quantifies utility.

We present a blind, self-supervised enhancement framework that jointly deconvolves and denoises B-mode images using a Swin Convolutional U-Net trained with a \\emph{physics-guided} degradation model. From each training frame, we extract rotated/cropped patches and synthesize inputs by (i) convolving with a Gaussian PSF surrogate and (ii) injecting noise via either spatial additive Gaussian noise or complex Fourier-domain perturbations that emulate phase/magnitude distortions. For US scans, clean-like targets are obtained via non-local low-rank (NLLR) denoising, removing the need for ground truth; for natural images, the originals serve as targets. Trained and validated on UDIAT~B, JNU-IFM, and XPIE Set-P, and evaluated additionally on a 700-image PSFHS test set, the method achieves the highest PSNR/SSIM across Gaussian and speckle noise levels, with margins that widen under stronger corruption.

    "abstract": "In the era of the Internet of Everything (IoE), the exponential growth of sensor-generated data at the network edge renders efficient Probabilistic Skyline Query (PSKY) processing a critical challenge. Traditional distributed PSKY methodologies predominantly rely on pre-defined static thresholds to filter local candidates. However, these rigid approaches are fundamentally ill-suited for the highly volatile and heterogeneous nature of edge computing environments, often leading to either severe communication bottlenecks or excessive local computational latency. To resolve this resource conflict, this paper presents SA-PSKY, a novel Self-Adaptive framework designed for distributed edge-cloud collaborative systems. We formalize the dynamic threshold adjustment problem as a continuous Markov Decision Process (MDP) and leverage a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) agent to autonomously optimize filtering intensities in real-time. By intelligently analyzing multi-dimensional system states, including data arrival rates, uncertainty distributions, and instantaneous resource availability, our framework effectively minimizes a joint objective function of computation and communication costs. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that SA-PSKY consistently outperforms state-of-the-art static and heuristic baselines. Specifically, it achieves a reduction of up to 60\\% in communication overhead and 40\\% in total response time, while ensuring robust scalability across diverse data distributions."

    "abstract": "This paper establishes a fundamental and surprising phenomenon in the theory of stochastic wave equations: the restoration of the unique continuation property (UCP) across characteristic hypersurfaces, a property that is known to fail generically in the deterministic setting. We prove that if a solution to a linear stochastic wave equation vanishes on one side of a characteristic surface $Γ$, then it must vanish in a full neighborhood of any point on $Γ$, provided the stochastic diffusion coefficient is non-degenerate. This result stands in sharp contrast to the classical Hörmander-type counterexamples for deterministic waves. Furthermore, we extend the UCP to equations with non-homogeneous stochastic sources and establish a global unique continuation result from the interior of an arbitrarily narrow characteristic cone. Our proofs rely on a novel stochastic Carleman estimate, where the Itô diffusion term introduces a crucial positive energy contribution that is absent in deterministic models. These findings demonstrate a qualitative difference between deterministic and stochastic hyperbolic dynamics and open new avenues for control theory and inverse problems in stochastic setting."

A Segal type is defined to be a type in which these directed morphisms can be composed. We show that all higher coherences can be stated and derived if simplicial type theory is taken to be homotopy type theory with a postulated interval type. In technical terms, this means that if a type has unique fillers for $(2,1)$-horns, it has unique fillers for all inner $(n,k)$-horns. This generalizes a result of Riehl and Shulman for the case $n = 3, k \\in \\{1, 2\\}$. Our main technical tool is the Leibniz adjunction: the pushout-product is left adjoint to the pullback-hom in the wild category of types. While this adjunction is well known for ordinary categories, it is much more involved for higher categories, and the fact that it can be proved for the wild category of types (a higher category without stated higher coherences) is non-trivial. We make profitable use of the equivalence between the wild category of maps and that of families. We have formalized the results in Cubical Agda."

Experimental results show similar or improved uncertainty estimation and calibration compared to existing LLA approximations. Notwithstanding, biasing the learned kernel significantly enhances out-of-distribution detection. This remarks the benefits of the proposed method for finding better kernels than the NTK in the context of LLA to compute prediction uncertainty given a pre-trained DNN."

Lett. 36, 3530 (2011)]. We show that the microscopic dipole phase at the extended harmonic frequencies is sensitive to the relative IR-XUV delay and IR intensity, whereas the corresponding signal intensity drops significantly for chirped XUV pulses with poor temporal coherence. We discuss the impact of such sensitivity on the macroscopic harmonic radiation, whereby decoherence among the dipole emitters may lead to further signal suppression."

While time-delay cosmography using quadruply lensed GW events associated with optical images of the lens systems can provide precise measurement of the Hubble constant ($H_0$), they are considered to be much rarer than doubly lensed events. In this work, we analyze time-delay cosmography with doubly lensed GW events for the first time. We generate mock doubly lensed GW events with designed sensitivity of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) O5 network, with LIGO post-O5 upgrade, and with Einstein Telescope (ET) + Cosmic Explorer (CE) respectively, and select the events that can be associated with future galaxy surveys. Over 1000 realizations, we find an average of 0.2(2.4) qualified events with the LVK O5(post-O5) network. Whereas with the ET+CE network, we find an average of 73.2 qualified events over 100 realizations. Using the Singular Isothermal Sphere (SIS) lens model, we jointly estimate waveform parameters and the impact parameter with doubly lensed GW signals, and then forecast the constraints on cosmological parameters and modified GW propagation by combining time-delay cosmography and the standard siren approach. The average posterior gives a constraint on $H_0$ with a relative uncertainty of $14\\%$, $10\\%$ and $0.42\\%$ in the $Λ$CDM model for the LVK O5, LVK post-O5, and ET+CE network, respectively. While the LVK network gives uninformative constraints on the $(w_0,w_a)$ dynamical dark energy model, the ET+CE network yields a moderate constraint of $w_0=-1.02^{+0.31}_{-0.22}$ and $w_a=0.48^{+0.99}_{-1.54}$.

More data can make evaluation more confidently wrong under misspecified aggregation. We propose a judge-aware ranking framework that extends the Bradley-Terry-Luce model by introducing judge-specific discrimination parameters, jointly estimating latent model quality and judge reliability from pairwise comparisons without reference labels. We establish identifiability up to natural normalizations and prove consistency and asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimator, enabling confidence intervals for score differences and rank comparisons. Across multiple public benchmarks and a newly collected dataset, our method improves agreement with human preferences, achieves higher data efficiency than unweighted baselines, and produces calibrated uncertainty quantification for LLM rankings."

We analyzed their narrative form, symbolic meaning, occupational relevance, and links to knowledge areas in software engineering. To ground these concepts in practice, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 12 industrial practitioners in Sweden to explore how such narratives are recognized or transmitted within their daily work and how they affect it. Synthesizing these results, we propose a working definition of software engineering folklore as informally transmitted, traditional, and emergent narratives and heuristics enacted within occupational folk groups that shape identity, values, and collective knowledge. We argue that making the concept of software engineering folklore explicit provides a foundation for subsequent ethnography and folklore studies and for reflective practice that can preserve context-effective heuristics while challenging unhelpful folklore."

Nonetheless, emerging evidence shows that CDR can inadvertently heighten group-level unfairness. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis to uncover why these fairness issues arise. Specifically, we identify two key challenges: (i) Cross-Domain Disparity Transfer, wherein existing group-level disparities in the source domain are systematically propagated to the target domain; and (ii) Unfairness from Cross-Domain Information Gain, where the benefits derived from cross-domain knowledge are unevenly allocated among distinct groups. To address these two challenges, we propose a Cross-Domain Fairness Augmentation (CDFA) framework composed of two key components. Firstly, it mitigates cross-domain disparity transfer by adaptively integrating unlabeled data to equilibrate the informativeness of training signals across groups. Secondly, it redistributes cross-domain information gains via an information-theoretic approach to ensure equitable benefit allocation across groups. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and baselines demonstrate that our framework significantly reduces unfairness in CDR without sacrificing overall recommendation performance, while even enhancing it."

It also arises in the context of gradient-based methods for optimization problems that feature matrix functions, e.g., when fitting an evolution equation to an observed solution trajectory. In principle, the well-known identity \\[ f\\left( \\begin{bmatrix} A & E \\\\ 0 & A \\end{bmatrix} \\right) \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ \\vc{b} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} L_f(A, E) \\vc{b} \\\\ f(A) \\vc{b} \\end{bmatrix}, \\] allows one to directly apply any standard Krylov subspace method, such as the Arnoldi algorithm, to address this task. However, this comes with the major disadvantage that the involved block triangular matrix has unfavorable spectral properties, which impede the convergence analysis and, to a certain extent, also the observed convergence. To avoid these difficulties, we propose a novel modification of the Arnoldi algorithm that aims at better preserving the block triangular structure. In turn, this allows one to bound the convergence of the modified method by the best polynomial approximation of the derivative $f^\\prime$ on the numerical range of $A$.

While classical theory ensures that consistency and monotonicity imply convergence to the viscosity solution, treating these discrete systems as optimization problems introduces new analytical hurdles: solvability and the uniqueness of local minima do not follow from monotonicity alone. By establishing the well--posedness of these optimization--based solvers, our framework enables the adaptation of Level Set Methods to high--dimensional settings, unlocking new capabilities in applications such as high--dimensional segmentation and interface tracking.

We demonstrate that when realistic spatial variations of the Earths density are taken into account, the oscillation probabilities acquire additional, energy dependent structures that cannot be captured by path-averaged density approximations. We show that mismodeling of the matter density profile can introduce degeneracies that obscure genuine leptonic CP violating effects, thereby degrading parameter sensitivity and biasing the inference of the CP phase. Identifying energy regions in which CP sensitivity remains robust against matter density uncertainties is therefore essential. These considerations indicate that marginalization over a single effective density parameter is insufficient for next generation precision measurements and motivate the incorporation of spatially resolved Earth density profiles in the analysis frameworks of future long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments."

Building on this, we design an agentic augmentation pipeline that simulates expert workflows to generate 266K multi-turn cybersecurity samples for supervised fine-tuning. Combined with general open-source LLM data, these resources enable the training of RedSage, an open-source, locally deployable cybersecurity assistant with domain-aware pretraining and post-training. To rigorously evaluate the models, we introduce RedSage-Bench, a benchmark with 30K multiple-choice and 240 open-ended Q&A items covering cybersecurity knowledge, skills, and tool expertise. RedSage is further evaluated on established cybersecurity benchmarks (e.g., CTI-Bench, CyberMetric, SECURE) and general LLM benchmarks to assess broader generalization.

    "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often answer classic visual illusions \"correctly\" on original images, yet persist with the same responses when illusion factors are inverted, even though the visual change is obvious to humans. This raises a fundamental question: do VLMs perceive visual changes or merely recall memorized patterns? While several studies have noted this phenomenon, the underlying causes remain unclear. To move from observations to systematic understanding, this paper introduces VI-Probe, a controllable visual-illusion framework with graded perturbations and matched visual controls (without illusion inducer) that disentangles visually grounded perception from language-driven recall. Unlike prior work that focuses on averaged accuracy, we measure stability and sensitivity using Polarity-Flip Consistency, Template Fixation Index, and an illusion multiplier normalized against matched controls. Experiments across different families reveal that response persistence arises from heterogeneous causes rather than a single mechanism. For instance, GPT-5 exhibits memory override, Claude-Opus-4.1 shows perception-memory competition, while Qwen variants suggest visual-processing limits. Our findings challenge single-cause views and motivate probing-based evaluation that measures both knowledge and sensitivity to controlled visual change.

    "abstract": "Given a finite vector space $V=\\mathbb{F}_q^n$, the $q$-analogue of a graph, called a $q$-graph, is a pair $Γ=(\\mathcal{V},\\mathcal{E})$, where $\\mathcal{V}$ is the set of $1$-dimensional subspaces of $V$ and $\\mathcal{E}$ is a subset of the $2$-dimensional subspaces of $V$. Elements of $\\mathcal{V}$ and $\\mathcal{E}$ are called vertices and edges, respectively. If the edges through a vertex $X$ consist of all $2$-spaces of a $(k+1)$-dimensional space which contain $X$, regardless of the choice of vertex, then $Γ$ is $k$-regular. Moreover, $Γ$ is flag-transitive if there is a subgroup of $Γ{\\rm L}_n(q)$ preserving $\\mathcal{E}$ and acting transitively on the set of all incident vertex-edge pairs; and symmetric if there is a subgroup of $Γ{\\rm L}_n(q)$ preserving $\\mathcal{E}$ and acting transitively on the set of all ordered pairs of adjacent vertices. This paper classifies all $k$-regular $q$-graphs that are either flag-transitive or symmetric. The $q$-graphs in the classification are constructed from familiar objects in finite geometry, including spreads, symplectic polar spaces, and generalised hexagons. The classification depends essentially on the classification of transitive linear groups, and thus ultimately on the classification of finite simple groups."

This task is particularly challenging when the number of features is large relative to the number of observations. This problem is often present in mobile health, where behavioral changes in at-risk patients must be detected in real time in order to prompt timely interventions. We propose a variance component score test (VC*) for detecting changes in feature means and/or variances using only pre-change point data to estimate distributional parameters. Through simulation studies, we show that VC* has higher power than existing methods. Moreover, we demonstrate that reducing bias by using only pre-change point days to estimate parameters outweighs the increased estimator variances in most scenarios. Lastly, we apply VC* and competing methods to passively collected smartphone data in adolescents and young adults with affective instability."

We introduce EditYourself, a DiT-based framework for audio-driven video-to-video (V2V) editing that enables transcript-based modification of talking head videos, including the seamless addition, removal, and retiming of visually spoken content. Building on a general-purpose video diffusion model, EditYourself augments its V2V capabilities with audio conditioning and region-aware, edit-focused training extensions. This enables precise lip synchronization and temporally coherent restructuring of existing performances via spatiotemporal inpainting, including the synthesis of realistic human motion in newly added segments, while maintaining visual fidelity and identity consistency over long durations. This work represents a foundational step toward generative video models as practical tools for professional video post-production."

    "abstract": "This paper presents the first optimal-rate $p$-th order methods with $p\\geq 1$ for finding first and second-order stationary points of non-convex smooth objective functions over Riemannian manifolds. In contrast to the geodesically convex setting, we definitively establish that the optimal oracle complexity of non-convex optimization over manifolds matches that over Euclidean space. In parallel with the complexity analysis, we introduce a general framework for systematically studying higher-order regularity on Riemannian manifolds that characterizes its joint dependence on the objective function and the chosen retraction. To the best of our knowledge, this framework constitutes the first known application in optimization of pullback connections and the Sasaki metric to the study of retraction-based pullbacks of the objective function. We provide clean derivative bounds based on a new covariant Faà di Bruno formula derived within our framework. For $p=3$, our methods are fully implementable via a new Krylov-based framework for minimizing quartically regularized cubic polynomials. This is the first Krylov method for this class of polynomials and may be of independent interest beyond Riemannian optimization."

    "abstract": "We present the first application of MAP-Elites, a quality-diversity algorithm, to trade execution. Rather than searching for a single optimal policy, MAP-Elites generates a diverse portfolio of regime-specialist strategies indexed by liquidity and volatility conditions. Individual specialists achieve 8-10% performance improvements within their behavioural niches, while other cells show degradation, suggesting opportunities for ensemble approaches that combine improved specialists with the baseline PPO policy. Results indicate that quality-diversity methods offer promise for regime-adaptive execution, though substantial computational resources per behavioural cell may be required for robust specialist development across all market conditions. To ensure experimental integrity, we develop a calibrated Gymnasium environment focused on order scheduling rather than tactical placement decisions. The simulator features a transient impact model with exponential decay and square-root volume scaling, fit to 400+ U.S. equities with R^2>0.02 out-of-sample. Within this environment, two Proximal Policy Optimization architectures - both MLP and CNN feature extractors - demonstrate substantial improvements over industry baselines, with the CNN variant achieving 2.13 bps arrival slippage versus 5.23 bps for VWAP on 4,900 out-of-sample orders ($21B notional). These results validate both the simulation realism and provide strong single-policy baselines for quality-diversity methods."

    "abstract": "Accurate reconstruction of atmospheric wind fields is essential for applications such as weather forecasting, hazard prediction, and wind energy assessment, yet conventional instruments leave spatio-temporal gaps within the lower atmospheric boundary layer. Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) provide flexible in situ measurements, but individual platforms sample wind only along their flight trajectories, limiting full wind-field recovery. This study presents a framework for reconstructing four-dimensional atmospheric wind fields using measurements obtained from a coordinated UAS swarm. A synthetic turbulence environment and high-fidelity multirotor simulation are used to generate training and evaluation data. Local wind components are estimated from UAS dynamics using a bidirectional long short-term memory network (Bi-LSTM) and assimilated into a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to reconstruct a continuous wind field in space and time. For local wind estimation, the bidirectional LSTM achieves root-mean-square errors (RMSE) of 0.064 and 0.062 m/s for the north and east components in low-wind conditions, increasing to 0.122 to 0.129 m/s under moderate winds and 0.271 to 0.273 m/s in high-wind conditions, while the vertical component exhibits higher error, with RMSE values of 0.029 to 0.091 m/s. The physics-informed reconstruction recovers the dominant spatial and temporal structure of the wind field up to 1000 m altitude while preserving mean flow direction and vertical shear. Under moderate wind conditions, the reconstructed mean wind field achieves an overall RMSE between 0.118 and 0.154 m/s across evaluated UAS configurations, with the lowest error obtained using a five-UAS swarm. These results demonstrate that coordinated UAS measurements enable accurate and scalable four-dimensional wind-field reconstruction without dedicated wind sensors or fixed infrastructure."

We consider a Lennard-Jones potential with free parameters in the McKean-Vlasov framework and proceed with a regularization at the mesoscale letting the particles interact moderately. We prove the well-posedness of the McKean-Vlasov SDE involving such singular kernels and the convergence of the empirical measure towards the solution of the McKean-Vlasov Fokker-Planck PDE, by means of a semigroup approach. We derive both the range of parameters characterizing the aggregation and repulsive force and the mesoscale order for which the convergence is achieved, by obtaining the right integrability regularity of the drift."

    "abstract": "Quantization has significantly improved the compute and memory efficiency of Large Language Model (LLM) training. However, existing approaches still rely on accumulating their updates in high-precision: concretely, gradient updates must be applied to a high-precision weight buffer, known as $\\textit{master weights}$. This buffer introduces substantial memory overhead, particularly for Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) models, where model parameters and optimizer states dominate memory usage. To address this, we introduce the Error-Compensating Optimizer (ECO), which eliminates master weights by applying updates directly to quantized parameters. ECO quantizes weights after each step and carefully injects the resulting quantization error into the optimizer momentum, forming an error-feedback loop with no additional memory. We prove that, under standard assumptions and a decaying learning rate, ECO converges to a constant-radius neighborhood of the optimum, while naive master-weight removal can incur an error that is inversely proportional to the learning rate. We show empirical results for pretraining small Transformers (30-800M), a Gemma-3 1B model, and a 2.1B parameter Sparse MoE model with FP8 quantization, and fine-tuning DeepSeek-MoE-16B in INT4 precision. Throughout, ECO matches baselines with master weights up to near-lossless accuracy, significantly shifting the static memory vs validation loss Pareto frontier."

This inefficiency stems from the fact that it focuses on tail-end performance and overlooks many sampled trajectories. We address this problem by augmenting CVaR with an expected quantile term. Quantile optimization admits a dynamic programming formulation that leverages all sampled data, thus improves sample efficiency. This does not alter the CVaR objective since CVaR corresponds to the expectation of quantile over the tail. Empirical results in domains with verifiable risk-averse behavior show that our algorithm within the Markovian policy class substantially improves upon CVaR-PG and consistently outperforms other existing methods."

Existing reference-based image generation methods leverage large-scale pretrained diffusion models and demonstrate strong capability in generating diverse images conditioned on a single reference image. However, these methods are limited to single-image references and cannot leverage 3D assets, constraining their practical versatility. To address this gap, we present a cross-domain diffusion model with dual-branch perception that leverages multi-view RGB images and point maps of 3D assets to jointly model their colors and canonical-space coordinates, achieving precise consistency between generated images and the 3D references. Our spatially aligned dual-branch generation architecture and domain-decoupled generation mechanism ensure the simultaneous generation of two spatially aligned but content-disentangled outputs, RGB images and point maps, linking 2D image attributes with 3D asset attributes. Experiments show that our approach effectively uses 3D assets as references to produce images consistent with the given assets, opening new possibilities for combining diffusion models with 3D content creation."

We propose boundary probes which are able to distinguish small AdS black holes from other states within the microcanonical ensemble. We investigate different coarse-graining prescriptions acting on the evolving CFT state, including averaging over CFT data, Hamiltonians and time windows, and compare their purities to those expected from the bulk semiclassical description. Our results clarify how semiclassical black hole behaviour can arise from an ensemble-averaging of the exact unitary dynamics, and take a step towards a better understanding of coarse-graining in the single-sided black hole information problem."

To extract faint CGM emission in the presence of bright point sources, we introduce {\\it CubeCarve}, a dual-channel deconvolution algorithm that separates unresolved quasar emission from spatially extended structure. This approach enables reliable recovery of \\Lya\\ emission projected onto the quasar position without introducing subtraction artifacts. Using {\\it CubeCarve}, we find that the \\Lya\\ surface brightness profiles of these systems are, on average, fainter and shallower than those of quasars of similar bolometric luminosities. We also find that the total integrated \\Lya\\ luminosities of the nebulae are lower in systems whose host galaxies exhibit brighter far-infrared emission. These results suggest that the CGM conditions in composite systems differ from those in the broader quasar population. Our study highlights both the physical diversity of quasar CGM environments and the effectiveness of {\\it CubeCarve} for recovering diffuse emission in modern IFU datasets."
