    "abstract": "We propose an intrinsic geometric framework on the space of operational contexts, specified by channels, stationary states, and self-preservation functionals. Each context C carries a pointer algebra, internal charges, and a self-consistent configuration minimizing a self-preservation functional. The Hessian of this functional yields an intrinsic metric on charge space, while non-commutative questioning loops dN -> dPhi -> d rho^circ define a notion of curvature. In suitable regimes, this N-Q-S geometry reduces to familiar Fisher-type information metrics and admits charts that resemble Riemannian or Lorentzian space-times. We outline how gauge symmetries and gravitational dynamics can be interpreted as holonomies and consistency conditions in this context geometry."

    "abstract": "Flexible ferroelectrics possess significant potential for wearable electronics and bio-inspired devices, yet their electromechanical coupling mechanisms under dynamic bending remain elusive. This study employs phase-field simulations to investigate the effects of bending deformation on domain structures and macroscopic ferroelectric responses in (SrTiO3)10/(PbTiO3)10/(SrTiO3)10 trilayer films. By constructing computational models for upward-concave (U-shaped) and downward-concave (N-shaped) configurations, we analyze the regulation of polarization patterns by strain distributions under varying curvature radii. The results demonstrate that the two bending modes generate opposite through-thickness strain gradients: U-shaped bending produces compressive strain in the upper layer and tensile strain in the lower, while N-shaped bending yields the reverse. These inhomogeneous strains drive distinct polarization reconfigurations within the PTO layer. While stable vortex-antivortex pairs persist at moderate curvatures, reducing the bending radius triggers divergent topological transitions -- U-shaped bending transforms vortex pairs into zigzag-like domains, whereas N-shaped bending promotes out-of-plane c-domain evolution. Crucially, bending-induced strain gradients generate transverse flexoelectric fields that markedly modulate hysteresis loops. U-shaped bending introduces a negative flexoelectric field, shifting loops rightward and suppressing maximum polarization Pmax. In contrast, N-shaped bending generates a positive field, shifting loops leftward and enhancing Pmax. Furthermore, analysis of polarization switching reveals that bending mediates domain-evolution pathways and reversal dynamics."

    "abstract": "Building extraction from remote sensing images is a challenging task due to the complex structure variations of the buildings. Existing methods employ convolutional or self-attention blocks to capture the multi-scale features in the segmentation models, while the inherent gap of the feature pyramids and insufficient global-local feature integration leads to inaccurate, ambiguous extraction results. To address this issue, in this paper, we present an Uncertainty-Aggregated Global-Local Fusion Network (UAGLNet), which is capable to exploit high-quality global-local visual semantics under the guidance of uncertainty modeling. Specifically, we propose a novel cooperative encoder, which adopts hybrid CNN and transformer layers at different stages to capture the local and global visual semantics, respectively. An intermediate cooperative interaction block (CIB) is designed to narrow the gap between the local and global features when the network becomes deeper. Afterwards, we propose a Global-Local Fusion (GLF) module to complementarily fuse the global and local representations. Moreover, to mitigate the segmentation ambiguity in uncertain regions, we propose an Uncertainty-Aggregated Decoder (UAD) to explicitly estimate the pixel-wise uncertainty to enhance the segmentation accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance to other state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/Dstate/UAGLNet"

Our analysis reveals a dual mechanism behind the drastic suppression of thermal conductivity in bundles: first, the breaking of rotational symmetry in isolated SWCNTs dramatically enhances the scattering rates of symmetry-sensitive phonon modes, such as the twist (TW) mode. Second, the emergence of new inter-tube phonon modes introduces abundant additional scattering channels across the entire frequency spectrum. Crucially, the incorporation of quantum Bose-Einstein (BE) statistics is essential to accurately capture these phenomena, enabling our approach to quantitatively reproduce experimental observations. This work establishes the combination of ML-driven interatomic potentials and ALD-BTE as a predictive framework for nanoscale thermal transport, effectively bridging the gap between theoretical models and experimental measurements."

Furthermore, we characterize precisely when a graph on $n \\geq 5$ vertices is uniquely reconstructible from its $3$-cut complex. Based on this characterization, we develop an $O(n^4)$ recognition algorithm. These results deepen the connection between graph structure and the topology of cut complexes."

    "abstract": "The efficacy of UAV swarm cooperative perception fundamentally depends on three-dimensional (3D) formation geometry, which governs target observability and sensor complementarity. In the literature, the exploitation of formation geometry and its impact on UAV sensing have rarely been studied, which can significantly degrade multimodal cooperative perception at scenarios where heterogeneous payloads (vision cameras and LiDAR) should be geometrically arranged to exploit their complementary strengths while managing communication interference and hardware budgets. To bridge this critical gap, we propose an information-theoretic optimization framework that allocation of UAVs and multimodal sensors, configures formation geometries, and flight control. The UAV-sensor allocation is optimized by the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) determinant maximization. Under this framework we introduce an equivalent formation transition strategy that enhances field-of-view (FOV) coverage without compromising perception accuracy and communication interference. Furthermore, we design a novel Lyapunov-stable flight control scheme with logarithmic potential fields to generate energy-efficient trajectories for formation transitions. Extensive simulations demonstrate our formation-aware design achieves 25.0\\% improvement in FOV coverage, 104.2\\% enhancement in communication signal strength, and 47.2\\% reduction in energy consumption compared to conventional benchmarks. This work establishes that task-driven geometric configuration represents a foundational rather than incidental component in next-generation UAV swarm systems."

    "abstract": "With the rapid growth of smart devices and mobile internet, large-scale data processing is becoming increasingly important, while mobile devices remain resource-constrained. Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) addresses this limitation by offloading tasks to the cloud. Nevertheless, the widespread adoption of MCC also raises challenges such as data privacy, selective computation, efficient revocation, and keyword search. Additionally, the development of quantum computers also threatens data security in MCC. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient quantum-resistant delegable data analysis scheme with revocation and keyword search (EQDDA-RKS) for MCC. In the proposed scheme, an authorised mobile device can perform keyword searches and compute inner product values over encrypted data without disclosing any additional information. Meanwhile, if a user's function key is compromised, it can be revoked. To alleviate the burden on mobile devices, most of the computation which should be executed by the mobile device is outsourced to a cloud server, and the mobile device only needs to interact with a central authority once. Furthermore, an authorised mobile device can temporarily delegate its keyword search and function computation rights to a delegatee in case the device becomes unavailable due to power depletion, going offline, etc. Our scheme is formally proven secure in the standard model against quantum attacks, chosen plaintext attacks, chosen keyword attacks, and outside keyword guessing attacks. Furthermore, the analysis demonstrates that the number of interactions between a mobile device and the central authority is $O(1)$ in our scheme, rather than growing linearly with the number of functions, which is well-suited for MCC scenarios."

We first propose a PAC-Bayes bound for multivariate linear regression, extending the earlier bound for single-output linear regression by Shalaeva et al., and establish sufficient conditions for its convergence. We then show that LAEs, when evaluated under a relaxed mean squared error, can be interpreted as constrained multivariate linear regression models on bounded data, to which our bound adapts. Furthermore, we develop theoretical methods to improve the computational efficiency of optimizing the LAE bound, enabling its practical evaluation on large models and real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our bound is tight and correlates well with practical ranking metrics such as Recall@K and NDCG@K."

We propose the Data Annotation Requirements Representation and Specification (DARS), including an Annotation Negotiation Card to align stakeholders on objectives and constraints, and a Scenario-Based Annotation Specification to express atomic and verifiable data annotation requirements. We evaluate DARS with an automotive perception case related to an ongoing project, and a mapping against 18 real-world data annotation error types. The results suggest that DARS mitigates root causes of completeness, accuracy, and consistency annotation errors. By integrating DARS into RE, this work improves the reliability of safety-critical systems using data annotations and demonstrates how engineering frameworks must evolve for data-dependent components of today's intelligent information systems."

    "abstract": "While Large Language Model (LLM) agents show great potential for automated UI navigation such as automated UI testing and AI assistants, their efficiency has been largely overlooked. Our motivating study reveals that inefficient UI representation creates a critical performance bottleneck. However, UI representation optimization, formulated as the task of automatically generating programs that transform UI representations, faces two unique challenges. First, the lack of Boolean oracles, which traditional program synthesis uses to decisively validate semantic correctness, poses a fundamental challenge to co-optimization of token efficiency and completeness. Second, the need to process large, complex UI trees as input while generating long, compositional transformation programs, making the search space vast and error-prone. Toward addressing the preceding limitations, we present UIFormer, the first automated optimization framework that synthesizes UI transformation programs by conducting constraint-based optimization with structured decomposition of the complex synthesis task. First, UIFormer restricts the program space using a domain-specific language (DSL) that captures UI-specific operations. Second, UIFormer conducts LLM-based iterative refinement with correctness and efficiency rewards, providing guidance for achieving the efficiency-completeness co-optimization. UIFormer operates as a lightweight plugin that applies transformation programs for seamless integration with existing LLM agents, requiring minimal modifications to their core logic. Evaluations across three UI navigation benchmarks spanning Android and Web platforms with five LLMs demonstrate that UIFormer achieves 48.7% to 55.8% token reduction with minimal runtime overhead while maintaining or improving agent performance. Real-world industry deployment at WeChat further validates the practical impact of UIFormer."

Our approach addresses the critical challenges of the domain gap between synthetic and real-world imagery and the time-consuming bottleneck of manual annotation. We leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to create photorealistic representations of the operational environment and objects. These assets are then used in a game engine where physics simulations create natural arrangements. A novel, two-pass rendering technique combines the realism of splats with a shadow map generated from proxy meshes. This map is then algorithmically composited with the image to add both physically plausible shadows and subtle highlights, significantly enhancing realism. Pixel-perfect segmentation masks are generated automatically and formatted for direct use with object detection models like YOLO. Our experiments show that a hybrid training strategy, combining a small set of real images with a large volume of our synthetic data, yields the best detection and segmentation performance, confirming this as an optimal strategy for efficiently achieving robust and accurate models."

    "abstract": "This PhD thesis discusses how European law could improve privacy protection in the area of behavioural targeting. Behavioural targeting, also referred to as online profiling, involves monitoring people's online behaviour, and using the collected information to show people individually targeted advertisements. To protect privacy in the area of behavioural targeting, the EU lawmaker mainly relies on the consent requirement for the use of tracking technologies in the e-Privacy Directive, and on general data protection law. With informed consent requirements, the law aims to empower people to make choices in their best interests. But behavioural studies cast doubt on the effectiveness of the empowerment approach as a privacy protection measure. Many people click \"I agree\" to any statement that is presented to them. Therefore, to mitigate privacy problems such as chilling effects, this study argues for a combined approach of protecting and empowering the individual. Compared to the current approach, the lawmaker should focus more on protecting people. The PhD thesis is a legal study, but it also incorporates insights from other disciplines, such as computer science, behavioural economics, and media studies. This study is among the first to discuss the implications of behavioural research for European data protection policy. The topic of whether data protection law should apply to pseudonymous data is discussed in depth. The study contains a detailed analysis of the role of informed consent in data protection law, and gives much attention to the tension between protecting and empowering the individual within data protection law."

Two types of spicules, referred to as types I and II, have been identified in observations and studied in previous numerical works. The statistics of type II spicules in 3D numerical simulations have not yet been studied. We aim to compare the statistics of properties such as lengths, lifetimes, widths, heights, inclinations, and maximum velocities of self-consistently formed spicules in a MURaM-ChE simulation with observations. We employ a H$α$ proxy to identify fine-scale structures at the solar limb resembling spicules in a simulation of an enhanced network region. We track the evolution of 58 such features found in a 21-minute time sequence, and compare their dynamical and morphological properties with those derived from quiet-Sun observations using the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) onboard the Hinode mission in the Ca II H spectral line. Previous studies have shown that spicules show very similar properties in Ca II H and H$α$. The spicule-like structures found in the simulation have statistical properties which are broadly consistent with those observed with Hinode/SOT. In particular, we find evidence for the self-consistent formation of both type I and type II spicules within the simulation, even in the absence of ambipolar diffusion. We also investigate the properties of rapid blueshifted and redshifted excursions (RBEs and RREs) in the simulation in relation to the spicules."

However, fine-grained functional grasping, which is essential for downstream manipulation tasks, remains underexplored and faces several challenges: the complexity of specifying goals and reward functions for functional grasps across diverse objects, the difficulty of multi-task RL exploration, and the challenge of sim-to-real transfer. In this work, we propose DemoFunGrasp for universal dexterous functional grasping. We factorize functional grasping conditions into two complementary components - grasping style and affordance - and integrate them into an RL framework that can learn to grasp any object with any functional grasping condition. To address the multi-task optimization challenge, we leverage a single grasping demonstration and reformulate the RL problem as one-step demonstration editing, substantially enhancing sample efficiency and performance. Experimental results in both simulation and the real world show that DemoFunGrasp generalizes to unseen combinations of objects, affordances, and grasping styles, outperforming baselines in both success rate and functional grasping accuracy. In addition to strong sim-to-real capability, by incorporating a vision-language model (VLM) for planning, our system achieves autonomous instruction-following grasp execution."

    "abstract": "We study bottomonium dynamics in a momentum-space anisotropic quark-gluon plasma (QGP) using the quantum trajectories (QTraj) framework. The real part of the heavy-quark potential is obtained from a minimal extension of the Karsch-Mehr-Satz (KMS) potential, while the angle-averaged imaginary part is derived to leading order in the anisotropy parameter $ξ$ and modeled to interpolate smoothly between the small- and large -$ξ$ regimes. The resulting anisotropic complex potential is used to solve the real-time Schrödinger equation using QTraj for the evolution of bottomonium in heavy-ion collisions. Nuclear modification factors $R_{AA}$, double ratios, and elliptic flow coefficients $v_2$ for the $Υ(1S)$, $Υ(2S)$, and $Υ(3S)$ states are computed, including feed-down contributions, in Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02 \\, \\text{TeV}$. The QTraj-Aniso predictions successfully reproduce the observed sequential suppression pattern and non-zero elliptic flow, showing good agreement with experimental measurements from the ALICE, ATLAS, and CMS collaborations and demonstrating the relevance of path-length dependent suppression and medium anisotropy in quarkonium phenomenology."

    "abstract": "The emerging field of quantum thermodynamics is beginning to reveal the intriguing role that information can play in quantum thermal engines. Information enters as a resource when considering feedback-controlled thermal machines. While both a general theory of quantum feedback control as well as specific examples of quantum feedback-controlled engines have been presented, still lacking is a general framework for such machines. Here, we present a framework for a generic, two-stroke quantum heat engine interacting with $N$ thermal baths and Maxwell's demon. The demon performs projective measurements on the engine working substance, the outcome of which is recorded in a classical memory, embedded in its own thermal bath. To perform feedback control, the demon enacts unitary operations on the working substance, conditioned on the recorded outcome. By considering the compound machine-memory as a hybrid (classical-quantum) standard thermal machine interacting with $N+1$ thermal baths, our framework puts the working substance and memory on equal footing, thereby enabling a comprehensible resolution to Maxwell's paradox. We illustrate the application of our framework with a two-qubit engine. A remarkable observation is that more information does not necessarily result in better thermodynamic performance: sometimes knowing less is better."

We describe the Voronoi and Delaunay polytopes and show that the latter are combinatorially equivalent to uniform matroid polytopes. As a consequence, the combinatorics of the tropical theta divisor canonically encodes the matroid and Grassmannian structures underlying the associated KP multi-soliton solutions. We define the Hirota variety of a banana graph, which parametrizes all tau functions arising from such a graph. Starting from the matroid arising from Delaunay polytopes and the periods in the tropical limit, we construct an explicit parametrization of this variety which realizes the tau function as a multi-soliton. Our framework specializes naturally to real and positive settings."

Quantum nonlocality sharing provides a crucial strategy for the resource-efficient recycling of quantum correlations, offering a promising pathway toward scaling quantum networks. Despite its potential, the limited availability of resources introduces a fundamental trade-off between the number of sharable network branches and the achievable sequential sharing rounds. The relationship between available entanglement and the sharing capacity remains largely unexplored, which constrains the efficient design and scalability of quantum networks. Here, we establish the entanglement threshold required to support unbounded sharing across an entire network by introducing a protocol based on probabilistic projective measurements. When resources fall below this threshold, we derive an achievable trade-off between the number of sharable branches and sharing rounds. To assess practical feasibility, we compare the detectability of our protocol with weak-measurement schemes and extend the sharing protocol to realistic noise models, providing a robust framework for nonlocality recycling in quantum networks."

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of self-pressurization in cryogenic tanks requires resolving the coupled effects of heat ingress, natural convection, and phase change. This work introduces a segregated numerical framework in which the liquid and vapor phases are treated with incompressible and compressible solvers, respectively, and the liquid-vapor interface is modeled as a sharp boundary subject to energy-jump conditions derived from first principles, without accommodation or tuning coefficients. Conjugate heat transfer through the tank walls is accounted for by solving the heat-conduction equation in the solid domain rather than prescribing external heat-flux conditions. The framework is validated against laboratory-scale LN2 and large-scale LH2 experiments, reproducing the spatio-temporal evolution of pressure and temperature without adjustable parameters. In both settings, the simulations identify two distinct regimes in self-pressurization: an initial heating-driven phase that establishes a self-similar temperature profile in the vapor, followed by an evaporation-driven phase in which the pressure rise is governed by the saturation relation. The comparison between these largely different scales motivated a revised scaling for self-pressurization, based on ullage thermodynamics. Finally, the influence of buoyancy was examined by reducing the strength of the gravitational body force, which revealed that natural convection modifies the duration of the transient heating phase but has a limited impact on the long-term pressurization rate. This analysis also clarifies the mechanism controlling the development of thermal stratification in the liquid. Overall, the segregated approach provides a predictive, parameter-free tool for analyzing cryogenic storage and offers a physically grounded basis for scaling self-pressurization across fluids, geometries, and heat-flux conditions."

The prototypes employ 10 um pitch pixels with a fast operational amplifier-based buffering stage at the output, enabling direct characterization of intrinsic sensor response. Beam tests with minimum ionizing particles assessed the timing and charge collection of DC- and AC-coupled designs, including devices exposed to 10^14 NIEL and 10^15 NIEL non ioninsing energy loss. DC-coupled sensors demonstrated stable performance, maintaining time resolution lower than 70 ps and >99% detection efficiency up to 10^15 NIEL. AC-coupled sensors demonstrated a wide operational margin, with efficiencies above 99% for clusterization thresholds below 150 electrons. Even though the AC coupling allows higher reverse bias than DC-coupled sensors, the reduced signal amplitude lowers the signal-to-noise ratio, increasing the jitter contribution. At high reverse bias, the AC-coupled sensors achieve time resolutions comparable to the DC-coupled version, demonstrating the viability of both approaches. These results also suggest that combining the low capacitance of DC-coupled designs with the high-bias capability of AC coupling could further enhance time resolution. These results confirm the suitability of 65 nm MAPS for future collider detectors requiring high radiation tolerance, efficiency, and timing precision."

    "abstract": "As quantum computing advances toward practical deployment, it threatens a wide range of classical cryptographic mechanisms, including digital signatures, key exchange protocols, public-key encryption, and certain hash-based constructions that underpin modern network infrastructures. These primitives form the security backbone of most blockchain platforms, raising serious concerns about the long-term viability of blockchain systems in a post-quantum world. Although migrating to post-quantum cryptography may appear straightforward, the substantially larger key sizes and higher computational costs of post-quantum primitives can introduce significant challenges and, in some cases, render such transitions impractical for blockchain environments. In this paper, we examine the implications of adopting post-quantum cryptography in blockchain systems across four key dimensions. We begin by identifying the cryptographic primitives within blockchain architectures that are most vulnerable to quantum attacks, particularly those used in consensus mechanisms, identity management, and transaction validation. We then survey proposed post-quantum adaptations across existing blockchain designs, analyzing their feasibility within decentralized and resource-constrained settings. Building on this analysis, we evaluate how replacing classical primitives with post-quantum alternatives affects system performance, protocol dynamics, and the incentive and trust structures that sustain blockchain ecosystems. Our study demonstrates that integrating post-quantum signature schemes into blockchain systems is not a simple drop-in replacement; instead, it requires careful architectural redesign, as naive substitutions risk undermining both security guarantees and operational efficiency."

In the high-dimensional setting where the number of functional variables is large relative to the length of functional time series, non-asymptotic theory for covariance function estimation has been developed for Gaussian and sub-Gaussian functional linear processes. However, corresponding non-asymptotic results for high-dimensional non-Gaussian and nonlinear functional time series, as well as for spectral density function estimation, are largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce novel functional dependence measures, based on which we establish systematic non-asymptotic concentration bounds for estimates of (auto)covariance and spectral density functions in high-dimensional and non-Gaussian settings. We then illustrate the usefulness of our convergence results through two applications to dynamic functional principal component analysis and sparse spectral density function estimation. To handle the practical scenario where curves are discretely observed with errors, we further develop convergence rates of the corresponding estimates obtained via a nonparametric smoothing method. Finally, extensive simulation studies are conducted to corroborate our theoretical findings."

In fact, there does not appear to be a single example of a fat Cantor set $C$ whose Birkhoff spectrum -- the full set of visiting frequencies -- is known. In this article, we develop an approach to analyse the Birkhoff spectra of a natural class of dynamically defined fat nowhere dense compact subsets of Cantor minimal systems. We show that every Cantor minimal system admits such sets whose Birkhoff spectrum is a full non-degenerate interval -- and also such sets for which the spectrum is not an interval. As an application, we obtain that every irrational rotation admits fat Cantor sets $C$ and $C'$ whose Birkhoff spectra are, respectively, an interval and not an interval."

We evaluate the steady-state entropy production rate and quantum correlations by applying the quantum phase space formulation to calculate the entropy change. Our study reveals the essential contribution of coherent feedback in the thermal bath's input-noise operators, resulting in the system being driven far from thermal equilibrium. Our analysis shows that in the small-coupling limit, the entropy production rate is proportional to the quantum mutual information. We use for application the optomechanical system of Fabry-Pérot cavity, and show that the picks of the entropy production corresponding of the heating/cooling of movable mirror are improved. Therefore, we conclude that irreversibility and quantum correlations are not independent and must be analyzed jointly. The results demonstrate the possibility of enhancement of entropy production and pave the way for promising quantum thermal applications through coherent feedback loop."

Model construction proceeds by extension of the truncated King models, using a newly defined asynchronicity parameter to couple the tidal and rotational perturbations. The method of matched asymptotic expansion is used to derive a global solution to the free boundary problem posed by the corresponding set of Poisson-Laplace equations. We explore the relevant parameter space and outline the intrinsic properties of the resulting models, both structural and kinematic. Their triaxial configuration, characterised by extension in the direction of the galactic centre and flattening toward the orbital plane, is found to depart further from spherical symmetry for larger values of the asynchronicity parameter. We hope that these simplified analytical models serve as useful tools for investigating the interplay of tidal and rotational effects, providing an equilibrium description that complements, and may serve as a basis for, more realistic numerical simulations."

Literal translations of the Chinese texts, historically based arguments, and close readings are combined with astrophysics, (peak brightness, decay time estimate, shell age expansion model calculation, etc.). (a) Nandou's second star, near which the BC48 `guest star' was reported, is identified as tau Sgr, not lambda Sgr, far from the M22 location. A nova in M22 would peak at only m=6.4 \\pm 1.4 mag, and thus a description as a `blue-white' `melon' does not fit; it was likely a comet. (b) The imprecise position (`Shen['s] east') of the `guest star' in 483, its extended (dipper-like) radiance, and the context speak for a bolide. Considering the new (larger) Gaia distance and small extinction towards Te-11 (outside a cloud), its bi-polar morphology and current expansion velocity point to a planetary nebula; as a nova, the shell expansion age is 1100-2000 yr from detailed supersonic expansion calculations. (c) Most certainly, Mars was meant when the source for 1645 reported `a large star entered Yugui'; the verb implies motion. AT Cnc lies neither in Yugui's asterism box nor in the eponymous lunar mansion range. The fluid drag expansion age of AT Cancri's ejecta is 128-631 yr. All three exact ages are unsubstantiated. True novae or nova shells can be connected to historical records only if the position and object type are plausible. Duration, brightness (light curve), and color (evolution) should fit and could provide more astrophysical insight ..."

    "abstract": "This paper establishes comprehensive stability results for quasi-variational inequalities (QVIs) under monotone perturbations of the governing operator. We prove strong convergence of both minimal and maximal solutions when sequences of operators converge pointwise while preserving fundamental properties including homogeneity, strong monotonicity, Lipschitz continuity, and T-monotonicity. Our analysis extends to regularization techniques, finite-dimensional approximations, and non-monotone nonlinearities, providing explicit convergence rates under appropriate conditions. The theory encompasses applications to $p$-Laplacian operators, elliptic regularizations, and optimal control problems with QVI constraints. By developing a unified framework that bridges classical monotone operator theory with contemporary computational challenges, this work provides essential mathematical foundations for the robust numerical approximation and sensitivity analysis of quasi-variational problems arising in materials science, physics, and engineering applications."

    "abstract": "High-performance computing (HPC) clusters consume enormous amounts of energy, with idle nodes as a major source of waste. Powering down unused nodes can mitigate this problem, but poorly timed transitions introduce long delays and reduce overall performance. To address this trade-off, we present SPARS, a reinforcement learning-enabled simulator for power management in HPC job scheduling. SPARS integrates job scheduling and node power state management within a discrete-event simulation framework. It supports traditional scheduling policies such as First Come First Served and EASY Backfilling, along with enhanced variants that employ reinforcement learning agents to dynamically decide when nodes should be powered on or off. Users can configure workloads and platforms in JSON format, specifying job arrivals, execution times, node power models, and transition delays. The simulator records comprehensive metrics-including energy usage, wasted power, job waiting times, and node utilization-and provides Gantt chart visualizations to analyze scheduling dynamics and power transitions. Unlike widely used Batsim-based frameworks that rely on heavy inter-process communication, SPARS provides lightweight event handling and consistent simulation results, making experiments easier to reproduce and extend. Its modular design allows new scheduling heuristics or learning algorithms to be integrated with minimal effort. By providing a flexible, reproducible, and extensible platform, SPARS enables researchers and practitioners to systematically evaluate power-aware scheduling strategies, explore the trade-offs between energy efficiency and performance, and accelerate the development of sustainable HPC operations."

    "abstract": "We present a Lagrangian Heterogeneous Multiscale Method (LHMM) for simulating the non-Newtonian rheology of polymer melts in complex two-dimensional flows. The method couples Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) at the microscale with a GENERIC-compliant Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) at the macroscale, in a concurrent framework, overcoming the limitations of traditional Eulerian-based methods in capturing long-memory and history-dependent effects. At the microscale, DPD serves as a virtual rheometer, employing FENE (Finitely Extensible Nonlinear Elastic) bead-spring polymer chains. This approach provides key rheological properties, including shear-thinning and zero-shear-rate viscosities, relaxation times, and viscoelastic dynamics, which are quantified via Carreau-Yasuda fitting and spectral analysis. The LHMM couples SPH-derived strain rates with microscopic stress responses using the Irving-Kirkwood formalism. This approach enables a concurrent interaction between macroscopic strain rates and microscopic stress tensors, ensuring a consistent viscoelastic response across scales.The method is validated against benchmark flows, including Reverse Poiseuille Flow and flow through a Periodic Array of Cylinders, across Weissenberg numbers $0.5<\\text{Wi}<30$ and low Reynolds numbers ($\\text{Re}<1$). A final demonstration of flow in a 2D porous medium highlights LHMM's capability to handle highly heterogeneous geometries. The LHMM is implemented in LAMMPS, making it suitable for integrating multiple models to describe microscales. In contrast, large-scale simulations efficiently utilize GPU and CPU resources, managing multiple coupling and time-scaling levels to maintain numerical stability and accuracy. The framework offers a predictive, constitutive-free tool that links microscopic polymer dynamics to macroscopic flow behavior, making it suitable for multiscale applications."

    "abstract": "Both student retention in higher education and artificial intelligence governance face a common structural challenge: the application of linear regulatory frameworks to complex adaptive systems. Risk-based approaches dominate both domains, yet systematically fail because they assume stable causal pathways, predictable actor responses, and controllable system boundaries. This paper extracts transferable methodological principles from CAPIRE (Curriculum, Archetypes, Policies, Interventions & Research Environment), an empirically validated framework for educational analytics that treats student dropout as an emergent property of curricular structures, institutional rules, and macroeconomic shocks. Drawing on longitudinal data from engineering programmes and causal inference methods, CAPIRE demonstrates that well-intentioned interventions routinely generate unintended consequences when system complexity is ignored. We argue that five core principles developed within CAPIRE - temporal observation discipline, structural mapping over categorical classification, archetype-based heterogeneity analysis, causal mechanism identification, and simulation-based policy design - transfer directly to the challenge of governing AI systems. The isomorphism is not merely analogical: both domains exhibit non-linearity, emergence, feedback loops, strategic adaptation, and path dependence. We propose Complex Systems AI Governance (CSAIG) as an integrated framework that operationalises these principles for regulatory design, shifting the central question from \"how risky is this AI system?\" to \"how does this intervention reshape system dynamics?\" The contribution is twofold: demonstrating that empirical lessons from one complex systems domain can accelerate governance design in another, and offering a concrete methodological architecture for complexity-aware AI regulation."

Moreover, the sign structure of the Ruppeiner curvature provides a transparent characterization of the competing microscopic interactions across the coexisting phases. We find that the Lorentz-violating parameter $\\ell$ and the string-cloud parameter $α$ shift the critical scales and rescale correlation measures while preserving the universality class of the critical behavior. We further comment on dynamical and holographic implications and contrast the thermodynamic sensitivity to $(\\ell,α)$ with thin-disk optical signatures."

    "abstract": "The collaboration between humans and artificial intelligence (AI) holds the promise of achieving superior outcomes compared to either acting alone. Nevertheless, our understanding of the conditions that facilitate such human-AI synergy remains limited. A recent meta-analysis showed that, on average, human-AI combinations do not outperform the better individual agent, indicating overall negative human-AI synergy. We argue that this pessimistic conclusion arises from insufficient attention to human learning in the experimental designs used. To substantiate this claim, we re-analyzed all 74 studies included in the original meta-analysis, which yielded two new findings. First, most previous research overlooked design features that foster human learning, such as providing trial-by-trial outcome feedback to participants. Second, our re-analysis, using robust Bayesian meta-regressions, demonstrated that studies providing outcome feedback show relatively higher synergy than those without outcome feedback. Crucially, when feedback is paired with AI explanations we tend to find positive human-AI synergy, while AI explanations provided without feedback were strongly linked to negative synergy, indicating that explanations are useful for synergy only when humans can learn to verify the AI's reliability through feedback. We conclude that the current literature underestimates the potential for human-AI collaboration because it predominantly relies on experimental designs that do not facilitate human learning, thus hindering humans from effectively adapting their collaboration strategies. We therefore advocate for a paradigm shift in human-AI interaction research that explicitly incorporates and tests human learning mechanisms to enhance our understanding of and support for successful human-AI collaboration."

    "abstract": "Recent codec-based language models~(LMs) have revolutionized text-to-speech~(TTS). However, since standard codecs tightly couple timbre and prosody, continuation-based LMs inevitably replicate this entanglement, hindering independent control. Recent efforts attempt to break this entanglement via codec design, but insufficient decoupling remains a critical bottleneck. To tackle this challenge, we propose DisCo-Speech, a zero-shot controllable TTS framework that enables prosody control and voice cloning via a disentangled speech codec (DisCodec) and an LM-based generator. The core component, DisCodec, contains two core stages: 1) Tri-factor disentanglement, which explicitly factorizes speech into content, prosody, and timbre subspaces via parallel encoders and hybrid losses; and 2) Fusion and reconstruction, which fuses content and prosody into unified content-prosody tokens suitable for LM prediction, while jointly optimizing reconstruction quality to resolve the disentanglement-reconstruction trade-off. With this design, the LM performs prosodic continuation from a style prompt while the decoder handles target timbre injection, enabling flexible zero-shot control. Experiments show that DisCo-Speech matches state-of-the-art voice cloning performance while outperforming baselines in zero-shot prosody control. By resolving the core entanglement at the codec level, DisCo-Speech provides a robust foundation for controllable speech synthesis. Audio samples are available at https://github.com/disco-speech/DisCo-Speech, and the code and weights will be released at the same link."

The first generalization consists in considering spaces with differential structures on them (the so-called ringed spaces) rather than the usual manifolds. This entails a generalization of the concept of smoothness, which allows us to think about a smooth passage through the singularity. The second generalization is related to the concept of curve. We show that if a kind of singularity is implanted in the set of curve's parameters, along with an appropriate topology, in such a way that the structure of the set of parameters corresponds to the structure of the singular space-time, the curve can smoothly -- in a generalized sense -- pass through the singularity."

Here we fine-tune the MACE-MPA-0 universal machine-learning potential on rocksalt carbide UHTCs containing group IV-V metals and demonstrate that not only do the elastic constants deviate from the rule of mixtures approximation in the high-entropy limit, but also in the low-entropy limit of binary and ternary mixtures. We find that this is caused by distortion imposed by the lattice mismatch, enabling the tuning of the physical properties of UHTC mixtures in both low- and high-entropy compounds. We identify a three-component mixture compound, HfCVCZrC, as the best balance between synthesizability and toughness, and apply our developed MACE-UHTC model to identify a range of non-equimolar candidate compositions of this compound which may enable the synthesis of a mixture UHTC with a Young's modulus up to 40 GPa below that of ZrC."

    "abstract": "The deformation theory of singular varieties plays a central role in understanding the geometry and moduli of algebraic varieties. For a variety $X$ with possibly singular points, the space of first-order infinitesimal deformations is given by \\( T^1_X = \\operatorname{Ext}^1_{\\mathcal{O}_X}(Ω_X, \\mathcal{O}_X), \\) which measures the Zariski tangent space to the deformation functor of $X$. When $T^1_X = 0$, the variety is said to be \\emph{rigid}; otherwise, nonzero elements of $T^1_X$ correspond to nontrivial first-order deformations. We investigate the structure of $T^1_X$ for singular varieties and provide cohomological and geometric criteria ensuring non-rigidity. In particular, we show that if the sheaf of tangent fields $T_X$ possesses nonvanishing cohomology $H^1(X, T_X)$ or if the local contributions $\\mathcal{E}xt^1(Ω_X, \\mathcal{O}_X)$ are supported on a positive-dimensional singular locus, then $T^1_X \\neq 0$.

Moreover, non-rigidity arises when $X$ % appears as a cone over a projectively nonrigid variety. These criteria provide effective tools for detecting non-rigidity in both local and global settings, linking the vanishing of Ext and cohomology groups to the deformation behavior of singularities. The results contribute to a deeper understanding of the interplay between singularity theory, moduli, and the rigidity properties of algebraic varieties."

Traditional manual processing is not feasible for either real-time applications or large arrays. Deep learning-based pickers trained on large earthquake catalogs offer an automated alternative. However, they are typically optimized for high signal-to-noise, long-duration networks and struggle with the challenges presented by microseismic datasets, which are purpose-built for limited time without previously detected seismicity. In this study, we demonstrate how a network-wide earthquake phase picker, the Phase Neural Operator (PhaseNO), can be adapted to microseismic monitoring using transfer learning. Starting from a PhaseNO model pre-trained on more than 57,000 three-component earthquake and noise records, we fine-tune the model using only 200 labeled and noise seismograms from induced events in hydraulic-fracturing settings. The fine-tuned model thus preserves the rich spatio-temporal representation learned from abundant earthquake data, while adapting to the characteristics and labeling conventions of microseismic phases, which are often picked on peaks or troughs rather than onsets. We evaluate performance on three distinct real-world microseismic datasets with different network geometries and acquisition parameters. Compared to the original PhaseNO and a conventional workflow, the adapted model increases F1 score and accuracy by up to 30%, and strongly reduces systematic timing bias and pick uncertainty. Because the adaptation relies on a small, campaign-specific calibration set, the approach is readily transferable to other microseismic tasks where public earthquake data and pre-trained models are accessible.

    "abstract": "The quality of the latent space in visual tokenizers (e.g., VAEs) is crucial for modern generative models. However, the standard reconstruction-based training paradigm produces a latent space that is biased towards low-level information, leading to a foundation flaw: better pixel-level accuracy does not lead to higher-quality generation. This implies that pouring extensive compute into visual tokenizer pre-training translates poorly to improved performance in generation. We identify this as the ``pre-training scaling problem`` and suggest a necessary shift: to be effective for generation, a latent space must concisely represent high-level semantics. We present VTP, a unified visual tokenizer pre-training framework, pioneering the joint optimization of image-text contrastive, self-supervised, and reconstruction losses. Our large-scale study reveals two principal findings: (1) understanding is a key driver of generation, and (2) much better scaling properties, where generative performance scales effectively with compute, parameters, and data allocated to the pretraining of the visual tokenizer. After large-scale pre-training, our tokenizer delivers a competitive profile (78.2 zero-shot accuracy and 0.36 rFID on ImageNet) and 4.1 times faster convergence on generation compared to advanced distillation methods. More importantly, it scales effectively: without modifying standard DiT training specs, solely investing more FLOPS in pretraining VTP achieves 65.8\\% FID improvement in downstream generation, while conventional autoencoder stagnates very early at 1/10 FLOPS.

    "abstract": "Recent feed-forward reconstruction models like VGGT and $π^3$ achieve impressive reconstruction quality but cannot process streaming videos due to quadratic memory complexity, limiting their practical deployment. While existing streaming methods address this through learned memory mechanisms or causal attention, they require extensive retraining and may not fully leverage the strong geometric priors of state-of-the-art offline models. We propose LASER, a training-free framework that converts an offline reconstruction model into a streaming system by aligning predictions across consecutive temporal windows. We observe that simple similarity transformation ($\\mathrm{Sim}(3)$) alignment fails due to layer depth misalignment: monocular scale ambiguity causes relative depth scales of different scene layers to vary inconsistently between windows. To address this, we introduce layer-wise scale alignment, which segments depth predictions into discrete layers, computes per-layer scale factors, and propagates them across both adjacent windows and timestamps. Extensive experiments show that LASER achieves state-of-the-art performance on camera pose estimation and point map reconstruction %quality with offline models while operating at 14 FPS with 6 GB peak memory on a RTX A6000 GPU, enabling practical deployment for kilometer-scale streaming videos.

    "abstract": "Personalization is becoming indispensable for LLMs to align with individual user preferences and needs. Yet current approaches are often computationally expensive, data-intensive, susceptible to catastrophic forgetting, and prone to performance degradation in multi-turn interactions or when handling implicit queries. To address these challenges, we conceptualize personalization as a model editing task and introduce Personalization Editing, a framework that applies localized edits guided by clustered preference representations. This design enables precise preference-aligned updates while preserving overall model capabilities. In addition, existing personalization benchmarks frequently rely on persona-based dialogs between LLMs rather than user-LLM interactions, or focus primarily on stylistic imitation while neglecting information-seeking tasks that require accurate recall of user-specific preferences. We introduce User Preference Question Answering (UPQA), a short-answer QA dataset constructed from in-situ user queries with varying levels of difficulty. Unlike prior benchmarks, UPQA directly evaluates a model's ability to recall and apply specific user preferences. Across experimental settings, Personalization Editing achieves higher editing accuracy and greater computational efficiency than fine-tuning, while outperforming prompting-based baselines in multi-turn conversations and implicit preference questions settings."

    "abstract": "Direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulent reactive flows has been the subject of significant research interest for several decades. Accurate prediction of the effects of turbulence on the rate of reactant conversion, and the subsequent influence of chemistry on hydrodynamics remain a challenge in combustion modeling. The key issue in DNS is to account for the wide range of temporal and spatial physical scales that are caused by complex interactions of turbulence and chemistry. In this work, a new computational methodology is developed that is shown to provide a viable alternative to DNS. The framework is the matrix product state (MPS), a form of tensor network (TN) as used in computational many body physics. The MPS is a well-established ansatz for efficiently representing many types of quantum states in condensed matter systems, allowing for an exponential compression of the required memory compared to exact diagonalization methods. Due to the success of MPS in quantum physics, the ansatz has been adapted to problems outside its historical domain, notably computational fluid dynamics. Here, the MPS is used for computational simulation of a shear flow under non-reacting and nonpremixed chemically reacting conditions. Reductions of 30% in memory are demonstrated for all transport variables, accompanied by excellent agreements with DNS. The anastaz accurately captures all pertinent flow physics such as reduced mixing due to exothermicity & compressibility, and the formation of eddy shocklets at high Mach numbers. A priori analysis of DNS data at higher Reynolds numbers shows compressions as large as 99.99% for some of the transport variables. This level of compression is encouraging and promotes the use of MPS for simulations of complex turbulent combustion systems."

Yet the qubit counts and error rates required to realize such an advantage remain uncertain; resource estimates for ground-state electronic structure span orders of magnitude, and no quantum-native method has been validated at a commercially relevant scale. Here we address this uncertainty by executing the iterative qubit coupled-cluster (iQCC) algorithm, designed for fault-tolerant quantum hardware, at unprecedented scale using a quantum solver on classical processors, enabling simulations of transition organo-metallic complexes requiring hundreds of logical qubits and millions of entangling gates. Using this approach, we compute the lowest triplet excited state (T$_1$) energies of Ir(III) and Pt(II) phosphorescent organometallic compounds and show that iQCC achieves the lowest mean absolute error (0.05 eV) and highest R$^2$ (0.94) relative to experiment, outperforming leading classical methods. We find these systems remain classically tractable up to $\\sim$200 logical qubits, establishing the threshold at which quantum advantage in computational chemistry may emerge and clarifying resource requirements for future quantum computers."

To mitigate the effects of model poisoning for audio signal classification, we present REVERB-FL, a lightweight, server-side defense that couples a small reserve set (approximately 5%) with pre- and post-aggregation retraining and adversarial training. After each local training round, the server refines the global model on the reserve set with either clean or additional adversarially perturbed data, thereby counteracting non-IID drift and mitigating potential model poisoning without adding substantial client-side cost or altering the aggregation process. We theoretically demonstrate the feasibility of our framework, showing faster convergence and a reduced steady-state error relative to baseline federated averaging. We validate our framework on two open-source audio classification datasets with varying IID and Dirichlet non-IID partitions and demonstrate that REVERB-FL mitigates global model poisoning under multiple designs of local data poisoning."

Despite the global importance of mango (Mangifera indica L.), there is a lack of studies on the robustness of models for the diagnosis of disease in its leaves. This paper proposes a methodology to evaluate convolutional neural networks (CNNs) under adverse conditions. We adapted the MangoLeafDB dataset, generating MangoLeafDB-C with 19 types of artificial corruptions at five severity levels. We conducted a benchmark comparing five architectures: ResNet-50, ResNet-101, VGG-16, Xception, and LCNN (the latter being a lightweight architecture designed specifically for mango leaf diagnosis). The metrics include the F1 score, the corruption error (CE) and the relative mean corruption error (relative mCE). The results show that LCNN outperformed complex models in corruptions that can be present in real-world scenarios such as Defocus Blur, Motion Blur, while also achieving the lowest mCE. Modern architectures (e.g., ResNet-101) exhibited significant performance degradation in corrupted scenarios, despite their high accuracy under ideal conditions. These findings suggest that lightweight and specialized models may be more suitable for real-world applications in edge devices, where robustness and efficiency are critical. The study highlights the need to incorporate robustness assessments in the development of intelligent systems for agriculture, particularly in regions with technological limitations."

However, acquiring ST data remains prohibitively expensive, and traditional fixed-grid sampling strategies lead to redundant measurements of morphologically similar or biologically uninformative regions, thus resulting in scarce data that constrain current methods. The well-established single-cell sequencing field, however, could provide rich biological data as an effective auxiliary source to mitigate this limitation. To bridge these gaps, we introduce SCR2-ST, a unified framework that leverages single-cell prior knowledge to guide efficient data acquisition and accurate expression prediction. SCR2-ST integrates a single-cell guided reinforcement learning-based (SCRL) active sampling and a hybrid regression-retrieval prediction network SCR2Net. SCRL combines single-cell foundation model embeddings with spatial density information to construct biologically grounded reward signals, enabling selective acquisition of informative tissue regions under constrained sequencing budgets. SCR2Net then leverages the actively sampled data through a hybrid architecture combining regression-based modeling with retrieval-augmented inference, where a majority cell-type filtering mechanism suppresses noisy matches and retrieved expression profiles serve as soft labels for auxiliary supervision. We evaluated SCR2-ST on three public ST datasets, demonstrating SOTA performance in both sampling efficiency and prediction accuracy, particularly under low-budget scenarios.

The CE-ZK property allows a verifier of a quantum proof to revoke the proof in a way that can be checked (certified) by the prover. Conditioned on successful certification, the verifier's state can be efficiently simulated with only the statement, in a statistically indistinguishable way. Our contributions regarding these certified-everlasting NIZKs (CE-NIZKs) are as follows: - We identify a barrier to obtaining CE-NIZKs in the CRS model via generalizations of known interactive proofs that satisfy CE-ZK. - We circumvent this by constructing CE-NIZK from black-box use of NIZK for NP satisfying certain properties, along with OWFs. As a result, we obtain CE-NIZKs for NP in the CRS model, based on polynomial hardness of the learning with errors (LWE) assumption. - In addition, we observe that the aforementioned barrier does not apply to the shared EPR model. Consequently, we present a CE-NIZK for NP in this model based on any statistical binding hidden-bits generator, which can be based on LWE. The only quantum computation in this protocol involves single-qubit measurements of the shared EPR pairs."

The model features partially informed private agents who receive a noisy signal about economic fundamentals from a fully informed public sector. When monetary policy satisfies the Taylor principle, the equilibrium is unique and determinate. However, the release of news about current or future fundamentals can still generate a form of \"Paradox of Transparency\" through general equilibrium interactions between aggregate demand and monetary policy. When the Taylor principle is violated, belief-driven equilibria may emerge. Validation exercises based on the Simulated Method of Moments confirm the empirical plausibility of the model's key implications."

Depending on the values of these parameters $V_{eff}$ becomes a double barrier potential. We quantize the model and obtain the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. We solve that equation using the WKB approximation and compute the corresponding probability ($TP_{WKB}$) that the wavefunction of the universe tunnels through the double barrier potential $V_{eff}$. We study how $TP_{WKB}$ behaves as a function of the parameters $A$, $B$, $σ$ and the radiation energy $E$. We notice a significant occurrence of resonances in $TP_{WKB}$ when varying it as a function of $E$ or $σ$. It is a very interesting phenomenon because it may cause the universe to be born with selected values of $E$ or $σ$."

The global matrix is stored in a block format that reflects the natural HDG structure, enabling all iterative solver kernels to be executed with strided batched dense matrix-vector multiplications. This implementation avoids sparse data structures, increases arithmetic intensity, and sustains high memory throughput across a range of meshes and polynomial orders. The nonlinear solver combines Newton's method with preconditioned GMRES, integrating scalable preconditioners such as block-Jacobi, additive Schwarz domain decomposition, and polynomial smoothers. All preconditioners are implemented in batched form with architecture-aware optimizations--including dense linear algebra kernels, memory-coalesced vector operations, and shared-memory acceleration--to minimize memory traffic and maximize parallel occupancy. Comprehensive studies are conducted for a variety of PDEs (including Poisson equation, Burgers equation, linear and nonlinear elasticity, Euler equations, Navier-Stokes equations, and Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations) using structured and unstructured meshes with different element types and polynomial orders on both NVIDIA and AMD GPU architectures."

The approach is applied to predict size effects and dynamical thermal conductivities in CsPbBr3 and La2Zr2O7 using first-principles data as input.

Purely leptonic models are energetically more favorable yet they require rather specific morphological assumptions. The gamma-ray morphology of the source can be better explained within a hadronic scenario based on the identification of cold gas structures spatially correlated with the observed gamma-ray emission. However, a purely hadronic model for the source emission requires a substantial energy reservoir in protons and fails to reproduce the extended X-ray emission recently detected by XRISM. We show that emission including a combination of leptonic and hadronic components can reproduce both the spectral and morphological properties of the source. We provide predictions for the X-ray and neutrino spectra of~the~nebula that can discriminate the hadronic and leptonic contributions to the overall source signal."

    "abstract": "Memory has emerged, and will continue to remain, a core capability of foundation model-based agents. As research on agent memory rapidly expands and attracts unprecedented attention, the field has also become increasingly fragmented. Existing works that fall under the umbrella of agent memory often differ substantially in their motivations, implementations, and evaluation protocols, while the proliferation of loosely defined memory terminologies has further obscured conceptual clarity. Traditional taxonomies such as long/short-term memory have proven insufficient to capture the diversity of contemporary agent memory systems. This work aims to provide an up-to-date landscape of current agent memory research. We begin by clearly delineating the scope of agent memory and distinguishing it from related concepts such as LLM memory, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and context engineering. We then examine agent memory through the unified lenses of forms, functions, and dynamics. From the perspective of forms, we identify three dominant realizations of agent memory, namely token-level, parametric, and latent memory. From the perspective of functions, we propose a finer-grained taxonomy that distinguishes factual, experiential, and working memory. From the perspective of dynamics, we analyze how memory is formed, evolved, and retrieved over time. To support practical development, we compile a comprehensive summary of memory benchmarks and open-source frameworks. Beyond consolidation, we articulate a forward-looking perspective on emerging research frontiers, including memory automation, reinforcement learning integration, multimodal memory, multi-agent memory, and trustworthiness issues. We hope this survey serves not only as a reference for existing work, but also as a conceptual foundation for rethinking memory as a first-class primitive in the design of future agentic intelligence."

Based on a random parameter scan, we show that large portions of the parameter space feature a dark matter relic density in agreement with the limits derived by Planck. Moreover, constraints related to lepton flavour violation are mostly respected within such parameter regions. Our study shows that it will be worth to further investigate the freeze-in mechanism within scotogenic frameworks."

    "abstract": "Near-field perception is essential for the safe operation of autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) in manufacturing environments. Conventional ranging sensors such as light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and ultrasonic devices provide broad situational awareness but often fail to detect small objects near the robot base. To address this limitation, this paper presents a three-tier near-field perception framework. The first approach employs light-discontinuity detection, which projects a laser stripe across the near-field zone and identifies interruptions in the stripe to perform fast, binary cutoff sensing for obstacle presence. The second approach utilizes light-displacement measurement to estimate object height by analyzing the geometric displacement of a projected stripe in the camera image, which provides quantitative obstacle height information with minimal computational overhead. The third approach employs a computer vision-based object detection model on embedded AI hardware to classify objects, enabling semantic perception and context-aware safety decisions. All methods are implemented on a Raspberry Pi 5 system, achieving real-time performance at 25 or 50 frames per second. Experimental evaluation and comparative analysis demonstrate that the proposed hierarchy balances precision, computation, and cost, thereby providing a scalable perception solution for enabling safe operations of AMRs in manufacturing environments."

We refine this result by extending it to a broader class of distributions and allowing a distinct pair of densities for each body, one for hyperplane sections and another for the full volume. We also present some examples illustrating cases not covered by previous results."

In particular, self-sustained oscillations in the form of limit cycles act as robust organizing centers in phase space that are not captured by existing fixed-point-based approaches. In this work, we extend the flow topology framework for nonlinear resonators to include limit cycles as fundamental topological elements. Using a graph-based construction, we show how periodic attractors impact the global connectivity of phase-space flows. We illustrate the approach with a minimal nonlinear Van der Pol resonator model, where limit cycles coexist with stationary points. Our results provide a unified topological description of stationary and time-periodic phases in nonlinear bosonic systems, with direct relevance to photonic, superconducting, and optomechanical platforms, and raise new questions on synchronization and the extension of flow topology to the quantum regime."

We provide a general formalism for $N$ qubits. For $N=2$ qubits, we classify normal and abnormal extremals, showcasing examples where abnormal solutions are either absent or suboptimal. For normal extremals, we establish a correspondence between the laser detuning from atomic transitions and the motion of a classical particle in a quartic potential, yielding a reduced, semi-analytic formulation of the control problem. Combining PMP-based insights with numerical optimization, our approach bridges analytic and computational methods for high-fidelity, time-optimal control."

    "abstract": "Verifying quantum advantage for practical problems, particularly the ground state energy estimation (GSEE) problem, is one of the central challenges in quantum computing theory. For that purpose, dequantization algorithms play a central role in providing a clear theoretical framework to separate the complexity of quantum and classical algorithms. However, existing dequantized algorithms typically rely on sampling procedures, leading to prohibitively large computational overheads and hindering their practical implementation on classical computers. In this work, we propose a tensor network-based dequantization framework for GSEE that eliminates the sampling process while preserving the asymptotic complexity of prior dequantized algorithms. In our formulation, the overhead arising from sampling is replaced by the growth of the bond dimension required to represent Chebyshev vectors as tensor network states. Consequently, physical structure, such as entanglement and locality, is naturally reflected in the computational cost. By combining this approach with tensor network approximations, such as Matrix Product States (MPS), we construct a practical dequantization algorithm that is executable within realistic computational resources. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our method can efficiently construct high-degree polynomials up to $d=10^4$ for Hamiltonians with up to $100$ qubits, explicitly revealing the crossover between classically tractable and quantum advantaged regimes. These results indicate that tensor network-based dequantization provides a crucial tool toward the rigorous, quantitative verification of quantum advantage in realistic many-body systems."

By comparing the Penrose and Thue-Morse quasicrystals, we demonstrate that the nature of the magnetic phase transition is controlled by the electronic density of states (DOS): while the singular DOS of the Penrose tiling induces magnetic order at infinitesimal interaction strengths, the Thue-Morse lattice requires a finite critical interaction to drive the transition. Crucially, through a novel boundary construction strategy and rigorous finite-size scaling, we identify a quantum critical point on the Thue-Morse quasicrystal with critical exponents ($ν\\approx 0.94$, $β\\approx 0.72$ and $z\\approx 1.51$) that deviate significantly from the conventional $(2+1)$D Heisenberg $O(3)$ class. These findings establish the existence of a novel universality class driven by the interplay between electronic correlations and aperiodic geometry, challenging standard paradigms of magnetic criticality in two dimensions."

However, the average model has two basic assumptions: the low-frequency assumption, the small ripple assumption. In high-bandwidth design, these two assumptions are violated. In order to solve this, various methods have been proposed. This paper gives a comprehensive overview of the existing small signal model for PWM converters from the following perspectives: 1. model fidelity, 2. analytical tractability. 3. complexity of the derivation process and result 4.generality."

Two samples for each SCF type with three (SCF1) and four (SCF2) air holes are individually inserted in a syringe loaded with a 0.5 mL solution of CNTs dispersed in methanol, and a high-power laser at 980 nm is injected into the fibers during distinct periods: SCF1 (20 and 30 minutes), SCF2 (5 and 10 minutes). The CNT solution thermally expands, accelerating and depositing nanotubes on the fiber tip. The material and dimensions of the CNTs deposited on the SCFs' cross-section are characterized, revealing nanotube bundles increasing in thickness from the fiber core to the bridges and inside the holes. The average maximum CNT thickness widening the bridge edges is, respectively, for SCF1 (2.8 and 2 microns) and SCF2 (1.7 and 1.3 microns). These achievements are significant for nanoparticle deposition and fabrication of microscale devices on tips and inside specialty and hollow fibers, enabling innovative fiber sensors, mode-locked fiber lasers, in-fiber acousto-optic modulators, and broadband photoacoustic transmitters for imaging and neurostimulation."

    "abstract": "One of the main technical obstacles in constructing a consistent theory of quantum gravity is that the metric itself defines the causal structure required for quantization. This motivates implementing quantum aspects of gravity through an independent connection. Moreover, the experimentally confirmed violation of Bell inequalities, together with the natural structure of the energy--momentum tensor in semiclassical gravity, suggests that nonlocality should be incorporated into the gravitational formalism. Motivated by these considerations, we propose a model in which the connection is treated as an independent bitensorial field, leading to a bitensorial generalization of the Einstein equations. The model reduces to General Relativity when the matter source is classical. We apply it in two regimes: the late-time universe and the Newtonian limit. In the cosmological case, the model naturally gives rise to a positive effective cosmological constant. In the Newtonian regime, we analyze a situation in which the gravitational source is in a quantum superposition and find that the model predicts a novel, nonconservative effective force that depends on the velocity of the test particle."

    "abstract": "Enhanced lithological interpretation from well logs plays a key role in geological resource exploration and mapping, as well as in geo-environmental modeling studies. Core and cutting information is useful for making sound interpretations of well logs; however, these are rarely collected at each depth due to high costs. Moreover, well log interpretation using traditional methods is constrained by poor borehole conditions. Traditional statistical methods are mostly linear, often failing to discriminate between lithology and rock facies, particularly when dealing with overlapping well log signals characterized by the structural and compositional variation of rock types. In this study, we develop multiple supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms to jointly analyze multivariate well log data from Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) expeditions 390 and 393 for enhanced lithological interpretations. Among the algorithms, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network models, the Decision Tree and Gradient Boosting models outperformed the others, achieving an accuracy of 0.9950 and an F1-score of 0.9951. While unsupervised machine learning (ML) provides the foundation for cluster information that inherently supports the classification algorithm, supervised ML is applied to devise a data-driven lithology clustering mechanism for IODP datasets. The joint ML-based method developed here has the potential to be further explored for analyzing other well log datasets from the world's oceans."

Existing solutions often deploy the entire model as a single monolithic unit, which applies a unified resource configuration to both attention and expert modules despite their different requirements, leading to limited scalability and resource inefficiency. In this paper, we propose Janus, a scalable MoE inference system that disaggregates attention and experts on separate GPU sub-clusters, enabling each module to be managed and scaled independently. Janus incorporates three key designs for efficient, disaggregated MoE inference. First, it proposes an adaptive two-phase communication scheme that exploits intra- and inter-node bandwidth hierarchies for low-latency data exchange. Second, motivated by the memory-bound nature of MoE modules, Janus introduces a lightweight scheduler and implements it as a GPU kernel to balance the number of activated experts across GPUs at minimal overhead, thereby reducing inference latency. Third, Janus performs fine-grained resource management to dynamically adjust expert placement and independently scale attention and MoE resources to improve overall efficiency. Evaluation shows Janus achieves up to 3.9 higher perGPU throughput than state-of-the-art systems while meeting per-token latency requirements."

We have realized dipole traps with near-infrared laser light in four different wavelength regions between 1050 and 2002 nm. We have identified trap-light-induced processes as the overall dominant source of losses, except for wavelengths around 2000 nm, where light-induced losses appeared to be much weaker. In a trap near 1550 nm, we found a plateau of minimal light-induced losses, and by carefully tuning the wavelength, we reached conditions where losses from inelastic collisions between the trapped dimers became observable. For very weakly bound dimers close to the center of a magnetically tuned Feshbach resonance, we demonstrate the Pauli suppression of collisional losses by about an order of magnitude."

Using shear rheology combined with in-situ optical imaging, we find that this memory effect emerges exclusively in the nonlinear strain-stiffening regime, and persists over a much broader range of strain amplitudes than previously reported for other viscoelastic amorphous materials. Furthermore, we uncover a strong correlation between the memory response and the development of negative normal stresses and associated strain fields, highlighting the unique nonequilibrium mechanics underlying memory formation in biopolymer networks."

For evaluating time-awareness in retrieval, we propose a new benchmark with temporally opposite (chiral) actions as hard negatives and curated splits for chiral and non-chiral actions. We show that TARA outperforms all existing video-text models on this chiral benchmark while also achieving strong results on standard benchmarks. Furthermore, we discover additional benefits of TARA beyond time-awareness: (i) TARA embeddings are negation-aware as shown in NegBench benchmark that evaluates negation in video retrieval, (ii) TARA achieves state of the art performance on verb and adverb understanding in videos. Overall, TARA yields a strong, versatile, time-aware video-text embedding model with state of the art zero-shot performance."

We introduce a new statistical primitive, the reproducibility budget $C_T$, which quantifies a system's finite capacity for statistical reproducibility - the extent to which its sampling process can remain governed by a consistent underlying distribution in the presence of both exogenous change and endogenous feedback. Formally, $C_T$ is defined as the cumulative Fisher-Rao path length of the coupled learner-environment evolution, measuring the total distributional motion accumulated during learning. From this construct we derive a drift-feedback generalization bound of order $O(T^{-1/2} + C_T/T)$, and we prove a matching minimax lower bound showing that this rate is minimax-optimal. Consequently, the results establish a reproducibility speed limit: no algorithm can achieve smaller worst-case generalization error than that imposed by the average Fisher-Rao drift rate $C_T/T$ of the data-generating process. The framework situates exogenous drift, adaptive data analysis, and performative prediction within a common geometric structure, with $C_T$ emerging as the intrinsic quantity measuring distributional motion across these settings."

Small-scale prototype tests of CABLESSail are presented in this paper, which demonstrate the effectiveness of cable actuation on deployable booms. A novel control allocation method is also presented in this paper that provides a computationally-efficient manner to determine the deformations required in each of the structural booms to impart the desired momentum management torque on the solar sail. Numerical simulation results with the proposed algorithm demonstrate robustness to uncertainty in the shape of the sail membrane, resulting in reliable generation of momentum management torques that exceed or meet the capabilities of state-of-the-art solar sail actuators.

However, enabling large-scale training on early-life AI accelerators faces three core challenges: frequent system disruptions and undefined failure modes that undermine reliability; numerical errors and training instabilities that threaten correctness and convergence; and the complexity of parallelism optimization combined with unpredictable local noise that degrades efficiency. To address these challenges, SIGMA is an open-source training stack designed to improve the reliability, stability, and efficiency of large-scale distributed training on early-life AI hardware. The core of this initiative is the LUCIA TRAINING PLATFORM (LTP), the system optimized for clusters with early-life AI accelerators. Since its launch in March 2025, LTP has significantly enhanced training reliability and operational productivity. Over the past five months, it has achieved an impressive 94.45% effective cluster accelerator utilization, while also substantially reducing node recycling and job-recovery times. Building on the foundation of LTP, the LUCIA TRAINING FRAMEWORK (LTF) successfully trained SIGMA-MOE, a 200B MoE model, using 2,048 AI accelerators. This effort delivered remarkable stability and efficiency outcomes, achieving 21.08% MFU, state-of-the-art downstream accuracy, and encountering only one stability incident over a 75-day period. Together, these advances establish SIGMA, which not only tackles the critical challenges of large-scale training but also establishes a new benchmark for AI infrastructure and platform innovation, offering a robust, cost-effective alternative to prevailing established accelerator stacks and significantly advancing AI capabilities and scalability.

This is largely due to the lack of pairwise Bangla-English data and advanced translation models. If datasets and models can be enhanced to better handle natural, informal Bangla, millions of people will benefit from improved online information access. In this research, we explore current state-of-the-art models and propose improvements to Bangla translation by developing a dataset from informal sources like social media and conversational texts. This work aims to advance Bangla machine translation by focusing on informal language translation and improving accessibility for Bangla speakers in the digital world."

    "abstract": "Reproducibility in simulation-based computer architecture research requires coordinating artifacts like disk images, kernels, and benchmarks, but existing workflows are inconsistent. We improve gem5, an open-source simulator with over 1600 forks, and gem5 Resources, a centralized repository of over 2000 pre-packaged artifacts, to address these issues. While gem5 Resources enables artifact sharing, researchers still face challenges. Creating custom disk images is complex and time-consuming, with no standardized process across ISAs, making it difficult to extend and share images. gem5 provides limited guest-host communication features through a set of predefined exit events that restrict researchers' ability to dynamically control and monitor simulations. Lastly, running simulations with multiple workloads requires researchers to write custom external scripts to coordinate multiple gem5 simulations which creates error-prone and hard-to-reproduce workflows. To overcome this, we introduce several features in gem5 and gem5 Resources. We standardize disk-image creation across x86, ARM, and RISC-V using Packer, and provide validated base images with pre-annotated benchmark suites (NPB, GAPBS). We provide 12 new disk images, 6 new kernels, and over 200 workloads across three ISAs. We refactor the exit event system to a class-based model and introduce hypercalls for enhanced guest-host communication that allows researchers to define custom behavior for their exit events. We also provide a utility to remotely monitor simulations and the gem5-bridge driver for user-space m5 operations. Additionally, we implemented Suites and MultiSim to enable parallel full-system simulations from gem5 configuration scripts, eliminating the need for external scripting. These features reduce setup complexity and provide extensible, validated resources that improve reproducibility and standardization."

    "source": "arXiv",
    "abstract": "Premature semantic collapse -- the forced early commitment to a single meaning -- remains a core architectural limitation of current language models. Softmax-driven competition and greedy decoding cause models to discard valid interpretations before sufficient context is available, resulting in brittle reasoning and context failures. We introduce Non-Resolution Reasoning (NRR), a general computational framework that preserves semantic ambiguity during inference and performs resolution only when explicitly required. NRR integrates three components: (1) Multi-Vector Embeddings that maintain multiple viable interpretations per token, (2) Non-Collapsing Attention that prevents winner-take-all dynamics across layers, and (3) Contextual Identity Tracking (CIT), which assigns context-specific identities to recurring entities (e.g., distinguishing \"Dr. Smith the cardiologist\" from \"Dr. Smith the researcher\"). These mechanisms are unified by an external Resolution Operator $ρ$ that makes semantic commitment explicit, controllable, and task-dependent. Unlike standard architectures, NRR separates representation from resolution, allowing a single model to shift between creative, factual, and ambiguity-preserving reasoning without retraining. A synthetic evaluation demonstrates NRR's ability to preserve ambiguity and track context: CIT-enhanced models achieve 90.9% accuracy on out-of-distribution identity-shift tasks, compared to 9.1% for transformer baselines. NRR provides a principled alternative to premature collapse, reframing ambiguity as an explicit representational state rather than a failure mode. The question is not whether AI should resolve ambiguity, but when, how, and under whose control."

The COaxially Aligned STeerable (COAST) guidewire robot has the ability to generate a wide variety of motions including bending motion with different bending lengths, follow-the-leader motion, and feedforward motion. In our past studies, we have explored different designs of the COAST guidewire robot and developed modeling, control, and sensing strategies for the COAST guidewire robot. In this study, the performance of a modified COAST guidewire robot is evaluated by conducting navigation experiments in an anatomical phantom model with pulsatile flow. The modified COAST guidewire robot is a simplified version of the COAST guidewire robot and consists of two tubes as opposed to three tubes. Through this study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the modified COAST guidewire robot in navigating the tortuous phantom vasculature."

Aims: The goal of the present investigation is the interpretation of recent JWST data of the low main sequence of 47 Tuc, in order to explore the stellar to sub-stellar transition, to derive the mass distribution of the individual sources and to disentangle stars from different populations. Methods: Stellar evolution modelling of low-mass stars of metallicity [Fe/H]=-0.78 and oxygen content [O/Fe]=+0.4 and [O/Fe]=0 is used to simulate the evolution of the first and the second generation of the cluster. The comparison between the calculated sequences with the data points is used to characterize the individual objects, to split the different stellar components and to infer the current mass function of the cluster. Results: The first generation of 47 Tuc harbours 45 % of the overall population of the cluster, the remaining 55 % making up the second generation. The transition from the stellar to the sub-stellar domain is found at $0.074 M_{\\odot}$ and $0.07 M_{\\odot}$ for the first and second generations, respectively. The mass function of both the stellar generations are consistent with a Kroupa-like profile down to $0.22 M_\\odot$."

Our goal is to determine how external perturbations can be optimized to steer the system efficiently toward the uniformly positive state, starting from two initial clusters of positive sites. To achieve this, we cast the problem as a Markov decision process adapted for a two-dimensional Ising model with zero-temperature dynamics. Within this framework, we compare alternative growth geometries and identify the structure of optimal strategies across three representative regimes."

It enables precise control over subject motion and has important applications in animation. However, current pose-guided video generation methods are limited to accepting only human poses as input, thus generalizing poorly to pose of other subjects. To address this issue, we propose PoseAnything, the first universal pose-guided video generation framework capable of handling both human and non-human characters, supporting arbitrary skeletal inputs. To enhance consistency preservation during motion, we introduce Part-aware Temporal Coherence Module, which divides the subject into different parts, establishes part correspondences, and computes cross-attention between corresponding parts across frames to achieve fine-grained part-level consistency. Additionally, we propose Subject and Camera Motion Decoupled CFG, a novel guidance strategy that, for the first time, enables independent camera movement control in pose-guided video generation, by separately injecting subject and camera motion control information into the positive and negative anchors of CFG. Furthermore, we present XPose, a high-quality public dataset containing 50,000 non-human pose-video pairs, along with an automated pipeline for annotation and filtering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Pose-Anything significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both effectiveness and generalization."

Building upon POLAR, we develop a flow-based generative model POLARNet that predicts per-light OLAT responses from a single portrait, capturing fine-grained and direction-aware illumination effects while preserving facial identity. Unlike diffusion or background-conditioned methods that rely on statistical or contextual cues, our formulation models illumination as a continuous, physically interpretable transformation between lighting states, enabling scalable and controllable relighting. Together, POLAR and POLARNet form a unified illumination learning framework that links real data, generative synthesis, and physically grounded relighting, establishing a self-sustaining \"chicken-and-egg\" cycle for scalable and reproducible portrait illumination."

It is known that a threshold in the electrostatic potential must be exceeded in order for stochastic particle motion and heating to occur. Regardless its amplitude, however, the electrostatic wave induces a periodic oscillation in the particle motion. We show, by analytical and numerical arguments, that this dynamics is non-adiabatic, meaning that the particle does not land back to its initial state when the wave is slowly turned off. This way, particle energization (although, not rigorously heating) occurs even under sub-threshold conditions."

    "abstract": "Most path following and trajectory tracking algorithms in mobile robotics require the desired path or trajectory to be defined by at least twice continuously differentiable functions to guarantee key properties such as global convergence, especially for nonholonomic robots like unicycles with speed constraints. Consequently, these algorithms typically exclude continuous but non-differentiable paths, such as piecewise functions. Despite this exclusion, such paths provide convenient high-level inputs for describing robot missions or behavior. While techniques such as spline interpolation or optimization-based methods are commonly used to smooth non-differentiable paths or create feasible ones from sequences of waypoints, they either can produce unnecessarily complex trajectories or are computationally expensive. In this work, we present a method to regularize non-differentiable functions and generate feasible paths through mollification. Specifically, we approximate an arbitrary path with a differentiable function that can converge to it with arbitrary precision. Additionally, we provide a systematic method for bounding the curvature of generated paths, which we demonstrate by applying it to paths resulting from linking a sequence of waypoints with segments. The proposed approach is computationally efficient, enabling real-time implementation on microcontrollers and compatibility with standard trajectory tracking and path following algorithms."

While surface immobilization has been widely used to extend observation times, it could disrupt molecular dynamics and impede biological function. Moreover, the study of weak molecular interactions requires high local concentrations, often leading to problems with signal saturation in fluorescence-based approaches. Recent advancements in single-molecule trapping techniques have addressed some limitations, but achieving precise, controllable, long-term trapping in a molecularly crowded environment without external forces remains difficult. Here, we introduce a nanopore-gated sub-attoliter silicon nanocavity that enables precise, non-perturbative trapping of individual biomolecules for extended observation times, eliminating the need for external forces. Using nucleosomes as model systems, we demonstrate single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) to monitor relative distances. Our data also show that an applied electric field can modulate the conformational properties of macromolecules, emphasizing a key advantage of our device: it does not require an electric field to retain trapped molecules. We envision this nanocavity platform as a powerful tool for interrogating molecular dynamics in physiologically relevant environments, offering unperturbed access to weak and transient interactions that are central to biological regulation."

The technique of n-step returns is known to increase the convergence speed of RL algorithms compared to their 1-step returns-based versions. However, SAC is notoriously difficult to combine with n-step returns, since their usual combination introduces bias in off-policy algorithms due to the changes in action distribution. While this problem is solved by importance sampling, a method for estimating expected values of one distribution using samples from another distribution, importance sampling may result in numerical instability. In this work, we combine SAC with n-step returns in a way that overcomes this issue. We present an approach to applying numerically stable importance sampling with simplified hyperparameter selection. Furthermore, we analyze the entropy estimation approach of Soft Actor-Critic in the context of the n-step maximum entropy framework and formulate the $τ$-sampled entropy estimation to reduce the variance of the learning target.

End-to-end learning-based approaches unlock greater flexibility and adaptability, but existing state-of-the-art methods either rely on heightmaps that introduce noise and complex, costly pipelines, or implicitly infer terrain features from egocentric depth images, often missing accurate critical geometric cues and leading to inefficient learning and rigid gaits. To overcome these limitations, we propose START, a single-stage learning framework that enables agile, stable locomotion on highly sparse and randomized footholds. START leverages only low-cost onboard vision and proprioception to accurately reconstruct local terrain heightmap, providing an explicit intermediate representation to convey essential features relevant to sparse foothold regions. This supports comprehensive environmental understanding and precise terrain assessment, reducing exploration cost and accelerating skill acquisition. Experimental results demonstrate that START achieves zero-shot transfer across diverse real-world scenarios, showcasing superior adaptability, precise foothold placement, and robust locomotion."

    "abstract": "Epithelia are confluent cell layers that self-organize into polygonal networks whose geometry encodes their mechanical state. A principal driver is the tunable contractility of the actomyosin cortex, which links cell-junction tension to tissue architecture. Notably, epithelial tilings frequently resemble centroidal Voronoi tessellations (CVTs), yet the physical origin of this resemblance has remained unclear. Here, using a minimal vertex model that relates cell shape to a mechanical energy, we show that CVT-like patterns arise naturally in the solid (rigid) regime of tissues. Analytical theory reveals that isotropic strain minimization drives cell centroids toward Voronoi configurations, a result we corroborate with a analytical mean-field formulation of the vertex model. We further demonstrate that physiologically relevant perturbations -- such as cyclic stretch -- shift tissues into distinct, geometrically disordered CVT states, and that these shifts provide quantitative, image-based readouts of mechanical state. Together, our results identify a mechanical origin for CVT-like organization in epithelia and establish a geometric framework that infers tissue stresses directly from morphology, offering broadly applicable metrics for assessing rigidity and remodeling in living tissues."

    "abstract": "Multi-modal 3D object detection is important for reliable perception in robotics and autonomous driving. However, its effectiveness remains limited under adverse weather conditions due to weather-induced distortions and misalignment between different data modalities. In this work, we propose DiffFusion, a novel framework designed to enhance robustness in challenging weather through diffusion-based restoration and adaptive cross-modal fusion. Our key insight is that diffusion models possess strong capabilities for denoising and generating data that can adapt to various weather conditions. Building on this, DiffFusion introduces Diffusion-IR restoring images degraded by weather effects and Point Cloud Restoration (PCR) compensating for corrupted LiDAR data using image object cues. To tackle misalignments between two modalities, we develop Bidirectional Adaptive Fusion and Alignment Module (BAFAM). It enables dynamic multi-modal fusion and bidirectional bird's-eye view (BEV) alignment to maintain consistent spatial correspondence. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show that DiffFusion achieves state-of-the-art robustness under adverse weather while preserving strong clean-data performance. Zero-shot results on the real-world DENSE dataset further validate its generalization. The implementation of our DiffFusion will be released as open-source."

To overcome the limitations of traditional methods in large-scale, fine-grained detection, this study focuses on accurately identifying infected trees and analyzing infestation patterns. We propose FID-Net, a deep learning model that detects pest-affected trees from UAV visible-light imagery and enables infestation analysis via three spatial metrics. Based on YOLOv8n, FID-Net introduces a lightweight Feature Enhancement Module (FEM) to extract disease-sensitive cues, an Adaptive Multi-scale Feature Fusion Module (AMFM) to align and fuse dual-branch features (RGB and FEM-enhanced), and an Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) mechanism to enhance discriminative information efficiently. From detection results, we construct a pest situation analysis framework using: (1) Kernel Density Estimation to locate infection hotspots; (2) neighborhood evaluation to assess healthy trees' infection risk; (3) DBSCAN clustering to identify high-density healthy clusters as priority protection zones. Experiments on UAV imagery from 32 forest plots in eastern Tianshan, China, show that FID-Net achieves 86.10% precision, 75.44% recall, 82.29% mAP@0.5, and 64.30% mAP@0.5:0.95, outperforming mainstream YOLO models. Analysis confirms infected trees exhibit clear clustering, supporting targeted forest protection. FID-Net enables accurate tree health discrimination and, combined with spatial metrics, provides reliable data for intelligent pest monitoring, early warning, and precise management."

    "abstract": "Imitation learning (IL) has emerged as a central paradigm in autonomous driving. While IL excels in matching expert behavior in open-loop settings by minimizing per-step prediction errors, its performance degrades unexpectedly in closed-loop due to the gradual accumulation of small, often imperceptible errors over time.Over successive planning cycles, these errors compound, potentially resulting in severe failures.Current research efforts predominantly rely on increasingly sophisticated network architectures or high-fidelity training datasets to enhance the robustness of IL planners against error accumulation, focusing on the state-level robustness at a single time point. However, autonomous driving is inherently a continuous-time process, and leveraging the temporal scale to enhance robustness may provide a new perspective for addressing this issue.To this end, we propose a method termed Sequence of Experts (SoE), a temporal alternation policy that enhances closed-loop performance without increasing model size or data requirements. Our experiments on large-scale autonomous driving benchmarks nuPlan demonstrate that SoE method consistently and significantly improves the performance of all the evaluated models, and achieves state-of-the-art performance.This module may provide a key and widely applicable support for improving the training efficiency of autonomous driving models."

However, the extension of this technique to out-of-equilibrium systems has been hampered by the lack of x-ray sources capable of accessing multiple atomic sites with high spectral and temporal resolution, as well as the lack of simple theoretical procedures to interpret the observed signals. In this work we employ multi-site XPS with a narrowband femtosecond x-ray probe to unravel different ultrafast dissociation processes of a polyatomic molecule, fluoromethane (CH$_{3}$F). We show that XPS can follow the cleavage of both the C-F and C-H bonds in real time, despite these channels lying close in binding energy. Additionally, we apply the partial charges model to describe these dynamics, and verify this extension with both advanced ab-initio calculations and experimental data. These results enable the application of this technique to out-of-equilibrium systems of higher complexity, by correlating real-time information from multiple atomic sites and interpreting the measurements through a viable theoretical modelling."

    "abstract": "Dense retrieval has become the industry standard in large-scale information retrieval systems due to its high efficiency and competitive accuracy. Its core relies on a coarse-to-fine hierarchical architecture that enables rapid candidate selection and precise semantic matching, achieving millisecond-level response over billion-scale corpora. This capability makes it essential not only in traditional search and recommendation scenarios but also in the emerging paradigm of generative recommendation driven by large language models, where semantic IDs-themselves a form of coarse-to-fine representation-play a foundational role. However, the widely adopted dual-tower encoding architecture introduces inherent challenges, primarily representational space misalignment and retrieval index inconsistency, which degrade matching accuracy, retrieval stability, and performance on long-tail queries. These issues are further magnified in semantic ID generation, ultimately limiting the performance ceiling of downstream generative models. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a simple and effective framework named SCI comprising two synergistic modules: a symmetric representation alignment module that employs an innovative input-swapping mechanism to unify the dual-tower representation space without adding parameters, and an consistent indexing with dual-tower synergy module that redesigns retrieval paths using a dual-view indexing strategy to maintain consistency from training to inference. The framework is systematic, lightweight, and engineering-friendly, requiring minimal overhead while fully supporting billion-scale deployment. We provide theoretical guarantees for our approach, with its effectiveness validated by results across public datasets and real-world e-commerce datasets."

Despite outperforming time-invariant models in regional studies, their mathematical foundations are often insufficiently formalized. This study addresses these gaps by formally deriving the EEPAS and PPE models within the framework of inhomogeneous Poisson point processes and clarifying the connection between empirical $Ψ$-scaling regressions and likelihood-based inference. We introduce a fully automated, open-source Python implementation of EEPAS that combines analytical modeling with Numba JIT acceleration, NumPy vectorization, and joblib parallelization, all configured via modular JSON files for usability and reproducibility. Integration with pyCSEP enables standardized evaluation and comparison. When applied to the Italy HORUS dataset, our system reproduces published results within one hour using identical initialization settings. It also provides a comprehensive pipeline from raw catalog to parameter estimation, achieving improved log-likelihoods and passing strict consistency tests without manual $Ψ$ identification. We position our framework as part of a growing open-source ecosystem for seismological research that spans the full workflow from data acquisition to forecast evaluation. Our framework fills a key gap in this ecosystem by providing robust tools for medium- to long-term statistical modeling of earthquake catalogs, which is an essential but underserved component in probabilistic seismic forecasting."

Nonetheless, their substantial computational cost makes deployment on resource-constrained devices impractical. In this paper, we introduce an efficient asymmetric VPR framework that incorporates a high-capacity gallery model for offline feature extraction with a lightweight query network for online processing. A key challenge in this setting is ensuring compatibility between these heterogeneous networks, which conventional approaches address through computationally expensive k-NN-based compatible training. To overcome this, we propose a geographical memory bank that structures gallery features using geolocation metadata inherent in VPR databases, eliminating the need for exhaustive k-NN computations. Additionally, we introduce an implicit embedding augmentation technique that enhances the query network to model feature variations despite its limited capacity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only significantly reduces computational costs but also outperforms existing asymmetric retrieval techniques, establishing a new aspect for VPR in resource-limited environments.

We compare our theoretical predictions with the results of micromagnetic simulations and identify two resonance frequencies determined by the eigenenergies of the excitation modes.

The ``forcing Strouhal number'' that produced the largest lift coefficient increments, equal to $0.26 \\pm 0.04$, was linked to the conventional bluff-body Strouhal number by recognizing that drag and lift on flat plate wings are directly proportional at a fixed angle of attack. Flowfield measurements, to determine the time-averaged separation bubble height and local velocity at separation, showed that the universal Strouhal number of approximately $0.16 \\pm 0.01$ --developed for bluff-body and separation bubble vortex shedding--can be further generalized to active separation control, when the natural shedding frequency is substituted by the forcing frequency. Insect wing flapping frequencies in hover were examined on the basis of Strouhal number scaling and corresponded reasonably well to the optimum forcing Strouhal number range, although angle of attack estimates were a source of uncertainty. Furthermore, universal Strouhal number scaling can only be validated with accurate separation bubble height and separation velocity measurements."

To address this limitation, we propose a novel Bidirectional Image-Guided Concept Erasure (Bi-Erasing) framework that performs concept suppression and safety enhancement simultaneously. Specifically, based on the joint representation of text prompts and corresponding images, Bi-Erasing introduces two decoupled image branches: a negative branch responsible for suppressing harmful semantics and a positive branch providing visual guidance for safe alternatives. By jointly optimizing these complementary directions, our approach achieves a balance between erasure efficacy and generation usability. In addition, we apply mask-based filtering to the image branches to prevent interference from irrelevant content during the erasure process. Across extensive experiment evaluations, the proposed Bi-Erasing outperforms baseline methods in balancing concept removal effectiveness and visual fidelity."

Challenges exist in encoding the minimal and physical degrees of freedom for a non-Abelian gauge theory and maintaining physical or gauge-invariant dynamics in a simulation. In this work, the Loop-String-Hadron (LSH) formulation of the 1+1-dimensional SU(3) lattice gauge theory is used to define an efficient mapping of SU(3) invariant degrees of freedom onto qubits. It is shown that the required number of qubits in the LSH basis is significantly reduced compared to its IRREP basis counterpart. While the non-Abelian Gauss laws of the SU(3) theory are automatically satisfied by the usage of LSH variables, the remnant constraints on the consistency of the flux numbers still exist. During time evolution, the noise can accumulate and take the state out of the sector of the Hilbert space where the constraint is satisfied. With this motivation, an oracle algorithm is constructed to be applied to the qubits for checking the local constraint at a given link. Costs in terms of qubit and gate number, and circuit depth, are found."

Typically, they exhibit eigenvalue splitting that scales as ε^(1/n), which is referred to as the generic response. However, under certain conditions, a nongeneric response of HOEPs occurs where the splitting follows a lower order ε^(1/m) (m<n). A nongeneric response of HOEPs with a lower order splitting lead to the remaining EPs. While the presence of these remaining EPs is acknowledged, a thorough elucidation of their fundamental properties has yet to be achieved. In this work, we demonstrate those unsplit eigenvalue points must constitute remaining EPs in a perturbed n-orders HOEPs system. Combining graph theory and topological analysis, the number and splitting order of the remaining EPs is studied. This framework not only resolves a fundamental challenge in HOEPs but also paves the way for exploiting remaining EPs in applications such as anisotropic sensing and the design of Dirac exceptional points."

We operate in the high-dimensional and highly-constrained setting, where oracle access is restricted to one or a few objective and constraint gradients per-iteration, as in streaming or online estimation. Existing approaches to solve such problems are based on either the stochastic primal-dual or stochastic subgradient methods, and require globally Lipschitz continuous constraint functions. In this work, we develop a hinge-proximal framework that utilizes an exact penalty reformulation to yield updates involving only one linearized constraint (and hence accessing one constraint gradient) per-iteration. The updates also admit a novel hinge-proximal three-point inequality relying on smoothness rather than global Lipschitz continuity of the constraint functions. The framework leads to three algorithms: a baseline hinge-proximal SGD (HPS), a variance-reduced HPS version for finite-sum settings, and a nested HPS version whose performance depends on a geometric regularity constant of the constraint region rather than explicitly on the number of constraints, while achieving near-SGD sample complexity. The superior empirical performance of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated on a robust regression problem with noisy features, representative of errors-in-variables estimation."

We discover a $\\sim$30 Hz propulsive pulse, the mechanical signature of collective ciliary action. This high-frequency motor output drives a fluctuating velocity in the low-$Re$ \\textit{V. carteri}, but is mechanically filtered by the inertia of the larger \\textit{V. ferrisii}, resulting in a smooth swimming trajectory.

    "abstract": "Detecting partial deepfake speech is challenging because manipulations occur only in short regions while the surrounding audio remains authentic. However, existing detection methods are fundamentally limited by the quality of available datasets, many of which rely on outdated synthesis systems and generation procedures that introduce dataset-specific artifacts rather than realistic manipulation cues. To address this gap, we introduce HQ-MPSD, a high-quality multilingual partial deepfake speech dataset. HQ-MPSD is constructed using linguistically coherent splice points derived from fine-grained forced alignment, preserving prosodic and semantic continuity and minimizing audible and visual boundary artifacts. The dataset contains 350.8 hours of speech across eight languages and 550 speakers, with background effects added to better reflect real-world acoustic conditions. MOS evaluations and spectrogram analysis confirm the high perceptual naturalness of the samples. We benchmark state-of-the-art detection models through cross-language and cross-dataset evaluations, and all models experience performance drops exceeding 80% on HQ-MPSD. These results demonstrate that HQ-MPSD exposes significant generalization challenges once low-level artifacts are removed and multilingual and acoustic diversity are introduced, providing a more realistic and demanding benchmark for partial deepfake detection.

    "abstract": "The Multimodal Direct Inversion (MMDI) algorithm is widely used in Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE) to estimate tissue shear stiffness. However, MMDI relies on the Helmholtz equation, which assumes wave propagation in a uniform, homogeneous, and infinite medium. Furthermore, the use of the Laplacian operator makes MMDI highly sensitive to noise, which compromises the accuracy and reliability of stiffness estimates. In this study, we propose the Deep-Learning driven Inversion Framework for Shear Modulus Estimation in MRE (DIME), aimed at enhancing the robustness of inversion. DIME is trained on the displacement fields-stiffness maps pair generated through Finite Element Modelling (FEM) simulations. To capture local wave behavior and improve robustness to global image variations, DIME is trained on small image patches. We first validated DIME using homogeneous and heterogeneous datasets simulated with FEM, where DIME produced stiffness maps with low inter-pixel variability, accurate boundary delineation, and higher correlation with ground truth (GT) compared to MMDI. Next, DIME was evaluated in a realistic anatomy-informed simulated liver dataset with known GT and compared directly to MMDI. DIME reproduced ground-truth stiffness patterns with high fidelity (r = 0.99, R^2 = 0.98), while MMDI showed greater underestimation. After validating DIME on synthetic data, we tested the model in in vivo liver MRE data from eight healthy and seven fibrotic subjects. DIME preserved physiologically consistent stiffness patterns and closely matched MMDI, which showed directional bias. Overall, DIME showed higher correlation with ground truth and visually similar stiffness patterns, whereas MMDI displayed a larger bias that can potentially be attributed to directional filtering. These preliminary results highlight the feasibility of DIME for clinical applications in MRE."

While widely studied in classification, OOD detection for regression and survival analysis remains limited due to the absence of discrete labels and the challenge of quantifying predictive uncertainty. We introduce a framework for OOD detection that is simultaneously model aware and subspace aware, and that embeds variable prioritization directly into the detection step. The method uses the fitted predictor to construct localized neighborhoods around each test case that emphasize the features driving the model's learned relationship and downweight directions that are less relevant to prediction. It produces OOD scores without relying on global distance metrics or estimating the full feature density. The framework is applicable across outcome types, and in our implementation we use random forests, where the rule structure yields transparent neighborhoods and effective scoring. Experiments on synthetic and real data benchmarks designed to isolate functional shifts show consistent improvements over existing methods. We further demonstrate the approach in an esophageal cancer survival study, where distribution shifts related to lymphadenectomy identify patterns relevant to surgical guidelines."

Hence, for Lie $\\infty$-groups, we consider simplicial coalgebras of point distributions. To do this properly, we first develop the homotopy theory of pointed formal $\\infty$-groupoids within K. Behrend and E. Getzler's framework for higher geometric stacks. These objects are \"higher\" but not \"derived\", which is an important distinction for the geometric applications in mind. The second part of our construction relies on a careful analysis of J. Pridham's variation of the Dold-Kan adjunction for cosimplicial algebras. Our main result is a differentiation functor at the level of 1-categories from finite-dimensional Lie $\\infty$-groups to finite-type Lie $\\infty$-algebras that is homotopically well-behaved, coordinate-free, and explicit yet tractable.

We further analyze the varying importance of model layers and propose a dynamic, layer-aware recomputation strategy to balance accuracy and efficiency.

    "abstract": "Identifying and comparing topological features, particularly cycles, across different topological objects remains a fundamental challenge in persistent homology and topological data analysis. This work introduces a novel framework for constructing cycle communities through two complementary approaches. First, a dendrogram-based methodology leverages merge-tree algorithms to construct hierarchical representations of homology classes from persistence intervals. The Wasserstein distance on merge trees is introduced as a metric for comparing dendrograms, establishing connections to hierarchical clustering frameworks. Through simulation studies, the discriminative power of dendrogram representations for identifying cycle communities is demonstrated. Second, an extension of Stratified Gradient Sampling simultaneously learns multiple filter functions that yield cycle barycenter functions capable of faithfully reconstructing distinct sets of cycles. The set of cycles each filter function can reconstruct constitutes cycle communities that are non-overlapping and partition the space of all cycles. Together, these approaches transform the problem of cycle matching into both a hierarchical clustering and topological optimization framework, providing principled methods to identify similar topological structures both within and across groups of topological objects."

    "abstract": "For decades, SQL has been the default language for composing queries, but it is increasingly used as an artifact to be read and verified rather than authored. With Large Language Models (LLMs), queries are increasingly machine-generated, while humans read, validate, and debug them. This shift turns relational query languages into interfaces for back-and-forth communication about intent, which will lead to a rethinking of relational language design, and more broadly, relational interface design. We argue that this rethinking needs support from an Abstract Relational Query Language (ARQL): a semantics-first reference metalanguage that separates query intent from user-facing syntax and makes underlying relational patterns explicit and comparable across user-facing languages. An ARQL separates a query into (i) a relational core (the compositional structure that determines intent), (ii) modalities (alternative representations of that core tailored to different audiences), and (iii) conventions (orthogonal environment-level semantic parameters under which the core is interpreted, e.g., set vs. bag semantics, or treatment of null values). Usability for humans or machines then depends less on choosing a particular language and more on choosing an appropriate modality. Comparing languages becomes a question of which relational patterns they support and what conventions they choose. We introduce Abstract Relational Calculus (ARC), a strict generalization of Tuple Relational Calculus (TRC), as a concrete instance of ARQL. ARC comes in three modalities: (i) a comprehension-style textual notation, (ii) an Abstract Language Tree (ALT) for machine reasoning about meaning, and (iii) a diagrammatic hierarchical graph (higraph) representation for humans. ARC provides the missing vocabulary and acts as a Rosetta Stone for relational querying."

    "abstract": "The scaling of computation throughput continues to outpace improvements in memory bandwidth, making many deep learning workloads memory-bound. Kernel fusion is a key technique to alleviate this problem, but the fusion strategies of existing compilers and frameworks are limited to using local scratchpad memory. When the intermediate results exceed the limited capacity (such as FFN), the fusion fails. Although modern GPUs (like the NVIDIA H100) now incorporate an inter-core connection mechanism known as Distributed Shared Memory(DSM)--providing a larger, high-bandwidth, and low-latency on-chip memory pool--this hardware potential has yet to be exploited by software frameworks. To bridge this gap, we present FlashFuser, the first compiler framework to utilize inter-core connection for kernel fusion on modern GPUs. FlashFuser extends established fusion techniques to the DSM domain through three core contributions. First, we propose a powerful DSM-based communication abstraction that formalizes complex cluster-based data exchange patterns, such as reduce, shuffle and multiply. Second, we introduce a dataflow analyzer that generalizes loop scheduling, resource mapping, and tile selection to the distributed memory hierarchy; it determines the optimal execution order and tile sizes by quantifying data movement across memory levels. Finally, FlashFuser integrates these components into a unified search engine that employs analytical cost modeling and DSM-aware pruning strategies to efficiently discover the optimal execution plan. Our evaluation on an NVIDIA H100 GPU shows that FlashFuser reduces memory access by 58% and delivers kernel speedups of 3.3x against highly-tuned libraries and 4.1x against state-of-the-art compilers, resulting in a 1.24x end-to-end speedup."

However, stellar binarity can alter observable properties and introduce strong biases. We aim to provide a holistic picture of the binary population and its evolution in the red giant phase by characterizing a sample of binaries hosting oscillating red giants from a combination of extensive asteroseismic, spectroscopic, and astrometric surveys. We investigate the binary properties of evolved stars in the APOKASC3 and APO-K2 catalogs, leveraging asteroseismic constraints and Gaia DR3 non-single-star solutions. We explore the mass distribution of red-giant binary systems and analyze the evolution of their binary fraction. For stars with M$\\leq$1.8M$_\\odot$, we find binary fractions $\\sim$31% and $\\sim$41% for oscillating and non-oscillating solar-like stars on the main-sequence (MS). By the power excess ($ν_\\mathrm{max}$) as luminosity proxy, we detect a binary attrition of $\\sim$69% and $\\sim$81% on the low- and high-luminosity red-giant branch (RGB) and an additional $\\sim$38% to the red clump (RC), with respect to the MS. Binaries hosting RC and secondary clump stars (2RC) stars are largely depleted at $P_\\mathrm{orb}\\lesssim$500 and $\\lesssim$200 days, respectively. Mass-dependent differences in binary fractions and orbital properties point to more substantial binary attrition for stars with M $\\leq$1.8 M$_\\odot$. The distinct mass distributions and the depletion of short-period binaries during the red-giant phase underscore the impact of stellar expansion and binary interactions on stellar evolution. RC systems with $P_\\mathrm{orb}\\lesssim$800 to 1,000 days are likely shaped by past interactions, such as mass transfer or loss, which can lead to significantly biased age estimates if not accounted for."

    "abstract": "A common assumption in the spatial analysis of agricultural field trials is stationarity. In practice, however, this assumption is often violated due to unaccounted field effects. For instance, in plant breeding field trials, this can lead to inaccurate estimates of plant performance. Based on such inaccurate estimates, breeders may be impeded in selecting the best performing plant varieties, slowing breeding progress. We propose a method to automatically verify the hypothesis of stationarity. The method is sensitive towards mean as well as variance-covariance nonstationarity. It is specifically developed for the two-dimensional grid-structure of field trials. The method relies on the hypothesis that we can detect nonstationarity by partitioning the field into areas, within which stationarity holds. We applied the method to a large number of simulated datasets and a real-data example. The method reliably points out which trials exhibit quality issues and gives an indication about the severity of nonstationarity. This information can significantly reduce the time spent on manual quality control and enhance its overall reliability. Furthermore, the output of the method can be used to improve the analysis of conducted trials as well as the experimental design of future trials."

As re-collecting demonstrations and retraining for each new hardware platform are prohibitively costly, we show that existing robot data can be augmented for transfer and generalization. The Open X-Embodiment (OXE) dataset, which aggregates demonstrations from over 60 robot datasets, has been widely used as the foundation for training generalist policies. However, it is highly imbalanced: the top four robot types account for over 85\\% of its real data, which risks overfitting to robot-scene combinations. We present AugE-Toolkit, a scalable robot augmentation pipeline, and OXE-AugE, a high-quality open-source dataset that augments OXE with 9 different robot embodiments. OXE-AugE provides over 4.4 million trajectories, more than triple the size of the original OXE. We conduct a systematic study of how scaling robot augmentation impacts cross-embodiment learning. Results suggest that augmenting datasets with diverse arms and grippers improves policy performance not only on the augmented robots, but also on unseen robots and even the original robots under distribution shifts. In physical experiments, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art generalist policies such as OpenVLA and $π_0$ benefit from fine-tuning on OXE-AugE, improving success rates by 24-45% on previously unseen robot-gripper combinations across four real-world manipulation tasks.

Existing resources and standardized tools for these languages are limited. To address this, we propose a human-AI collaborative approach for building a multilingual legal terminology database, based on a multi-agent framework. This approach integrates advanced large language models and legal domain experts throughout the entire process-from raw document preprocessing, article-level alignment, to terminology extraction, mapping, and quality assurance. Unlike a single automated pipeline, our approach places greater emphasis on how human experts participate in this multi-agent system. Humans and AI agents take on different roles: AI agents handle specific, repetitive tasks, such as OCR, text segmentation, semantic alignment, and initial terminology extraction, while human experts provide crucial oversight, review, and supervise the outputs with contextual knowledge and legal judgment. We tested the effectiveness of this framework using a trilingual parallel corpus comprising 35 key Chinese statutes, along with their English and Japanese translations. The experimental results show that this human-in-the-loop, multi-agent workflow not only improves the precision and consistency of multilingual legal terminology mapping but also offers greater scalability compared to traditional manual methods."

First, most existing approaches can only generate ambient sounds and lack the capability to produce human speech synchronized with lip movements. Second, recent attempts at unified human video-audio generation typically rely on explicit fusion or modality-specific alignment modules, which introduce additional architecture design and weaken the model simplicity of the original transformers. To address these issues, JoVA employs joint self-attention across video and audio tokens within each transformer layer, enabling direct and efficient cross-modal interaction without the need for additional alignment modules. Furthermore, to enable high-quality lip-speech synchronization, we introduce a simple yet effective mouth-area loss based on facial keypoint detection, which enhances supervision on the critical mouth region during training without compromising architectural simplicity. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that JoVA outperforms or is competitive with both unified and audio-driven state-of-the-art methods in lip-sync accuracy, speech quality, and overall video-audio generation fidelity. Our results establish JoVA as an elegant framework for high-quality multimodal generation."

We trace these failures to embedding norm inflation: learned tokens drift to out-of-distribution magnitudes, degrading prompt conditioning in pre-norm Transformers. Empirically, we show semantics are primarily encoded by direction in CLIP token space, while inflated norms harm contextualization; theoretically, we analyze how large magnitudes attenuate positional information and hinder residual updates in pre-norm blocks. We propose Directional Textual Inversion (DTI), which fixes the embedding magnitude to an in-distribution scale and optimizes only direction on the unit hypersphere via Riemannian SGD. We cast direction learning as MAP with a von Mises-Fisher prior, yielding a constant-direction prior gradient that is simple and efficient to incorporate. Across personalization tasks, DTI improves text fidelity over TI and TI-variants while maintaining subject similarity. Crucially, DTI's hyperspherical parameterization enables smooth, semantically coherent interpolation between learned concepts (slerp), a capability that is absent in standard TI. Our findings suggest that direction-only optimization is a robust and scalable path for prompt-faithful personalization."

While already established in amplitude interferometry, for the recently expanding field of intensity interferometers the closure phase enables recovering information of the interferometric phases that are otherwise inaccessible with this technique. To extract the (cosine of) the closure phase ($\\cos φ$) in intensity interferometry, third-order correlations between three simultaneously measuring telescopes have to be computed. As the signal-to-noise of such three-photon correlations is too small for current generation intensity interferometers, no third-order correlations of astrophysical targets have been recorded so far. In this paper we present the first measurements of third order correlation functions of two stellar systems, Nunki ($σ$ Sgr) and Dschubba ($δ$ Sco), observed with the H.E.S.S. intensity interferometer in 2023. We show how to isolate the three-photon contribution term from the two-photon contributions, in order to access $\\cos φ$. For the observed stellar targets the sensitivity is not high enough to extract closure phase information. To demonstrate that the analysis works well we further extract $\\cos φ$ in a laboratory experiment, using the H.E.S.S. intensity interferometer and a pseudo-thermal light source."

To address this issue, we propose CausalCLIP, a framework that explicitly disentangles causal from non-causal features and employs targeted filtering guided by causal inference principles to retain only the most transferable and discriminative forensic cues. By modeling the generation process with a structural causal model and enforcing statistical independence through Gumbel-Softmax-based feature masking and Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) constraints, CausalCLIP isolates stable causal features robust to distribution shifts. When tested on unseen generative models from different series, CausalCLIP demonstrates strong generalization ability, achieving improvements of 6.83% in accuracy and 4.06% in average precision over state-of-the-art methods."

We compare reaction-limited and diffusion-limited evaporation regimes, demonstrating that their distinct velocity fields and flow magnitudes fundamentally alter filament arrangement. While diffusion-limited evaporation drives the ``coffee-ring effect\", compromising network uniformity, reaction-limited evaporation suppresses edge accumulation, promoting centered conductive deposits. We map out the spatial variation of filament alignment - tangential at the contact line, radial in the intermediate region, and random near the center. Longer filaments tend to favour more tangential alignment overall and suppress edge accumulation. We find that by tuning the evaporation regime, filament deposition can lead to significantly lower percolation thresholds and significantly higher conductivity exponents. These results quantify the link between evaporation kinetics and microstructure, providing guidelines for optimizing conductive network formation in printed electronics."

    "abstract": "Positional numeration systems are a large family of numeration systems used to represent natural numbers. Whether the set of all representations forms a regular language or not is one of the most important questions that can be asked of such a system. This question was investigated in a 1998 article by Hollander. Central to his analysis is a property linking positional numeration systems and Rényi numeration systems, which use a real base to represent real numbers. However, this link only exists when the initial numeration system has a dominant root, which is not a necessary condition for regularity. In this article, we show a more general link between positional numeration systems and alternate base numeration systems, a family generalizing Rényi systems. We then take advantage of this link to provide a full characterization of those numeration systems that generate a regular language. We also discuss the effectiveness of our method, and comment Hollander's results and conjecture in the light of ours."

    "abstract": "Refraction, traditionally viewed as a geometric event occurring at material interfaces, is now being re-examined through the lens of coherence. Recent studies in optics and photonics, including coherence tomography, Moire interference, and coherence-engineered diffraction, indicate that phase organization alone can bend light even without index discontinuities. Fraunhofer-based analyses further show that angular deflection can arise from intrinsic phase curvature within homogeneous media. Here we introduce a coherence-based constitutive framework that systematizes these observations: refraction can occur inside a bulk medium when coherence itself provides the effective boundary. Two near-frequency structured beams write and probe a shared phase field, revealing reproducible angular rotation and coherence-lensing whose direction and magnitude follow the spectral detuning. The key detuning coefficient is: Krc = 2 * pi * (1/lambda_r - 1/lambda_w). The compact coherence-refraction relation n2 * sin(theta_t) - n1 * sin(theta_i) = Krc_parallel / k0, with k0 = 2 * pi / lambda_r, retains the form of Snell's law while extending it to coherence-driven regimes. This is not a new law but a quantitative rule linking tangential phase matching to observable deflection within homogeneous media."

The new bound depends on a degree-$k$ polynomial which can be chosen freely, so one needs to make a good choice of the polynomial to obtain as strong a bound as possible. We thus propose linear programming methods to optimize it. We also investigate the implications of the new bound for the quantum distance chromatic number, showing that it is sharp for some classes of graphs. Finally, we extend the Hoffman bound to the distance setting of the vector chromatic number. Our results extend and unify several previous bounds in the literature."

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation requires a holistic understanding of the physical world, as it assigns semantic labels to spatially continuous and structurally coherent objects rather than to isolated pixels. However, existing data-free knowledge distillation (DFKD) methods-primarily designed for classification-often disregard this continuity, resulting in significant performance degradation when applied directly to segmentation tasks. In this paper, we introduce DFSS, a novel data-free distillation framework tailored for semantic segmentation. Unlike prior approaches that treat pixels independently, DFSS respects the structural and contextual continuity of real-world scenes. Our key insight is to leverage Batch Normalization (BN) statistics from a teacher model to guide Approximate Distribution Sampling (ADS), enabling the selection of data that better reflects the original training distribution-without relying on potentially misleading teacher predictions. Additionally, we propose Weighted Distribution Progressive Distillation (WDPD), which dynamically prioritizes reliable samples that are more closely aligned with the original data distribution early in training and gradually incorporates more challenging cases, mirroring the natural progression of learning in human perception. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that DFSS consistently outperforms existing data-free distillation methods for semantic segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results with significantly reduced reliance on auxiliary data."

This paper presents an iterative learning framework for automatic tuning of Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) weighting matrices based on task-level performance feedback. Inspired by norm-optimal Iterative Learning Control (ILC), the proposed method adaptively adjusts NMPC weights Q and R across task repetitions to minimize key performance indicators (KPIs) related to tracking accuracy, control effort, and saturation. Unlike gradient-based approaches that require differentiating through the NMPC solver, we construct an empirical sensitivity matrix, enabling structured weight updates without analytic derivatives. The framework is validated through simulation on a UR10e robot performing carbon fiber winding on a tetrahedral core. Results demonstrate that the proposed approach converges to near-optimal tracking performance (RMSE within 0.3% of offline Bayesian Optimization (BO)) in just 4 online repetitions, compared to 100 offline evaluations required by BO algorithm. The method offers a practical solution for adaptive NMPC tuning in repetitive robotic tasks, combining the precision of carefully optimized controllers with the flexibility of online adaptation."

Material reconstruction is highly underconstrained and typically relies on analysis-by-synthesis, which requires expensive and noisy path tracing. To better constrain the optimization, we incorporate single-view priors into the reconstruction process. We leverage a diffusion-based material estimator that produces multiple, but often inconsistent, candidate decompositions per view. To reduce the inconsistency, we fit an explicit low-dimensional parametric function to the predictions. We then propose a robust optimization framework using soft per-view prediction selection together with confidence-based soft multi-view inlier set to fuse the most consistent predictions of the most confident views into a consistent parametric material space. Finally, we use inverse path tracing to optimize for the low-dimensional parameters. Our results outperform state-of-the-art methods in material disentanglement on both synthetic and real scenes, producing sharp and clean reconstructions suitable for high-quality relighting."

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed significant advancements in machine learning methods on graphs. However, transferring knowledge effectively from one graph to another remains a critical challenge. This highlights the need for algorithms capable of applying information extracted from a source graph to an unlabeled target graph, a task known as unsupervised graph domain adaptation (GDA). One key difficulty in unsupervised GDA is conditional shift, which hinders transferability. In this paper, we show that conditional shift can be observed only if there exists local dependencies among node features. To support this claim, we perform a rigorous analysis and also further provide generalization bounds of GDA when dependent node features are modeled using markov chains. Guided by the theoretical findings, we propose to improve GDA by decorrelating node features, which can be specifically implemented through decorrelated GCN layers and graph transformer layers. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, showing not only substantial performance enhancements over baseline GDA methods but also clear visualizations of small intra-class distances in the learned representations.

We construct an unbiased estimator for the quantum state and establish both sufficient conditions and necessary conditions for informational completeness within a truncated Fock space up to $n_{\\mathrm{max}}$ photons. We further provide a comprehensive variance analysis, showing that the shadow norm scales as $\\mathcal{O}(n_{\\mathrm{max}}^4)$, improving upon previous $\\mathcal{O}(n_{\\mathrm{max}}^{13/3})$ bounds.

We first validate our method by successfully detecting artificially induced shortcut learning. We then apply it to probe the feature utilization of an SA-SonoNet model trained for Spontaneous Preterm Birth (sPTB) prediction. Our analysis confirmed that while the embeddings contain substantial metadata, the sPTB classifier's weight vectors were highly correlated with clinically relevant factors (e.g., birth weight) but decoupled from clinically irrelevant acquisition factors (e.g. scanner). Our methodology provides a tool to verify model trustworthiness, demonstrating that, in the absence of induced bias, the clinical model selectively utilizes features related to the genuine clinical signal."

Can AI understand what we cannot say? We investigate whether LLMs coherently represent abortion stigma across the cognitive, interpersonal, and structural levels where it operates. We systematically tested 627 demographically diverse personas across five leading LLMs using the validated Individual Level Abortion Stigma Scale (ILAS). Our multilevel analysis examined whether models coherently represent stigma at the cognitive level (self-judgment), interpersonal level (anticipated judgment and isolation), and structural level (community condemnation and disclosure patterns), as well as overall stigma. Models fail tests of genuine understanding across all levels. They overestimate interpersonal stigma while underestimating cognitive stigma, assume uniform community condemnation, introduce demographic biases absent from human validation data, miss the empirically validated stigma-secrecy relationship, and contradict themselves within theoretical constructs. These patterns reveal that current alignment approaches ensure appropriate language but not coherent multilevel understanding. This work provides empirical evidence that current LLMs lack coherent multilevel understanding of psychological and physiological constructs. AI safety in high-stakes contexts demands new approaches to design (multilevel coherence), evaluation (continuous auditing), governance and regulation (mandatory audits, accountability, deployment restrictions), and AI literacy in domains where understanding what people cannot say determines whether support helps or harms."

Here, we investigate effects of including nondipole terms in the light-matter coupling in simulations of HHG in materials with both topologically trivial and non-trivial phases. We show how the inclusion of nondipole terms breaks dipole selection rules, allowing for new polarizations of the generated light. Specifically we find that helicity, completely absent in the dipole approximation, is induced by the nondipole extension, and that this helicity is dependent on the topological phase of the material."

Here, we develop a quantum-classical hybrid artificial neural network (QANN) that extends this rule into a quantum-inspired formulation. Within this framework, the QANN maps compositional descriptors to quantum probability amplitudes, naturally introducing pairwise inter-element correlations inaccessible to classical heuristics. The physical validity of these correlations is substantiated by constructing an equivalent complex-valued neural network (CVNN), confirming both the consistency and interpretability of the formulation. Retaining the simplicity of chemical reasoning while embedding quantum-native features, our quantum-inspired rule enables efficient and generalizable topological classification. High-throughput screening combined with first-principles (DFT) validation reveals five previously unreported topological compounds, demonstrating the enhanced predictive power and physical insight afforded by quantum-inspired heuristics."

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has proven effective in training large reasoning models (LRMs) by leveraging answer-verifiable signals to guide policy optimization, which, however, suffers from high annotation costs. To alleviate this problem, recent work has explored unsupervised RLVR methods that derive rewards solely from the model's internal consistency, such as through entropy and majority voting. While seemingly promising, these methods often suffer from model collapse in the later stages of training, which may arise from the reinforcement of incorrect reasoning patterns in the absence of external supervision. In this work, we investigate a novel semi-supervised RLVR paradigm that utilizes a small labeled set to guide RLVR training on unlabeled samples. Our key insight is that supervised rewards are essential for stabilizing consistency-based training on unlabeled samples, ensuring that only reasoning patterns verified on labeled instances are incorporated into RL training. Technically, we propose an effective policy optimization algorithm, TraPO, that identifies reliable unlabeled samples by matching their learning trajectory similarity to labeled ones. Building on this, TraPO achieves remarkable data efficiency and strong generalization on six widely used mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME24/25, AMC, MATH-500, Minerva, and Olympiad) and three out-of-distribution tasks (ARC-c, GPQA-diamond, and MMLU-pro). With only 1K labeled and 3K unlabeled samples, TraPO reaches 42.6% average accuracy, surpassing the best unsupervised method trained on 45K unlabeled samples (38.3%). Notably, when using 4K labeled and 12K unlabeled samples, TraPO even outperforms the fully supervised model trained on the full 45K labeled samples on all benchmarks, while using only 10% of the labeled data.

Given a vector field \\(\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{x})\\) defining the system \\(\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{x}/\\mathrm{d}t = \\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{x})\\), the package performs a battery of computational tests -- Jacobian symmetry analysis, curl magnitude estimation, fixed point detection and stability classification, periodic orbit detection, and stable/unstable manifold computation -- to determine where the system sits within the classification hierarchy. This classification has direct implications for qualitative behaviour: gradient systems cannot oscillate, Morse-Smale systems are structurally stable in less than 3 dimensions, and general systems may exhibit chaos. Much of classical developmental theory going back to Waddington's epigenetic landscape rests on an implicit assumption of gradient dynamics. The package is designed with applications in systems and developmental biology in mind, particularly the analysis of gene regulatory networks and cell fate decision models in the context of Waddington's epigenetic landscape. It provides tools to assess whether a landscape metaphor is appropriate for a given dynamical model, and to quantify the magnitude of non-gradient (curl) dynamics."

    "abstract": "Accurate aerodynamic prediction often relies on high-fidelity simulations; however, their prohibitive computational costs severely limit their applicability in data-driven modeling. This limitation motivates the development of multi-fidelity strategies that leverage inexpensive low-fidelity information without compromising accuracy. Addressing this challenge, this work presents a multi-fidelity deep learning framework that combines autoencoder-based transfer learning with a newly developed Multi-Split Conformal Prediction (MSCP) strategy to achieve uncertainty-aware aerodynamic data fusion under extreme data scarcity. The methodology leverages abundant Low-Fidelity (LF) data to learn a compact latent physics representation, which acts as a frozen knowledge base for a decoder that is subsequently fine-tuned using scarce HF samples. Tested on surface-pressure distributions for NACA airfoils (2D) and a transonic wing (3D) databases, the model successfully corrects LF deviations and achieves high-accuracy pressure predictions using minimal HF training data. Furthermore, the MSCP framework produces robust, actionable uncertainty bands with pointwise coverage exceeding 95%. By combining extreme data efficiency with uncertainty quantification, this work offers a scalable and reliable solution for aerodynamic regression in data-scarce environments."

    "abstract": "Measuring collaborative problem solving (CPS) synergy remains challenging in learning analytics, as classical manual coding cannot capture emergent system-level dynamics. This study introduces a computational framework that integrates automated discourse analysis with the Synergy Degree Model (SDM) to quantify CPS synergy from group communication. Data were collected from 52 learners in 12 groups during a 5-week connectivist MOOC (cMOOC) activity. Nine classification models were applied to automatically identify ten CPS behaviors across four interaction levels: operation, wayfinding, sense-making, and creation. While BERT achieved the highest accuracy, GPT models demonstrated superior precision suitable for human-AI collaborative coding. Within the SDM framework, each interaction level was treated as a subsystem to compute group-level order parameters and derive synergy degrees. Permutation tests showed automated measures preserve construct validity, despite systematic biases at the subsystem level. Statistical analyses revealed significant task-type differences: survey study groups exhibited higher creation-order than mode study groups, suggesting \"controlled disorder\" may benefit complex problem solving. Importantly, synergy degree distinguished collaborative quality, ranging from excellent to failing groups. Findings establish synergy degree as a sensitive indicator of collaboration and demonstrate the feasibility of scaling fine-grained CPS analytics through AI-in-the-loop approaches."

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenges of low scheduling efficiency, unbalanced resource allocation, and poor adaptability in ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) processes under heterogeneous data environments by proposing an intelligent scheduling optimization framework based on deep Q-learning. The framework formalizes the ETL scheduling process as a Markov Decision Process and enables adaptive decision-making by a reinforcement learning agent in high-dimensional state spaces to dynamically optimize task allocation and resource scheduling. The model consists of a state representation module, a feature embedding network, a Q-value estimator, and a reward evaluation mechanism, which collectively consider task dependencies, node load states, and data flow characteristics to derive the optimal scheduling strategy in complex environments. A multi-objective reward function is designed to balance key performance indicators such as average scheduling delay, task completion rate, throughput, and resource utilization. Sensitivity experiments further verify the model's robustness under changes in hyperparameters, environmental dynamics, and data scale. Experimental results show that the proposed deep Q-learning scheduling framework significantly reduces scheduling delay, improves system throughput, and enhances execution stability under multi-source heterogeneous task conditions, demonstrating the strong potential of reinforcement learning in complex data scheduling and resource management, and providing an efficient and scalable optimization strategy for intelligent data pipeline construction."

    "abstract": "Effective science mapping relies on high-quality representations of scientific documents. As an important task in scientometrics and information studies, science mapping is often challenged by the complex and heterogeneous nature of citations. While previous studies have attempted to improve document representations by integrating citation and semantic information, the heterogeneity of citations is often overlooked. To address this problem, this study proposes a citation importance-aware contrastive learning framework that refines the supervisory signal. We first develop a scalable measurement of citation importance based on location, frequency, and self-citation characteristics. Citation importance is then integrated into the contrastive learning process through an importance-aware sampling strategy, which selects low-importance citations as hard negatives. This forces the model to learn finer-grained representations that distinguish between important and perfunctory citations. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we fine-tune a SciBERT model and perform extensive evaluations on SciDocs and PubMed benchmark datasets. Results show consistent improvements in both document representation quality and science mapping accuracy. Furthermore, we apply the trained model to over 33 million documents from Web of Science. The resulting map of science accurately visualizes the global and local intellectual structure of science and reveals interdisciplinary research fronts. By operationalizing citation heterogeneity into a scalable computational framework, this study demonstrates how differentiating citations by their importance can be effectively leveraged to improve document representation and science mapping."

Large Language Models (LLMs), in contrast, can produce human-readable explanations and facilitate feature analysis, potentially reducing the manual workload of fraud analysts and informing system refinements. However, they perform poorly when applied directly to tabular fraud detection due to the difficulty of reasoning over many features, the extreme class imbalance, and the absence of contextual information. To bridge this gap, we introduce FinFRE-RAG, a two-stage approach that applies importance-guided feature reduction to serialize a compact subset of numeric/categorical attributes into natural language and performs retrieval-augmented in-context learning over label-aware, instance-level exemplars. Across four public fraud datasets and three families of open-weight LLMs, FinFRE-RAG substantially improves F1/MCC over direct prompting and is competitive with strong tabular baselines in several settings. Although these LLMs still lag behind specialized classifiers, they narrow the performance gap and provide interpretable rationales, highlighting their value as assistive tools in fraud analysis."

Unlike conventional modulation schemes that operate in the time-frequency (TF) domain, OTFS projects signals to the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, where wireless channels exhibit sparse and quasi-static characteristics. This fundamental transformation enables superior channel estimation (CE) performance in challenging propagation environments characterized by high-mobility, severe multipath effects, and rapidly time-varying channel conditions. This article provides a systematic examination of CE techniques for OTFS systems, covering the extensive research landscape from foundational methods to cutting-edge approaches. We present a detailed analysis of DD and TF domain CE techniques presented in the literature, including separate pilot, embedded pilot, and superimposed pilot approaches. The article encompasses various algorithmic frameworks including Bayesian learning, matching pursuit-based techniques, message passing algorithms, deep learning (DL)-based methods, and recent CE approaches. Additionally, we explore joint CE and signal detection (SD) strategies, the integration of OTFS with next-generation wireless systems including massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), millimeter wave (mmWave) communications, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. Critical implementation challenges are presented, including leakage suppression, inter-Doppler interference mitigation, impulsive noise handling, signaling overhead reduction, guard space requirements, peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) management, beam squint effects, and hardware impairments."

In the training environment, the convolutional neural network long short term memory model achieved the highest accuracy, while traditional machine learning models provided moderate performance. In a new layout, however, all learning based methods showed significant degradation, whereas the rule-based method remained stable. Notably, for binary detection of presence versus absence of people, all models consistently achieved high accuracy across layouts. These results demonstrate that high capacity models can produce fine grained outputs with high accuracy in the same environment, but they are vulnerable to domain shift. In contrast, rule-based methods cannot provide fine grained outputs but exhibit robustness against domain shift. Moreover, regardless of the model type, a clear trade off was revealed between spatial generalization performance and output granularity."

    "abstract": "As a contribution towards the understanding for the field equations of diffeomorphism invariant theories of pure gravity, we demonstrate in great detail that the expression for the field equations of such theories can be derived within the perspective of the surface term coming from the variation of the Lagrangian. Specifically, starting with the surface term, we extract a symmetric rank-two tensor together with an anti-symmetric one out of this term with the variation operator replaced with the Lie derivative along an arbitrary vector field. By utilizing an equality stemming from the Lie derivative of the Lagrangian density along an arbitrary vector field, it is proved that the resulting symmetric rank-two tensor is identified with the functional derivative of the Lagrangian density with respect to the metric. Such a result further brings forth the expression for the field equations constructed from the symmetric rank-two tensor, which naturally rules out the derivative of the Lagrangian density with respect to the metric and coincides with the one for the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion. Furthermore, it is illustrated that the construction of the expression for the field equations from the symmetric rank-two tensor must be feasible as long as the variation operator in the variation equation of the Lagrangian is allowed to be substituted by the Lie derivative along an arbitrary vector field. On the other hand, as a byproduct, the anti-symmetric rank-two tensor turns out to be the Noether charge two-form. Our results offer a straightforward support on the proposal in our previous work that the surface term gives a unified description for field equations and Noether charges in the context of theories of gravity admitting diffeomorphism invariance symmetry."

    "abstract": "Given the inherently costly and time-intensive nature of pixel-level annotation, the generation of synthetic datasets comprising sufficiently diverse synthetic images paired with ground-truth pixel-level annotations has garnered increasing attention recently for training high-performance semantic segmentation models. However, existing methods necessitate to either predict pseudo annotations after image generation or generate images conditioned on manual annotation masks, which incurs image-annotation semantic inconsistency or scalability problem. To migrate both problems with one stone, we present a novel dataset generative diffusion framework for semantic segmentation, termed JoDiffusion. Firstly, given a standard latent diffusion model, JoDiffusion incorporates an independent annotation variational auto-encoder (VAE) network to map annotation masks into the latent space shared by images. Then, the diffusion model is tailored to capture the joint distribution of each image and its annotation mask conditioned on a text prompt. By doing these, JoDiffusion enables simultaneously generating paired images and semantically consistent annotation masks solely conditioned on text prompts, thereby demonstrating superior scalability. Additionally, a mask optimization strategy is developed to mitigate the annotation noise produced during generation. Experiments on Pascal VOC, COCO, and ADE20K datasets show that the annotated dataset generated by JoDiffusion yields substantial performance improvements in semantic segmentation compared to existing methods."

In this work, we introduce an object tracking method based on light field images that does not depend on a pre-trained model, while being robust to complex visual behavior, such as reflections. We extract semantic and geometric features from light field inputs using vision foundation models and convert them into view-dependent Gaussian splats. These splats serve as a unified object representation, supporting differentiable rendering and pose optimization. We further introduce a light field object tracking dataset containing challenging reflective objects with precise ground truth poses. Experiments demonstrate that our method is competitive with state-of-the-art model-based trackers in these difficult cases, paving the way toward universal object tracking in robotic systems.

Writing a sedenion as a pair of octonions (v1, v2), we compute the determinant of left multiplication by v and show that it factors as the fourth power of the norm times a quartic polynomial D2. The factor D2 vanishes precisely when v1 and v2 have the same norm and are orthogonal as vectors in R^8, giving a concrete polynomial criterion for nontrivial zero divisors. After normalizing by the norm, the zero divisor set becomes diffeomorphic to the Stiefel manifold V2(R^8) of orthonormal 2-frames, which we interpret as a \"zero divisor frame bundle\". On a suitable 3-dimensional linear slice, this set is modeled by a quadratic double cone, a structure we confirm by numerical experiments and 3-dimensional visualization. Finally, we approximate the Levi-Civita connection induced from the ambient Euclidean metric and compute parallel transport along a great-circle loop in V2(R^8); projecting the holonomy to a torus of base and fiber angles produces a curve of essentially (1,1) type. These results provide an explicit determinantal invariant and a concrete geometric picture of singular structures and holonomy in the zero divisor set of the sedenions."

    "abstract": "CLIP delivers strong zero-shot classification but remains highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Previous work of adversarial fine-tuning largely focuses on matching the predicted logits between clean and adversarial examples, which overlooks uncertainty calibration and may degrade the zero-shot generalization. A common expectation in reliable uncertainty estimation is that predictive uncertainty should increase as inputs become more difficult or shift away from the training distribution. However, we frequently observe the opposite in the adversarial setting: perturbations not only degrade accuracy but also suppress uncertainty, leading to severe miscalibration and unreliable over-confidence. This overlooked phenomenon highlights a critical reliability gap beyond robustness. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel adversarial fine-tuning objective for CLIP considering both prediction accuracy and uncertainty alignments. By reparameterizing the output of CLIP as the concentration parameter of a Dirichlet distribution, we propose a unified representation that captures relative semantic structure and the magnitude of predictive confidence. Our objective aligns these distributions holistically under perturbations, moving beyond single-logit anchoring and restoring calibrated uncertainty. Experiments on multiple zero-shot classification benchmarks demonstrate that our approach effectively restores calibrated uncertainty and achieves competitive adversarial robustness while maintaining clean accuracy."

The transformation yields a new process whose diffusion component has a square-root structure and whose drift becomes nonlinear. A critical reassessment of earlier studies using similar transformations reveals fundamental errors in model specification and derivations. To address this, we introduce a generalized Girsanov change of measure that adjusts the drift of the transformed process. Under the resulting equivalent measure, the dynamics reduce to the classical Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) model. Using the Yamada-Watanabe-Engelbert theorem, we establish existence, uniqueness, and positivity of solutions, and show that the combined transformation and measure change is valid only under specific parameter restrictions, including those most relevant for financial applications. The CIR representation allows us to exploit known results on stationary distributions, moments, and boundary behavior. Under an additional coefficient relationship, the process can be further linked to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck framework, yielding explicit distributional properties under the equivalent measure. Finally, since standard martingale conditions are not applicable, we prove directly that the associated Radon-Nikodym derivative is a true martingale by invoking a recent criterion based on Feller's explosion test and boundary classification."

We find that the [OII]3727/Hb ratio drops by a factor of five from z~3 to 8 at fixed M* and SFR, in contrast to the nearly constant [OIII]5007/Hb ratio. We derive metallicities via the direct Te method using the [OIII]4363 line, and identify that high-z galaxies lie on the low-metallicity end of the anti-correlation between ionization parameter and metallicity at z~0. Photoionization modeling demonstrates that the redshift evolution, where metallicity decreases and ionization parameter increases, self-consistently explains the observed line ratios. We then examine the mass-metallicity (MZ) and fundamental (MZ-SFR) relations. Including additional galaxies at z~10-12, we find that the MZ relation monotonically decreases from z~3 to 10 at fixed M*, while the MZ-SFR relation shows a significant decline at z>8. Based on the ChemicalUniverseMachine model, this evolutionary trend can be explained by enhanced gas inflow (outflow) by a factor of ~5 (~1.7) at z>8."

    "abstract": "While joint pruning--quantization is theoretically superior to sequential application, current joint methods rely on auxiliary procedures outside the training loop for finding compression parameters. This reliance adds engineering complexity and hyperparameter tuning, while also lacking a direct data-driven gradient signal, which might result in sub-optimal compression. In this paper, we introduce CoDeQ, a simple, fully differentiable method for joint pruning--quantization. Our approach builds on a key observation: the dead-zone of a scalar quantizer is equivalent to magnitude pruning, and can be used to induce sparsity directly within the quantization operator. Concretely, we parameterize the dead-zone width and learn it via backpropagation, alongside the quantization parameters. This design provides explicit control of sparsity, regularized by a single global hyperparameter, while decoupling sparsity selection from bit-width selection. The result is a method for Compression with Dead-zone Quantizer (CoDeQ) that supports both fixed-precision and mixed-precision quantization (controlled by an optional second hyperparameter). It simultaneously determines the sparsity pattern and quantization parameters in a single end-to-end optimization. Consequently, CoDeQ does not require any auxiliary procedures, making the method architecture-agnostic and straightforward to implement. On ImageNet with ResNet-18, CoDeQ reduces bit operations to ~5% while maintaining close to full precision accuracy in both fixed and mixed-precision regimes."

    "abstract": "With the advent of large language models (LLMs), the landscape of recommender systems is undergoing a significant transformation. Traditionally, user reviews have served as a critical source of rich, contextual information for enhancing recommendation quality. However, as LLMs demonstrate an unprecedented ability to understand and generate human-like text, this raises the question of whether explicit user reviews remain essential in the era of LLMs. In this paper, we provide a systematic investigation of the evolving role of text reviews in recommendation by comparing deep learning methods and LLM approaches. Particularly, we conduct extensive experiments on eight public datasets with LLMs and evaluate their performance in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning scenarios. We further introduce a benchmarking evaluation framework for review-aware recommender systems, RAREval, to comprehensively assess the contribution of textual reviews to the recommendation performance of review-aware recommender systems. Our framework examines various scenarios, including the removal of some or all textual reviews, random distortion, as well as recommendation performance in data sparsity and cold-start user settings. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs are capable of functioning as effective review-aware recommendation engines, generally outperforming traditional deep learning approaches, particularly in scenarios characterized by data sparsity and cold-start conditions. In addition, the removal of some or all textual reviews and random distortion does not necessarily lead to declines in recommendation accuracy. These findings motivate a rethinking of how user preference from text reviews can be more effectively leveraged.

This paper investigates the application of deep learning, specifically implicit neural representation (INR), to compress Cryo-EM biological data. The proposed approach first extracts the binary map of each file according to the density threshold. The density map is highly repetitive, ehich can be effectively compressed by GZIP. The neural network then trains to encode spatial density information, allowing the storage of network parameters and learnable latent vectors. To improve reconstruction accuracy, I further incorporate the positional encoding to enhance spatial representation and a weighted Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function to balance density distribution variations. Using this approach, my aim is to provide a practical and efficient biological data compression solution that can be used for educational and research purpose, while maintaining a reasonable compression ratio and reconstruction quality from file to file."

Moreover, locally-designed frequency support cannot minimize the overall system cost to maintain frequency stability. On the other hand, the concept of frequency-constrained system scheduling is introduced, which incorporates frequency dynamic constraints into the system economic optimization, so that frequency requirements can be maintained with minimum cost. However, these works rely on analytical approximations of the frequency dynamic metrics, which are mathematically complicated and tend to be over-conservative for the approximation of IBR headroom requirements."

We theoretically investigate the longitudinal diffusive magneto-conductivity of monolayer 1{\\it T}$^{\\prime}$-$\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$ by using the linear response theory. It is shown that the Weiss oscillations are polarized in spin and valley degrees of freedom, under uniform electric fields and a weak one-dimensional spatially-periodic electrostatic potential modulation. The spin polarization, the valley polarization and the spin-valley polarization can be switched by flipping the external electric fields. The polarization is found not only in the amplitudes but also in the periods of the Weiss oscillations. It is found that the period polarization in Weiss oscillations originates from the polarized effective Fermi energies or the polarized Landau level spacing scales. In Weiss oscillations, polarization in amplitude does not imply the presence of polarization in period, whereas polarization in period is accompanied by polarization in amplitude. The superposition of polarization in amplitude and polarization in period enables the appearance of considerable polarization in Weiss oscillations under relatively weak external electric fields."

By combining this FUSE-galaxy sample with literature collections, we find that H I absorbers exhibit a clear inverse correlation between Doppler width and column density over nearly five orders of magnitude in $N_{\\rm HI}$, from $N_{\\rm HI} \\approx 10^{13}\\rm~{cm^{-2}}$ to $N_{\\rm HI} \\approx 10^{18}\\rm~{cm^{-2}}$, while O VI absorption follows a positive correlation across $N_{\\rm OVI}\\approx 3\\times10^{13}$-$10^{15}\\rm~{cm^{-2}}$. We develop a model framework to interpret these contrasting trends and show that H I absorbers are best described as systems of approximately constant total column density ($N_{\\rm H}$), whereas O VI traces regions of roughly constant spatial density ($n_{\\rm H}$ and $n_{\\rm OVI}$). Under the latter scenario, the observed $b_{\\rm OVI}$-$N_{\\rm OVI}$ relation maps directly to a velocity-size relation consistent with a Kolmogorov-like turbulent spectrum. Together, these findings reveal a coherent physical picture in which H I and O VI trace a continuous turbulent cascade spanning more than five orders of magnitude in spatial scale-from cool, photoionized clumps to warm, highly ionized halo gas--with accretion in the halo outskirts likely driving the turbulent energy injection that sustains the multiphase CGM."

These techniques have demonstrated that constructing content-gnostic per-shot bitrate ladders can provide significant bitrate gains and improved Quality of Experience (QoE) for viewers under various network conditions. However, constructing a convex hull for every video incurs a significant computational overhead. Recently, machine learning-based bitrate ladder construction techniques have emerged as a substitute for convex hull construction. These methods operate by extracting features from source videos to train machine learning (ML) models to construct content-adaptive bitrate ladders. Here, we present a new ML-based bitrate ladder construction technique that accurately predicts the VMAF scores of compressed videos, by analyzing the compression procedure and by making perceptually relevant measurements on the source videos prior to compression. We evaluate the performance of our proposed framework against leading prior methods on a large corpus of videos. Since training ML models on every encoder setting is time-consuming, we also investigate how per-shot bitrate ladders perform under different encoding settings. We evaluate the performance of all models against the fixed bitrate ladder and the best possible convex hull constructed using exhaustive encoding with Bjontegaard-delta metrics."

We introduce a condition of operational robustness as a criterion for when an observable can be attributed an actual value in a given Bohmian state. The main result is a necessary and sufficient condition: under appropriate regularity conditions, an actual value can be consistently assigned if and only if the wave function satisfies a local eigencondition of the corresponding operator at the particle's configuration. For general states, we define a weak actual value as a derived theoretical construct to characterize the local average behavior of an observable along a trajectory. We prove that its ensemble average equals the standard quantum expectation value and derive its evolution equation. Furthermore, we establish that the weak actual value equals the real part of the quantum weak value when post-selecting on position. This work extends and formalizes earlier discussions on the definability of observables in Bohmian mechanics, develops a conceptual and mathematical framework for discussing the ontological status of observables, and establishes a theoretical correspondence with weak measurement experiments."

We present a diagnostic study using the Amazon Computers co-purchase data to understand when and why GCNs help. Through systematic experiments with simulated label scarcity, feature ablation, and per-class analysis, we find that GCN performance depends critically on the interaction between graph homophily and feature quality. GCNs provide the largest gains under extreme label scarcity, where they leverage neighborhood structure to compensate for limited supervision. Surprisingly, GCNs can match their original performance even when node features are replaced with random noise, suggesting that structure alone carries sufficient signal on highly homophilous graphs. However, GCNs hurt performance when homophily is low and features are already strong, as noisy neighbors corrupt good predictions. Our quadrant analysis reveals that GCNs help in three of four conditions and only hurt when low homophily meets strong features. These findings offer practical guidance for practitioners deciding whether to adopt graph-based methods."

Our approach is inspired by ControlNet, which we adapt to image-to-3D generation to enable text steering directly in a forward pass. We build a scalable data engine for automatic data generation, and develop a two-stage training recipe based on flow-matching training and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Compared to competing methods, Steer3D more faithfully follows the language instruction and maintains better consistency with the original 3D asset, while being 2.4x to 28.5x faster.

The agent is equipped with a Perceptive Zoomer (PZ) for localized fine-grained analysis and a Comparative Retriever (CR) for querying normal exemplars when evidence is ambiguous. To teach these inspection behaviors, we construct structured perceptive and comparative trajectories from the MMAD dataset and train the model in two stages: supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning. A two-part reward design drives this process: a perception reward that supervises classification accuracy, spatial alignment, and type correctness, and a behavior reward that encourages efficient tool use. Together, these components enable the model to refine its judgment through step-wise observation, zooming, and verification. AgentIAD achieves a new state-of-the-art 97.62% classification accuracy on MMAD, surpassing prior MLLM-based approaches while producing transparent and interpretable inspection traces."

Yet prior works have largely relied on standard temporal logic (TL), which models only robot trajectories and overlooks object-level interactions. Existing datasets built from randomly generated TL formulas paired with natural-language descriptions therefore cover temporal operators but fail to represent the layered spatial relations that manipulation tasks depend on. To address this gap, we introduce a dataset generation framework that synthesizes SpaTiaL specifications and converts them into natural-language descriptions through a deterministic, semantics-preserving back-translation procedure. This pipeline produces the NL2SpaTiaL dataset, aligning natural language with multi-level spatial relations and temporal objectives to reflect the compositional structure of manipulation tasks. Building on this foundation, we propose a translation-verification framework equipped with a language-based semantic checker that ensures the generated SpaTiaL formulas faithfully encode the semantics specified by the input description. Experiments across a suite of manipulation tasks show that SpaTiaL-based representations yield more interpretable, verifiable, and compositional grounding for instruction following.

    "abstract": "Forensic scientists often need to identify an unknown speaker or writer in cases such as ransom calls, covert recordings, alleged suicide notes, or anonymous online communications, among many others. Speaker recognition in the speech domain usually examines phonetic or acoustic properties of a voice, and these methods can be accurate and robust under certain conditions. However, if a speaker disguises their voice or employs text-to-speech software, vocal properties may no longer be reliable, leaving only their linguistic content available for analysis. Authorship attribution methods traditionally use syntactic, semantic, and related linguistic information to identify writers of written text (authorship attribution). In this paper, we apply a content-based authorship approach to speech that has been transcribed into text, using what a speaker says to attribute speech to individuals (speaker attribution). We introduce a stylometric method, StyloSpeaker, which incorporates character, word, token, sentence, and style features from the stylometric literature on authorship, to assess whether two transcripts were produced by the same speaker. We evaluate this method on two types of transcript formatting: one approximating prescriptive written text with capitalization and punctuation and another normalized style that removes these conventions. The transcripts' conversation topics are also controlled to varying degrees. We find generally higher attribution performance on normalized transcripts, except under the strongest topic control condition, in which overall performance is highest. Finally, we compare this more explainable stylometric model to black-box neural approaches on the same data and investigate which stylistic features most effectively distinguish speakers."

Although educational resources are burgeoning, educators face challenges selecting materials that both align with intended learning outcomes and address diverse learner needs.

We propose a framework that supports the cost-effective automation of evaluating alignment between educational resources and intended learning outcomes. Using human-generated materials, we benchmarked LLM-based text-embedding models and found that the most accurate model (Voyage) achieved 79% accuracy in detecting alignment. We then applied the optimal model to LLM-generated resources and, via expert evaluation, confirmed that it reliably assessed correspondence to intended outcomes (83% accuracy). Finally, in a three-group experiment with 360 learners, higher alignment scores were positively related to greater learning performance, chi-squared(2, N = 360) = 15.39, p < 0.001. These findings show that embedding-based alignment scores can facilitate scalable personalization by confirming alignment with learning outcomes, which allows teachers to focus on tailoring content to diverse learner needs."

The details of the evolution of this network and the associated spectrum of axions are crucial for obtaining an accurate axion mass prediction, thus guiding searches at haloscopes. In a previous publication, we obtained evidence for the standard scaling of axion string networks, showing that the number of horizon lengths of string per horizon volume asymptotes to an $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ constant. In this article, we turn our attention to the axion spectra, studying spectra of all components of the axion current and their unequal time correlators. With the new information we are better able to distinguish the contributions from propagating axions from the field carried by the strings, and show that previous measurements of the axion energy spectrum based only on the timelike component of the current are approximately 30\\% derived from the string fields. We introduce a simple model based on an ensemble of string segments, which accounts for the general features of the spectra and time correlations. We conclude that axion emission from a scaling string network is close to scale-invariant ($q \\approx 1$), and that the energy spectrum of sub-horizon modes behaves as $p_\\text{ax}\\ln( k τ)$, where $k$ is the comoving wavenumber, $τ$ the conformal time and $p_\\text{ax} \\simeq 10$. The number density spectrum evolves towards a single curve for $kτ\\lesssim 10^2$, with higher wavenumber deviations arising from initial conditions and resonant axion production at the string width scale. The total number density of axions produced from strings is $n_\\text{ax}=1.66(17) f_\\text{a}^2 H$, where $f_\\text{a}$ is the axion decay constant and $H$ the Hubble rate.

    "abstract": "Multiparameter quantum estimation becomes challenging when the parameters are incompatible, i.e., when their respective symmetric logarithmic derivatives do not commute, or when the model is sloppy, meaning that the quantum probe depends only on combinations of parameters leading to a degenerate or ill-conditioned Fisher information matrix. In this work, we explore the use of scrambling operations between parameter encoding to overcome sloppiness. We consider a bosonic model with two phase-shift parameters and analyze the performance of second- and third-order nonlinear scrambling using two classes of probe states: squeezed vacuum states and coherent states. Our results demonstrate that nonlinear scrambling mitigates sloppiness, increases compatibility, and improves overall estimation precision. We find third-order nonlinearity to be more effective than second-order under both fixed-probe and fixed-energy constraints. Furthermore, by comparing joint estimation to a stepwise estimation strategy, we show that a threshold for nonlinear coupling exists. For coherent probes, joint estimation outperforms the stepwise strategy if the nonlinearity is sufficiently large, while for squeezed probes, this advantage is observed specifically with third-order nonlinearity."

In addition to high-fidelity RGB images, we provide multiple complementary modalities, including depth, surface normals, object segmentation and optical flow, enabling a deeper understanding of scene geometry and motion. The dataset is organised into three distinct benchmarking scenarios: a dense multi-view camera setup, a sparse camera arrangement, and monocular video sequences, enabling a wide range of experimentation and comparison across varying levels of data sparsity.

    "abstract": "Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) paradigms in autonomous driving primarily rely on Imitation Learning (IL), which introduces inherent challenges such as distribution shift and causal confusion. Online Reinforcement Learning offers a promising pathway to address these issues through trial-and-error learning. However, applying online reinforcement learning to VLA models in autonomous driving is hindered by inefficient exploration in continuous action spaces. To overcome this limitation, we propose MindDrive, a VLA framework comprising a large language model (LLM) with two distinct sets of LoRA parameters. The one LLM serves as a Decision Expert for scenario reasoning and driving decision-making, while the other acts as an Action Expert that dynamically maps linguistic decisions into feasible trajectories. By feeding trajectory-level rewards back into the reasoning space, MindDrive enables trial-and-error learning over a finite set of discrete linguistic driving decisions, instead of operating directly in a continuous action space. This approach effectively balances optimal decision-making in complex scenarios, human-like driving behavior, and efficient exploration in online reinforcement learning. MindDrive achieves strong closed-loop performance on the challenging Bench2Drive benchmark, with a Driving Score (DS) of 78.04 and a Success Rate (SR) of 55.09%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate the effectiveness of online reinforcement learning for the VLA model in autonomous driving."

Existing parametric models struggle to distinguish complex, simultaneous disfluencies (e.g., a 'block' with a 'prolongation') due to the scarcity of these specific combinations in training data. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has revolutionized NLP by grounding models in external knowledge, this paradigm remains unexplored in pathological speech processing. To bridge this gap, we introduce StutterFuse, the first Retrieval-Augmented Classifier (RAC) for multi-label stuttering detection. By conditioning a Conformer encoder on a non-parametric memory bank of clinical examples, we allow the model to classify by reference rather than memorization. We further identify and solve \"Modality Collapse\", an \"Echo Chamber\" effect where naive retrieval boosts recall but degrades precision. We mitigate this using: (1) SetCon, a Jaccard-Weighted Metric Learning objective that optimizes for multi-label set similarity, and (2) a Gated Mixture-of-Experts fusion strategy that dynamically arbitrates between acoustic evidence and retrieved context. On the SEP-28k dataset, StutterFuse achieves a weighted F1-score of 0.65, outperforming strong baselines and demonstrating remarkable zero-shot cross-lingual generalization."

As a concrete example, we consider the anisotropic time-dependent Kondo model characterized by the time-dependent interaction strengths $J_{\\parallel}(t)$ and $J_{\\perp}(t)$. We construct an exact solution to the time-dependent Schrodinger equation and by applying appropriate boundary conditions on the fermion fields we obtain a set of matrix difference equations called the quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (qKZ) equations corresponding to the XXZ R-matrix. The consistency of these equations imposes constraints on the time-dependent interaction strengths $J_{\\parallel}(t)$ and $J_{\\perp}(t)$, such that the system is integrable. Remarkably, the resulting temporal trajectories of the couplings are shown to coincide exactly with the RG flow trajectories of the static Kondo model, establishing a direct and universal correspondence between integrability and renormalization-group flow in time-dependent quantum systems."

Various strategies like byte-level representations or calendar tokens have been proposed. However, the optimal approach remains unclear, especially given the diverse statistical distributions of real-world event data, which range from smooth log-normal to discrete, spiky patterns. This paper presents the first empirical study of temporal tokenization for event sequences, comparing distinct encoding strategies: naive numeric strings, high-precision byte-level representations, human-semantic calendar tokens, classic uniform binning, and adaptive residual scalar quantization. We evaluate these strategies by fine-tuning LLMs on real-world datasets that exemplify these diverse distributions. Our analysis reveals that no single strategy is universally superior; instead, prediction performance depends heavily on aligning the tokenizer with the data's statistical properties, with log-based strategies excelling on skewed distributions and human-centric formats proving robust for mixed modalities."

    "abstract": "This work introduces a hypergraph formulation that generalizes the classical paradigm of Bar-Yossef et al. to the multi-sender index coding (MSIC) setting. Central to the model is a 4-regular side-information hypergraph G, a new adjacency representation A_G = [A_1 ... A_N], and a simple fitting criterion for sub-hypergraph validity, in the presence of specially designed hyperedges that capture both side information and cross-sender signal cancellation. This formulation establishes a tight achievability-converse equivalence for the general N-sender, K-receiver problem: every valid fitting induces a valid linear multi-sender index code, every linear code induces a valid fitting, and the optimal scalar linear broadcast length equals the hyper-minrank l**lin(G) = hyperminrank(G) = min*{A fits G} sum_{n=1}^N rank(A_n). Beyond this exact characterization, the approach yields hypergraph analogues of Haemers-type bounds on the broadcast length, including a clique-cover upper bound and a lower bound via the clique number of a carefully defined complement hypergraph. Algorithmically, we provide an exact procedure to compute hyperminrank(G), and show that in certain regimes its complexity is asymptotically better than approximate LT-CMAR solutions. The framework captures well-known settings such as embedded index coding, and applies directly to multi-sender cache-aided communications, coded computation, distributed storage, and edge/satellite systems, where hyperminrank can serve as a unified design target."

Such variability complicates the RL infrastructure, slows training, and makes training curriculum (e.g., response length extension) and hyperparameter selection challenging. In this work, we propose cascaded domain-wise reinforcement learning (Cascade RL) to develop general-purpose reasoning models, Nemotron-Cascade, capable of operating in both instruct and deep thinking modes. Departing from conventional approaches that blend heterogeneous prompts from different domains, Cascade RL orchestrates sequential, domain-wise RL, reducing engineering complexity and delivering state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of benchmarks. Notably, RLHF for alignment, when used as a pre-step, boosts the model's reasoning ability far beyond mere preference optimization, and subsequent domain-wise RLVR stages rarely degrade the benchmark performance attained in earlier domains and may even improve it (see an illustration in Figure 1). Our 14B model, after RL, outperforms its SFT teacher, DeepSeek-R1-0528, on LiveCodeBench v5/v6/Pro and achieves silver-medal performance in the 2025 International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI).

A period of stable \"ordinary\" coronal heating ensues, before the concentrated fields are dissipated through interactions with the surrounding environment. The evolution of coronal abundances can be explained by the First Ionisation Potential (FIP) effect operating within this framework. We extend the discussion from magnetic activity on timescales of active region lifetimes (months), to the solar cycle (years), and stellar evolution (eons). The broad picture shows intriguing similarities that may prompt new investigations."

Using AC transport measurements to analyze the first-harmonic and second-harmonic resistance responses, we observe a distinct nonreciprocal second-harmonic signal that is significantly enhanced near the boundary of the normal and superconducting phases. Phenomenologically, this response arises from direction-dependent coupling between the external magnetic field and the current-induced intrinsic magnetization within the chiral lattice. Furthermore, a persistent nonreciprocal response observed under perpendicular magnetic fields suggests a toroidal-induced effect linked to the electric polarization emerging from the charge-density-wave phase. These results demonstrate that bulk Mo3Al2C serves as an intrinsic platform for tunable nonreciprocal transport rooted in the interplay of chirality, polarity, and superconductivity."

While masked diffusion models (MDMs) offer a parallel alternative, they suffer from critical drawbacks: high computational overhead from precluding Key-Value (KV) caching, and incoherent generation arising from learning dependencies over an intractable space of token combinations. To address these limitations, we introduce ReFusion, a novel masked diffusion model that achieves superior performance and efficiency by elevating parallel decoding from the token level to a higher slot level, where each slot is a fixed-length, contiguous sub-sequence. This is achieved through an iterative ``plan-and-infill'' decoding process: a diffusion-based planning step first identifies a set of weakly dependent slots, and an autoregressive infilling step then decodes these selected slots in parallel. The slot-based design simultaneously unlocks full KV cache reuse with a unified causal framework and reduces the learning complexity from the token combination space to a manageable slot-level permutation space. Extensive experiments on seven diverse benchmarks show that ReFusion not only overwhelmingly surpasses prior MDMs with 34% performance gains and an over 18$\\times$ speedup on average, but also bridges the performance gap to strong ARMs while maintaining a 2.33$\\times$ average speedup."

We investigate a degenerate modification of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric obtained through a coordinate transformation applied to the radial coordinate, analogous to recent approaches that address the Big Bang singularity via spacetime defects. The resulting metric, while formally satisfying the standard homogeneous Friedmann equations, actually describes an evolving wormhole geometry with two asymptotically flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker regions connected by a throat located at the coordinate singularity. Using Israel's junction formalism, we demonstrate that this coordinate singularity corresponds to a thin shell characterized by exotic matter with well-defined surface energy density and isotropic pressure. The shell obeys the barotropic equation of state $p = -ρ/2$, confirming the presence of exotic matter that violates the standard energy condition, which is a requirement for maintaining wormhole geometries. As the universe expands, this thin shell becomes increasingly diluted, scaling as $1/a(t)$ with the cosmic scale factor."

Unlike conventional optimization-based deep learning methods, we reformulate neural networks as index models and estimate $\\mathcal{S}_0$ using the second-order Stein's formula. This gradient-descent-free strategy guarantees feature selection consistency with a sample size requirement of $n = Ω(p^2)$, where $p$ is the feature dimension. To handle high-dimensional scenarios, we further introduce a screening-and-selection mechanism that achieves nonlinear selection consistency when $n = Ω(s \\log p)$, with $s$ representing the sparsity level.

A simple version of this problem is the detection of a signal of interest with unknown parameters in Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN). When the parameters defining the signal are not known, an optimal detector (in the Neyman-Pearson sense) does not exist. An upper bound on the performance of any detector is the matched filter, which implies perfect sample by sample knowledge of the signal of interest. In recent years Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have proven to be very effective at hypothesis testing problems such as object detection and image classification. This paper examines the application of DNN-based approaches to the signal detection problem at the raw I/Q level and compares them to statistically based approaches as well as the Matched Filter. These methods aim to maximize the Probability of Detection Pd while maintaining a constant Probability of False Alarm PF A. Two Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are trained and assessed on this signal detection problem, across three signal of interest models.

ADHD participants showed statistically significant but small increases in activation across several networks, including a gamma-dominant inferior temporal component showing a Group effect and a Group by Condition interaction with stronger NoGo-related activation in ADHD. Two additional components showed similar but weaker NoGo-selective patterns. A main effect of Task emerged only for one temporal delta component, with higher activation during the VCPT than the ECPT. No Group by Task interactions were observed. Behavioral results replicated the established ADHD performance profile, with slower responses, greater variability, and higher error rates, particularly during the emotional ECPT. Overall, the findings reveal subtle alterations in oscillatory brain networks during inhibitory processing in ADHD, with modest effect sizes embedded within substantial within-group variability. These results support a dimensional view of ADHD neurobiology and highlight the limited discriminative power of network-level EEG markers."

AEGD is notable for its unconditional energy stability, which guarantees monotonic energy decay and convergence independently of the initial step size. In this work, we propose the Generalized Energy-Based Adaptive Gradient (gAEGD) method, which extends AEGD by replacing the square-root energy with a broader class of admissible energy functions. We show that gAEGD preserves unconditional energy stability, remains robust to step-size selection, and exhibits a two-phase adaptive dynamic: the effective step size first adjusts automatically and then stabilizes within a regime that ensures decay of the objective function values. We establish an optimal convergence rate of $O(\\frac{1}{k})$ for attaining an $ε$-stationary point, and further derive improved convergence rates for the objective gap under a local Kurdyka-Łojasiewicz (KL) condition. Extensive numerical experiments corroborate our theoretical results and demonstrate that a particular instance of gAEGD-ALEGD, which employs a logarithmic energy function-often outperforms AEGD across a range of benchmark optimization problems."

In the positive recurrent case, return-time processes associated with non-periodic points converge to a standard Poisson process, while those for periodic points converge to a compound Poisson limit. In the null-recurrent regime, three distinct behaviors arise. Points satisfying certain combinatorial conditions (in particular, this class is generic in the measure-theoretic sense) exhibit fractional Poisson limits, whereas periodic points yield compound fractional Poisson limits. For all remaining points, we describe the full family of possible limit laws, each Pareto-dominated. This classification is sharp: every limit behavior in this family can be realized by an explicit system. For canonical families of null-recurrent CMS, we identify the limit process for every point, providing a complete description of return-time statistics in these systems."

The system integrates three key stages: an SPS classifier module, a SIR predictor, and a bank of specialized U-Net autoencoders designed for different interference conditions. The classification block identifies the parameters required for cancellation. The recommender then directs the signal to the appropriate mitigation model, optionally incorporating SIR-based decisions for scenarios where successive interference cancellation may be advantageous. Experiments conducted across diverse SIR levels and modulation environments show that the recommender strategy improves robustness and reduces BER compared to using any single mitigation method alone. The results demonstrate the potential of adaptive, model-selective architectures to enhance interference resilience in dynamic communication environments."

    "abstract": "Purpose: To develop DarkSPARC, a retrospective, training-free, self-calibrated spectral reconstruction method that converts routine bright-blood 3D left atrial (LA) late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) MRI into a dark-blood image, and to quantify its impact on LA scar-pool CNR, SNR, effective CNR (eCNR), and scar quantification accuracy. Methods: DarkSPARC embeds bright-blood LA LGE into a calibrator-conditioned (N+1)-dimensional spectral domain and reconstructs a dark-blood-like image using scan-specific spectral landmarks. A scan-specific 3D numerical phantom framework was built from LAScarQS post-ablation LGE by cloning remote myocardium into the LA wall and imposing controlled scar burden. Five baseline cases spanning the 5th-95th percentiles of native scar-pool CNR, each with multiple scar burdens and 10 CNR degradation levels, yielded 200 phantoms. For every phantom, LA scar-pool CNR, SNR, eCNR, and Scar% were measured on bright-blood and DarkSPARC images. In vivo performance was evaluated in 60 public post-ablation scans of atrial fibrillation patients. Results: In scan-specific phantoms, DarkSPARC increased LA scar-pool CNR, SNR, and eCNR over bright-blood in all 200 experiments, with DarkSPARC/bright-blood ratios up to about 30-fold for CNR and about 6-fold for SNR in the lowest-CNR conditions. At 70% CNR degradation, bright-blood underestimated ground-truth LA Scar% by -37% to -54%, whereas DarkSPARC reduced bias to about -3% to -5%. In vivo, DarkSPARC similarly improved metrics: median scar-pool CNR, SNR, and eCNR increased from 20.0 to 135.9 (6.8x), 70.6 to 200.6 (2.8x), and 0.22 to 0.75 (3.4x), respectively (all p<0.001), and LA Scar% increased from 3.9% to 9.75%. Conclusion: DarkSPARC is a self-calibrated, training-free reconstruction that yields dark-blood 3D LA LGE, boosting CNR/SNR/eCNR and stabilizing reliable scar quantification without extra scans."

Such agents could intentionally sabotage these codebases if they were misaligned. We investigate asynchronous monitoring, in which a monitoring system reviews agent actions after the fact. Unlike synchronous monitoring, this approach does not impose runtime latency, while still attempting to disrupt attacks before irreversible harm occurs. We treat monitor development as an adversarial game between a blue team (who design monitors) and a red team (who create sabotaging agents). We attempt to set the game rules such that they upper bound the sabotage potential of an agent based on Claude 4.1 Opus. To ground this game in a realistic, high-stakes deployment scenario, we develop a suite of 5 diverse software engineering environments that simulate tasks that an agent might perform within an AI developer's internal infrastructure. Over the course of the game, we develop an ensemble monitor that achieves a 6% false negative rate at 1% false positive rate on a held out test environment. Then, we estimate risk of sabotage at deployment time by extrapolating from our monitor's false negative rate. We describe one simple model for this extrapolation, present a sensitivity analysis, and describe situations in which the model would be invalid.

    "abstract": "Much of software engineering (SE) research assumes that progress depends on massive datasets and CPU-intensive optimizers. Yet has this assumption been rigorously tested? The counter-evidence presented in this paper suggests otherwise: across dozens of optimization problems from recent SE literature, including software configuration and performance tuning, cloud and systems optimization, project and process-level decision modeling, behavioral analytics, financial risk modeling, project health prediction, reinforcement learning tasks, sales forecasting, and software testing, even with just a few dozen labels, very simple methods (e.g. diversity sampling, a minimal Bayesian learner, or random probes) achieve near 90% of the best reported results. Further, these simple methods perform just as well as more state-of-the-the-art optimizers like SMAC, TPE, DEHB etc. While some tasks would require better outcomes and more sampling, these results seen after a few dozen samples would suffice for many engineering needs (particularly when the goal is rapid and cost-efficient guidance rather than slow and exhaustive optimization). Our results highlight that some SE tasks may be better served by lightweight approaches that demand fewer labels and far less computation. We hence propose the data-light challenge: when will a handful of labels suffice for SE tasks? To enable a large-scale investigation of this issue, we contribute (1) a mathematical formalization of labeling, (2) lightweight baseline algorithms, and (3) results on public-domain data showing the conditions under which lightweight methods excel or fail.

Coherence between the internal states of a quantum emitter, or among multiple emitters, plays a key role. Such continuous nonclassical sources of light can find applications in quantum computation, quantum sensing, quantum metrology, and quantum communication. This thesis explores the multi-photon lasing phenomena in various quantum dot-photonic crystal cavity quantum electrodynamic (QED) setups. Exciton-phonon interactions are inevitable in such systems and are incorporated using the polaron-transformed master equation. The Born-Markov approximation is employed to obtain the reduced density matrix rate equation. Using quantum laser theory, we derived the Scully-Lamb laser rate equations and evaluated the single- and multi-photon excess emission rates defined as the difference between emission and absorption rates into the cavity mode without mean-field approximations. We investigated cooperative two-photon lasing, correlated emission lasing, hyperradiant lasing, non-degenerate two-mode two-photon lasing, and continuous variable entanglement in open quantum systems with single or multiple semiconductor quantum dots (two-level, three-level, and four-level) driven coherently/incoherently and coupled to single/ bimodal cavities."

In this paper, we develop a rigorous harmonic analysis framework for directed graphs centered on the \\emph{Combinatorial Directed Laplacian} ($L = D_{out} - A$). We construct a \\emph{Biorthogonal Graph Fourier Transform} (BGFT) using dual left and right eigenbases, and introduce a directed variational semi-norm based on the operator norm $\\|Lx\\|_2$ rather than the quadratic form. We derive exact Parseval-type bounds that quantify the energy distortion induced by the non-normality of the graph, explicitly linking signal reconstruction stability to the condition number of the eigenvector matrix, $κ(V)$. Finally, we present experimental validation comparing normal directed cycles against non-normal perturbed topologies, demonstrating that while the BGFT provides exact reconstruction in ideal regimes, the geometric departure from normality acts as the fundamental limit on filter stability in directed networks."

While existing results have been limited to linear systems, this paper extends the OOG framework to nonlinear NCSs with quadratically constrained nonlinearities, considering false-injection attacks that can also manipulate sensor measurements through nonlinear transformations. Specifically, we provide computationally efficient linear matrix inequality conditions and complementary frequency-domain tests that yield explicit upper bounds on the OOG of this class of nonlinear systems.

We begin by proving a general inequality for spin correlations under the assumption of Gaussian domination, which directly implies long-range order at low temperatures for graphs with bounded Green's function. Usually, Gaussian domination is proved via reflection positivity, but this requires strict symmetries and is very rigid. In this article we also probe the boundaries of elementary methods for proving Gaussian domination. Although we did not find a way to get uniform bounds, we do offer new views for Gaussian domination at low and high temperatures for finite graphs, and a few counterexamples illustrating the interplay between correlation estimates and Gaussian domination and how local changes in the graph structure can affect the presence of Gaussian domination."

A source generates time-stamped update packets that are processed by a server that delivers them to a monitor. An adversary, who eavesdrops on the server-monitor link, wishes to infer the timing of the underlying source update sequence. The server must balance the timeliness of the status information at the monitor against the timing information leaked to the adversary. We consider a model with Bernoulli source updates under two classes of Last-Come-First-Served (LCFS) service policies: (1) Coupled policies that tie the server's deliveries to the update arrival process in a preemptive queue; (2) Decoupled (dumping) policies in which the server transmits its freshest update according to a schedule that is independent of the update arrivals. For each class, we characterize the structure of the optimal policy that minimizes AoI for a given MaxL rate. Our analysis reveals that decoupled dumping policies offer a superior age-leakage trade-off to coupled policies. When subject to a MaxL constraint, we prove that the optimal dumping strategy is achieved by dithering between two adjacent deterministic dump periods."

Within collinear spin configurations, we find that Fe-based systems predominantly adopt antiferromagnetic ground states, whereas Mn-based analogues exhibit a more balanced distribution between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic order. For compounds exhibiting several nearly degenerate collinear configurations, we analyze the nature of their magnetic ground states, assess the possible emergence of non-collinear order, and discuss the limitations and uncertainties inherent to standard density-functional approaches. Our electronic-structure analysis further reveals that newly predicted ferromagnetic kagome systems display characteristic features of topological metals, with rich magnetic configurations that can be tuned by chemical substitution. Overall, these ferromagnetic kagome compounds constitute a broad and still largely unexplored materials platform for the emergence of exciting magneto-transport phenomena."

Despite prior work showing that PCI DSS can reduce card fraud, only 32.4% of organizations were fully compliant in 2022, suggesting possible deficiencies in enforcement mechanisms. This study compares PCI DSS with three data security frameworks, HIPAA, NIS2, and GDPR, to examine how enforcement mechanisms relate to implementation success. The analysis reveals that PCI DSS significantly lags far behind these security frameworks and that its sanctions are orders of magnitude smaller than those under GDPR and NIS2. The findings indicate a positive association between stronger, multi-modal enforcement (including public disclosure, license actions, and imprisonment) and higher implementation rates, and highlights the structural weakness of PCI DSS's bank-dependent monitoring model. Enhanced non-monetary sanctions and the creation of an independent supervisory authority are recommended to increase transparency, reduce conflicts of interest, and improve PCI DSS compliance without discouraging card acceptance."

    "abstract": "Magnetic fields are found in many astrophysical objects, ranging from galaxy clusters to the interstellar medium of galaxies and magnetars. Strong magnetic fields are also observed in massive stars, but it is still unclear how they are generated. There are different theories for their origin: the magnetic fields could be fossil fields from star formation, they could be generated in dynamo processes during stellar evolution, or they could be generated during a merger of two stars. Here, we show how magnetic fields are generated in simulations of mergers of massive main-sequence stars, conducted with the 3D magnetohydrodynamics code AREPO. In these simulations, a $9\\,M_\\odot$ and a $8\\,M_\\odot$ main sequence star merge, whereby the more massive star transfers mass to the less massive one until it is finally disrupted, forming a core--disk structure. During the initial mass transfer, magnetic fields start to be amplified in the accretion stream, saturating after the disruption at an equipartition level. Correspondingly, the magnetic energy starts being present at small scales, growing to larger scales during the merger. During the merger, the magnetic pressure is much smaller than the gas pressure, thus the dynamical impact of the magnetic fields on the merger is small. After the merger, both are similar in some regions and the magnetic field shows a large-scale structure that is mostly toroidal and that is expected to be stable. Thus, our simulations show that magnetic fields in massive stars can originate from a merger of two main sequence stars."

    "abstract": "Visual tokenizers play a crucial role in diffusion models. The dimensionality of latent space governs both reconstruction fidelity and the semantic expressiveness of the latent feature. However, a fundamental trade-off is inherent between dimensionality and generation quality, constraining existing methods to low-dimensional latent spaces. Although recent works have leveraged vision foundation models to enrich the semantics of visual tokenizers and accelerate convergence, high-dimensional tokenizers still underperform their low-dimensional counterparts. In this work, we propose RecTok, which overcomes the limitations of high-dimensional visual tokenizers through two key innovations: flow semantic distillation and reconstruction--alignment distillation. Our key insight is to make the forward flow in flow matching semantically rich, which serves as the training space of diffusion transformers, rather than focusing on the latent space as in previous works. Specifically, our method distills the semantic information in VFMs into the forward flow trajectories in flow matching. And we further enhance the semantics by introducing a masked feature reconstruction loss. Our RecTok achieves superior image reconstruction, generation quality, and discriminative performance. It achieves state-of-the-art results on the gFID-50K under both with and without classifier-free guidance settings, while maintaining a semantically rich latent space structure. Furthermore, as the latent dimensionality increases, we observe consistent improvements. Code and model are available at https://shi-qingyu.github.io/rectok.github.io."

In this work we focus on the heat equation on a finite interval and we determine the dimensionless diffusion parameter from a single measurement. Our results extend to estimating additional parameters of the initial-boundary value problem, such as the length of the interval and/or the time required for the solution to achieve a specific state. Our approach relies on the asymptotic solution of an integral equation: The formulation of this integral equation is based on the solution of the direct problem via the Fokas method; the solution of this equation is achieved through the asymptotic evaluation of the associated integrals which yield an effective approximate solution, supported by numerical verifications. We apply these approximations to well-established problems in soil science and we compare our results with existing ones, displaying clear improvement."

    "abstract": "Continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) requires precise spatio-temporal modeling to accurately recognize sequences of gestures in videos. Existing frameworks often rely on CNN-based spatial backbones combined with temporal convolution or recurrent modules. These techniques fail in capturing fine-grained hand and facial cues and modeling long-range temporal dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose the Unified Spatio-Temporal Modeling (USTM) framework, a spatio-temporal encoder that effectively models complex patterns using a combination of a Swin Transformer backbone enhanced with lightweight temporal adapter with positional embeddings (TAPE). Our framework captures fine-grained spatial features alongside short and long-term temporal context, enabling robust sign language recognition from RGB videos without relying on multi-stream inputs or auxiliary modalities. Extensive experiments on benchmarked datasets including PHOENIX14, PHOENIX14T, and CSL-Daily demonstrate that USTM achieves state-of-the-art performance against RGB-based as well as multi-modal CSLR approaches, while maintaining competitive performance against multi-stream approaches. These results highlight the strength and efficacy of the USTM framework for CSLR. The code is available at https://github.com/gufranSabri/USTM"

    "abstract": "Negative magnetoresistance in conventional two-dimensional electron gases is a well-known phenomenon, but its origin in complex and topological materials, especially those endowed with quantum geometry, remains largely elusive. Here, we report the discovery of a giant negative magnetoresistance, reaching a remarkable $- 90\\%$ of the resistance at zero magnetic field, $R_0$, in $n$-type tellurene films. This record-breaking effect persists over a wide magnetic field range (measured up to $35$ T) at cryogenic temperatures and is suppressed when the chemical potential shifts away from the Weyl node in the conduction band, strongly suggesting a quantum geometric origin. We propose two novel mechanisms for this phenomenon: a quantum geometric enhancement of diffusion and a magnetoelectric spin interaction that locks the spin of a Weyl fermion, in cyclotron motion under crossed electric $\\boldsymbol{\\cal E}$ and magnetic ${\\bf B}$ fields, to its guiding-center drift, $(\\boldsymbol{\\cal E}\\times{\\bf B})\\cdotσ$. We show that the time integral of the velocity auto-correlations promoted by the quantum metric between the spin-split conduction bands enhance diffusion, thereby reducing the resistance. This mechanism is experimentally confirmed by its unique magnetoelectric dependence, $ΔR_{zz}(\\boldsymbol{\\cal E},{\\bf B})/R_0=-β_{g}(\\boldsymbol{\\cal E}\\times{\\bf B})^2$, with $β_{g}$ determined by the quantum metric. Our findings establish a new, quantum geometric and non-Markovian memory effect in magnetotransport, paving the way for controlling electronic transport in complex and topological matter."

For Chipclass, a hyperparameter-less and optimization-less GG-based binary classifier, we discuss how activation functions and support edge (SE)-centered neurons affect the classification, proposing smoother functions and structural SV (SSV)-centered neurons to achieve margins with low probabilities and smoother classification contours. We extend the neural network architecture, which can be trained with backpropagation with a softmax function and a cross-entropy loss, or by solving a system of linear equations. A new subgraph-/distance-based membership function for graph regularization is also proposed, along with a new GG recomputation algorithm that is less computationally expensive than the standard approach. Experimental results with the Friedman test show that our method was better than previous GG-based classifiers and statistically equivalent to tree-based models."

We show that the number of steps of the corresponding Riemannian gradient descent (RGD) algorithm that prepares a ground state to a given precision depends on the structure of the Hamiltonian. Specifically, we develop an upper bound for the number of RGD steps that depends on the spectral gap of the Hamiltonian, the overlap between ground and initial state, and the target precision. In numerical experiments we study examples where we observe for a 1D Ising chain with nearest-neighbor interactions that the RGD steps needed to prepare a ground state scales linearly with the number of spins. For all-to-all couplings a quadratic scaling is obtained. To achieve efficient implementations while keeping convergence guarantees, we develop RGD approximations by randomly projecting the Riemannian gradient into polynomial-sized subspaces. We find that the speed of convergence of the randomly projected RGD critically depends on the size of the subspace the gradient is projected into. Finally, we develop efficient quantum device implementations based on Trotterization and a quantum stochastic drift-inspired protocol. We implement the resulting quantum algorithms on IBM's quantum devices and provide data for small-scale problems."

However, high computational demands, complex incentive mechanisms, and disparities in client-side computing power often lead to long times and higher costs. To address these challenges, many existing methods rely on server-side knowledge distillation that solely removes the updates of the target client, overlooking the privacy embedded in the contributions of other clients, which can lead to privacy leakage. In this work, we introduce DPUL, a novel server-side unlearning method that deeply unlearns all influential weights to prevent privacy pitfalls. Our approach comprises three components: (i) identifying high-weight parameters by filtering client update magnitudes, and rolling them back to ensure deep removal. (ii) leveraging the variational autoencoder (VAE) to reconstruct and eliminate low-weight parameters. (iii) utilizing a projection-based technique to recover the model. Experimental results on four datasets demonstrate that DPUL surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, providing a 1%-5% improvement in accuracy and up to 12x reduction in time cost."

However, as user interaction histories increase, computational time and memory requirements also grow. This is mainly caused by the standard attention mechanism. Although there exist many methods employing efficient attention and SSM-based models, these approaches struggle to effectively model long sequences and may exhibit unstable performance on short sequences. To address these challenges, we design a sparse attention mechanism, BlossomRec, which models both long-term and short-term user interests through attention computation to achieve stable performance across sequences of varying lengths. Specifically, we categorize user interests in recommendation systems into long-term and short-term interests, and compute them using two distinct sparse attention patterns, with the results combined through a learnable gated output. Theoretically, it significantly reduces the number of interactions participating in attention computation. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that BlossomRec, when integrated with state-of-the-art Transformer-based models, achieves comparable or even superior performance while significantly reducing memory usage, providing strong evidence of BlossomRec's efficiency and effectiveness.The code is available at https://github.com/ronineume/BlossomRec."

    "abstract": "Controlling the crystal phase and lattice mismatch of semiconductors offers a powerful route to engineer electronic and optical properties of heterostructures. As a consequence, semiconductors in the wurtzite phase are increasingly sought after, superseding the thermodynamically favored cubic zinc blende phase. Empirical atomistic modeling, required for large scale simulations of heterostructures and their properties, relies heavily on valence force field (VFF) methods to find the equilibrium atomic positions in an alloy. For zinc blende crystals, VFF models are well-established. In the case of wurtzite, such parameters are frequently adopted without rigorous analysis, despite subtle but consequential differences from the zinc blende structure. Such an approach can compromise accuracy in describing material properties, since the structural differences between zinc blende and wurtzite directly influence electronic and optical characteristics. Based on the analytical VFF model by Tanner et al., and using structural similarities between wurtzite and [111]-oriented zinc blende, we construct a wurtzite VFF without introducing additional parameters. Our framework relies on analytic expressions and minimization routines to project zinc blende models onto wurtzite systems. Beyond elastic tensors, we train the model to reproduce bond length asymmetries and band gaps by using output of the VFF model in density functional theory calculations. Applied to wurtzite III-N compounds and BN, the model accurately reproduces targeted observables but also properties it has not been trained on, including the internal parameter u. We further validate the model on highly mismatched alloys such as (B,Ga)N and (B,In,Ga)N, exhibiting good agreement between VFF and density functional theory results when using identical supercells in these calculations."

In the DC limit, the transverse spin conductivity quantizes to $σ^{xy}=α^2\\text{sgn}(m)\\hbar/4π$, a magnonic analog of the quantum Hall effect, where $m$ is the topological magnon mass and $α$ a dimensionless coupling constant. In the AC regime, the conductivity exhibits a sharp resonance when the drive frequency matches the topological gap $Δ$, signaling interband transitions. Our work establishes gauge fields as a versatile tool for controlling magnon transport and reveals topologically protected quantized responses."

Using this benchmark, we conduct the first systematic study of LLMs and propose a hierarchical evaluation protocol that assesses actor correctness, name accuracy, path fidelity, and behavioral coverage. The results show that while LLMs can partially reconstruct system functionality, their performance varies significantly across projects, with particularly noticeable shortcomings in domain-specific and multi-module systems. The models also exhibit high omission rates and struggle to maintain consistent abstraction when aggregating subfunctions into user-goal use cases, highlighting both the potential and current limitations of LLM-based use case reverse engineering."

We consider a sample of several wormhole solutions and plasma distributions for which the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the light rays is separable. This allows us to derive analytical expressions for the shadow boundary and examine the behavior of the photon regions as the plasma frequency varies. We observe that plasma profiles which depend only on radial coordinate lead to common evolution of the photon region which does not depend on the wormhole metric and is consistent with the Kerr black hole. For plasma profiles with angular dependence the evolution of the photon region is specific for every spacetime thus wormholes are observationally distinguishable. We further investigate the formation of forbidden regions in the plasma medium where light cannot propagate. They lead to the formation of plasma frequency ranges where the shadow is no longer observable and we show that this phenomenon is characteristic for all the configurations in our sample. We obtain the critical frequencies for which the shadow vanishes and demonstrate that for all the wormholes they are lower than the critical frequencies for the Kerr black hole in the same environment. This implies that there exist plasma frequency ranges in which the Kerr black hole casts a shadow but wormholes do not, creating a strong observational signature for discriminating between compact objects. In the frequency ranges where both black hole and wormhole shadows exist the wormhole shadows are consistently smaller than those for the Kerr black hole. As the plasma frequency grows the discrepancy progresses showing that plasma medium facilitates the experimental detection of wormholes. Finally we consider aberrational effects on the wormhole shadows. They further increase the deviation from black holes making wormholes easier to detect."

Through a systematic evaluation of a leading SLM (Qwen3 4B), we find that while the base model exhibits fundamental limitations in arithmetic tasks, our proposed error-driven method, which clusters erroneous predictions to refine prompt-rules iteratively, dramatically improves performance, elevating the model's accuracy to 70.8\\%. Our results suggest that developing reliable, interpretable, and industrially deployable AI assistants can be achieved not only through costly fine-tuning but also via systematic, error-driven prompt optimization, enabling small models to surpass larger language models (GPT-3.5 Turbo) in a privacy-compliant manner."

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) magnetic nanostructures offer unprecedented opportunities for engineering emergent spin textures, but controlling their configuration remains a central challenge. Here we show that conformally coated Ni Nanotubes arranged in a woodpile geometry with lattice spacings ranging from 800 to 1200 nm, realised by two-photon lithography and atomic layer deposition, exhibit a geometry-tuneable balance between chiral and axial states. Magnetic force microscopy on the top layer of the 3D woodpile reveals that few-layer systems exhibit a chiral contrast whilst increasing the number of stacked layers drives a transition to an axial configuration with the change in state populations depending strongly on lattice spacing. Micromagnetic simulations demonstrate that chirality is not intrinsic to isolated tubes but is imprinted by spin textures formed in the substrate sheet film, which couple into the 3D network. As the sheet-film influence diminishes with increasing layer number, dipolar interactions dominate and stabilise the axial state. This two-stage mechanism of chirality imprinting followed by increasingly dominant dipolar interactions, provides clear control parameters for tailoring spin-texture populations. Our results establish conformally coated woodpiles as a reconfigurable 3D ferromagnetic metamaterial platform that can be exploited for data storage, magnonics, and neuromorphic computing."

    "abstract": "Avatar video generation models have achieved remarkable progress in recent years. However, prior work exhibits limited efficiency in generating long-duration high-resolution videos, suffering from temporal drifting, quality degradation, and weak prompt following as video length increases. To address these challenges, we propose KlingAvatar 2.0, a spatio-temporal cascade framework that performs upscaling in both spatial resolution and temporal dimension. The framework first generates low-resolution blueprint video keyframes that capture global semantics and motion, and then refines them into high-resolution, temporally coherent sub-clips using a first-last frame strategy, while retaining smooth temporal transitions in long-form videos. To enhance cross-modal instruction fusion and alignment in extended videos, we introduce a Co-Reasoning Director composed of three modality-specific large language model (LLM) experts. These experts reason about modality priorities and infer underlying user intent, converting inputs into detailed storylines through multi-turn dialogue. A Negative Director further refines negative prompts to improve instruction alignment. Building on these components, we extend the framework to support ID-specific multi-character control. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model effectively addresses the challenges of efficient, multimodally aligned long-form high-resolution video generation, delivering enhanced visual clarity, realistic lip-teeth rendering with accurate lip synchronization, strong identity preservation, and coherent multimodal instruction following."

To address this challenge, we propose ShowTable, a pipeline that synergizes MLLMs with diffusion models via a progressive self-correcting process. The MLLM acts as the central orchestrator for reasoning the visual plan and judging visual errors to provide refined instructions, the diffusion execute the commands from MLLM, achieving high-fidelity results. To support this task and our pipeline, we introduce three automated data construction pipelines for training different modules. Furthermore, we introduce TableVisBench, a new benchmark with 800 challenging instances across 5 evaluation dimensions, to assess performance on this task. Experiments demonstrate that our pipeline, instantiated with different models, significantly outperforms baselines, highlighting its effective multi-modal reasoning, generation, and error correction capabilities."

However, there is currently a lack of high-quality datasets specifically designed to evaluate the ability of large multi-modal models (LMMs) to discover medical insights. In this paper, we introduce MedInsightBench, the first benchmark that comprises 332 carefully curated medical cases, each annotated with thoughtfully designed insights. This benchmark is intended to evaluate the ability of LMMs and agent frameworks to analyze multi-modal medical image data, including posing relevant questions, interpreting complex findings, and synthesizing actionable insights and recommendations. Our analysis indicates that existing LMMs exhibit limited performance on MedInsightBench, which is primarily attributed to their challenges in extracting multi-step, deep insights and the absence of medical expertise. Therefore, we propose MedInsightAgent, an automated agent framework for medical data analysis, composed of three modules: Visual Root Finder, Analytical Insight Agent, and Follow-up Question Composer. Experiments on MedInsightBench highlight pervasive challenges and demonstrate that MedInsightAgent can improve the performance of general LMMs in medical data insight discovery."

    "abstract": "Moving groups are routinely faced with a choice of different routes as part of their daily lives, such as choosing between exits from a building. Differences in moving speeds and environmental constraints often lead to individuals being able to observe the choices of others ahead. This social information can inform their decision-making, but exactly how this is being used remains an open question. Previous theoretical studies on animal groups have demonstrated that simple heuristics are plausible and accurate mechanisms, with some further predicting that more recent decisions are more heavily weighted. Experiments with fish corroborate the importance of more recent decisions; however, experimental work is limited. Here, we conduct an online survey with human participants to identify which social decision-making mechanism individuals follow. Contrary to previous experimental work, we find little indication that recent decisions are weighted more heavily; instead, our results suggest that following the majority of previous decisions is the dominant behaviour. Furthermore, self-reported decision-making mechanisms correlate with our experimental findings despite their variability, suggesting that on average individuals can recognize their behavioural tendencies. Our findings give insight into social sequential decision-making, and provide an empirical foundation for integrating realistic social decision mechanisms into pedestrian movement models."

    "abstract": "Cable-driven continuum robots (CDCRs) require accurate, real-time dynamic models for high-speed dynamics prediction or model-based control, making such capability an urgent need. In this paper, we propose the Lightweight Actuation-Space Energy Modeling (LASEM) framework for CDCRs, which formulates actuation potential energy directly in actuation space to enable lightweight yet accurate dynamic modeling. Through a unified variational derivation, the governing dynamics reduce to a single partial differential equation (PDE), requiring only the Euler moment balance while implicitly incorporating the Newton force balance. By also avoiding explicit computation of cable-backbone contact forces, the formulation simplifies the model structure and improves computational efficiency while preserving geometric accuracy and physical consistency. Importantly, the proposed framework for dynamic modeling natively supports both force-input and displacement-input actuation modes, a capability seldom achieved in existing dynamic formulations. Leveraging this lightweight structure, a Galerkin space-time modal discretization with analytical time-domain derivatives of the reduced state further enables an average 62.3% computational speedup over state-of-the-art real-time dynamic modeling approaches."

    "abstract": "In this paper, a low-complexity IQ imbalance compensation architecture is proposed, which reduces the effects of in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) imbalance. The architecture consists of transceiver IQ skew estimation methods and a low-complexity MIMO equalizer structure. Before the IQ skew estimation, the chromatic dispersion(CD) is pre-compensated in the transmitter(TX) by chirp filtering. The receiver(RX) IQ skew is estimated by Gardner's phase detector, and the TX skew is estimated by finding the value that yields the lowest equalizer error. The low-complexity MIMO equalizer consists of a complex-valued MIMO(CV-MIMO) and a real-valued DD-LMS MIMO(RV-MIMO), which employ a butterfly and a non-butterfly structure, respectively. The CV-MIMO is used to perform polarization demultiplexing. The RV-MIMO equalizes each of the two polarisations and simultaneously compensates for the TX IQ imbalance. The architecture first compensates for the IQ skew at low-complexity, and the other imperfections are compensated by the low-complexity MIMO equalizer. Therefore, this architecture can equalize signals impaired by the transceiver IQ imbalance with low complexity. A 100 km transmission simulation and experiment with 36 Gbaud dual-polarization quadrature amplitude modulation(DP-QAM) signals and offline DSP showed that, with the RX IQ skew estimation, the number of real multiplications is reduced by more than 70% compared with conventional cases. With the low-complexity MIMO equalizer, the number of real multiplications is reduced by 51% compared with 4x4 MIMO"

    "abstract": "Creation of high fidelity photonic quantum states in the continuous variable regime is indispensable for the implementation of quantum technologies universally. However, this is a challenging task as it requires higher nonlinearity or larger Fock states. In this article, we surmount this necessity by using a linear optical setup with a cascaded arrangement of beam splitters that relies solely on single photon sources and single photon detectors to tailor desired single mode nonclassical states. To show the utility of this setup, we demonstrate the generation of displaced higher photon states with unit fidelity and the family of Schrodinger cat states above $98\\%$ fidelity. In addition, we manifest the generation of GKP resource states, such as ON states and weak cubic phase states with $99\\%$ fidelity. Creating such a variety of important states in this single setup is made feasible by stating the output in the form of displaced qudits. This figure of merit facilitates efficient identification and optimization of input parameters required to generate the target single mode quantum states. We also account for the experimental imperfections by incorporating detector inefficiencies and non-unit single photon sources. This cascaded setup will assist the experimentalists to explore the feasible creation of target states using currently available resources, such as single photon sources and single photon detectors."

I exploited the APOGEE DR17 data base and selected highly confident tidal tails members of 17 Milky Way globular clusters, for which the above four properties were computed for the first time. From all possible paired property combinations, I found that $σ$$_{\\rm V_{LOS}}$ and $σ$$_{\\rm V_{Tan}}$ resulted to be highly correlated, nearly to the identity relationship. This observation-based correlation resulted to be in an overall very good agreement with that arising from the aforementioned predictions. Additionally, when the four analyzed properties are linked to the accretion groups of the Milky way to which the globular clusters are meant to be associated, I found kinematically cold and hot tidal tails pertaining to globular clusters distributed in all the considered accretion groups. This outcome could be an evidence that globular clusters form in galaxies within a wide variety of dark matter halos, with different masses and profiles."

Beyond quantized resistance plateaus, we demonstrate mode-resolved control via gate-defined chiral-helical junctions that selectively transmit or backscatter a single helical channel, a capability inaccessible in time-reversal symmetric quantum spin Hall systems. Targeted experiments and simulations identify contact-induced doping, effectively creating unintended chiral-helical interfaces, as a generic mechanism for quantization breakdown, which is mitigated by large area contacts that enhance edge-channel equilibration. Our findings establish metal screened graphene as a gate-tunable, interaction-driven helical system with quantized transport, spatially separable helical channels, and compatibility with superconducting proximity for topological devices."

Two natural properties are credibility, which ensures that the assignment is a Nash equilibrium and equality, requiring that agents with equal-weight jobs are assigned to machines of equal load. We combine these two with a hierarchy of fairness properties based on envy-freeness together with several relaxations based on the idea that envy seems more justified towards agents with a higher weight. We present a complete complexity landscape for satisfiability and decision versions of these properties, alone or in combination, and study them as structural constraints under makespan optimization. For our positive results, we develop a unified algorithmic approach, where we achieve different properties by fine-tuning key subroutines."

    "abstract": "In the rapidly evolving field of self-supervised learning on graphs, generative and contrastive methodologies have emerged as two dominant approaches. Our study focuses on masked feature reconstruction (MFR), a generative technique where a model learns to restore the raw features of masked nodes in a self-supervised manner. We observe that both MFR and graph contrastive learning (GCL) aim to maximize agreement between similar elements. Building on this observation, we reveal a novel theoretical insight: under specific conditions, the objectives of MFR and node-level GCL converge, despite their distinct operational mechanisms. This theoretical connection suggests these approaches are complementary rather than fundamentally different, prompting us to explore their integration to enhance self-supervised learning on graphs. Our research presents Contrastive Masked Feature Reconstruction (CORE), a novel graph self-supervised learning framework that integrates contrastive learning into MFR. Specifically, we form positive pairs exclusively between the original and reconstructed features of masked nodes, encouraging the encoder to prioritize contextual information over the node's own features. Additionally, we leverage the masked nodes themselves as negative samples, combining MFR's reconstructive power with GCL's discriminative ability to better capture intrinsic graph structures. Empirically, our proposed framework CORE significantly outperforms MFR across node and graph classification tasks, demonstrating state-of-the-art results. In particular, CORE surpasses GraphMAE and GraphMAE2 by up to 2.80% and 3.72% on node classification tasks, and by up to 3.82% and 3.76% on graph classification tasks."

Here, we investigate how redshift precision and survey design propagate into constraints on modified gravity using an end-to-end pipeline run on mock catalogues, focusing on mis-centring and spectroscopic completeness.

The framework integrates kinematic boundary conditions, such as potential part collisions, to guarantee the feasibility of automated assembly planning. The developed algorithm computes all feasible production sequences, integrating modules for detecting spatial relationships and formulating geometric constraints. The algorithm incorporates additional attributes, including handling feasibility, tolerance matching, and joint compatibility, to manage the high combinatorial complexity inherent in assembly sequence generation. Heuristics, such as Single-Piece Flow assembly and geometrical constraint enforcement, are utilized to further refine the solution space, facilitating more efficient planning for complex assemblies. The PLP stage is formulated as a Mixed-Integer Program (MIP), balancing the total times of a fixed number of manufacturing stations. While some complexity reduction techniques may sacrifice optimality, they significantly reduce the MIPs computational time. Furthermore, the framework enables customization of engineering constraints and supports a flexible trade-off between ASP and PLP. The open-source nature of the framework, available at https://github.com/TUM-utg/PyCAALP, promotes further collaboration and adoption in both industrial and production research applications."

    "abstract": "We revisit the problem of physics-informed regression, and propose a method that directly computes the state at the prediction point, simultaneously with the derivative and curvature information of the existing samples. We frame each prediction as a constrained optimisation problem, leveraging multivariate Taylor series expansions and explicitly enforcing physical laws. Each individual query can be processed with low computational cost without any pre- or re-training, in contrast to global function approximator-based solutions such as neural networks. Our comparative benchmarks on a reaction-diffusion system show competitive predictive accuracy relative to a neural network-based solution, while completely eliminating the need for long training loops, and remaining robust to changes in the sampling layout."

    "abstract": "Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) have become indispensable in industrial applications due to their operational flexibility and efficiency. Navigation serves as a crucial technical foundation for accomplishing complex tasks. However, navigating AMRs in dense, cluttered, and semi-structured environments remains challenging, primarily due to nonholonomic vehicle dynamics, interactions with mixed static/dynamic obstacles, and the non-convex constrained nature of such operational spaces. To solve these problems, this paper proposes an Improved Sequential Model Predictive Control (ISMPC) navigation framework that systematically reformulates navigation tasks as sequential switched optimal control problems. The framework addresses the aforementioned challenges through two key innovations: 1) Implementation of a Multi-Directional Safety Rectangular Corridor (MDSRC) algorithm, which encodes the free space through rectangular convex regions to avoid collision with static obstacles, eliminating redundant computational burdens and accelerating solver convergence; 2) A sequential MPC navigation framework that integrates corridor constraints with barrier function constraints is proposed to achieve static and dynamic obstacle avoidance. The ISMPC navigation framework enables direct velocity generation for AMRs, simplifying traditional navigation algorithm architectures. Comparative experiments demonstrate the framework's superiority in free-space utilization ( an increase of 41.05$\\%$ in the average corridor area) while maintaining real-time computational performance (average corridors generation latency of 3 ms)."

    "abstract": "With the rise of cryptocurrencies, many new applications built on decentralized blockchains have emerged. Blockchains are full-stack distributed systems where multiple sub-systems interact. While many deployed blockchains and decentralized applications need better scalability and performance, security is also critical. Due to their complexity, assessing blockchain and DAPP security requires a more holistic view than for traditional distributed or centralized systems. In this thesis, we summarize our contributions to blockchain and decentralized application security. We propose a security reference architecture to support standardized vulnerability and threat analysis. We study consensus security in single-chain Proof-of-Work blockchains, including resistance to selfish mining, undercutting, and greedy transaction selection, as well as related issues in DAG-based systems. We contribute to wallet security with a new classification of authentication schemes and a two-factor method based on One-Time Passwords. We advance e-voting with a practical boardroom voting protocol, extend it to a scalable version for millions of participants while preserving security and privacy, and introduce a repetitive voting framework that enables vote changes between elections while avoiding peak-end effects. Finally, we improve secure logging using blockchains and trusted computing through a centralized ledger that guarantees non-equivocation, integrity, and censorship evidence, then build on it to propose an interoperability protocol for central bank digital currencies that ensures atomic transfers."

Second, we show how the tools of stochastic geometry can be used to develop a new method for proving existence and uniqueness of solutions to reflected BSDEs. We implement this method and obtain a well-posedness result for reflected BSDEs in any bounded, two-dimensional, simply-connected domain that is locally C2 -diffeomorphic to a convex set.

We address selection bias through a selective tilting approach that extends empirical Bayes confidence intervals to truncated sampling mechanisms. Sign information is unreliable (a positive z-score need not indicate benefit, and investigators may choose contrast directions post hoc), so we work with absolute z-scores and identify only the distribution of absolute signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Our framework provides coverage guarantees for functionals including posterior estimands describing idealized replications and the symmetrized posterior mean, which we justify decision-theoretically as optimal among sign-equivariant (odd) estimators and minimax among priors inducing the same absolute SNR distribution."

Earlier approaches have produced numerous criteria for matchability and unmatchability, but have offered little structural insight. In this paper, we develop parallel structure theorems which characterize unmatchable pairs in both abelian groups and field extensions. Our framework reveals analogous obstructions to matchability: nearly periodic decompositions of sets in the group setting correspond to decompositions of subspaces involving translates of simple extensions in the linear setting. This perspective not only recovers previously known results through short proofs, but also leads to new matching criteria and guarantees the existence of nontrivial unmatchable pairs."

As a result, we establish asymptotic normality for the count of any fixed graph $H$ in $G_n$ across the entire range of sparsity (above the containment threshold for $H$ in $G_n$).

    "abstract": "Generalized category discovery (GCD) is an important and challenging task in open-world learning. Specifically, given some labeled data of known classes, GCD aims to cluster unlabeled data that contain both known and unknown classes. Current GCD methods based on parametric classification adopt the DINO-like pseudo-labeling strategy, where the sharpened probability output of one view is used as supervision information for the other view. However, large pre-trained models have a preference for some specific visual patterns, resulting in encoding spurious correlation for unlabeled data and generating noisy pseudo-labels. To address this issue, we propose a novel method, which contains two modules: Loss Sharpness Penalty (LSP) and Dynamic Anchor Selection (DAS). LSP enhances the robustness of model parameters to small perturbations by minimizing the worst-case loss sharpness of the model, which suppressing the encoding of trivial features, thereby reducing overfitting of noise samples and improving the quality of pseudo-labels. Meanwhile, DAS selects representative samples for the unknown classes based on KNN density and class probability during the model training and assigns hard pseudo-labels to them, which not only alleviates the confidence difference between known and unknown classes but also enables the model to quickly learn more accurate feature distribution for the unknown classes, thus further improving the clustering accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively mitigate the noise of pseudo-labels, and achieve state-of-the-art results on multiple GCD benchmarks."

We argue open-source data and software may facilitate rapid analysis of public data - a much-needed ability in human service intervention development under increasingly constrained resources - but find public data are limited by the information they reliably capture, limiting their utility by a non-trivial margin of error.

In the quantum Hall regime, such phases typically emerge at half-filled, high-orbital-index ($N\\geq2$) Landau levels (LLs) where the short-range Coulomb interaction is softened by the nodes of electron wave functions. In the lowest ($N=0$) LLs, these phases are not expected. Instead, composite fermion (CF) liquids and fractional quantum Hall states, which are well explained in the picture of weakly interacting CF quasiparticles, are favored. Here we report the observation of an unexpected stripe/nematic phase in the \\textit{lowest} LL at filling factor $ν=5/8$ in ultrahigh-quality GaAs two-dimensional \\textit{hole} systems, evinced by a pronounced in-plane transport anisotropy. Remarkably, $ν=5/8$ can be mapped to a half-filled, high-index CF LL ($N_{\\text{CF}}=2$), analogous to the $N=2$ hole LL. Our finding signals a novel stripe/nematic phase of CFs, driven by the residual long-range interaction among these emergent quasiparticles. This phase is surprisingly robust, surviving up to $\\sim$100 mK. Its absence in electron-type systems suggests that severe LL mixing stemming from the large hole effective mass and non-linear LL fan diagram plays a crucial role in modifying the CF-CF interaction."

Current SCOOD methods mainly adopt various clustering-based in-distribution sample filtering (IDF) strategies to select clean ID samples from unlabeled data, and take the remaining samples as auxiliary OOD data, which inevitably introduces a large number of noisy samples in training. To address the above issue, we propose a concise SCOOD framework based on predictive sample assignment (PSA). PSA includes a dual-threshold ternary sample assignment strategy based on the predictive energy score that can significantly improve the purity of the selected ID and OOD sample sets by assigning unconfident unlabeled data to an additional discard sample set, and a concept contrastive representation learning loss to further expand the distance between ID and OOD samples in the representation space to assist ID/OOD discrimination. In addition, we also introduce a retraining strategy to help the model fully fit the selected auxiliary ID/OOD samples. Experiments on two standard SCOOD benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin."

Given our initial state, the fluctuations are given by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process whose characteristic operators are the Laplacian and gradient operators. The domains of these operators include functions with boundary conditions that depend on the hydrodynamic profile. A central ingredient in our analysis is the derivation of sharp bounds on the space and space-time $v$-functions of arbitrary degree for the centered occupation variables.

Such a representation is significant for all active vehicle safety applications especially when performing dynamic maneuvers in a complex traffic scenario. As a first step, a hierarchical situation classifier is used to distinguish the different types of traffic scenarios. This classifier is responsible for identifying the type of the road infrastructure and the safety-relevant traffic participants of the driving environment. With each class representing similar traffic scenarios, a set of Random Forests (RFs) is individually trained to predict the probabilistic space-time representation, which depicts the future behavior of traffic participants. This representation is termed as a Predicted-Occupancy Grid (POG). The input to the RFs is an Augmented Occupancy Grid (AOG). In order to increase the learning accuracy of the RFs and to perform better predictions, the AOG is reduced to low-dimensional features using a Stacked Denoising Autoencoder (SDA). The excellent performance of the proposed machine learning approach consisting of SDAs and RFs is demonstrated in simulations and in experiments with real vehicles. An application of POGs to estimate the criticality of traffic scenarios and to determine safe trajectories is also presented."

In contrast, neutron-capture (n-capture) elements remain sparsely investigated across the GC system, despite their unique ability to trace nucleosynthetic channels and star-formation timescales. A homogeneous and statistically robust mapping of n-process elements in a large sample of GCs would provide powerful constraints on their formation environments, chemical signatures of in situ and accreted systems, and refine our understanding of the early chemical evolution of the MW halo.

    "abstract": "File systems are critical OS components that require constant evolution to support new hardware and emerging application needs. However, the traditional paradigm of developing features, fixing bugs, and maintaining the system incurs significant overhead, especially as systems grow in complexity. This paper proposes a new paradigm, generative file systems, which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate and evolve a file system from prompts, effectively addressing the need for robust evolution. Despite the widespread success of LLMs in code generation, attempts to create a functional file system have thus far been unsuccessful, mainly due to the ambiguity of natural language prompts. This paper introduces SYSSPEC, a framework for developing generative file systems. Its key insight is to replace ambiguous natural language with principles adapted from formal methods. Instead of imprecise prompts, SYSSPEC employs a multi-part specification that accurately describes a file system's functionality, modularity, and concurrency. The specification acts as an unambiguous blueprint, guiding LLMs to generate expected code flexibly. To manage evolution, we develop a DAG-structured patch that operates on the specification itself, enabling new features to be added without violating existing invariants. Moreover, the SYSSPEC toolchain features a set of LLM-based agents with mechanisms to mitigate hallucination during construction and evolution. We demonstrate our approach by generating SPECFS, a concurrent file system. SPECFS passes hundreds of regression tests, matching a manually-coded baseline. We further confirm its evolvability by seamlessly integrating 10 real-world features from Ext4. Our work shows that a specification-guided approach makes generating and evolving complex systems not only feasible but also highly effective."

We show that under this limit, the geodesics of the magnetic BTZ solution reduce to the two-dimensional motion of a charged particle in a normal magnetic field together with the presence of an extra harmonic potential, sometimes called the Fock-Darwin problem, which serves as a precursor to model certain condensed matter theories. Our present study has significance in analyzing the symmetries of different dynamical systems, from relativistic and/to nonrelativistic theories. Also, we discuss here one of the applications of the generalized (magnetic) NH_3 symmetry in the context of the Virial theorem, where this symmetry is the symmetry group of the Fock-Darwin problem mentioned above."

    "abstract": "The slow inference process of image diffusion models significantly degrades interactive user experiences. To address this, we introduce Diffusion Preview, a novel paradigm employing rapid, low-step sampling to generate preliminary outputs for user evaluation, deferring full-step refinement until the preview is deemed satisfactory. Existing acceleration methods, including training-free solvers and post-training distillation, struggle to deliver high-quality previews or ensure consistency between previews and final outputs. We propose ConsistencySolver derived from general linear multistep methods, a lightweight, trainable high-order solver optimized via Reinforcement Learning, that enhances preview quality and consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that ConsistencySolver significantly improves generation quality and consistency in low-step scenarios, making it ideal for efficient preview-and-refine workflows. Notably, it achieves FID scores on-par with Multistep DPM-Solver using 47% fewer steps, while outperforming distillation baselines. Furthermore, user studies indicate our approach reduces overall user interaction time by nearly 50% while maintaining generation quality. Code is available at https://github.com/G-U-N/consolver."

Here we propose a mechanistic model of human mental rotation, leveraging advances in deep, equivariant, and neuro-symbolic learning. Our model consists of three stacked components: (1) an equivariant neural encoder, taking images as input and producing 3D spatial representations of objects, (2) a neuro-symbolic object encoder, deriving symbolic descriptions of objects from these spatial representations, and (3) a neural decision agent, comparing these symbolic descriptions to prescribe rotation simulations in 3D latent space via a recurrent pathway. Our model design is guided by the abundant experimental literature on mental rotation, which we complemented with experiments in VR where participants could at times manipulate the objects to compare, providing us with additional insights into the cognitive process of mental rotation. Our model captures well the performance, response times and behavior of participants in our and others' experiments. The necessity of each model component is shown through systematic ablations. Our work adds to a recent collection of deep neural models of human spatial reasoning, further demonstrating the potency of integrating deep, equivariant, and symbolic representations to model the human mind."

While several studies have explored how LLMs can generate or solve optimization models, far less is understood about what these models actually learn regarding problem structure or algorithmic behavior. This study investigates how LLMs internally represent combinatorial optimization problems and whether such representations can support downstream decision tasks. We adopt a twofold methodology combining direct querying, which assesses LLM capacity to explicitly extract instance features, with probing analyses that examine whether such information is implicitly encoded within their hidden layers. The probing framework is further extended to a per-instance algorithm selection task, evaluating whether LLM-derived representations can predict the best-performing solver. Experiments span four benchmark problems and three instance representations. Results show that LLMs exhibit moderate ability to recover feature information from problem instances, either through direct querying or probing. Notably, the predictive power of LLM hidden-layer representations proves comparable to that achieved through traditional feature extraction, suggesting that LLMs capture meaningful structural information relevant to optimization performance."

Here, we introduce a reconfigurable plasmonic metasurface laser platform in which the lasing area geometry, and thus the emission properties, are dynamically programmed via spatially structured optical pumping. Using hexagonal arrays of silver nanoparticles embedded in dye-doped waveguides, we demonstrate lasing at high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone, including the K and M points. K-point lasing exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) in relative intensity between degenerate K and K' modes, with no bias induced by pump geometry, even for geometries that explicitly break symmetry. In contrast, M-point lasing allows deterministic control over emission channels via asymmetric pumping. We further show that spatially separated K-point lasers synchronize in phase and amplitude, undergoing SSB in lockstep. A theoretical density matrix approach cast into stochastic differential equations reproduces the observed real- and Fourier-space intensity distributions and SSB behavior. Our findings establish spatially programmable metasurface lasers as a versatile platform for exploring dynamic phenomena in photonic lattices, with potential applications in vortex beam shaping, optical logic, and true random number generation."

We test this interpretation by performing a non-parametric exploration of the minimally coupled, luminal Horndeski subclass known as kinetic gravity braiding (KGB). Using mochi_class and its manifestly stable effective field theory (EFT) basis implementation, we efficiently scan a broad class of models in which the EFT functions are allowed to vary freely in time, while enforcing the absence of ghost and gradient instabilities from the outset. We identify a set of KGB models that realize phantom crossing and remain broadly consistent with current probes of the background and linear large-scale structure, including CMB temperature and lensing power spectra, redshift-space distortions, cosmic shear, and the cross-correlation between galaxies and the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. Our results demonstrate that viable phantom-crossing solutions exist without conformal coupling, motivating future full Bayesian analyses of this model class with non-parametric EFT priors."

The statistical power of the ongoing Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) demands precise theoretical tools to model the Lya forest. We present a hybrid effective field theory (HEFT) forward model in redshift space that leverages the accuracy of non-linear particle displacements computed using the N-body simulation suite AbacusSummit with the predictive power of an analytical, perturbative bias forward model in the framework of the effective field theory (EFT). The residual noise between the model and the simulated Lya field has a nearly white (scale-and orientation-independent) power spectrum on quasi-linear scales, substantially simplifying its modeling compared to a purely perturbative description. As a consequence of the improved control over the 3D Lya forest stochasticity, we find agreement between the modeled and the true power spectra at the 5 per cent level down to scales of k <= 1 h/Mpc. This procedure offers a promising path toward constructing efficient and accurate emulators to predict large-scale clustering summary statistics for full-shape cosmological analyses of Lya forest data from both DESI and its successor, DESI-II."

However, its tremendous energy waste has raised concerns about sustainability. Proof-of-Useful-Work (PoUW) aims to redirect the meaningless computation to meaningful tasks such as solving machine learning (ML) problems, giving rise to the branch of Proof-of-Learning (PoL). While previous studies have proposed various PoLs, they all, to some degree, suffer from security, decentralization, or efficiency issues. In this paper, we propose a PoL framework that trains ML models efficiently while maintaining blockchain security in a fully distributed manner. We name the framework SEDULity, which stands for a Secure, Efficient, Distributed, and Useful Learning-based blockchain system. Specifically, we encode the template block into the training process and design a useful function that is difficult to solve but relatively easy to verify, as a substitute for the PoW puzzle. We show that our framework is distributed, secure, and efficiently trains ML models. We further demonstrate that the proposed PoL framework can be extended to other types of useful work and design an incentive mechanism to incentivize task verification. We show theoretically that a rational miner is incentivized to train fully honestly with well-designed system parameters. Finally, we present simulation results to demonstrate the performance of our framework and validate our analysis."

This paper establishes theoretical performance limits for MIMO Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems under per-element constant-envelope (CE) transmission constraints. We demonstrate that hardware distortions -- specifically power amplifier nonlinearity, ADC quantization, and oscillator phase noise -- impose a capacity ceiling that cannot be overcome by increasing transmit power. A unified link budget framework integrates wideband beam squint, aperture pointing errors, and colored noise sources through a spectral consistency principle that ensures residual phase noise is counted exactly once across communication and sensing analyses. The sensing bounds are derived via the Whittle-Fisher Information Matrix under a Constant Acceleration kinematic model with jerk noise, yielding closed-form scaling laws: residual phase noise variance scales as $α^{-1}$ while dynamic state-estimation error (DSE) variance scales as $α^{-5}$ with pilot overhead $α$. Numerical results show divergent MIMO scaling: sensing precision improves with array size ($\\mathrm{RMSE} \\propto 1/\\sqrt{N_t N_r}$), while the critical SNR exhibits scale invariance regarding array size, implying that the distortion-limited transition point stabilizes regardless of the array scale. The steep $α^{-5}$ DSE scaling creates an operationally infeasible region at $α< α^* \\approx 0.16$, where $α^* = (C_{\\mathrm{DSE}}/C_{\\mathrm{PN}})^{1/4}$ -- a constraint-driven threshold under the adopted baseline for LEO operation.

We show that if the relationships between the variable of interest and other covariates are linear, then the coefficient on the variable of interest represents a weighted average of the derivatives of the outcome conditional expectation function with respect to the variable of interest. If these relationships are nonlinear, the regression coefficient becomes biased relative to this weighted average. We show that this bias is interpretable, analogous to the biases from measurement error and omitted variable bias under the standard linear model."

This includes classifying mixture distributions with cross-entropy loss with one and two-layer networks, and learning single and multi-index models with one and two-layer networks. When the data is drawn from an isotropic Gaussian mixture distribution, it is known that the evolution of a finite family of summary statistics under stochastic gradient descent converges to an autonomous ordinary differential equation (ODE), as the dimension and sample size go to $\\infty$ and the step size goes to $0$ commensurately. Our main result is that these ODE limits are universal in that this convergence occurs even when the data is drawn from mixtures of product measures provided the first two moments match the corresponding Gaussian distribution and the initialization and ground truth vectors are sufficiently coordinate-delocalized. We complement this by proving two corresponding non-universality results. We provide a simple example where the ODE limits are non-universal if the initialization is coordinate aligned. We also show that the stochastic differential equation limits arising as fluctuations of the summary statistics around their ODE's fixed points are not universal."

The formulation exhibits spectral convergence for quasi-periodic problem which we give a rigorous mathematical proof and also verify numerically. We demonstrate the approach on Duffing oscillators and a nonlinear Klein-Gordon system, documenting spectral error decay on the torus and tight agreement with time-accurate integrations while using modest frequency grids.

We show that, as the distance between the interfaces tends to zero, the local-time terms converge to a limiting homogenized drift term. When the interfaces are sticky, the limiting diffusion also decelerates, meaning that its diffusion coefficient is effectively reduced. Such limit theorems illustrate a form of stochastic homogenization for diffusions evolving in a heterogeneous medium interleaved with semipermeable, sticky interfaces."

We provide the rationale for as well as the practical concerns with such an approach for estimating marginal effects.

Briefly, sample-splitting is used to data-adaptively select the combination of estimators of the outcome regression (i.e., the conditional expectation of the outcome given the trial arm and covariates) and known propensity score (i.e., the conditional probability of being randomized to the intervention given the covariates) that minimizes the cross-validated variance estimate and, thereby, maximizes empirical efficiency. We discuss our approach for evaluating finite sample performance with parametric and plasmode simulations, pre-specifying the Statistical Analysis Plan, and unblinding in real-time on video conference with our colleagues from around the world. We present the results from applying our approach in the primary, pre-specified analysis of 8 recently published trials (2022-2024).

Through numerical investigation of experimentally-achievable systems from individual nanoparticles and dimers to nanolenses and switchable clusters, we demonstrate how plasmon hybridization and near-field coupling dictate the magnitude and spatial distribution of temperature. Our results highlight the critical role of polarization and gap distance in tuning the thermal output of dimers, the ability of a trimer nanolens to focus heat into a sub-diffraction volume, and the pronounced thermal difference in a switchable nanoparticle cluster. This work establishes a framework for designing advanced thermoplasmonic systems where heat is not merely a detriment, but a dynamically controllable element for applications in catalysis, health, or active photonic devices."

    "abstract": "Recent deep learning frameworks in histopathology, particularly multiple instance learning (MIL) combined with pathology foundational models (PFMs), have shown strong performance. However, PFMs exhibit limitations on certain cancer or specimen types due to domain shifts - these cancer types were rarely used for pretraining or specimens contain tissue-based artifacts rarely seen within the pretraining population. Such is the case for transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT), which are essential for diagnosing muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), but contain fragmented tissue chips and electrocautery artifacts and were not widely used in publicly available PFMs. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective domain-adaptive self-supervised adaptor (DA-SSL) that realigns pretrained PFM features to the TURBT domain without fine-tuning the foundational model itself. We pilot this framework for predicting treatment response in TURBT, where histomorphological features are currently underutilized and identifying patients who will benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is challenging. In our multi-center study, DA-SSL achieved an AUC of 0.77+/-0.04 in five-fold cross-validation and an external test accuracy of 0.84, sensitivity of 0.71, and specificity of 0.91 using majority voting. Our results demonstrate that lightweight domain adaptation with self-supervision can effectively enhance PFM-based MIL pipelines for clinically challenging histopathology tasks.

Making use of diffusion priors, we fine-tune powerful existing diffusion models on a large-scale customized dataset of indoor and outdoor scenes, paired with spatiotemporal light probes. For accurate spatial conditioning, we demonstrate that depth alone is insufficient and we introduce a new geometric condition to provide the relative position of the scene to the target 3D position. Finally, we combine diffuse and mirror predictions at different exposures into a single HDRI map leveraging differentiable rendering. We thoroughly evaluate our method and design choices to establish LiMo as state-of-the-art for both spatial control and prediction accuracy."

The analysis combines time-resolved experimental measurements with physics-based linear models, using mean fields previously assimilated from the same dataset as base flows. Spectral proper orthogonal decomposition reveals coherent dynamics in low- and medium-frequency regimes for both flows, with the low-frequency dynamics being substantially stronger in the separated case. In the separated flow, these dynamics are linked to a three-dimensional zero-frequency modal instability that generates large-scale streaks downstream of the bump. A standing-wave model based on resolvent modes, incorporating sidewall effects, reproduces the experimentally observed spanwise structure of the dynamics and highlights the limitations of simulations with small spanwise extent and periodic boundary conditions. In the attached flow, similar low-frequency streaks are identified. These are weaker, do not form a prominent standing-wave pattern, and cannot be definitively classified as either modal or non-modal. The three-dimensional zero-frequency instability and finite-span standing-wave dynamics, identified as the main drivers of low-frequency coherent structures in the separated flow, offer an explanation for persistent discrepancies between simulations and experiments on the Gaussian bump, and provide guidance on spanwise domain size and boundary conditions for future simulations."

Non-stochastic optimisation of the ternary tree class of encodings to date has targeted either the device or Hamiltonian. We develop a deterministic method which optimises ternary tree encodings without changing the underlying tree structure. This enables reduction in Pauli-weight without ancillae or additional swap-gate overhead. We demonstrate this method for a variety of encodings, including those which are derived from the qubit connectivity graph of a quantum computer.

This paper introduces a rigorous mathematical methodology for task assignment, employing Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) to ensure both balanced workloads and cost minimization. The proposed model systematically integrates individual employee efficiency, task complexity, and performance metrics to reflect real organizational dynamics. The formulation is guided by two principal objectives: firstly, to achieve equitable work load distribution commensurate with employee efficiency, and secondly, to minimize overall project costs by accounting for task difficulty and individual proficiency. Furthermore, the approach incorporates adaptive updates to efficiency parameters based on observed performance, thereby enhancing its practical applicability. Empirical evaluation using simulated datasets demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method over conventional assignment strategies in terms of both workload fairness and cost reduction. The findings underscore the potential of this MILP based framework as a robust, scalable, and adaptable solution for contemporary human resource allocation challenges in project management contexts."

    "abstract": "We perform a comparative Bayesian analysis of fermionic and bosonic dark matter admixed neutron stars (DMANS) by incorporating a comprehensive set of theoretical, experimental, and astrophysical constraints. The hadronic matter equation of state (EoS) is modeled using a relativistic mean-field approach, constrained by chiral effective field theory ($χ$EFT) calculations at low densities, finite nuclei and heavy-ion collision data at intermediate densities, and neutron star (NS) observations at high densities. For the dark sector, we consider fermionic dark matter (FDM) interacting via a dark vector meson, and two bosonic dark matter models (BDM1 and BDM2) characterized by self-interacting scalar fields. Bayesian inference is employed to constrain the model parameters, including the dark matter mass, coupling strength, and dark matter fraction within NSs. Our analysis finds that all models yield consistent nuclear matter parameters, allowing a small dark matter fraction under 10%. The presence of dark matter slightly softens the EoS, leading to a modest reduction in NS mass, radius, and tidal deformability, though all models remain compatible with NICER and GW170817 observations. The log-evidence and likelihood analyses reveal no statistical preference among the FDM and BDM models, indicating that current astrophysical data cannot decisively distinguish between fermionic and bosonic dark matter scenarios. This study provides a unified statistical framework to constrain dark matter properties using NS observables."

However, existing Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are predominantly limited to single-step reasoning, as existing benchmarks lack the complexity needed to evaluate and drive multi-hop abilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMhops, a novel, large-scale benchmark designed to systematically evaluate and foster multi-modal multi-hop reasoning. MMhops dataset comprises two challenging task formats, Bridging and Comparison, which necessitate that models dynamically construct complex reasoning chains by integrating external knowledge. To tackle the challenges posed by MMhops, we propose MMhops-R1, a novel multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) framework for dynamic reasoning. Our framework utilizes reinforcement learning to optimize the model for autonomously planning reasoning paths, formulating targeted queries, and synthesizing multi-level information. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MMhops-R1 significantly outperforms strong baselines on MMhops, highlighting that dynamic planning and multi-modal knowledge integration are crucial for complex reasoning. Moreover, MMhops-R1 demonstrates strong generalization to tasks requiring fixed-hop reasoning, underscoring the robustness of our dynamic planning approach. In conclusion, our work contributes a challenging new benchmark and a powerful baseline model, and we will release the associated code, data, and weights to catalyze future research in this critical area."

In this work, we propose a stance-aware structural modeling that encodes each post in a discourse with its stance signal and aggregates reply embedddings by stance category enabling a scalable and semantically enriched representation of the entire thread. To enhance structural awareness, we introduce stance distribution and hierarchical depth as covariates, capturing stance imbalance and the influence of reply depth.

    "abstract": "Bidding flexibility in day-ahead and intraday auctions would enable decentralized flexible resources, such as electric vehicles and heat pumps, to efficiently align their consumption with the intermittent generation of renewable energy. However, because these resources are individually too small to participate in those auctions directly, an aggregator (e.g., a utility) must act on their behalf. This requires aggregating many decentralized resources, which is a computationally challenging task. In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient and highly accurate method that is readily applicable to European day-ahead and intraday auctions. Distinct from existing methods, we aggregate only economically relevant power profiles, identified through price forecasts. The resulting flexibility is then conveyed to the market operator via exclusive groups of block bids. We evaluate our method for a utility serving the Swiss town of Losone, where flexibility from multiple heat pumps distributed across the grid must be aggregated and bid in the Swiss day-ahead auction. Results show that our method aggregates accurately, achieving 98% of the theoretically possible cost savings. This aggregation accuracy remains stable even as the number of heat pumps increases, while computation time grows only linearly, demonstrating strong scalability."

Before mass transfer, both approaches predict synchronization and orbital decay timescales that agree within $\\sim$2 orders of magnitude and typically exceed the stellar main sequence lifetime, implying negligible tidal impact on secular orbital evolution. However, the implied dissipation channels differ, and the differences become more pronounced once mass transfer begins. To test the theoretical predictions against observations, we apply both approaches to the well-characterized PSR J0045--7319 system, which has an orbital decay timescale of 0.5 Myr. The numerical solution reveals strong resonances with internal gravity waves, bringing the predicted orbital period change rate close to the observed value. In contrast, the semi-analytic prescriptions predict orbital decay timescales longer than the Hubble time. These results suggest that for population studies, modestly calibrated parameterized equations may suffice, but for individual systems, reliable interpretation requires direct numerical approaches."

However, in reality, the insulating phase of nickelates is the result of charge disproportionation (CD) with the formation of a system of spin-triplet ($S = 1$) electron [NiO$_6$]$^{10-}$ and spinless ($S = 0$) hole [NiO$_6$]$^{8-}$ centers, equivalent to a system of effective spin-triplet composite bosons moving in a nonmagnetic lattice. The effective CD-phase Hamiltonian takes into account local ($U$) and nonlocal ($V$) correlations, and the transfer of composite bosons ($t_b$). Within the framework of the effective field approximation, we have shown the existence of two types of CD phases: the high-temperature classical paramagnetic CO-phase of charge ordering of electron and hole centers, and the low-temperature magnetic quantum CDq phase with charge and spin density transfer between electron and hole centers, with ''uncertain valence'' [NiO$_{6}$]$^{(9\\pmδ)-}$ ($0 \\le δ\\le 1$) and spin density $(1 \\pm δ)/2$ NiO$_6$-centers. In the classical CO phase, spin-triplet electron centers are surrounded by the nearest nonmagnetic hole centers, which ''turns off'' the strong superexchange interaction of the nearest neighbors. The magnetic ordering in the quantum CDq phase is determined by a strong traditional superexchange and an unusual bosonic double exchange mechanism."

The study extends the machine-learning approach of Silvester (Machine Learning for Hydrodynamic Stability, arXiv:2407.09572), where a classifier network was trained on preselected simulation data to identify bifurcated and nonbifurcated flow regimes. In contrast, the proposed methodology introduces adaptivity through a flow-based deep generative model that automatically refines the sampling of the parameter space. The strategy has two components: a classifier network maps the flow parameters to a bifurcation probability, and a probability density estimation technique (KRnet) for the generation of new samples at each adaptive step. The classifier output provides a probabilistic measure of flow stability, and the Shannon entropy of these predictions is employed as an uncertainty indicator. KRnet is trained to approximate a probability density function that concentrates sampling in regions of high entropy, thereby directing computational effort towards the evolving bifurcation boundary. This coupling between classification and generative modeling establishes a feedback-driven adaptive learning process analogous to error-indicator based refinement in contemporary partial differential equation solution strategies. Starting from a uniform parameter distribution, the new approach achieves accurate bifurcation boundary identification with significantly fewer Navier--Stokes simulations, providing a scalable foundation for high-dimensional stability analysis."

The central piece of the approach is the integration of a fine-tuned Large Language Model to address critical issues in SQL code conversion, such as syntax mapping, resolving discrepancies between Oracle PL/SQL and PostgreSQL, and optimising database elements such as stored procedures, triggers, views, and overall database logic. Thus, the method involves a trade-off between fine-tuning and prompt engineering. Special attention is given to a fine-tuning approach, which enhances the adaptability and compatibility with migration requirements across the entire database. According to the achieved results, fine-tuning plays a very important role. The study employs targeted evaluation methodologies along with computational metrics to measure the success of iterative conversion cycles. Core innovations include automated SQL feature detection, semi-supervised error analysis and integration of Subject Matter Experts feedback within a systematic migration workflow. The methodology achieves significant reductions in Syntax Error Rates, enhances feature alignment throughout migration iterations, and leverages dataset sampling to ensure continual improvement. By embedding GAI into the migration process, the framework facilitates precise feature mapping, semi-automated error resolution, and data-driven optimisation loops, improving workflow efficiency."

    "abstract": "In recent years, the quantum Mpemba effect (QME), which occurs when an out-of-equilibrium system reaches equilibrium faster than another that is closer to equilibrium, has attracted significant attention from the scientific community as an intriguing and counterintuitive phenomenon. It generalizes its classical counterpart by extending the concept beyond temperature equilibration. This paper approaches the QME in Markovian open quantum systems from different perspectives. First, we propose a physical mechanism based on decoherence-free subspaces. Second, we show that an exponential enhancement of the decay rate toward equilibrium, scaling with system size, can be obtained, leading to an extreme version of the phenomenon in Markovian open quantum systems. Third, we study the strong Mpemba effect through the unravelings of Davies maps, revealing subtleties in the choice of figures of merit used to identify the QME. Finally, we propose a microscopic model to gain deeper insight into bath dynamics in this context."

In various papers, Trevor Bench-Capon criticised these models on the grounds that they would give incorrect outcomes in some cases. In particular, the models would not account for the possibility that intermediate factors are established with different strengths by different base-level factors. In this paper we respond to these criticisms for van Woerkom's result-based hierarchical models. We argue that in some examples Bench-Capon seems to interpret intermediate factors as dimensions, and that applying van Woerkom's dimension-based version of the hierarchical result model to these examples avoids Bench-Capon's criticisms."

This study aims to investigate the distribution of micron-sized dust particles in the Flying Saucer (BKLT J162813-243139) in Rho Ophiuchi, leveraging the unique observational conditions of a bright infrared background that enables the edge-on disc to be seen in both silhouette and scattered light at certain, specific wavelengths. As part of the JWST Edge-on Disc Ice program ('JEDIce'), we use NIRSpec IFU observations of the Flying Saucer, serendipitously observed against a PAH-emitting background, to constrain the dust distribution and grain sizes through radiative transfer modelling. Observation of the Flying Saucer in silhouette at 3.29 microns reveals that the midplane radial extent of small dust grains is ~235 au, larger than the large-grain disc extent previously determined to be 190 au from millimetre data. The scattered light observed in emission probes micron sized icy grains at large vertical distances above the midplane. The vertical extent of the disc silhouette is similar at visible, near-IR, and mid-IR wavelengths, corroborating the conclusion that dust settling is inefficient for grains as large as tens of microns, vertically and radially."

    "abstract": "Machine learning based intrusion detection systems are increasingly targeted by black box adversarial attacks, where attackers craft evasive inputs using indirect feedback such as binary outputs or behavioral signals like response time and resource usage. While several defenses have been proposed, including input transformation, adversarial training, and surrogate detection, they often fall short in practice. Most are tailored to specific attack types, require internal model access, or rely on static mechanisms that fail to generalize across evolving attack strategies. Furthermore, defenses such as input transformation can degrade intrusion detection system performance, making them unsuitable for real time deployment. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Feature Poisoning, a lightweight and proactive defense mechanism designed specifically for realistic black box scenarios. Adaptive Feature Poisoning assumes that probing can occur silently and continuously, and introduces dynamic and context aware perturbations to selected traffic features, corrupting the attacker feedback loop without impacting detection capabilities. The method leverages traffic profiling, change point detection, and adaptive scaling to selectively perturb features that an attacker is likely exploiting, based on observed deviations. We evaluate Adaptive Feature Poisoning against multiple realistic adversarial attack strategies, including silent probing, transferability based attacks, and decision boundary based attacks. The results demonstrate its ability to confuse attackers, degrade attack effectiveness, and preserve detection performance. By offering a generalizable, attack agnostic, and undetectable defense, Adaptive Feature Poisoning represents a significant step toward practical and robust adversarial resilience in machine learning based intrusion detection systems."

These pulsars were initially discovered through their single-pulse emission and therefore designated as rotating radio transients (RRATs). Follow-up timing campaigns yielded a number of higher signal-to-noise summed pulse profiles for each pulsar, allowing us to obtain timing solutions both through single pulses as well as the standard method of time-integrating the pulsar's emission. We find that the two methods return timing parameters which are usually in agreement within two standard deviations, and have similar sized error bars. The single-pulse timing solutions have significantly higher RMS errors and reduced chi-squared values, likely due to pulse jitter. The distribution of wait times between detected single pulses indicates a significant amount of pulse clustering in time on short timescales from all three sources. For all sources, the presence of low-level emission outside of the sparse bright pulses and lack of giant pulses is more reminiscent of highly nulling canonical radio pulsars than extremely transient RRATs, highlighting the diversity of emission behavior observed from sources published as RRATs."

As large language models (LLMs) increasingly act on behalf of humans in collaborative and competitive workflows, there is a pressing need to evaluate whether and under what conditions they exhibit envy-like preferences. In this paper, we test whether LLMs show envy-like behavior toward each other. We considered two scenarios: (1) A point allocation game that tests whether a model tries to win over its peer. (2) A workplace setting observing behaviour when recognition is unfair. Our findings reveal consistent evidence of envy-like patterns in certain LLMs, with large variation across models and contexts. For instance, GPT-5-mini and Claude-3.7-Sonnet show a clear tendency to pull down the peer model to equalize outcomes, whereas Mistral-Small-3.2-24B instead focuses on maximizing its own individual gains. These results highlight the need to consider competitive dispositions as a safety and design factor in LLM-based multi-agent systems."

    "abstract": "A family of parsimonious ultrametric mixture models with the Manly transformation is developed for clustering high-dimensional and asymmetric data. Advances in Gaussian mixture modeling sufficiently handle high-dimensional data but struggle with the common presence of skewness. While these advances reduce the number of free parameters, they often provide limited insight into the structure and interpretation of the clusters. To address this shortcoming, this research implements the extended ultrametric covariance structure and the Manly transformation resulting in the parsimonious ultrametric Manly mixture model family. The ultrametric covariance structure reduces the number of free parameters while identifying latent hierarchical relationships between and within groups of variables. This phenomenon allows the visualization of hierarchical relationships within individual clusters, improving cluster interpretability. Additionally, as with many classes of mixture models, model selection remains a fundamental challenge; a two-step model selection procedure is proposed herein. With simulation studies and real data analyses, we demonstrate improved model selection via the proposed two-step method, and the effective clustering performance for the proposed family."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the thermodynamic behavior of a horizonless compact object within the framework of Rastall-Rainbow (RR) gravity. Working with local shell thermodynamics for gravastar and an exterior fiducial temperature, we show that the RR modification bends temperature to produce two extrema and a stable mass remnant at zero temperature. We show that the gravastar's shell entropy is smaller than that of a comparable black hole, and that RR modifications introduce a logarithmic correction which contributes to specific heat positivity and a smoother free energy landscape of small gravastars. A Central finding of this work is that, from heat capacity and Helmholtz free energy analyses, we uncover small, middle, and large branches and demonstrate that unlike Rainbow modified black holes, the small RR gravastar is both locally and globally favored over hot curved space. At the parameter level, both Rastall and Rainbow play distinct roles. Increasing the Rastall parameter, by strengthening matter-curvature coupling, adjusts the redshift between the shell and the exterior, shifts the temperature maximum to higher values at larger masses, and narrows the unstable window. In contrast, increasing the Rainbow parameter enhances energy dependent UV suppression and bends the temperature in lower values at larger masses. Altogether, these results highlight a controlled route to thermodynamic stabilization and the emergence of a stable remnant in horizonless compact objects within RR gravity."

    "abstract": "Renewable energy sources play a major role in future net-zero energy systems. However, achieving energy system resilience remains challenging, since renewables depend on weather fluctuations, and future energy systems are subject to major design uncertainty. Existing literature mostly treats these types of uncertainty separately. Therefore, the assessment of uncertainties surrounding climate change and energy system design, and particularly their interactions, is insufficiently understood. To close this gap, we evaluate net load to assess energy system stress without relying on perfect foresight, while maintaining temporal and spatial correlations of the climate system. Net load is calculated from hourly historical and future climate model data translated to energy variables. To scope the extent of plausible energy systems, we consider eight different design scenarios inspired by the European Ten-Year Network Development Plan (TYNDP) and different levels of transmission expansion. We find that climate change impacts on net load are highly sensitive to the energy system design, implying that energy systems can be designed so that they are either hindered or helped by climate change. Furthermore, within a system scenario, climate change can change the frequency and seasonality of high net load events and their technological and meteorological composition. Wind-dominated systems with currently electrified heating levels, for instance, feature a 30% increase of high net load events under climate change, mostly in summer and fall, while fully electrified net zero systems are impacted by high net load events in winter and spring, which decrease by 50% with climate change. Our work thus calls for a wider perspective on energy-climate stress that captures the non-linear interactions of climate change and system design uncertainty, thereby overcoming the current focus on cold Dunkelflauten."

    "abstract": "Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals have long been applied in the field of affective brain-computer interfaces (aBCIs). Cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition has demonstrated significant potential in practical applications due to its suitability across diverse people. However, most studies on cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition neglect the presence of inter-individual variability and negative transfer phenomena during model training. To address this issue, a cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition through source selection with adversarial strategy is introduced in this paper. The proposed method comprises two modules: the source selection network (SS) and the adversarial strategies network (AS). The SS uses domain labels to reverse-engineer the training process of domain adaptation. Its key idea is to disrupt class separability and magnify inter-domain differences, thereby raising the classification difficulty and forcing the model to learn domain-invariant yet emotion-relevant representations. The AS gets the source domain selection results and the pretrained domain discriminators from SS. The pretrained domain discriminators compute a novel loss aimed at enhancing the performance of domain classification during adversarial training, ensuring the balance of adversarial strategies. This paper provides theoretical insights into the proposed method and achieves outstanding performance on two EEG-based emotion datasets, SEED and SEED-IV.

This process is often performed by hand, relying on a skill practiced over many years, and attempted for small models. Nondimensionalization is often considered an art, as there is no formal method accessible to applied scientists. Here we show how to systematically perform nondimensionalization for arbitrarily sized models described by rational first order ordinary differential equations. We translate and extend an existing approach for computing rational invariants of the maximal scaling symmetry, which combines ideas from differential algebra, invariant theory and linear algebra, to the setting arising in biological models. The modeler inputs the system of equations and our implemented algorithm outputs the nondimensional quantities for the corresponding nondimensionalized model. We extend the algorithm to include initial conditions, and the modeler's choice of invariants, thereby including a larger class of nondimensionalizations. We further prove that any dimensionally consistent change of variables preserves the dimension of the maximal scaling symmetry. We showcase the framework on various models, including the classical Michaelis-Menten equations, which serves as a benchmark for asking and answering specific modeling questions."

The Cullis' determinant is defined for every matrix of size $n\\times k$, where $n \\ge k \\ge 1$ and is equal to the ordinary determinant if $n = k$. In this paper we solve the linear preserver problem for the Cullis' determinant for $k \\ge 4, n \\ge k + 2$ and $n + k$ is even. It appears that in this case all linear maps preserving the Cullis' determinant are non-singular and could be represented by two-sided matrix multiplication. Note that the cases where $n = k$ or $n = k + 1$ admit slightly different description allowing (sub)matrix transposition and were completely studied before: the case where $n = k$ is a classical linear preserver problem for the ordinary determinant and was solved by Frobenius; the complete characterisation for the case where $n = k + 1$ was obtained in the previous paper by the authors."

Including boundaries of 3D color codes, we demonstrate that the 3D restriction decoder achieves optimal scaling of the logical error rate and a threshold value of 1.55(6)% for code-capacity bit- and phase-flip noise, which is almost a factor of two higher than previously reported for this family of codes [2, 3].

We sought to assess the performance of a self-supervised ultrasound foundation model for automated fetal renal anomaly classification using a curated dataset of 969 two-dimensional ultrasound images. A pretrained Ultrasound Self-Supervised Foundation Model with Masked Autoencoding (USF-MAE) was fine-tuned for binary and multi-class classification of normal kidneys, urinary tract dilation, and multicystic dysplastic kidney. Models were compared with a DenseNet-169 convolutional baseline using cross-validation and an independent test set. USF-MAE consistently improved upon the baseline across all evaluation metrics in both binary and multi-class settings. USF-MAE achieved an improvement of about 1.87% (AUC) and 7.8% (F1-score) on the validation set, 2.32% (AUC) and 4.33% (F1-score) on the independent holdout test set. The largest gains were observed in the multi-class setting, where the improvement in AUC was 16.28% and 46.15% in F1-score. To facilitate model interpretability, Score-CAM visualizations were adapted for a transformer architecture and show that model predictions were informed by known, clinically relevant renal structures, including the renal pelvis in urinary tract dilation and cystic regions in multicystic dysplastic kidney. These results show that ultrasound-specific self-supervised learning can generate a useful representation as a foundation for downstream diagnostic tasks. The proposed framework offers a robust, interpretable approach to support the prenatal detection of renal anomalies and demonstrates the promise of foundation models in obstetric imaging."

To address these challenges we present a few-shot learning approach within a lightweight yet efficient framework that combines domain-adapted MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3 models as feature extractors, along with a feature fusion technique to generate robust feature representation. For the classification task, the fused features are passed through a Bi-LSTM classifier enhanced with attention mechanisms to capture sequential dependencies and focus on the most relevant features, thereby achieving optimal classification performance even in complex, real-world environments with noisy or cluttered backgrounds. The proposed framework was evaluated across multiple experimental setups, including both laboratory-controlled and field-captured datasets. On tomato leaf diseases from the PlantVillage dataset, it consistently improved performance across 1 to 15 shot scenarios, reaching 98.23+-0.33% at 15 shot, closely approaching the 99.98% SOTA benchmark achieved by a Transductive LSTM with attention, while remaining lightweight and mobile-friendly. Under real-world conditions using field images from the Dhan Shomadhan dataset, it maintained robust performance, reaching 69.28+-1.49% at 15-shot and demonstrating strong resilience to complex backgrounds. Notably, it also outperformed the previous SOTA accuracy of 96.0% on six diseases from PlantVillage, achieving 99.72% with only 15-shot learning. With a compact model size of approximately 40 MB and inference complexity of approximately 1.12 GFLOPs, this work establishes a scalable, mobile-ready foundation for precise plant disease diagnostics in data-scarce regions."

These biases can have societal impacts, e.g., when showing only a certain race for a stated occupation. They can also affect user experience when creating redundancy within a set of generated images instead of spanning diverse possibilities. Here, we introduce MineTheGap - a method for automatically mining prompts that cause a TTI model to generate biased outputs. Our method goes beyond merely detecting bias for a given prompt. Rather, it leverages a genetic algorithm to iteratively refine a pool of prompts, seeking for those that expose biases. This optimization process is driven by a novel bias score, which ranks biases according to their severity, as we validate on a dataset with known biases. For a given prompt, this score is obtained by comparing the distribution of generated images to the distribution of LLM-generated texts that constitute variations on the prompt.

In contrast, the joint study of cyclotomic Euler-Mahonian polynomials has received far less consideration. To the best of our knowledge, the only prior result in this direction is a formula due to Wachs for the signed Euler-Mahonian polynomials in the even case. In this paper, we focus on the cyclotomic Euler-Mahonian polynomials and derive a formula based on the Hadamard product.

    "abstract": "Unlike classical software, where logging and runtime tracing can effectively reveal internal execution status, quantum circuits possess unique properties, such as the no-cloning theorem and measurement-induced collapse, that prevent direct observation or duplication of their states. These characteristics make it especially challenging to monitor the execution of quantum circuits, complicating essential tasks such as debugging and runtime monitoring. This paper presents QMON, a practical methodology that leverages mid-circuit measurements and reset operations to monitor the internal states of quantum circuits while preserving their original runtime behavior. QMON enables the instrumentation of monitoring operators at developer-specified locations within the circuit, allowing comparisons between expected and observed quantum-state probabilities at those locations. We evaluated QMON by analyzing its impact on circuit behavior, monitoring coverage, and effectiveness in bug localization. Experimental results involving 154 quantum circuits show that all circuits preserve their intended functionality after instrumentation and that QMON successfully detects and localizes various programming errors. Although monitoring coverage is limited by the need to preserve delicate quantum properties, such as entanglement, QMON effectively detects errors while introducing no or negligible disturbance to the original quantum states. QMON facilitates the development of more robust and reliable quantum software as the field continues to mature."

    "abstract": "Metamorphic testing (MT) alleviates the oracle problem by checking metamorphic relations (MRs) across multiple test executions. The fault detection effectiveness of MT is influenced not only by the choice and quality of MRs, but also by how source test cases and metamorphic groups (MGs) are selected. While substantial research has focused on designing, generating, and validating MRs, systematic methods for source test case selection and MG selection remain largely unexplored. Although the Proportional Sampling Strategy (PSS) provides strong theoretical guarantees in traditional testing, its assumptions cannot be directly applied in MT due to differences in selection domains, test units, and failure distributions. This paper proposes PSALM, an adaptation of PSS to MT for both source test case selection and MG selection. We formally prove that PSALM is never inferior to random selection regardless of how the source test case and MG domains are partitioned. We further identify the conditions under which applying PSALM to source test case selection and MG selection yields identical effectiveness. A comprehensive empirical study on eight subject programs and 184 mutants shows that the results are consistent with our theoretical analysis and that PSALM generally performs more effectively than existing selection strategies such as ART and MT-ART. These results demonstrate that PSALM provides a theoretically grounded and practically effective selection strategy for MT."

    "abstract": "The design of effective reward functions presents a central and often arduous challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly when developing autonomous agents for complex reasoning tasks. While automated reward optimization approaches exist, they typically rely on derivative-free evolutionary heuristics that treat the reward function as a black box, failing to capture the causal relationship between reward structure and task performance. To bridge this gap, we propose Differentiable Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (DERL), a bilevel framework that enables the autonomous discovery of optimal reward signals. In DERL, a Meta-Optimizer evolves a reward function (i.e., Meta-Reward) by composing structured atomic primitives, guiding the training of an inner-loop policy. Crucially, unlike previous evolution, DERL is differentiable in its metaoptimization: it treats the inner-loop validation performance as a signal to update the Meta-Optimizer via reinforcement learning. This allows DERL to approximate the \"meta-gradient\" of task success, progressively learning to generate denser and more actionable feedback. We validate DERL across three distinct domains: robotic agent (ALFWorld), scientific simulation (ScienceWorld), and mathematical reasoning (GSM8k, MATH). Experimental results show that DERL achieves state-of-the-art performance on ALFWorld and ScienceWorld, significantly outperforming methods relying on heuristic rewards, especially in out-of-distribution scenarios. Analysis of the evolutionary trajectory demonstrates that DERL successfully captures the intrinsic structure of tasks, enabling selfimproving agent alignment without human intervention."

We present a new approach using symbolic regression trained on a simulation to derive simple, explicit mathematical expressions that estimate galaxy stellar masses from basic observables: photometry and redshift. Using a mock catalogue from the GALFORM semi-analytical model that reproduces the Physics of the Accelerating Universe Survey (PAUS), we show that a linear combination of just four observables -- minimally processed $u$- and $i$- band magnitudes, observed $(g-r)$ colour, and redshift -- can recover stellar masses with accuracy comparable to traditional spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, but with negligible computational cost. Our expressions can be evaluated instantaneously for millions of galaxies, making them ideal for next-generation surveys like LSST and Euclid. When observational errors are included, symbolic regression achieves a similar accuracy to deep neural networks while maintaining transparency. Validation against CIGALE SED fitting on PAUS data shows agreement within 0.13 dex for galaxies with $M_{*} > 10^8 M_{\\odot}$. We demonstrate that the stellar mass function can be recovered at $z < 0.5$, though with distortions at the extremes: the high-mass end is overestimated by a factor of $\\sim 3$ at $10^{11.5} h^{-1} M_{\\odot}$ due to scatter.

While Deep Learning (DL) techniques have been extensively researched for this problem, current methods frequently struggle with generalization, particularly in data-constrained or challenging settings. Moreover, many existing polyp segmentation methods rely on complex, task-specific architectures. To address these limitations, we present a framework that leverages the intrinsic robustness of DINO self-attention \"key\" features for robust segmentation. Unlike traditional methods that extract tokens from the deepest layers of the Vision Transformer (ViT), our approach leverages the key features of the self-attention module with a simple convolutional decoder to predict polyp masks, resulting in enhanced performance and better generalizability. We validate our approach using a multi-center dataset under two rigorous protocols: Domain Generalization (DG) and Extreme Single Domain Generalization (ESDG). Our results, supported by a comprehensive statistical analysis, demonstrate that this pipeline achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, significantly enhancing generalization, particularly in data-scarce and challenging scenarios. While avoiding a polyp-specific architecture, we surpass well-established models like nnU-Net and UM-Net. Additionally, we provide a systematic benchmark of the DINO framework's evolution, quantifying the specific impact of architectural advancements on downstream polyp segmentation performance."

Using data from 502,234 UK Biobank participants, we stratified individuals based on DK response frequency (0-1, 2-4, 5-7, >7) and observed a robust, dose-dependent association with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (HR = 1.64, 95% CI: 1.26-2.14) and vascular dementia (HR = 1.93, 95% CI: 1.37-2.72), independent of established risk factors. As DK response frequency increased, participants exhibited higher BMI, reduced physical activity, higher smoking rates, and a higher prevalence of chronic diseases, particularly hypertension, diabetes, and depression. Further analysis revealed a dose-dependent relationship between DK response frequency and the risk of Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia, with high DK responders showing early neurodegenerative changes, marked by elevated levels of Abeta40, Abeta42, NFL, and pTau-181. Metabolomic analysis also revealed lipid metabolism abnormalities, which may mediate this relationship. Together, these findings reframe DK response patterns as clinically meaningful signals of multidimensional neurobiological alterations, offering a scalable, low-cost, non-invasive tool for early risk identification and prevention at the population level."

Two observables are analysed: the longitudinal distribution P(x), along the confinement axis, and the transverse distribution P(y), perpendicular to the confinement axis. Using exact Fourier-sine and image-method representations with adaptive numerical schemes, we construct and test six scaling strategies for P(x) and five for P(y), encompassing geometric similarity, tether-position sweeps, confinement-strength crossovers, persistence-length effects, boundary-layer scaling near absorbing walls, and tether-centered coil scaling. Quantitative collapse diagnostics such as RMS residuals on common support, modal-energy fractions, and survival probabilities are combined with limiting-regime analysis and direct numerical evaluation to distinguish genuine universality from visually misleading overlap. From these tests we obtain a kappa-based confinement diagram and a two-parameter (kappa, a/L) regime map that link classical theories such as Flory/de Gennes blobs, Odijk deflection segments, and wormlike-chain behaviour within a single spectral picture. Gaussian, multimode, and eigenmode-dominated regimes are identified by explicit thresholds in modal composition and collapse error, providing operational criteria for when Gaussian or single-mode descriptions are valid and when full multimode structure is required. The resulting framework provides a compact, reproducible toolkit for analysing confined-polymer statistics, with applications to simulations and experiments on DNA, chromatin, and other biopolymers where confinement, stiffness, and tethering jointly control spatial organization."

Individuals' fear of losing control over data when it is being used to train such machine learning models or when distinguishing model-generated output from text written by humans. Digital watermarking provides additional protection by embedding an invisible watermark within the data that requires protection. However, little work has been taken to analyze and verify if existing digital text watermarking methods are secure and undetectable by large language models. In this paper, we investigate the security-related area of watermarking and machine learning models for text data. In a controlled testbed of three experiments, ten existing Unicode text watermarking methods were implemented and analyzed across six large language models: GPT-5, GPT-4o, Teuken 7B, Llama 3.3, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. The findings of our experiments indicate that, especially the latest reasoning models, can detect a watermarked text. Nevertheless, all models fail to extract the watermark unless implementation details in the form of source code are provided. We discuss the implications for security researchers and practitioners and outline future research opportunities to address security concerns."

This non-standard smoothness property precludes the direct application of classical tools from real functional analysis. Because of this, we introduce and systematically study new families of Sobolev spaces tailored to this setting. We define these spaces, denoted $W^{α,p}(Γ)$ and $H^α(Γ)$, to respect the continuity constraints on even-order derivatives at vertices, while permitting discontinuities in odd-order derivatives. We establish their fundamental properties, including characterizations, embedding theorems into Hölder and Lebesgue spaces, and compactness results. A central contribution in this investigation is the derivation of uniform bounds on the supremum norm of eigenfunctions for a class of Laplacians on metric graphs, a result of independent interest. Finally, we demonstrate that these spaces provide a natural framework for analyzing the regularity of solutions to fractional elliptic PDEs and SPDEs driven by Gaussian white noise on metric graphs, in particular, establishing a general characterization of the domain of the fractional powers of $(κ^2-Δ_Γ)$ and $(κ^2-\\nabla(a\\nabla))$ in terms of the Sobolev spaces we introduce, thereby extending all previously known characterizations in the literature, and improving the regularity results previously obtained to their sharp counterparts (with general fractional powers). We also show that these spaces are fundamental to the characterization of Gaussian free fields on metric graphs."

    "abstract": "In most real-world online advertising systems, advertisers typically have diverse customer acquisition goals. A common solution is to use multi-task learning (MTL) to train a unified model on post-click data to estimate the conversion rate (CVR) for these diverse targets. In practice, CVR prediction often encounters missing conversion data as many advertisers submit only a subset of user conversion actions due to privacy or other constraints, making the labels of multi-task data incomplete. If the model is trained on all available samples where advertisers submit user conversion actions, it may struggle when deployed to serve a subset of advertisers targeting specific conversion actions, as the training and deployment data distributions are mismatched. While considerable MTL efforts have been made, a long-standing challenge is how to effectively train a unified model with the incomplete and skewed multi-label data. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained Knowledge transfer framework for Asymmetric Multi-Label data (KAML). We introduce an attribution-driven masking strategy (ADM) to better utilize data with asymmetric multi-label data in training. However, the more relaxed masking in ADM is a double-edged sword: it provides additional training signals but also introduces noise due to skewed data. To address this, we propose a hierarchical knowledge extraction mechanism (HKE) to model the sample discrepancy within the target task tower. Finally, to maximize the utility of unlabeled samples, we incorporate ranking loss strategy to further enhance our model. The effectiveness of KAML has been demonstrated through comprehensive evaluations on offline industry datasets and online A/B tests, which show significant performance improvements over existing MTL baselines."

The study introduces the concept of an AI capacity budget to quantify how the finite ability of a learning model constrains joint communication and sensing performance. Under this framework, the paper derives both converse (upper) and achievability (lower) bounds that define the achievable rate-sensing region. For Gaussian channels, the effect of limited learning capacity is shown to behave as an equivalent additive noise, allowing simple analytical expressions for the resulting communication rate and sensing distortion. The theory is then extended to Rayleigh and Rician fading as well as to multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems through new matrix inequalities and a constructive mapping between AI capacity and effective noise covariance. Resource allocation between sensing and communication is optimized under this learning constraint, yielding closed-form conditions in the Gaussian case. A general learning-information trade-off law is also established, linking the representational power of the learning module to the achievable performance frontier. Finally, a practical variational training procedure is proposed to enforce the capacity constraint and to guide empirical evaluation. The derived scaling laws provide quantitative insight for co-designing model size, waveform, and hardware in next-generation ISAC systems."

However, they still struggle with (1) physical alignment and (2) out-of-distribution (OOD) instruction following. We argue that these issues stem from the models' failure to learn causal directions and to disentangle causal factors for novel recombination. We introduce the Causal Scene Graph (CSG) and the Physical Alignment Probe (PAP) dataset to enable diagnostic interventions. This analysis yields three key insights. First, DMs struggle with multi-hop reasoning for elements not explicitly determined in the prompt. Second, the prompt embedding contains disentangled representations for texture and physics. Third, visual causal structure is disproportionately established during the initial, computationally limited denoising steps. Based on these findings, we introduce LINA (Learning INterventions Adaptively), a novel framework that learns to predict prompt-specific interventions, which employs (1) targeted guidance in the prompt and visual latent spaces, and (2) a reallocated, causality-aware denoising schedule. Our approach enforces both physical alignment and OOD instruction following in image and video DMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on challenging causal generation tasks and the Winoground dataset.

    "abstract": "Classical deep neural network models struggle to represent data uncertainty and capture dependencies between features simultaneously, especially under fuzzy or noisy conditions. Although a quantum-assisted hierarchical fuzzy neural network (QA-HFNN) was proposed to learn fuzzy membership for each feature, it cannot model dependencies between features due to its single-qubit encoding. To address this, this paper proposes a dual-qubit hierarchical fuzzy neural network (DQ-HFNN), encoding feature pairs onto a pair of entangled qubits, which extends the single-feature fuzzy model to a joint fuzzy representation. By introducing quantum entanglement, the dual-qubit circuit can encode non-classical correlations, enabling the model to directly learn relationship patterns between feature pairs. Experiments on benchmarks show that DQ-HFNN demonstrates higher classification accuracy than QA-HFNN, as well as classical deep learning baselines. Furthermore, ablation studies after controlling for circuit depth and parameter counts show that the performance gain mainly stems from the relational modeling capability enabled by entanglement rather than enhanced expressivity. The proposed DQ-HFNN model exhibits high parameter efficiency and fast inference speed. Experiments under noisy conditions suggest that it is robust against noise and has the potential to be implemented on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices."

    "abstract": "The evolution toward sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks demands high-performance transceiver architectures capable of handling complex and dynamic environments. Conventional orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) receivers rely on cascaded discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and demodulation blocks, which are prone to inter-stage error propagation and suboptimal global performance. In this work, we propose two neural network (NN) models DFT-Net and Demodulation-Net (Demod-Net) to jointly replace the IDFT/DFT and demodulation modules in an OFDM transceiver. The models are trained end-to-end (E2E) to minimize bit error rate (BER) while preserving operator equivalence for hybrid deployment. A customized DFT-Demodulation Net Accelerator (DDNA) is further developed to efficiently map the proposed networks onto field-programmable gate array (FPGA) platforms. Leveraging fine-grained pipelining and block matrix operations, DDNA achieves high throughput and flexibility under stringent latency constraints. Experimental results show that the DL-based transceiver consistently outperforms the conventional OFDM system across multiple modulation schemes. With only a modest increase in hardware resource usage, it achieves approximately 1.5 dB BER gain and up to 66\\% lower execution time."

BézierFlow achieves a 2-3x performance improvement for sampling with $\\leq$ 10 NFEs while requiring only 15 minutes of training. Recent lightweight training approaches have shown promise by learning optimal timesteps, but their scope remains restricted to ODE discretizations. To broaden this scope, we propose learning the optimal transformation of the sampling trajectory by parameterizing stochastic interpolant (SI) schedulers. The main challenge lies in designing a parameterization that satisfies critical desiderata, including boundary conditions, differentiability, and monotonicity of the SNR. To effectively meet these requirements, we represent scheduler functions as Bézier functions, where control points naturally enforce these properties. This reduces the problem to learning an ordered set of points in the time range, while the interpretation of the points changes from ODE timesteps to Bézier control points. Across a range of pretrained diffusion and flow models, BézierFlow consistently outperforms prior timestep-learning methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of expanding the search space from discrete timesteps to Bézier-based trajectory transformations."

For infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces we give a short elementary argument showing that $Θ_H(2)=1/\\sqrt{2}$, thus answering a question of Raja about the precise two-piece covering index of $\\ell_2$. For scalar-valued Lebesgue spaces $L_p(μ)$, $1\\le p<\\infty$, we construct an explicit block decomposition of the unit ball yielding the upper bound $Θ_{L_p(μ)}(n)\\le n^{-1/p}$ for all $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$; in particular $Θ_{\\ell_p}(n)\\le n^{-1/p}$. For $1<p<\\infty$, this combines with Raja's general lower bound for $p$-asymptotically uniformly smoothable spaces to give the sharp asymptotic estimate $Θ_{L_p(μ)}(n)\\asymp n^{-1/p}$. We also obtain uniform lower bounds $Θ_{L_p(μ;E)}(n)\\gtrsim n^{-1/p}$ for Bochner spaces $L_p(μ;E)$, with constants independent of the Banach space $E$; this shows that, at the level of power-type lower estimates, the covering index cannot distinguish between very different asymptotic geometries of~$E$ and provides a partial negative answer to a problem of Raja.

Here, we propose a dual-pump scheme to produce frequency-degenerate photon pairs, based on cascaded sum-frequency generation and spontaneous parametric down-conversion occurring within a single waveguide, while strongly suppressing parasitic photon pair generation from single-pump processes. This approach significantly simplifies the design compared to microresonator-based methods and enables both pumping and collection of photon pairs entirely in the telecom band.

    "abstract": "This paper presents STARCaster, an identity-aware spatio-temporal video diffusion model that addresses both speech-driven portrait animation and free-viewpoint talking portrait synthesis, given an identity embedding or reference image, within a unified framework. Existing 2D speech-to-video diffusion models depend heavily on reference guidance, leading to limited motion diversity. At the same time, 3D-aware animation typically relies on inversion through pre-trained tri-plane generators, which often leads to imperfect reconstructions and identity drift. We rethink reference- and geometry-based paradigms in two ways. First, we deviate from strict reference conditioning at pre-training by introducing softer identity constraints. Second, we address 3D awareness implicitly within the 2D video domain by leveraging the inherent multi-view nature of video data. STARCaster adopts a compositional approach progressing from ID-aware motion modeling, to audio-visual synchronization via lip reading-based supervision, and finally to novel view animation through temporal-to-spatial adaptation. To overcome the scarcity of 4D audio-visual data, we propose a decoupled learning approach in which view consistency and temporal coherence are trained independently. A self-forcing training scheme enables the model to learn from longer temporal contexts than those generated at inference, mitigating the overly static animations common in existing autoregressive approaches. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that STARCaster generalizes effectively across tasks and identities, consistently surpassing prior approaches in different benchmarks."

The hysteretic magnetoresistance is isotropic with respect to the direction of magnetic field, which excludes the orbital effect of magnetic field as its origin. The observed temperature and magnetic-field dependence of this hysteresis and of its relaxation time indicates the strong influence of spin-glass state on magnetoresistance. Although a quantitative theory of this effect, originating from strong electronic correlations, requires complex numerical calculations, we suggest its explanation and a simple model which qualitatively describes the observed magnetoresistance behavior and shows a strong charge-spin entanglement. The proposed effect suggests a new class of extreme magnetoresistance mechanisms."

    "abstract": "Neural Encoders are frequently used in the NLP domain to perform dense retrieval tasks, for instance, to generate the candidate documents for a given query in question-answering tasks. However, sparse annotation and label noise in the training data make it challenging to train or fine-tune such retrieval models. Although existing works have attempted to mitigate these problems by incorporating modified loss functions or data cleaning, these approaches either require some hyperparameters to tune during training or add substantial complexity to the training setup. In this work, we consider a label weakening approach to generate robust retrieval models in the presence of label noise. Instead of enforcing a single, potentially erroneous label for each query document pair, we allow for a set of plausible labels derived from both the observed supervision and the model's confidence scores. We perform an extensive evaluation considering two retrieval models, one re-ranking model, considering four diverse ranking datasets. To this end, we also consider a realistic noisy setting by using a semantic-aware noise generation technique to generate different ratios of noise. Our initial results show that label weakening can improve the performance of the retrieval tasks in comparison to 10 different state-of-the-art loss functions."

Shared or overlapping nodes within overlapping communities can form either subcommunities or act as intersections between larger communities. Nodes at the intersections that do not form subcommunities can be identified as overlapping nodes or as part of an internal structure of nested communities. To identify overlapping nodes, we apply a threshold rule based on the number of nodes in the nested structure. As the threshold value increases, the number of selected overlapping nodes decreases. This approach allows us to analyse the roles of nodes considered overlapping according to selection criteria, for example to reduce the effect of noise. We illustrate our method by using three small and two larger real-world network structures. In larger networks, minor disturbances can produce a multitude of slightly different solutions, but the core communities remain robust, allowing other variations to be treated as noise. While this study employs our own method for community detection, other approaches can also be applied. Exploring the properties of shared nodes in overlapping communities of complex networks is a novel area of research with diverse applications in social network analysis, cybersecurity, and other fields in network science."

Using proton$\\textendash$proton collision data with integrated luminosities of up to 140 fb$^{-1}$ at $\\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV, the ATLAS collaboration systematically probe the CP nature of the Higgs boson's couplings to fermions ($τ$ leptons, bottom quarks, and top quarks) and bosons ($W$, $Z$, and $γ$) across diverse decay final states. The EFT framework is used to parameterize Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) effects via dimension-6 operators, enabling model-independent constraints on CP violation and new physics scales. The main focus is comparison of measurement characteristics and sensitivity across different final states: (1) $H \\to ττ$ (semileptonic/hadronic decays) for light fermion couplings; (2) $H \\to γγ$ and $H \\to bb$ in $t\\bar{t}H/tH$ processes for heavy fermion couplings; (3) $H \\to WW^* \\to lνlν$, $H \\to ZZ^* \\to 4l$, and vector boson fusion (VBF) $H \\to ττ/γγ$ for boson couplings; and (4) double Higgs ($HH$) production for self-couplings. All measurements are consistent with the Standard Model (SM) prediction of a CP-even Higgs boson ($J^{CP} = 0^{++}$), with no evidence of CP violation. The most stringent constraint on the CP-odd EFT parameter $c_{H\\tilde{W}}$ is obtained from VBF $H \\to ττ$ ($c_{H\\tilde{W}} \\in [-0.23, 0.70]$ at 95\\% CL), highlighting the unique sensitivity of this channel.

In particular, and in order to understand better the real structures and the dualities appearing in the singularity setting, we first look for the counterpart of Sabbah's mixed Hodge structures, initially defined on the space of vanishing cycles, on the orbifold cohomology ring. Then, we discuss to what extent the orbifold Poincaré duality defined by Chen and Ruan provides a polarization of this mixed Hodge structure. We study in details the Hodge-Tate case, which can be read off from the ages of the sectors, a variation of the hard Lefschetz condition introduced by Fernandez.

    "abstract": "Speculative Decoding is a prominent technique for accelerating the autoregressive inference of large language models (LLMs) by employing a fast draft model to propose candidate token sequences and a large target model to verify them in parallel. However, its core component -- the rejection sampling mechanism -- relies on a fixed, context-independent random threshold. This leads to a significant \"random rejection\" problem in high-uncertainty generation scenarios, where plausible candidate tokens are frequently rejected due to random chance, undermining inference efficiency. This paper introduces Efficient Adaptive Rejection Sampling (EARS), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the acceptance threshold by incorporating the target model's own predictive uncertainty, measured as \\(1 - \\max(P_{\\mathrm{target}})\\). By introducing a tolerance term proportional to this uncertainty, EARS intelligently relaxes the acceptance criterion when the model is uncertain, effectively reducing random rejections while maintaining strict standards when the model is confident. Experiments on creative writing and open-domain QA tasks demonstrate that EARS significantly enhances the efficiency of speculative decoding, achieving up to an 18.12% increase in throughput with a negligible 0.84% accuracy drop on the GSM8K benchmark. The method requires no modifications to model architectures and can be seamlessly integrated into existing speculative decoding frameworks."

Some physical parameters (electrical conductivity, Total Dissolved Solids, Ph and temperature were determined in-situ. The rest of the sample was taken to the laboratory for various chemical analysis and the results were compared to the WHO standards.

Their contamination indices showed that Ba, Co, Cs, Cu, Mo, Rb, Sr and Zn are generally less than one depicting their geogenic origin. The high degree of contamination is influenced by high levels of Al and Fe due to human activities and industrial waste disposal and can lead to anemia, osteomalacia (brittle or soft bones), cardiac arrest, stomach problems, nausea, and hemochromatosis.

However, existing vision-language models are constrained by the image understanding paradigm in 2D plane, which restricts their capability to perceive 3D spatial information and perform deep semantic fusion, resulting in suboptimal performance in complex autonomous driving environments. This study proposes MMDrive, an multimodal vision-language model framework that extends traditional image understanding to a generalized 3D scene understanding framework. MMDrive incorporates three complementary modalities, including occupancy maps, LiDAR point clouds, and textual scene descriptions. To this end, it introduces two novel components for adaptive cross-modal fusion and key information extraction. Specifically, the Text-oriented Multimodal Modulator dynamically weights the contributions of each modality based on the semantic cues in the question, guiding context-aware feature integration. The Cross-Modal Abstractor employs learnable abstract tokens to generate compact, cross-modal summaries that highlight key regions and essential semantics. Comprehensive evaluations on the DriveLM and NuScenes-QA benchmarks demonstrate that MMDrive achieves significant performance gains over existing vision-language models for autonomous driving, with a BLEU-4 score of 54.56 and METEOR of 41.78 on DriveLM, and an accuracy score of 62.7% on NuScenes-QA. MMDrive effectively breaks the traditional image-only understanding barrier, enabling robust multimodal reasoning in complex driving environments and providing a new foundation for interpretable autonomous driving scene understanding."

    "abstract": "Meat consumption is a major driver of global greenhouse gas emissions. While pricing interventions have shown potential to reduce meat intake, previous studies have focused on highly constrained environments with limited consumer choice. Here, we present the first large-scale field experiment to evaluate multiple pricing interventions in a real-world, competitive setting. Using a sequential crossover design with matched menus in a Swiss university campus, we systematically compared vegetarian-meal discounts (-2.5 CHF), meat surcharges (+2.5 CHF), and a combined scheme (-1.2 CHF=+1.2 CHF) across four campus cafeterias. Only the surcharge and combined interventions led to significant increases in vegetarian meal uptake--by 26.4% and 16.6%, respectively--and reduced CO2 emissions per meal by 7.4% and 11.3%, respectively. The surcharge, while effective, triggered a 12.3% drop in sales at intervention sites and a corresponding 14.9% increase in non-treated locations, hence causing a spillover effect that completely offset environmental gains. In contrast, the combined approach achieved meaningful emission reductions without significant effects on overall sales or revenue, making it both effective and economically viable. Notably, pricing interventions were equally effective for both vegetarian-leaning customers and habitual meat-eaters, stimulating change even within entrenched dietary habits. Our results show that balanced pricing strategies can reduce the carbon footprint of realistic food environments, but require coordinated implementation to maximize climate benefits and avoid unintended spillover effects."

    "abstract": "The amplitude-variation-with-offset inversion techniques are formulated to estimate elastic properties by fitting modeled seismic responses to observed data. Solving inverse seismic problems requires minimizing a target objective function for which gradient-based methods are frequently adopted. However, the efficiency and accuracy of these methods depend significantly on the approach used to compute the gradient of the target function. This work presents an explicit analytical gradient formulation of the exact Zoeppritz equation, discretized for multilayer media and derived using the adjoint-state method. The resulting expressions provide the gradient of a convolution-based objective function with respect to P-wave velocity, S-wave velocity, and density. The adjoint state-based solution improves computational efficiency by avoiding numerical approximations while maintaining high accuracy in calculating the gradient for seismic inversion. Additionally, using the exact Zoeppritz equation helps overcome the limitations associated with weak elastic property contrasts across subsurface layers. The least squares target function is minimized using a nonlinear limited-memory quasi-Newton algorithm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the analytical gradient solution of the exact Zoeppritz equations in seismic inversion problems involving P-wave and S-wave velocity and density models. The inversion methodology is validated using 1D well logs-based and 2D synthetic seismic data with varying noise levels. Then it is applied to a 2D field data set from the Troll oil and gas field in the Norwegian North Sea. The results demonstrate that the proposed inversion framework provides stable and reliable estimates of elastic property models."

Generative models offer a potential solution but suffer from semantic instability and morphological hallucinations that compromise diagnostic reliability. To address this challenge, we introduce a Correlation-Regulated Alignment Framework for Tissue Synthesis (CRAFTS), the first generative foundation model for pathology-specific text-to-image synthesis. By leveraging a dual-stage training strategy on approximately 2.8 million image-caption pairs, CRAFTS incorporates a novel alignment mechanism that suppresses semantic drift to ensure biological accuracy. This model generates diverse pathological images spanning 30 cancer types, with quality rigorously validated by objective metrics and pathologist evaluations. Furthermore, CRAFTS-augmented datasets enhance the performance across various clinical tasks, including classification, cross-modal retrieval, self-supervised learning, and visual question answering. In addition, coupling CRAFTS with ControlNet enables precise control over tissue architecture from inputs such as nuclear segmentation masks and fluorescence images. By overcoming the critical barriers of data scarcity and privacy concerns, CRAFTS provides a limitless source of diverse, annotated histology data, effectively unlocking the creation of robust diagnostic tools for rare and complex cancer phenotypes."

    "abstract": "Clinical transfusion-outcomes research faces unique methodological challenges compared with other areas of clinical research. These challenges arise because patients frequently receive multiple transfusions, each unit originates from a different donor, and the probability of receiving specific blood product characteristics is influenced by external, often uncontrollable, factors. These complexities complicate causal inference in observational studies of transfusion effectiveness and safety. This guide addresses key challenges in observational transfusion research, with a focus on time-varying exposure, time-varying confounding, and treatment-confounder feedback. Using the example of donor sex and pregnancy history in relation to recipient mortality, we illustrate the strengths and limitations of commonly used analytical approaches. We compare restriction-based analyses, time-varying Cox regression, and inverse probability weighted marginal structural models using a large observational dataset of male transfusion recipients. In the applied example, restriction and conventional time-varying approaches suggested an increased mortality risk associated with transfusion of red blood cells from ever-pregnant female donors compared with male-only donors (hazard ratio [HR] 1.22; 95% CI 1.05-1.42 and HR 1.21; 95% CI 1.04-1.41, respectively). In contrast, inverse probability of treatment and censoring weighted analyses, which account for treatment-confounder feedback, showed no evidence of an association (HR 1.01; 95% CI 0.85-1.20). These findings demonstrate how conventional methods can yield biased estimates when complex longitudinal structures are not adequately handled. We provide practical guidance on study design, target trial emulation, and the use of g-methods, including a reproducible tutorial and example dataset, to support valid causal inference in clinical transfusion research."

These sBBHs can retain detectable eccentricities when they enter the sensitivity bands of low-frequency GW observatories. We study multiband GW observations of eccentric sBBHs that escape from GC models simulated with the MOCCA code, focusing on how low- and middle-frequency detectors can constrain their eccentricities and other parameters. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we generate ten realizations of cosmic sBBHs by combining the MOCCA sample with a cosmological model for GC formation and evolution. We then assess their detectability and the precision of parameter estimation. Our results show that LISA, Taiji, the LISA-Taiji network (LT), and AMIGO could detect $0.8\\pm0.7$, $11.6\\pm2.0$, $15.4\\pm2.7$, and $7.9\\pm1.3$ escaping sBBHs, respectively, over four years, while LT-AMIGO could detect $20.6\\pm3.0$ multiband sBBHs in the same period. LT and AMIGO can measure initial eccentricities with relative errors of approximately $10^{-6}-2\\times10^{-4}$ and $10^{-3}-0.7$, respectively.

A tetragonal rutile SnO2 phase was confirmed to have formed by XRD investigation, with high crystallinity indicated by strong diffraction peaks. Higher precursor concentration samples showed aggregation, indicating that the smaller size of the nanoparticles caused them to interact. These findings show that changing the surfactant has a major impact on the crystallinity, size, and shape of SnO2 nanoparticles, which makes this technique establish for certain uses, including energy storage, gas sensors, and photocatalysis. Additionally, we examined the photocatalytic activity of the aforementioned samples, indicating from the UV-vis characterization results that the sample containing PEG as a surfactant performs better than others."

Pattern clustering is essential to reduce data complexity, yet existing methods struggle with computational prohibitiveness ($O(N^2)$ comparisons), sub-optimal discrete sampling for center alignment, and difficult speed-quality trade-offs. To address these, we propose an Optimal Alignment-Driven Iterative Closed-Loop Convergence Framework. First, to resolve alignment ambiguity, we introduce a hybrid suite of high-performance algorithms: an FFT-based Phase Correlation method for cosine similarity constraints, and a Robust Geometric Min-Max strategy for edge displacement constraints that analytically solves for the global optimum. Second, we model clustering as a Set Cover Problem (SCP) using a Surprisal-Based Lazy Greedy heuristic within a coarse-to-fine iterative refinement loop to ensure convergence. Additionally, a multi-stage pruning mechanism filters over 99% of redundant computations. Experimental results on the 2025 China Postgraduate EDA Elite Challenge benchmark demonstrate a 93.4% compression ratio relative to raw inputs and an over 100x speedup compared to the official baseline, effectively handling tens of thousands of patterns in seconds. Securing First Place among 77 teams, this approach proves its superiority in solving the NP-Hard layout clustering problem with an optimal balance of scalability and precision."

    "abstract": "High resolution phenotyping at the level of individual leaves offers fine-grained insights into plant development and stress responses. However, the full potential of accurate leaf tracking over time remains largely unexplored due to the absence of robust tracking methods-particularly for structurally complex crops such as canola. Existing plant-specific tracking methods are typically limited to small-scale species or rely on constrained imaging conditions. In contrast, generic multi-object tracking (MOT) methods are not designed for dynamic biological scenes. Progress in the development of accurate leaf tracking models has also been hindered by a lack of large-scale datasets captured under realistic conditions. In this work, we introduce CanolaTrack, a new benchmark dataset comprising 5,704 RGB images with 31,840 annotated leaf instances spanning the early growth stages of 184 canola plants. To enable accurate leaf tracking over time, we introduce LeafTrackNet, an efficient framework that combines a YOLOv10-based leaf detector with a MobileNetV3-based embedding network. During inference, leaf identities are maintained over time through an embedding-based memory association strategy. LeafTrackNet outperforms both plant-specific trackers and state-of-the-art MOT baselines, achieving a 9% HOTA improvement on CanolaTrack. With our work we provide a new standard for leaf-level tracking under realistic conditions and we provide CanolaTrack - the largest dataset for leaf tracking in agriculture crops, which will contribute to future research in plant phenotyping.

We revisit the corresponding model by Blasi et al. (2012), perform an extensive parameter study, and determine an optimal range of parameters that best fit the cosmic-ray data.

    "abstract": "Microparticle laser fragmentation in liquids has emerged as a promising approach to generate nanoparticles with high efficiency. Despite its advantages, the underlying fragmentation mechanisms, their connection to the nanoparticle size distribution, and the energy efficiency of the process remain poorly understood. In this study for the first time, microparticle fragmentation is investigated in single-pulse, single-particle experiments on Au microparticles. Determining the absorbed peak fluence enables assessment of the process energetics. Pump-probe microscopy identifies photomechanical fracture of the molten microparticle volume and photothermal phase explosion of its superheated surface as the fragmentation mechanisms. We find that 83% of the absorbed laser energy is converted into cavitation bubble formation, while only 1% contributes to the surface energy of the generated nanoparticles. Despite this small fraction, MP-LFL outperforms laser ablation in liquids. The surface energy generated per absorbed energy is 10 times higher, and the overall energy efficiency is 14 times higher. This gain originates from the confined microparticle geometry, which minimizes energy losses and enhances photomechanical fragmentation via pressure focusing. These results position microparticle fragmentation in liquids as a fundamentally more energy-efficient approach for scalable, laser-based nanoparticle production than laser ablation in liquids."

We recast entanglement-depth and non-$k$-separability certification as likelihood-based model selection among neural quantum states whose architecture enforces a chosen entanglement constraint. A hierarchy of separable neural quantum states is trained on finite-shot local Pauli outcomes and compared against an unconstrained reference model trained on the same data. When all constrained models are statistically disfavored, the data certify entanglement beyond the imposed limit directly from measurement statistics, without reconstructing the density matrix. We validate the method on simulated six- and ten-qubit datasets targeting GHZ, Dicke, and Bell-pair states, and demonstrate robustness for mixed states under local noise. Finally, we discuss lightweight interpretability diagnostics derived from trained parameters that expose coarse entanglement patterns and qubit groupings directly from bitstring statistics."

In this paper, we propose SCP, a sparse and cooperative perturbation framework that selects and leverages a compact subset of points whose joint perturbations produce amplified adversarial effects. Specifically, SCP identifies the subset where the misclassification loss is locally convex with respect to their joint perturbations, determined by checking the positivedefiniteness of the corresponding Hessian block. The selected subset is then optimized to generate high-impact adversarial examples with minimal modifications. Extensive experiments show that SCP achieves 100% attack success rates, surpassing state-of-the-art sparse attacks, and delivers superior imperceptibility to dense attacks with far fewer modifications."

For the two spherical accretion models, the infalling scenario yields a darker shadow due to the Doppler effect. However, the shadow radius remains unchanged for different models. In the case of an optically thin, geometrically thin disk accretion model, the observed brightness is predominantly determined by direct emission. The lensing ring provides a secondary contribution to the intensity, whereas the photon ring's emission is negligible. The widths of the lensing and photon rings exhibit a positive correlation with the magnetic charge $q$. Additionally, within the disk model framework, the black hole shadow radius is found to depend on the specific emission model."

An interactive agent would recognize its own uncertainty, ask targeted questions, and retain new knowledge efficiently. Prior work has primarily explored effective ways for a teacher to instruct the student, where the teacher identifies student gaps and provides guidance. In this work, we shift the focus to the student and investigate effective strategies to actively query the teacher in seeking useful information. Across math and coding benchmarks, where baseline student models begin with near-zero performance, we show that student-led approaches consistently yield absolute Pass@k improvements of at least 0.5 over static baselines. To improve question quality, we train students using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with guidance from either self or stronger students.

However, existing hint-based RL methods typically ignore difficulty when scheduling hint ratios and estimating relative advantages, leading to unstable learning and excessive imitation of off-policy hints. In this work, we propose ADHint, which treats difficulty as a key factor in both hint-ratio schedule and relative-advantage estimation to achieve a better trade-off between exploration and imitation. Specifically, we propose Adaptive Hint with Sample Difficulty Prior, which evaluates each sample's difficulty under the policy model and accordingly schedules an appropriate hint ratio to guide its rollouts. We also introduce Consistency-based Gradient Modulation and Selective Masking for Hint Preservation to modulate token-level gradients within hints, preventing biased and destructive updates. Additionally, we propose Advantage Estimation with Rollout Difficulty Posterior, which leverages the relative difficulty of rollouts with and without hints to estimate their respective advantages, thereby achieving more balanced updates. Extensive experiments across diverse modalities, model scales, and domains demonstrate that ADHint delivers superior reasoning ability and out-of-distribution generalization, consistently surpassing existing methods in both pass@1 and avg@8.

    "abstract": "We develop a systematic extension of mode-coupling theory (MCT) that incorporates critical dynamical fluctuations. Starting from a microscopic diagrammatic theory, we identify dominant classes of divergent diagrams near the mode-coupling transition and show that the corresponding asymptotic series dominates the mean-field below an upper critical dimension $d_c=8$. To resum these divergences, we construct a mapping to a stochastic dynamical process in which the order parameter evolves under random spatiotemporal fields. This reformulation provides a controlled, fully dynamical derivation of an effective theory for the $β$-relaxation which remarkably coincides with stochastic beta-relaxation theory [T. Rizzo, EPL 106, 56003 (2014)]. All coupling constants of the latter theory are expressed microscopically in terms of the liquid static structure factor and are computed for the paradigmatic hard-sphere system. The analysis demonstrates that fluctuations alone restore ergodicity and replace the putative mean-field transition by a smooth crossover. Our results establish a predictive framework for structural relaxation beyond mean-field."

    "abstract": "Mean-field theories of the glass transition predict a phase transition to a dynamically arrested state, yet no such transition is observed in experiments or simulations of finite-dimensional systems. We resolve this long-standing discrepancy by incorporating critical dynamical fluctuations into a microscopic mode-coupling framework. We show that these fluctuations round off the mean-field singularity and restore ergodicity at all finite densities (or temperatures) without invoking activated dynamics or facilitation. The resulting effective theory describes the order parameter as a stochastic process with self-induced, annealed disorder, determined self-consistently at the mean-field level. In the $β$-relaxation regime it reduces to stochastic beta-relaxation theory, thereby unifying mode-coupling and replica-based approaches beyond mean-field. All parameters of the stochastic $β$-relaxation theory are fixed by the static structure, enabling parameter-free predictions that extend mean-field theory into finite dimensions."

Predicting disease accurately is crucial in the medical field, but traditional methods relying solely on a doctor's experience often lack precision. To address this limitation, intelligent systems are applied as an alternative to traditional approaches. While various intelligent system methods exist, this study focuses on three: Fuzzy Logic, Neural Networks, and Case-Based Reasoning (CBR). A comparison of these techniques in terms of accuracy was conducted, and ultimately, Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) was selected for heart disease prediction. In the prediction phase, the heart disease dataset underwent data pre-processing to clean the data and data splitting to separate it into training and testing sets. The chosen intelligent system was then employed to predict heart disease outcomes based on the processed data. The experiment concluded with Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) achieving a notable accuracy rate of 97.95% in predicting heart disease. The findings also revealed that the probability of heart disease was 57.76% for males and 42.24% for females. Further analysis from related studies suggests that factors such as smoking and alcohol consumption are significant contributors to heart disease, particularly among males."

The results demonstrate that the angular momentum promotes the dissociation of quarkonium and has a stronger effect on the running coupling constant when the axis of $Q\\overline{Q}$ is transverse to the direction of the angular momentum. We also find that the angular momentum enhances the jet quenching parameter and has a stronger effect when the jet moves transversely to the direction of the angular momentum, namely $\\hat{q}_{\\perp}> \\hat{q}_{\\parallel}$. We discuss the dependence of the jet quenching parameter on the $η/s$ at strong coupling in the presence of the angular momentum."

This structure induces a family of transported RKHS geometries in which classical orthogonal polynomial estimators, kernel estimators, and spectral smoothing methods arise as projections onto transported eigenfunction systems. Our main contribution is a Spectral Equivariance Theorem showing that the eigenfunctions of any transported kernel are obtained by unitary transport of the base eigenfunctions. As a consequence, orthogonal polynomial estimators are equivariant under geometric deformation, kernel estimators correspond to soft spectral filtering in a twin space, and minimax rates and bias--variance tradeoffs are invariant under transport. We provide examples based on Hermite and Legendre polynomials, affine and Gaussian groups, and illustrate the effectiveness of twin transport for adaptive and multimodal estimation. The framework reveals a deep connection between group actions, RKHS geometry, and spectral nonparametrics, offering a unified perspective that encompasses kernel smoothing, orthogonal series, splines, and multiscale methods."

This model is developed to investigate the kinetics of morphology change during phase separation in nonstoichiometric Si oxide (SiOx, x < 2) films. The model takes into account the SiOx local atomic structure and probabilistic migration of oxygen atoms driven by the tendency of free energy minimization. The influence of the initial SiOx stoichiometry index x and film thickness on the morphology of the precipitated Si phase in the Si oxide matrix is analyzed. The morphology of the Si phase is shown to critically depend on the initial SiOx stoichiometry. Namely, isolated Si nanoparticles form at low excess Si content (x >= 1.4), while interconnected Si networks always appear at x <= 0.8. A dimensional effect on the morphology of the Si phase is revealed. Namely, reducing the film thickness imposes geometric constraints on the Si network formation. The percolation threshold is found to shift from xp ~= 1.35 for the bulk-like SiOx layers to xp ~= 0.85 for the quasi-two-dimensional films. The transition to the bulk material behavior is observed at a SiOx thickness of approximately 4.2 nm."

To address this, the Summer Introduction to Research and Experimentation in Nuclear physics (SIREN) was developed as a three-week, intensive summer program that engaged 24 students working in six teams on original research projects centered around cosmic detection. Each team was supported by an advisor and a peer mentor, combining structured guidance with near-peer learning. After developing a range of technical skills, students built cosmic detectors and used them to explore a variety of projects. The program also included multiple workshops on research skills and seminars led by guest speakers, giving students access to broader STEM pathways. The evaluation of the program was based on advisor and student surveys, as well as peer mentor observations. The findings suggest that the short-term team-based model promoted engagement, collaboration, and skill development while leading to the completion of advanced projects. The advisors highlighted the effectiveness of the program structure and the excitement generated by the direct application of newly acquired skills to research. Data showed that students were able to significantly develop transferable skills through hands-on activities. Post-program surveys indicated that participants experienced an increased sense of belonging in their majors and greater confidence in pursuing careers in STEM."

    "abstract": "Preparing ground states of strongly correlated quantum systems is a central goal in quantum simulation and optimization. The feedback-based quantum algorithm (FALQON) provides an attractive alternative to variational methods with a fully quantum feedback rule, but it fails in the presence of spectral degeneracies, where the feedback signal collapses and the evolution cannot reach the ground state. Using the Fermi-Hubbard model on lattices up to 3x3, we show that this breakdown appears at half-filling on the 2x2 lattice and extends to both half-filled and doped configurations on the 3x3 lattice. We then introduce an imaginary-time-enhanced FALQON (ITE-FALQON) scheme, which inserts short imaginary-time evolution steps into the feedback loop. The hybrid method suppresses excited-state components, escapes degenerate subspaces, and restores monotonic energy descent. The ITE-FALQON achieves a reliable ground-state convergence across all fillings, providing a practical route to scalable ground-state preparation in strongly correlated quantum systems."

Recent methods densify the reward by querying a teacher that provides step-level feedback, e.g., Guided Thought Reinforcement (GTR) and On-Policy Distillation, but rely on costly, often privileged models as the teacher, limiting practicality and reproducibility. We introduce GTR-Turbo, a highly efficient upgrade to GTR, which matches the performance without training or querying an expensive teacher model. Specifically, GTR-Turbo merges the weights of checkpoints produced during the ongoing RL training, and then uses this merged model as a \"free\" teacher to guide the subsequent RL via supervised fine-tuning or soft logit distillation. This design removes dependence on privileged VLMs (e.g., GPT or Gemini), mitigates the \"entropy collapse\" observed in prior work, and keeps training stable. Across diverse visual agentic tasks, GTR-Turbo improves the accuracy of the baseline model by 10-30% while reducing wall-clock training time by 50% and compute cost by 60% relative to GTR."

To overcome this fundamental trade-off, this study presents a novel approach, by integrating a direct band gap 2D semiconductor such as monolayer MoS2 (1L-MoS2) with a well-known THz emitter, low-temperature-grown gallium arsenide (GaAs). The fabricated hybrid 2D/3D vertical van der Waals heterostructure showed a 15% higher THz emission compared to bare GaAs due to phase-coherent addition of second-order non-linear susceptibility, and overall enhancement in the electric field of laser. The photoluminescence (PL) enhancement factor of 2.38 in heterostructures at GaAs emission energy of 1.42 eV. However, the substantial quenching of PL emission for 1L-MoS2 at the energy of 1.84 eV, is attributed to the Dexter-type exciton transfer mechanism at type-I band alignment. THz time-domain spectroscopy reveals a significant increase in optoelectronic properties, such as optical conductivity becoming doubled, and a 50% reduction in absorption coefficients. The study introduces a new route for fabricating large-area and compact mixed-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures, which can be used to enhance the efficiency of conventional semiconductor technologies and THz-based optoelectronic devices."

In this paper, we propose Motus, a unified latent action world model that leverages existing general pretrained models and rich, sharable motion information. Motus introduces a Mixture-of-Transformer (MoT) architecture to integrate three experts (i.e., understanding, video generation, and action) and adopts a UniDiffuser-style scheduler to enable flexible switching between different modeling modes (i.e., world models, vision-language-action models, inverse dynamics models, video generation models, and video-action joint prediction models). Motus further leverages the optical flow to learn latent actions and adopts a recipe with three-phase training pipeline and six-layer data pyramid, thereby extracting pixel-level \"delta action\" and enabling large-scale action pretraining. Experiments show that Motus achieves superior performance against state-of-the-art methods in both simulation (a +15% improvement over X-VLA and a +45% improvement over Pi0.5) and real-world scenarios(improved by +11~48%), demonstrating unified modeling of all functionalities and priors significantly benefits downstream robotic tasks."

Such capability has broad implications for content creation, education, and human-AI interaction, yet existing video diffusion models struggle to maintain temporal consistency and controllability across long sequences of multiple action steps. We introduce a pipeline for future-driven streaming instructional video generation, dubbed SneakPeek, a diffusion-based autoregressive framework designed to generate precise, stepwise instructional videos conditioned on an initial image and structured textual prompts. Our approach introduces three key innovations to enhance consistency and controllability: (1) predictive causal adaptation, where a causal model learns to perform next-frame prediction and anticipate future keyframes; (2) future-guided self-forcing with a dual-region KV caching scheme to address the exposure bias issue at inference time; (3) multi-prompt conditioning, which provides fine-grained and procedural control over multi-step instructions. Together, these components mitigate temporal drift, preserve motion consistency, and enable interactive video generation where future prompt updates dynamically influence ongoing streaming video generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method produces temporally coherent and semantically faithful instructional videos that accurately follow complex, multi-step task descriptions."

Meanwhile, despite the success of deep learning in medical imaging, the lack of interpretability limits its clinical adoption. To address these challenges, we propose TWLR, a two-stage framework for interpretable diabetic retinopathy (DR) assessment. In the first stage, a vision-language model integrates domain-specific ophthalmological knowledge into text embeddings to jointly perform DR grading and lesion classification, effectively linking semantic medical concepts with visual features. The second stage introduces an iterative severity regression framework based on weakly-supervised semantic segmentation. Lesion saliency maps generated through iterative refinement direct a progressive inpainting mechanism that systematically eliminates pathological features, effectively downgrading disease severity toward healthier fundus appearances. Critically, this severity regression approach achieves dual benefits: accurate lesion localization without pixel-level supervision and providing an interpretable visualization of disease-to-healthy transformations. Experimental results on the FGADR, DDR, and a private dataset demonstrate that TWLR achieves competitive performance in both DR classification and lesion segmentation, offering a more explainable and annotation-efficient solution for automated retinal image analysis."

Unlike routing-based approaches or circuit methods that yield data-dependent unitaries, our Universal QRAM encodes data in memory qubits that act as quantum control signals within a block-diagonal permutation structure. The key insight is that memory qubits serve as control signals, enabling coherent lookup when addresses are in superposition. For N addresses with K-bit data words, the construction requires $\\log_2 N + K + NK$ qubits and decomposes into exactly $NK$ multi-controlled gates. We verify the construction for $N \\in \\{2, 4, 8, 16\\}$ and $K \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, confirming that the resulting unitary is a pure permutation matrix with zero error across all data configurations.

    "abstract": "MoE models offer efficient scaling through conditional computation, but their large parameter size and expensive expert offloading make on-device deployment challenging. Existing acceleration techniques such as prefetching or expert clustering often increase energy usage or reduce expert diversity. We present SliceMoE, an energy-efficient MoE inference framework for miss-rate-constrained deployment. SliceMoE introduces Dynamic Bit-Sliced Caching (DBSC), which caches experts at slice-level granularity and assigns precision on demand to expand effective expert capacity. To support mixed-precision experts without memory duplication, we propose Calibration-Free Asymmetric Matryoshka Quantization (AMAT), a truncation-based scheme that maintains compatibility between low-bit and high-bit slices. We further introduce Predictive Cache Warmup (PCW) to reduce early-decode cold misses by reshaping cache contents during prefill. Evaluated on DeepSeek-V2-Lite and Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B, SliceMoE reduces decode-stage energy consumption by up to 2.37x and 2.85x, respectively, and improves decode latency by up to 1.81x and 1.64x, while preserving near-high-bit accuracy. These results demonstrate that slice-level caching enables an efficient on-device MoE deployment."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes two new algorithms for the lane keeping system (LKS) in autonomous vehicles (AVs) operating under snowy road conditions. These algorithms use deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to handle uncertainties and slippage. They include Action-Robust Recurrent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (AR-RDPG) and end-to-end Action-Robust convolutional neural network Attention Deterministic Policy Gradient (AR-CADPG), two action-robust approaches for decision-making. In the AR-RDPG method, within the perception layer, camera images are first denoised using multi-scale neural networks. Then, the centerline coefficients are extracted by a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network (DCNN). These coefficients, concatenated with the driving characteristics, are used as input to the control layer. The AR-CADPG method presents an end-to-end approach in which a convolutional neural network (CNN) and an attention mechanism are integrated within a DRL framework. Both methods are first trained in the CARLA simulator and validated under various snowy scenarios. Real-world experiments on a Jetson Nano-based autonomous vehicle confirm the feasibility and stability of the learned policies. Among the two models, the AR-CADPG approach demonstrates superior path-tracking accuracy and robustness, highlighting the effectiveness of combining temporal memory, adversarial resilience, and attention mechanisms in AVs."

    "abstract": "The early time emission in tidal disruption events (TDEs) originates from both accretion and shocks, which produce photons that eventually emerge from an inhomogeneous photosphere. In this work, we model the disk formation following the debris stream self-intersection in a TDE. We track the multi-band emission using three-dimensional, frequency-integrated and multi-group radiation hydrodynamic simulations. We find a more circularized disk forms about 24 days following the initial stream-stream collision, after the mass fallback rate peaks and once the debris stream density decreases. Despite the absence of a circularized disk at early times, various shocks and the asymmetric photosphere are sufficient to drive a wide range of optical-to-X-ray ratios and soft-X-ray variability. We find that with strong apsidal precession, the first light is from the stream-stream collision. It launches an optically-thick outflow, but only produces modest prompt emission. The subsequent optical and ultraviolet (UV) light curve rise is mainly powered by shocks in the turbulent accretion flow close to the black hole. The optical-UV luminosity peaks roughly when the disk forms and shock-driven outflows subside. The disk is optically and geometrically thick, extending well beyond the circularization radius. Radiation pressure clears the polar region and leaves optically-thin channels. We obtain the broad-band spectral energy distribution (SED) directly from multi-group simulations with 16-20 frequency groups. The SED has a black body component that peaks in the extreme UV. The soft X-ray component either resembles a thermal tail, or can be described by a shallower power law associated with bulk Compton scattering. The blackbody parameters are broadly consistent with observed optical TDEs and vary weakly with viewing angle. In contrast, soft X-ray emission is highly angle-dependent."

However, this paper identifies a paradoxical phenomenon we term the Benefit then Conflict dilemma, where detector performance stagnates and eventually degrades as source diversity expands. Our systematic analysis, diagnoses this failure by identifying two core issues: severe data-level heterogeneity, which causes the feature distributions of real and synthetic images to increasingly overlap, and a critical model-level bottleneck from fixed, pretrained encoders that cannot adapt to the rising complexity. To address these challenges, we propose Generator-Aware Prototype Learning (GAPL), a framework that constrain representation with a structured learning paradigm. GAPL learns a compact set of canonical forgery prototypes to create a unified, low-variance feature space, effectively countering data heterogeneity.To resolve the model bottleneck, it employs a two-stage training scheme with Low-Rank Adaptation, enhancing its discriminative power while preserving valuable pretrained knowledge. This approach establishes a more robust and generalizable decision boundary. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that GAPL achieves state-of-the-art performance, showing superior detection accuracy across a wide variety of GAN and diffusion-based generators.

We introduce author labeling, an annotation technique where the writer of the document itself annotates the data at the moment of creation. We collaborate with a commercial chatbot with over 10,000 users to deploy an author labeling annotation system for subjective features related to product recommendation. This system identifies task-relevant queries, generates on-the-fly labeling questions, and records authors' answers in real time. We train and deploy an online-learning model architecture for product recommendation that continuously improves from author labeling and find it achieved a 534% increase in click-through rate compared to an industry advertising baseline running concurrently. We then compare the quality and practicality of author labeling to three traditional annotation approaches for sentiment analysis and find author labeling to be higher quality, faster to acquire, and cheaper. These findings reinforce existing literature that annotations, especially for egocentric and subjective beliefs, are significantly higher quality when labeled by the author rather than a third party.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in quantum optics have highlighted the critical role of spatial propagation in controlling the quantum coherence of light beams. However, the evolution of quantum coherence for light beams undergoing fundamental optical processes at dielectric interfaces remains unexplored. Furthermore, manipulating multiphoton correlations typically requires complex interactions that challenge few-photon level implementation. Here, we introduce a quantum van Cittert-Zernike theorem for light beams, describing how their coherence-polarization properties are influenced by reflection and refraction, as well as how these properties evolve upon subsequent propagation. Our work demonstrates that the quantum statistics of photonic systems can be controllably modified through the inherent polarization coupling arising from reflection and refraction at an interface, without relying on conventional light-matter interactions. Our approach reveals regimes where thermal light can exhibit sub-Poissonian statistics with fluctuations below the shot-noise level through post-selected measurements, and this statistical property can be tuned by the incident angle. Remarkably, this quantum statistical modification is governed by a scaling law linking beam collimation to far-field thermalization. Our work establishes a robust, decoherence-avoiding mechanism for quantum state control, advancing the fundamental understanding of coherence in quantum optics and opening new avenues for applications in quantum information and metrology."

    "abstract": "We extend our previous work on the energy loss of a heavy fermion in a QED plasma to the Quark-Gluon plasma, using the same Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook collisional kernel. The calculation is carried out with a theoretical method where the hard-thermal-loop resummed gluon propagator is used for arbitrary momentum transfer in the scattering processes. Encoding the collision effect in a self-consistent manner, the resummed gluon propagator regulates the infrared divergence in the scattering amplitude without introducing an artificial cutoff for the transferred momenta and makes the analysis on the hard and soft processes in a unified framework. To place our computation on a more solid foundation, we also explicitly demonstrate the gauge independence of the interaction rate as well as the elimination of unphysical gluon polarizations by the ghost field under the use of the resummed gluon propagator. In addition, with our complete QCD calculation by including both quark-quark and quark-gluon scatterings, we provide a quantitatively reliable result on the collisional energy loss of a heavy quark where the new contribution from quark-gluon scatterings accounts for a larger portion of the total energy loss. In general, collisions between the thermal partons result in an increased energy loss which becomes more pronounced with increasing gauge coupling. Considering a typical coupling constant in QCD, $α_s = 0.3$, the energy loss increases $\\sim 8$% at large incident velocities as compared to the collisionless limit. Such a collision-induced correction is still moderate although it is sightly suppressed as compared to our previous estimate based on a QED calculation using couplings consistent with those expected to be generated in the Quark-Gluon plasma."

This prediction has been tested by experiments that have focused on the Sivers functions so far. We examine the current status on the theoretical prediction and experimental extraction of the signs of the Boer-Mulders functions from SIDIS and DY.

In this work, we show that Gibbs states are completely characterized by assuming dynamical stability of the system itself and of the system in weak contact with an arbitrary environment. This builds on and strengthens a result by Frigerio, Gorini, and Verri (1986), who derived Gibbs states from dynamical stability using an additional assumption that they referred to as the \"zeroth law of thermodynamics\", as it concerns a nested dynamical stability of a triple of systems. We prove that this zeroth law is redundant and that an environment consisting solely of harmonic oscillators is sufficient to single out Gibbs states as the only dynamically stable states."

Prior-driven deblending techniques require extensive fine-tuning and struggle to process large fields. This work aims to develop a fast, reliable deep-learning based deconvolution and denoising super-resolution (SR) technique. We employ a transformer neural network to improve the resolution of Herschel/SPIRE 500 $μ$m observations by a factor 4.5, using Spitzer/MIPS 24$μ$m and Herschel/SPIRE 250, 350, 500$μ$m images. Trained on SIDES and SHARK simulations, we injected instrumental noise into the input simulated images, while keeping the target images noise-free to enhance de-noising capabilities of our method. We evaluated the performance on simulated test sets and real JCMT/SCUBA-2 450 $μ$m observations in the COSMOS field which have superior resolution compared to Herschel. Our SR method achieves an inference time of $1s/deg^2$ on consumer GPUs, much faster than traditional deblending techniques. Using the simulation test sets, we show that fluxes of the extracted sources from the super-resolved image are accurate to within 5% for sources with an intrinsic flux $\\gtrsim$ 8 mJy, which is a substantial improvement compared to blind extraction on the native images. Astrometric error is low ($\\lesssim$ 1\" vs 12\" pixel scale). Reliability is $\\gtrsim$ 90% for sources $>$3 mJy and $>$90% of sources with intrinsic fluxes $\\gtrsim5$ mJy are recovered. Applied to real 500 $μ$m observations, fluxes of the extracted sources from the super-resolved map agree well with SCUBA-2 measured fluxes for sources $\\geq$10 mJy. Our technique enables SR over hundreds of $deg^2$ without the need for fine-tuning, facilitating statistical analysis of DSFGs."

Validating five market microstructure patterns across 100 US equities from 2015 to 2024, the system yields modest annualized returns (0.55%, Sharpe ratio 0.33) with exceptional downside protection (maximum drawdown -2.76%) and market-neutral characteristics (beta = 0.058). Performance exhibits strong regime dependence, generating positive returns during high-volatility periods (0.60% quarterly, 2020-2024) while underperforming in stable markets (-0.16%, 2015-2019). We report statistically insignificant aggregate results (p-value 0.34) to demonstrate a reproducible, honest validation protocol that prioritizes interpretability and extends naturally to advanced hypothesis generators, including large language models. The key empirical finding reveals that daily OHLCV-based microstructure signals require elevated information arrival and trading activity to function effectively. The framework provides complete mathematical specifications and open-source implementation, establishing a template for rigorous trading system evaluation that addresses the reproducibility crisis in quantitative finance research.

We show that this conclusion becomes much weaker in the presence of astrophysical foregrounds and strongly non-Gaussian primordial density perturbations, by studying how these phenomena affect the link between SIGWs and PBHs, and reevaluate LISA's sensitivity to asteroid-mass PBHs. In addition, we analyse the interplay between PBHs and SIGWs to gain further insights into the nature of primordial non-Gaussianity. We find that uncertainties in $f_{\\rm NL}$ can induce substantial uncertainties in the PBH abundance, which ultimately limits LISA's capacity to fully probe the asteroid-mass PBH DM window."

The axion and dilaton arise as pseudo-Goldstone modes of symmetries that predict particle masses depend on the dilaton, and therefore to evolve cosmologically, leading to correlated modifications of recombination physics, the sound horizon, and late-time expansion and growth histories. We confront this model with Planck 2018 temperature, polarisation, and lensing data, SPT-3G high-$\\ell$ measurements, DESI DR2 BAO, and Pantheon$+$ supernovae, assuming that the axion makes up all of the dark matter and that the dilaton plays the role of a dark energy field.

The model fits this enlarged data set as well as the $w_0w_a$ model with an electron mass modified by hand at recombination, though it does so with calculable dynamics. Axio-dilaton self-interactions robustly fake a phantom equation of state in DESI measurements. There is a sting: cosmology prefers dilaton-matter couplings $|\\mathbf{g}|\\sim 10^{-2}$-$10^{-1}$, which are large enough to have been detected in solar-system tests of General Relativity. These results show how axio-dilatons can provide a viable cosmology preferred by current data at surprisingly large couplings, within a framework that links dark energy, dark matter, and time-dependent particle masses in a coherent way. They suggest both new observable signals and new theoretical directions, aimed at resolving the apparent inconsistency with non-cosmological observations."

Unlike conventional RAG pipelines, which require costly construction and maintenance of full-scale vector databases that mirror the entire file system, SPAR employs a lightweight two-stage process: a semantic Metadata Index is first created, after which session-specific vector databases are dynamically generated on demand. This design reduces computational overhead while improving transparency, controllability, and relevance in retrieval. We provide a theoretical complexity analysis comparing SPAR with standard LLM-based RAG pipelines, demonstrating its computational advantages. To validate the framework, we apply SPAR to a synthesized enterprise-scale file system containing a large corpus of biomedical literature, showing improvements in both retrieval effectiveness and downstream model accuracy. Finally, we discuss design trade-offs and outline open challenges for deploying SPAR across diverse enterprise settings."

    "abstract": "We introduce an enriched entanglement structure for spin networks, inspired by tensor-network constructions, in which internal links can carry a controlled and discrete amount of entanglement. In the spin-network picture, vertices are dual to simplices and links are dual to their faces. Standard spin-network gluing corresponds to fully identifying two simplices along a face, implemented by a maximally entangled, gauge-invariant singlet state on the corresponding link, while unglued faces correspond to links carrying no entanglement. Working on a complete graph, we promote this binary choice to a controlled and tunable structure by allowing each link to carry a variable amount of entanglement, interpolating between product states and the fully entangled singlet. The additional link variables therefore control not only the amount of entanglement but also the extent to which gauge invariance at internal links is preserved or broken, admitting an interpretation in terms of emergent edge-mode-like degrees of freedom. Within this framework, spin-network contraction defines a bulk-to-boundary map from link-entanglement data to boundary states. Adapting techniques developed in random tensor networks, we show that in a suitable large-spin regime the map is a co-isometry in expectation value. Restricting to a code subspace defined by configurations in which links are either effectively glued or open, with small fluctuations around this pattern, the map becomes an exact isometry. This yields a discrete and geometrically meaningful realization of holographic and error-correcting features within the spin-network Hilbert space."

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are being readily and rapidly adopted, increasingly permeating critical domains: from consumer platforms and enterprise software to networked systems with embedded agents. While this has unlocked potential for human productivity gains, the attack surface has expanded accordingly: threats now span content safety failures (e.g., harmful or deceptive outputs), model and data integrity compromise (e.g., poisoning, supply-chain tampering), runtime manipulations (e.g., prompt injection, tool and agent misuse), and ecosystem risks (e.g., orchestration abuse, multi-agent collusion). Existing frameworks such as MITRE ATLAS, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) AI 100-2 Adversarial Machine Learning (AML) taxonomy, and OWASP Top 10s for Large Language Models (LLMs) and Agentic AI Applications provide valuable viewpoints, but each covers only slices of this multi-dimensional space. This paper presents Cisco's Integrated AI Security and Safety Framework (\"AI Security Framework\"), a unified, lifecycle-aware taxonomy and operationalization framework that can be used to classify, integrate, and operationalize the full range of AI risks. It integrates AI security and AI safety across modalities, agents, pipelines, and the broader ecosystem. The AI Security Framework is designed to be practical for threat identification, red-teaming, risk prioritization, and it is comprehensive in scope and can be extensible to emerging deployments in multimodal contexts, humanoids, wearables, and sensory infrastructures. We analyze gaps in prevailing frameworks, discuss design principles for our framework, and demonstrate how the taxonomy provides structure for understanding how modern AI systems fail, how adversaries exploit these failures, and how organizations can build defenses across the AI lifecycle that evolve alongside capability advancements."

    "abstract": "Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) provides interpretable rule learning in relational domains, yet remains limited in its ability to induce and reason with numerical constraints. Classical ILP systems operate over discrete predicates and typically rely on discretisation or hand-crafted numerical predicates, making it difficult to infer thresholds or arithmetic relations that must hold jointly across examples. Recent work has begun to address these limitations through tighter integrations of ILP with Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) or specialised numerical inference mechanisms. In this paper we investigate a modular alternative that couples the ILP system PyGol with the SMT solver Z3. Candidate clauses proposed by PyGol are interpreted as quantifier-free formulas over background theories such as linear or nonlinear real arithmetic, allowing numerical parameters to be instantiated and verified by the SMT solver while preserving ILP's declarative relational bias. This supports the induction of hybrid rules that combine symbolic predicates with learned numerical constraints, including thresholds, intervals, and multi-literal arithmetic relations. We formalise this SMT-ILP setting and evaluate it on a suite of synthetic datasets designed to probe linear, relational, nonlinear, and multi-hop reasoning. The results illustrate how a modular SMT-ILP architecture can extend the expressivity of symbolic rule learning, complementing prior numerical ILP approaches while providing a flexible basis for future extensions toward richer theory-aware induction."

Despite significant efforts, great challenges lie in the experimental synthesis and transformation conditions of 2D diamond. Herein, we have demonstrated the experimental preparation of high quality 2D diamond with controlled thickness and distinguished properties, realized by laser-heating few-layer graphene in diamond anvil cell. The quenched 2D diamond exhibited narrow T2g Raman peak (linewidth ~3.6 cm-1) and intense photoluminescence of SiV- (linewidth ~6.1 nm) and NV0 centers. In terms of transformation mechanism, atomic structures of hybrid phase interfaces suggested that the intermediate rhombohedral phase subtly mediate hexagonal graphite to cubic diamond transition. Furthermore, the tunable optical bandgap and thermal stability of 2D diamond sensitively depend on its sp3 concentration. We believe our results can shed light on the structural design and preparation of many carbon allotropes and further uncover the underlying transition mechanism."

To assess the adequacy of this threshold, we propose an evaluation metric based on the cosine similarity between the singular vectors of the signal and original weight matrices. The proposed metric is used in numerical experiments to compare two threshold estimation methods."

In order to augment the fast local behavior of our SSN method with global efficiency guarantees, we develop a hybrid method that combines our SSN method with the state-of-the-art first-order method for game solving, Predictive Regret Matching$^+$ (PRM$^+$). Our hybrid algorithm leverages the global progress provided by PRM$^+$, while achieving a local superlinear convergence rate once it switches to SSN near a Nash equilibrium.

A detailed representation of the future traffic scenario is of significant importance for autonomous driving and for all active safety systems. In order to predict the future space-time representation of the traffic scenario, first the type of traffic scenario is identified and then the machine learning algorithm maps the current state of the scenario to possible future states. The input to the machine learning algorithms is the current state representation of a traffic scenario, termed as the Augmented Occupancy Grid (AOG). The output is the probabilistic space-time representation which includes uncertainties regarding the behaviour of the traffic participants and is termed as the Predicted Occupancy Grid (POG). The novel architecture consists of two Stacked Denoising Autoencoders (SDAs) and a set of Random Forests. It is then compared with the other two existing architectures that comprise of SDAs and DeconvNet. The architectures are validated with the help of simulations and the comparisons are made both in terms of accuracy and computational time. Also, a brief overview on the applications of POGs in the field of active safety is presented."

In this paper, we propose OptHQC, an optimized implementation of the HQC scheme to deliver high-performance cryptographic operations. Our approach provides a comprehensive analysis of each computational blocks in HQC and introduces optimizations across all three stages: key generation, encryption, and decryption. We first exploit data-level sparsity in vector multiplication to accelerate polynomial operations during vector generation. We then leverage instruction-level acceleration (e.g., AVX2) in hash computation to further improve performance. Last, we transform multiplication into lookup table indexing and optimize memory access patterns in syndrome computation and error vector recovery, which are the most computationally intensive operations in HQC. Overall, OptHQC achieves an average 55% speedup over the reference HQC implementation on CPU."

We will demonstrate for the first time that NG-RC can perform classification task as good as conventional RC. This validates the versatile computational capability of NG-RC in tasks of both prediction and classification."

However, the mechanisms controlling their size and the dynamics of their annihilation are still not fully understood. In this study, we present an analytical model that predicts the radius $R$ of the CB as a function of the external magnetic field, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), the magnetic anisotropy, and the exchange interaction. The micromagnetic simulations validate this model across a broad range of parameters. We also identify two mechanisms of annihilation of CBs: (i) a droplet-like instability that occurs under rapid changes in the magnetic field, which we describe using a proposed magnetic Weber number $We$ and its critical field step scaling; and (ii) Bloch point depinning mechanism at interfaces, for which we determine the threshold magnetic field $B_{\\text{th}}$ for annihilation. Importantly, we uncover a novel fragmentation pathway in which CBs transform into skyrmion tubes, then into half-CBs, and finally into ferromagnetic states. These findings lay the groundwork for understanding and manipulating 3D CBs as next-generation devices."

The full-day program balances theory (somatic psychology, embodied cognition, expressive biosignals), hands-on making, and comparative reflection to interrogate what analog and digital modalities respectively afford for awareness, expression, and meaning-making. Participants will (1) experience and compare analog and MR-based journaling of emotion; (2) prototype and critique mappings from biosignals to visual/spatial feedback; and (3) articulate design principles for trauma-informed, hybrid workflows that amplify interoceptive literacy without overwhelming the user.

Medical foundation models (FMs) have emerged as a promising approach for scaling to new tasks, yet current research suffers from three critical pitfalls: data-regime bias, suboptimal adaptation, and insufficient task coverage. In this paper, we address these pitfalls and introduce AnyMC3D, a scalable 3D classifier adapted from 2D FMs. Our method scales efficiently to new tasks by adding only lightweight plugins (about 1M parameters per task) on top of a single frozen backbone. This versatile framework also supports multi-view inputs, auxiliary pixel-level supervision, and interpretable heatmap generation. We establish a comprehensive benchmark of 12 tasks covering diverse pathologies, anatomies, and modalities, and systematically analyze state-of-the-art 3D classification techniques. Our analysis reveals key insights: (1) effective adaptation is essential to unlock FM potential, (2) general-purpose FMs can match medical-specific FMs if properly adapted, and (3) 2D-based methods surpass 3D architectures for 3D classification. For the first time, we demonstrate the feasibility of achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse applications using a single scalable framework (including 1st place in the VLM3D challenge), eliminating the need for separate task-specific models."

Their applications include, among many others, machine learning and modeling of autonomous systems. The analysis of probabilistic programs is often quantitative - it involves reasoning about numerical properties like probabilities and expectations. A particularly important quantitative property of probabilistic programs is their posterior distribution, i.e., the distribution over possible outputs for a given input (or prior) distribution. Computing the posterior distribution exactly is known as exact inference. We present our current research using weighted automata, a generalization of the well-known finite automata, for performing exact inference in a restricted class of discrete probabilistic programs. This is achieved by encoding distributions over program variables - possibly with infinite support - as certain weighted automata. The semantics of our programming language then corresponds to common automata-theoretic constructions, such as product, concatenation, and others."

    "abstract": "The automotive industry is undergoing transformation, driven by the electrification of powertrains, the rise of software-defined vehicles, and the adoption of circular economy concepts. These trends blur the boundaries between the automotive sector and other industries. Unlike internal combustion engine (ICE) production, where mechanical capabilities dominated, competitiveness in electric vehicle (EV) production increasingly depends on expertise in electronics, batteries, and software. This study investigates whether and how firms' ability to leverage cross-industry diversification contributes to competitive advantage. We develop a country-level product space covering all industries and an industry-specific product space covering over 900 automotive components. This allows us to identify clusters of parts that are exported together, revealing shared manufacturing capabilities. Closeness centrality in the country-level product space, rather than simple proximity, is a strong predictor of where new comparative advantages are likely to emerge. We examine this relationship across industrial sectors to establish patterns of path dependency, diversification and capability formation, and then focus on the EV transition. New strengths in vehicles and aluminium products in the EU are expected to generate 5 and 4.6 times more EV-specific strengths, respectively, than other EV-relevant sectors over the next decade, compared to only 1.6 and 4.5 new strengths in already diversified China. Countries such as South Korea, China, the US and Canada show strong potential for diversification into EV-related products, while established producers in the EU are likely to come under pressure. These findings suggest that the success of the automotive transformation depends on regions' ability to mobilize existing industrial capabilities, particularly in sectors such as machinery and electronic equipment."

However, most current systems treat all users as experts, leading to frustrating and inefficient interactions when users are unfamiliar with a domain. Systems that can adapt their conversational strategies to a user's knowledge level stand to offer a much more natural and effective experience. To make a step toward such adaptive systems, we introduce a new task: estimating user domain knowledge from conversations, enabling a CRS to better understand user needs and personalize interactions. A key obstacle to developing such adaptive systems is the lack of suitable data; to our knowledge, no existing dataset captures the conversational behaviors of users with varying levels of domain knowledge. Furthermore, in most dialogue collection protocols, users are free to express their own preferences, which tends to concentrate on popular items and well-known features, offering little insight into how novices explore or learn about unfamiliar features. To address this, we design a game-based data collection protocol that elicits varied expressions of knowledge, release the resulting dataset, and provide an initial analysis to highlight its potential for future work on user-knowledge-aware CRS."

    "abstract": "Effective human-agent collaboration is increasingly prevalent in real-world applications. Current trends in such collaborations are predominantly unidirectional, with users providing instructions or posing questions to agents, where agents respond directly without seeking necessary clarifications or confirmations. However, the evolving capabilities of these agents require more proactive engagement, where agents should dynamically participate in conversations to clarify user intents, resolve ambiguities, and adapt to changing circumstances. Existing prior work under-utilize the conversational capabilities of language models (LMs), thereby optimizing agents as better followers rather than effective speakers. In this work, we introduce SpeakRL, a reinforcement learning (RL) method that enhances agents' conversational capabilities by rewarding proactive interactions with users, such as asking right clarification questions when necessary. To support this, we curate SpeakER, a synthetic dataset that includes diverse scenarios from task-oriented dialogues, where tasks are resolved through interactive clarification questions. We present a systematic analysis of reward design for conversational proactivity and propose a principled reward formulation for teaching agents to balance asking with acting. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves a 20.14% absolute improvement in task completion over base models without increasing conversation turns even surpassing even much larger proprietary models, demonstrating the promise of clarification-centric user-agent interactions."

Low-scale alternatives such as the inverse seesaw improve testability but typically lack a strong theoretical motivation. In this paper we bridge this gap by showing that gauging the discrete symmetry $\\mathbb Z_4 \\times \\mathbb Z_3$-motivated by the internal structure of the Standard Model-naturally yields a QCD axion with a high-quality Peccei-Quinn symmetry solving the strong CP problem, while simultaneously enforcing the field content and hierarchy required for a natural inverse seesaw. The resulting model is highly predictive and has the potential to be fully tested by future experiments.

    "abstract": "Conversational agents often encounter ambiguous user requests, requiring an effective clarification to successfully complete tasks. While recent advancements in real-world applications favor multi-agent architectures to manage complex conversational scenarios efficiently, ambiguity resolution remains a critical and underexplored challenge--particularly due to the difficulty of determining which agent should initiate a clarification and how agents should coordinate their actions when faced with uncertain or incomplete user input. The fundamental questions of when to interrupt a user and how to formulate the optimal clarification query within the most optimal multi-agent settings remain open. In this paper, we propose MAC (Multi-Agent Clarification), an interactive multi-agent framework specifically optimized to resolve user ambiguities by strategically managing clarification dialogues. We first introduce a novel taxonomy categorizing user ambiguities to systematically guide clarification strategies. Then, we present MAC that autonomously coordinates multiple agents to interact synergistically with users. Empirical evaluations on MultiWOZ 2.4 demonstrate that enabling clarification at both levels increases task success rate 7.8\\% (54.5 to 62.3) and reduces the average number of dialogue turns (6.53 to 4.86) by eliciting all required user information up front and minimizing repetition. Our findings highlight the importance of active user interaction and role-aware clarification for more reliable human-agent communication."

    "abstract": "We consider a renewal process which models a cumulative shock model that fails when the accumulation of shocks up-crosses a certain threshold. The ratio limit properties of the probabilities of non-failure after n cumulative shocks are studied. We establish that the ratio of survival probabilities converges to the probability that the renewal epoch equals zero. This limit holds for any renewal process, subject only to mild regularity conditions on the individual shock random variable. Precisions on the rates of convergence are provided depending on the support structure and the regularity of the distribution. Arguments are provided to highlight the coherence between this new results and the pre-existing results on the behavior of summands of i.i.d. real random variables."

We summarize the current limitations, including calibration across Galactic environments and the impact of internal stellar evolution, and define the observational requirements needed to overcome them. The Wide-field Spectroscopic Telescope (WST), with its large field of view, high multiplex, and broad wavelength coverage at high spectral resolution, is uniquely suited to deliver the homogeneous datasets required to map the age structure of the Galaxy at unprecedented scale. Such a capability will enable decisive progress in Galactic archaeology and stellar evolution studies."

In this study, we present new VLBI astrometry of 11 radio stars using the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), expanding the existing sample with positions, parallaxes, and proper motions measured. All 11 radio stars were detected, for 10 of which parallaxes and proper motions can be estimated, reaching a precision level of <1% in the best cases.

They are recognized as the most evolved population of hydrogen-rich cataclysmic variables. Yet they exhibit energetic disk-powered outbursts with an amplitude of 6-9 mag, duration of a month, and decade-long outburst cycles. Despite the dramatic increase in the number of WZ Sge stars over the last decades, there are many unresolved questions, both in terms of their binary evolution and outburst mechanism. In this proceeding paper, I review the recent studies on WZ Sge stars, focusing on their outbursts. Recent observations, both photometrically and spectroscopically, have found the absence of enhanced emission from the hotspot during the early outburst rise in WZ Sge stars, casting doubt on the occurrence of the enhanced mass transfer. Meanwhile, several WZ Sge stars are newly suggested to harbor a magnetic white dwarf, inferring an inner disk truncation in quiescence. Diversity among systems has been discovered: a WZ Sge star with superoutbursts both accompanying and lacking an early superhump phase, one possibly harboring an ONe and massive white dwarf, and one showing optical spectra strongly affected by disk winds. I introduce the connections of WZ Sge stars to period bouncers, helium-rich AM CVn stars, and low-mass X-ray binaries. Finally, prospects of WZ Sge stars in the upcoming time-domain surveys, such as the Rubin Observatory LSST, are presented."

Specifically, the two QPO types were detected simultaneously but exhibited distinct energy dependencies: the type-C QPO was dominant in the hard X-ray band (10-30 keV), while the type-B QPO was more prominent in the soft X-ray band (1-10 keV). Further analysis reveals that the emergence of the type-C QPO suppresses the strength of the type-B QPO, particularly above 10 keV. Tracking the detailed evolution of these QPOs, we find that the weakening of the type-B QPO coincides with the strengthening of the type-C QPO, indicating a competitive interaction between them. These findings reveal a more complex relationship between type-B and type-C QPOs than previously recognized, suggesting they originate from distinct but interacting physical components within the accretion flow and/or jet, and providing new insights into the dynamics of accretion state transitions."

We develop an anytime-valid, data-dependent upper confidence sequence for the weighted average suboptimality of projected SGD, constructed via nonnegative supermartingales and requiring no smoothness or strong convexity. This confidence sequence yields a simple stopping rule that is provably $\\varepsilon$-optimal with probability at least $1-α$ and is almost surely finite under standard stochastic approximation stepsizes. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first rigorous, time-uniform performance guarantees and finite-time $\\varepsilon$-optimality certificates for projected SGD with general convex objectives, based solely on observable trajectory quantities."

    "abstract": "Current methods for dense 3D point tracking in dynamic scenes typically rely on pairwise processing, require known camera poses, or assume a temporal ordering to input frames, constraining their flexibility and applicability. Additionally, recent advances have successfully enabled efficient 3D reconstruction from large-scale, unposed image collections, underscoring opportunities for unified approaches to dynamic scene understanding. Motivated by this, we propose DePT3R, a novel framework that simultaneously performs dense point tracking and 3D reconstruction of dynamic scenes from multiple images in a single forward pass. This multi-task learning is achieved by extracting deep spatio-temporal features with a powerful backbone and regressing pixel-wise maps with dense prediction heads. Crucially, DePT3R operates without requiring camera poses, substantially enhancing its adaptability and efficiency-especially important in dynamic environments with rapid changes. We validate DePT3R on several challenging benchmarks involving dynamic scenes, demonstrating strong performance and significant improvements in memory efficiency over existing state-of-the-art methods.

In this work, we investigate amorphous graphene and demonstrate that persistent homology, a topological data analysis technique, can serve as a physically interpretable structural descriptor for predicting thermal conductivity. We first show that ridge regression using persistent homology descriptors achieves high prediction accuracy. To gain physical insight into the prediction process, we perform inverse analysis by mapping the regression coefficients back onto the persistence diagrams. This reveals that distorted hexagonal and triangular motifs are strongly correlated with reduced thermal conductivity. A further comparison with the spatial distribution of localized vibrational modes supports the physical interpretation that these motifs suppress thermal transport. Our findings highlight that persistent homology not only enables accurate prediction of physical properties but also uncovers meaningful structure-property relationships in two-dimensional amorphous materials. This approach offers a promising framework for interpretable machine-learning models in materials science."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, they often struggle with long-text sequences due to the ``lost in the middle'' phenomenon. This issue has been shown to arise from a U-shaped attention bias, where attention is disproportionately focused on the beginning and end of a text, leaving the middle section underrepresented. While previous studies have attributed this bias to position encoding, our research first identifies an additional factor: initial saliency. It means that in the attention computation for each token, tokens with higher attention weights relative to the initial token tend to receive more attention in the prediction of the next token. We further find that utilizing this property by scaling attention weight between the initial token and others improves the model's ability to process long contexts, achieving a maximum improvement of 3.6\\% in MDQA dataset. Moreover, combining this approach with existing methods to reduce position encoding bias further enhances performance, achieving a maximum improvement of 3.4\\% in KV-Retrieval tasks."

    "abstract": "Change detection (CD) identifies scene changes from multi-temporal observations and is widely used in urban development and environmental monitoring. Most existing CD methods rely on supervised learning, making performance strongly dataset-dependent and incurring high annotation costs; they typically focus on a few predefined categories and generalize poorly to diverse scenes. With the rise of vision foundation models such as SAM2 and CLIP, new opportunities have emerged to relax these constraints. We propose Unified Open-Vocabulary Change Detection (UniVCD), an unsupervised, open-vocabulary change detection method built on frozen SAM2 and CLIP. UniVCD detects category-agnostic changes across diverse scenes and imaging geometries without any labeled data or paired change images. A lightweight feature alignment module is introduced to bridge the spatially detailed representations from SAM2 and the semantic priors from CLIP, enabling high-resolution, semantically aware change estimation while keeping the number of trainable parameters small. On top of this, a streamlined post-processing pipeline is further introduced to suppress noise and pseudo-changes, improving the detection accuracy for objects with well-defined boundaries. Experiments on several public BCD (Binary Change Detection) and SCD (Semantic Change Detection) benchmarks show that UniVCD achieves consistently strong performance and matches or surpasses existing open-vocabulary CD methods in key metrics such as F1 and IoU. The results demonstrate that unsupervised change detection with frozen vision foundation models and lightweight multi-modal alignment is a practical and effective paradigm for open-vocabulary CD. Code and pretrained models will be released at https://github.com/Die-Xie/UniVCD."

To bridge this gap, we propose a Spatial-Aware VLA Pretraining paradigm that performs explicit alignment between visual space and physical space during pretraining, enabling models to acquire 3D spatial understanding before robot policy learning. Starting from pretrained vision-language models, we leverage large-scale human demonstration videos to extract 3D visual and 3D action annotations, forming a new source of supervision that aligns 2D visual observations with 3D spatial reasoning. We instantiate this paradigm with VIPA-VLA, a dual-encoder architecture that incorporates a 3D visual encoder to augment semantic visual representations with 3D-aware features. When adapted to downstream robot tasks, VIPA-VLA achieves significantly improved grounding between 2D vision and 3D action, resulting in more robust and generalizable robotic policies."

In gauge theories, the full potential of this tool is revealed when it is combined with the Slavanov-Taylor identities associated with the local gauge symmetry. Hence, it is desirable to have perturbative expansion of scattering amplitudes that combine the graphical nature of Feynman diagram expansion and the reations among various diagrams due to the Slavanov-Taylor identities. In a remarkable paper, motivated by the similarity between graph homology and the gauge theory BRST homology, Kreimer, Sars and van Suijlekom found such an expansion. The implication of this expansion is that the amplitudes in a generic non-abelian gauge theory can be constructed by transmuting the renormalised integrands of trivalent Feynman diagrams in a scalar quantum field theory. In this paper, we show that this surprising connection naturally emerges from Witten's open string field theory in the field theory limit."

To address these challenges in the complex environment of roundabout intersections, this paper proposes a roundabout control algorithm, which takes into account the uncertainty of interactive information caused by time delays. First, to maintain the required distance between the current vehicle and its preceding and following vehicles, conflicting vehicles are identified based on the time-to-collision (TTC) in the conflict zone. To fully consider communication performance, a vehicle motion model incorporating time delays is established. According to the distributed model predictive control (DMPC) mechanism, the vehicle motion control that satisfies the roundabout constraints is determined. Second, by scheduling the sequence of vehicles entering the roundabout, a multiscale optimization objective is developed by integrating vehicle motion indicators and roundabout system indicators. Traffic density and travel time are embedded into the optimization problem to guide vehicles to enter the roundabout safely and stably. Through a variety of simulation experiments, the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm is verified by comparing its performance with that of multiple control algorithms under different autonomous vehicle penetration rates and heavy traffic load scenarios."

However, real-world applications often face situations where no training data is available, such as when launching new services or handling entirely new users. In such cases, conventional approaches cannot be applied. This study focuses on training-free recommendation, where no task-specific training is performed, and particularly on \\textit{training-free cold-start recommendation} (TFCSR), the more challenging case where the target user has no interactions. Large language models (LLMs) have recently been explored as a promising solution, and numerous studies have been proposed. As the ability of text embedding models (TEMs) increases, they are increasingly recognized as applicable to training-free recommendation, but no prior work has directly compared LLMs and TEMs under identical conditions. We present the first controlled experiments that systematically evaluate these two approaches in the same setting. The results show that TEMs outperform LLM rerankers, and this trend holds not only in cold-start settings but also in warm-start settings with rich interactions. These findings indicate that direct LLM ranking is not the only viable option, contrary to the commonly shared belief, and TEM-based approaches provide a stronger and more scalable basis for training-free recommendation."

Relative to its 2022 outburst, we measure a long-term spin-down of ~-2x10^-14 Hz s^-1, consistent with magnetic-dipole braking in quiescence. The pulse profile is nearly sinusoidal, with significant power at the fundamental, second, and fifth harmonics; the fractional amplitude decreases with increasing flux and shows soft lags up to a few keV. The 0.5-10 keV spectrum is well described by absorbed thermal Comptonisation (photon index ~2.4) plus a cool blackbody (kT ~0.23 keV) consistent with emission from a surface hotspot; no reflection or Fe-line features are detected. Requiring R_m \\leq R_co implies B_s ~(0.5-3)x10^8 G for d=(5 \\pm 2) kpc and ξ=0.3-0.5, below the upper limit from the secular spin-down (B_p \\leq 10^9 G), possibly indicating a mildly leaky propeller. The optical emission lies on the neutron-star branch of the L_OIR-L_X relation, consistent with reprocessing in a compact disc. The optical SEDs are broadly flat, while an early red excess suggests a transient jet contribution during the initial hard X-ray phase; an optical peak delayed relative to the X-rays may trace an outward-propagating heating front and rapid disc evolution in these short-lived outbursts."

    "abstract": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright, millisecond-duration radio bursts with poorly known origins. Most FRB sources are detected only once, while some are repeaters. Variation patterns observed in the rotation measure (RM) of some repeaters -- indicate that the local magneto-ionic environments of these FRB sources are highly dynamic. It has been suggested that a Be star-magnetar binary system is a possible origin for such variation. FRB 20201124A is notable among these sources since it is the most active one and exhibits substantial temporal variations of RM measured by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The physics behind this long-term behavior is poorly understood. Here we propose that, within the framework of the Be star-magnetar binary scenario, the observed variation of RM is attributed to a combination of orbital motion and the precession of the circumstellar disk of the Be star. While a ~785-day precession of the disk contributes to the observed decrease in the amplitude of the variation, our model predicts that the amplitude oscillates with this period."

Current benchmarks, however, evaluate VSS primarily on the recall-latency trade-off against a ground truth defined solely by distance metrics, neglecting how retrieval quality ultimately impacts downstream tasks. This disconnect can mislead both academic research and industrial practice. We present Iceberg, a holistic benchmark suite for end-to-end evaluation of VSS methods in realistic application contexts. From a task-centric view, Iceberg uncovers the Information Loss Funnel, which identifies three principal sources of end-to-end performance degradation: (1) Embedding Loss during feature extraction; (2) Metric Misuse, where distances poorly reflect task relevance; (3) Data Distribution Sensitivity, highlighting index robustness across skews and modalities. For a more comprehensive assessment, Iceberg spans eight diverse datasets across key domains such as image classification, face recognition, text retrieval, and recommendation systems. Each dataset, ranging from 1M to 100M vectors, includes rich, task-specific labels and evaluation metrics, enabling assessment of retrieval algorithms within the full application pipeline rather than in isolation. Iceberg benchmarks 13 state-of-the-art VSS methods and re-ranks them based on application-level metrics, revealing substantial deviations from traditional rankings derived purely from recall-latency evaluations. Building on these insights, we define a set of task-centric meta-features and derive an interpretable decision tree to guide practitioners in selecting and tuning VSS methods for their specific workloads."

In this work, we investigate the case where $\\mathbf{R}$ is the path measure of a diffusion process with killing, which we interpret as a regime-switching diffusion. In addition to matching the initial and terminal distributions of trajectories that survive up to time $T$, we consider a general constraint $ψ(t,x)$ on the distribution of killing times and/or killing locations. We investigate the uSBPs corresponding to four choices of $ψ$ in detail which reflect different levels of information available to an observer. We also provide a rigorous analysis of the connections and the comparisons among the outcomes of these four cases. Our results are novel in the field of uSBP. The regime-switching approach proposed in this work provides a unified framework for tackling different uSBP scenarios, which not only reconciles but also extends the existing literature on uSBP."

    "abstract": "Normal networks are an important class of phylogenetic networks that have compelling mathematical properties which align with intuition about inference from genetic data. While tools enabling widespread use of phylogenetic networks in the biological literature are still under mathematical, statistical, and computational development, many such results are being assembled, and in particular for normal phylogenetic networks. For instance, it has been shown that binary normal networks can be reconstructed from the sets of three- and four-leaf rooted phylogenetic trees that they display. It is also known that one can reconstruct particular subclasses of normal networks from just the displayed rooted triples. This applies, for instance, to rooted binary phylogenetic trees and to binary level-$1$ normal networks. In this paper we address the question of how much of the class of binary normal networks can be reconstructed from just the rooted triples that they display. We find that all except those with substructures that we call ``near-sibling reticulations'' and ``near-stack reticulations'' can be reconstructed just from their rooted triples. This goes some way to answering the natural question of how much information can be extracted from a set of displayed rooted triples, which are arguably the simplest substructure that one may hope for in a phylogenetic object."

The key technical breakthroughs of QwenLong-L1.5 are as follows: (1) Long-Context Data Synthesis Pipeline: We develop a systematic synthesis framework that generates challenging reasoning tasks requiring multi-hop grounding over globally distributed evidence. By deconstructing documents into atomic facts and their underlying relationships, and then programmatically composing verifiable reasoning questions, our approach creates high-quality training data at scale, moving substantially beyond simple retrieval tasks to enable genuine long-range reasoning capabilities. (2) Stabilized Reinforcement Learning for Long-Context Training: To overcome the critical instability in long-context RL, we introduce task-balanced sampling with task-specific advantage estimation to mitigate reward bias, and propose Adaptive Entropy-Controlled Policy Optimization (AEPO) that dynamically regulates exploration-exploitation trade-offs. (3) Memory-Augmented Architecture for Ultra-Long Contexts: Recognizing that even extended context windows cannot accommodate arbitrarily long sequences, we develop a memory management framework with multi-stage fusion RL training that seamlessly integrates single-pass reasoning with iterative memory-based processing for tasks exceeding 4M tokens. Based on Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking, QwenLong-L1.5 achieves performance comparable to GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Pro on long-context reasoning benchmarks, surpassing its baseline by 9.90 points on average. On ultra-long tasks (1M~4M tokens), QwenLong-L1.5's memory-agent framework yields a 9.48-point gain over the agent baseline. Additionally, the acquired long-context reasoning ability translates to enhanced performance in general domains like scientific reasoning, memory tool using, and extended dialogue."

Although several studies have explored this setting, the recommendation performance remains suboptimal, mainly due to two fundamental challenges: the heterogeneity of user behaviors and data sparsity. To address these challenges, we propose BLADE, a framework that enhances multi-behavior modeling while mitigating data sparsity. Specifically, to handle behavior heterogeneity, we introduce a dual item-behavior fusion architecture that incorporates behavior information at both the input and intermediate levels, enabling preference modeling from multiple perspectives. To mitigate data sparsity, we design three behavior-level data augmentation methods that operate directly on behavior sequences rather than core item sequences. These methods generate diverse augmented views while preserving the semantic consistency of item sequences. These augmented views further enhance representation learning and generalization via contrastive learning. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."

Current methods inadequately address unwanted influence from original content styles and style reference content features. We introduce SCAdapter, a novel technique leveraging CLIP image space to effectively separate and integrate content and style features. Our key innovation systematically extracts pure content from content images and style elements from style references, ensuring authentic transfers. This approach is enhanced through three components: Controllable Style Adaptive Instance Normalization (CSAdaIN) for precise multi-style blending, KVS Injection for targeted style integration, and a style transfer consistency objective maintaining process coherence. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate SCAdapter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both conventional and diffusion-based baselines. By eliminating DDIM inversion and inference-stage optimization, our method achieves at least $2\\times$ faster inference than other diffusion-based approaches, making it both more effective and efficient for practical applications."

    "abstract": "We show that quantum oracles provide an advantage over classical oracles for answering classical counterfactual questions in causal models, or equivalently, for identifying unknown causal parameters such as distributions over functional dependences. In structural causal models with discrete classical variables, observational data and even ideal interventions generally fail to answer all counterfactual questions, since different causal parameters can reproduce the same observational and interventional data while disagreeing on counterfactuals. Using a simple binary example, we demonstrate that if the classical variables of interest are encoded in quantum systems and the causal dependence among them is encoded in a quantum oracle, coherently querying the oracle enables the identification of all causal parameters -- hence all classical counterfactuals. We generalize this to arbitrary finite cardinalities and prove that coherent probing 1) allows the identification of all two-way joint counterfactuals p(Y_x=y, Y_{x'}=y'), which is not possible with any number of queries to a classical oracle, and 2) provides tighter bounds on higher-order multi-way counterfactuals than with a classical oracle. This work can also be viewed as an extension to traditional quantum oracle problems such as Deutsch--Jozsa to identifying more causal parameters beyond just, e.g., whether a function is constant or balanced. Finally, we raise the question of whether this quantum advantage relies on uniquely non-classical features like contextuality. We provide some evidence against this by showing that in the binary case, oracles in some classically-explainable theories like Spekkens' toy theory also give rise to a counterfactual identifiability advantage over strictly classical oracles."

RVM learns via an asymmetric masked prediction task requiring only a standard pixel reconstruction objective. This design yields a highly efficient ``generalist'' encoder: RVM achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art video models (e.g. VideoMAE, V-JEPA) on video-level tasks like action recognition and point/object tracking, while also performing favorably against image models (e.g. DINOv2) on tasks that test geometric and dense spatial understanding. Notably, RVM achieves strong performance in the small-model regime without requiring knowledge distillation, exhibiting up to 30x greater parameter efficiency than competing video masked autoencoders. Moreover, we demonstrate that RVM's recurrent nature allows for stable feature propagation over long temporal horizons with linear computational cost, overcoming some of the limitations of standard spatio-temporal attention-based architectures. Finally, we use qualitative visualizations to highlight that RVM learns rich representations of scene semantics, structure, and motion."

We synthesise images representing a deep imaging survey, with realistic instrumental and confusion noise, reflecting the latest PRIMAger instrument specifications. We present a new Bayesian modelling approach XID+stepwise that exploits PRIMAger's hyperspectral imaging to derive self-consistent, informative flux priors by sequentially propagating constraints from short to long wavelengths. With Euclid-like prior source positions, this method recovers fluxes to within 20% to 0.2-0.7 mJy across 45-84 um, which correspond to factors of 1.3-3.4 fainter than the confusion limit. For the most confusion-dominated channels, accurate fluxes are measured to 0.9, 2.5, 7.6 and 14.8 mJy at 92, 126, 183 and 235 um, respectively, which are factors of 3-5 better than the confusion limit. Using a deeper Euclid-based prior catalogue and weak ancillary flux priors at 25 um yields further improvements, reaching up to a factor ~7 fainter than the confusion limit at 96 um. Additionally, we demonstrate that positional priors from blind source detection followed by deblending via XID+ enables PRIMAger to achieve sensitivity beyond the confusion limits using PRIMAger data alone. We show that IR-luminous galaxies at z~2 are robustly detected in a large fraction of the PRIMAger channels (>98% in 12 out of the 16 considered channels), providing dense sampling of the FIR SED even for sources several factors below the confusion limit. We explore the impact on our results for a range of systematic effects, including cirrus contamination, optical degradation, and calibration uncertainties. These findings indicate that confusion noise will not limit the key science from PRIMA extragalactic imaging surveys when employing XID+."

We point out that the relevant mechanism is not intrinsically field-theoretic, but is essentially a quantum tunneling/evanescent matter channel, which is already captured within ordinary quantum mechanics. More importantly, the microscopic constituents of realistic macroscopic objects are bound and localized by strong potentials, introducing a large internal energy scale that suppresses coherent propagation between distant bodies. Including such binding/localization generically yields an exponential suppression, rendering the matter-mediated contribution negligible at the macroscopic separations relevant to gravitational-entanglement proposals. Consequently, the entanglement identified by AH diagnoses the presence of a coherent matter-exchange channel rather than the classical or quantum nature of gravity, and it does not undermine LOCC-based witness arguments in realistic bound-matter platforms."

In noncentrosymmetric materials, nonreciprocal transport with quantum geometric origin remains prominent with localized charge independent of vanished group velocity. The discovery of such nonreciprocal and nonlinear responses was realized by recent advances in two-dimensional materials. As a promising candidate, the electronic structure and symmetry of layered hybrid perovskites can be deliberately designed and manipulated by incorporating selected organic ligands. Despite the observation of exotic photogalvanic effects and chiral optical effects, the underlying mechanism how these nonlinear responses are enabled in the multi-quantum well structures remained unclear. Here we demonstrated the quantum geometric origin for interlayer spontaneous photocurrent in (PEA)2PbI4. Contrary to assumptions that charge transport across the 2D planes is limited, we observed a spontaneous photocurrent along this crystalline orientation. Theoretical analysis using a tight-binding model identifies shift current as the microscopic origin. This quantum geometric effect is enabled by ionic displacements from centrosymmetric coordinates and enhanced by multiband transition high-density bands of the layered hybrid crystal. We anticipate that such unique low-dimensional systems with structure can provide fertile ground for discovering novel optoelectronic functionalities."

As probed by Raman spectroscopy, modest and significant phonon energy redshifts occur following 98Mo and 18O enrichment, respectively.

While eSignatures' concrete legal effects depend on the individual case, QESs constitute the highest level of technical protection and authenticity under eIDAS. QESs are based on a qualified certificate issued by a qualified trust service provider (QTSP). Despite legal requirements, technically, a QTSP represents a single point of failure. Contrary, privacy-preserving collaborative computations (P2C2s) have become increasingly practical in recent years; yet lacking an extensive investigation on potential integrations in the QES landscape. We perform a threat analysis on the QES-creation process of Austria's national eID, using STRIDE and a DREAD-like model to extract requirement challenges (RCs) primarily related to: (1) Distributed Service Robustness, (2) Agile Crypto Deployment, and (3) Active User Involvement. To address these RCs, we present QoeSiGN, utilizing novel P2C2 technologies. While currently no P2C2 addresses all RCs, legal aspects, and practical efficiency simultaneously, QoeSiGN gives instantiation possibilities for different needs. For instance, \"Multi-Party HSMs\" for distributed hardware-secured computations; or secure multi-party computation (software) for highest crypto agility and user involvement, where the user participates in the QES computation. Deployment-wise, QTSPs would need to adapt the signing process and setup trusted communication channels. Legal-wise, QoeSiGN's implementation appears permissible, needing further analysis for realization. Technically, QoeSiGN addresses some regulation requirements better than the current solution, such as \"sole control\" or crypto agility. Our identified threats and extracted requirements can be transferred to the general QES ecosystem."

Using these methods, we obtain closed-form expressions for the leading contribution to the full infinite set of tree amplitudes involving any number of Goldstone and Higgs-like external states. These results are then used to derive total cross sections, decay rates, and perturbative unitarity bounds. We then apply our general formalism to the Standard Model scalar sector using the equivalence theorem, working in the regime of small field-space curvature, and use it to characterise the relation between Higgs Effective Field Theory (HEFT) and the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). We analyse three representative classes of models. Two reproduce previously known behaviours, while the third, based on a dilaton effective theory, exhibits a noteworthy feature within the HEFT framework: a smooth decoupling limit that connects HEFT directly to the Standard Model without passing through a SMEFT regime, providing a possible backdoor to the Standard Model."

A world model should possess three essential properties: controllability, long-term visual quality, and temporal consistency. To this end, we take a progressive approach-first enhancing controllability and then extending toward long-term, high-quality generation. We present LongVie 2, an end-to-end autoregressive framework trained in three stages: (1) Multi-modal guidance, which integrates dense and sparse control signals to provide implicit world-level supervision and improve controllability; (2) Degradation-aware training on the input frame, bridging the gap between training and long-term inference to maintain high visual quality; and (3) History-context guidance, which aligns contextual information across adjacent clips to ensure temporal consistency. We further introduce LongVGenBench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 100 high-resolution one-minute videos covering diverse real-world and synthetic environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LongVie 2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in long-range controllability, temporal coherence, and visual fidelity, and supports continuous video generation lasting up to five minutes, marking a significant step toward unified video world modeling."

Learning-based approaches to dimensionality reduction, utilizing neural networks and autoencoders, have shown great potential to alleviate this problem. However, ensuring the correctness of the resulting verification results remains an open question. In this work, we provide a formal approach to reduce the dimensionality of systems via convex autoencoders and learn the dynamics in the latent space through a kernel-based method. We then construct a finite abstraction from the learned model in the latent space and guarantee that the abstraction contains the true behaviors of the original system. We show that the verification results in the latent space can be mapped back to the original system. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on multiple systems, including a 26D system controlled by a neural network, showing significant scalability improvements without loss of rigor."

In this work, we highlight the direct connection between the low accuracy of AM1-BCC charges on polar species and the poor accuracy of corresponding hydration free energy calculations. We then propose an XGBoost regressor trained on atomic descriptors to rapidly predict charges obtained with high-fidelity density functional theory calculations at PBE0-D3(BJ)/def2-TZVP level. The more accurate electrostatic description results in more reliable free energy calculations than those obtained with semi-empirical AM1-BCC charges. Finally, we leverage this predictive model in combination with a 1 ns gas-phase molecular dynamics simulation to propose the Boltzmann Percentile method for assigning charges representative of the conformational ensemble of a molecule. Charges obtained with this method are robust to different input conformations, and the resulting free energies, calculated on a subset of the FreeSolv dataset, show a root mean squared error of 1.69 kcal/mol against the 3.05 kcal/mol obtained with semi-empirical charges as well as a significantly better ranking. Our method is easily integrable in the traditional workflow and requires the same computational resources. These two aspects make it a realistic tool for enhancing already expensive free energy calculations, and more in general, molecular dynamics simulations in condensed phase."

    "abstract": "Neural networks achieve remarkable performance through superposition: encoding multiple features as overlapping directions in activation space rather than dedicating individual neurons to each feature. This challenges interpretability, yet we lack principled methods to measure superposition. We present an information-theoretic framework measuring a neural representation's effective degrees of freedom. We apply Shannon entropy to sparse autoencoder activations to compute the number of effective features as the minimum neurons needed for interference-free encoding. Equivalently, this measures how many \"virtual neurons\" the network simulates through superposition. When networks encode more effective features than actual neurons, they must accept interference as the price of compression. Our metric strongly correlates with ground truth in toy models, detects minimal superposition in algorithmic tasks, and reveals systematic reduction under dropout. Layer-wise patterns mirror intrinsic dimensionality studies on Pythia-70M. The metric also captures developmental dynamics, detecting sharp feature consolidation during grokking. Surprisingly, adversarial training can increase effective features while improving robustness, contradicting the hypothesis that superposition causes vulnerability. Instead, the effect depends on task complexity and network capacity: simple tasks with ample capacity allow feature expansion (abundance regime), while complex tasks or limited capacity force reduction (scarcity regime). By defining superposition as lossy compression, this work enables principled measurement of how neural networks organize information under computational constraints, connecting superposition to adversarial robustness."

    "abstract": "Human-centric anomaly detection (AD) has been primarily studied to specify anomalous behaviors in a single person. However, as humans by nature tend to act in a collaborative manner, behavioral anomalies can also arise from human-human interactions. Detecting such anomalies using existing single-person AD models is prone to low accuracy, as these approaches are typically not designed to capture the complex and asymmetric dynamics of interactions. In this paper, we introduce a novel task, Human-Human Interaction Anomaly Detection (H2IAD), which aims to identify anomalous interactive behaviors within collaborative 3D human actions. To address H2IAD, we then propose Interaction Anomaly Detection Network (IADNet), which is formalized with a Temporal Attention Sharing Module (TASM). Specifically, in designing TASM, we share the encoded motion embeddings across both people such that collaborative motion correlations can be effectively synchronized. Moreover, we notice that in addition to temporal dynamics, human interactions are also characterized by spatial configurations between two people. We thus introduce a Distance-Based Relational Encoding Module (DREM) to better reflect social cues in H2IAD. The normalizing flow is eventually employed for anomaly scoring. Extensive experiments on human-human motion benchmarks demonstrate that IADNet outperforms existing Human-centric AD baselines in H2IAD."

We explore three spin qubit systems in linear or triangular configurations. We derive analytical expressions for these multi-exchange entangling operations and demonstrate how to use the resulting three-qubit gates to construct quantum circuits capable of generating standard entangled states such as GHZ and W states, and the Toffoli gate, by optimizing control parameters.

We then show that AdS bulk-to-boundary propagators with suitable time orderings provide alternative bases of solutions to the wave equation. We propose an AdS bulk reconstruction formula relating an on-shell free scalar at a spacetime point to CFT primary operators and their shadow transforms. In the flat space limit, this formula reduces to the Carrollian expansion of a free field in flat space.

    "abstract": "The question of how to interpret and compute arrival-time distributions in quantum mechanics remains unsettled, reflecting the longstanding tension between treating time as a quantum observable or as a classical parameter. Most previous studies have focused on the single-particle case in the far-field regime, where both approaches yield very similar arrival-time distributions and a semi-classical analysis typically suffices. Recent advances in atom-optics technologies now make it possible to experimentally investigate arrival-time distributions for entangled multi-particle systems in the near-field regime, where a deeper analysis beyond semi-classical approximations is required. Even in the far-field regime, due to quantum non-locality, the semi-classical approximation cannot generally hold in multi-particle systems. Therefore, in this work, two fundamental approaches to the arrival-time problem -- namely, the time-parameter and time-operator approaches -- are extended to multi-particle systems. Using these extensions, we propose a feasible two-particle arrival-time experiment and numerically evaluate the corresponding joint distributions. Our results reveal regimes in which the two approaches yield inequivalent predictions, highlighting conditions under which experiments could shed new light on distinguishing between competing accounts of time in quantum mechanics. Our findings also provide important insights for the development of quantum technologies that use entanglement in the time domain, including non-local temporal interferometry, temporal ghost imaging, and temporal state tomography in multi-particle systems."

Whereas similar claims have been made in more specific settings, we show that the neural scaling law is a consequence of Zipf's law under certain broad assumptions that we reveal systematically. The derivation steps are as follows: We derive Heaps' law on the vocabulary growth from Zipf's law, Hilberg's hypothesis on the entropy scaling from Heaps' law, and the neural scaling from Hilberg's hypothesis.

An isolated defect hosts a time-reversal pair of ground-state flux configurations with large net chirality. Certain excitations are also chiral. The chirality manifests in Majorana local Chern marker and in scalar spin chirality, producing electronic orbital magnetization. T-matrix analysis and numerics at finite defect density $n_d$ show that defect chiralities generate a topological gap of $11 n_d$ protecting a Chern number $C=\\pm 1$. Emergent ferromagnetic long range Ising interactions $r^{-γ}$ with $2<γ< 3$ between defect chiralities lead to a finite temperature $T_c$ phase transition into the chiral spin liquid. The $T_c$ is proportional to $n_d$ and diverges when $γ\\rightarrow 2$. We also consider additional solvable impurity potentials and find that $γ$ can be reduced to below $2.3$ and correspondingly enhance $T_c$. Our results offer applications to 2D Dirac cone systems with a finite density of fluctuating Ising magnetic impurities and to identifying spin liquids with lattice defects."

While various compression techniques exist, they frequently introduce complex engineering trade-offs or degrade model performance. We propose the Parametrized Random Projection (PRP) layer, a novel approach that decouples feature mixing from adaptation by utilizing a fixed random matrix modulated by lightweight, learnable element-wise parameters. This architecture drastically reduces the trainable parameter count to a linear scale while retaining reliable accuracy across various benchmarks. The design serves as a stable, computationally efficient solution for architectural scaling and deployment in resource-limited settings."

This result was surprising since the measure algebra $M(G)$ is Connes-amenable if and only if $G$ is amenable, which might lead one to guess that $B(G)$ should be operator Connes-amenable if and only if $G$ is amenable. This leads to the question: for which groups $G$ is $B(G)$ operator Connes-amenable? We make progress on this problem by giving the first examples of groups where $B(G)$ is known to not be operator Connes-amenable. More specifically, we show that $B(G)$ is not operator Connes-amenable when $G$ is a non-compact locally compact group with property (T) and finite almost periodic compactification, or when $G$ is a discrete group without the factorization property. This refutes the suggestion of Dales that $B(G)$ might be operator Connes-amenable for every locally compact group."

In multi tier Federated IoT (Fed-IoT) systems, unstable connectivity and adversarial interference can silently alter transmitted parameters, degrading convergence. We propose DP-EMAR, a differentially private, error model based autonomous repair framework that detects and reconstructs transmission induced distortions during FL aggregation. DP-EMAR estimates corruption patterns and applies adaptive correction before privacy noise is added, enabling reliable in network repair without violating confidentiality. By integrating Differential Privacy (DP) with Secure Aggregation (SA), the framework distinguishes DP noise from genuine transmission errors. Experiments on heterogeneous IoT sensor and graph datasets show that DP-EMAR preserves convergence stability and maintains near baseline performance under communication corruption while ensuring strict (epsilon, delta)-DP guarantees. The framework enhances robustness, communication efficiency, and trust in privacy preserving Federated IoT learning."

This is common practice in simulations of galaxy formation in which following the non-equilibrium abundances of additional elements is computationally expensive. We define the $\\mathrm{H}_2$ excess as the shift in density of the \\ion{H}{I}-$\\mathrm{H}_2$ transition in the reduced network compared to the full chemical network (30 elements). The strength of the $\\mathrm{H}_2$ excess generally increases both with temperature and metallicity, is largely independent of the radiation field strength, and persists across a large range of assumed shielding column densities. For warm gas, with $T\\approx1000~\\mathrm{K}$, the HI-$\\mathrm{H}_2$ transition is shifted by up to 1 dex to lower densities in primordial chemistry networks already for extremely low metallicities ($Z\\geq 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{Z}_{\\odot}$). We confirm our earlier findings that missing reactions with oxygen are largely responsible for this $\\mathrm{H}_2$ excess. A reduced chemical network of hydrogen, helium, and oxygen recovers the molecular hydrogen fractions from a full network and we therefore recommend to include destruction of molecular hydrogen by oxygen in a minimal chemical network for accurate molecular hydrogen abundances."

Popular fixes such as the Harman single-factor test, correlated uniquenesses, common latent factor models, and marker variable approaches have well known flaws. These approaches either poorly identify issues, rely too heavily on researchers' choices, omit real information, or require special marker items that many datasets lack. This paper introduces a metadata-only Feature-Augmented Method Factor (FAMF-SEM): a single extra method factor with fixed, item-specific weights based on questionnaire details like reverse coding, page and item order, scale width, wording direction, and item length. These weights are set using ridge regression, based on residual correlations in a basic CFA, and remain fixed in the model. The method avoids the need for additional data or marker variables and provides CMV-adjusted results with clear links to survey design features. An AMOS/LISREL-friendly, no-code Excel workflow demonstrates the method. The paper explains the rationale, provides model details, outlines setup, presents step-by-step instructions, describes checks and reliability tests, and notes limitations."

XNNTab first learns highly non-linear feature representations, which are decomposed into monosemantic features using a sparse autoencoder (SAE).

In this work, we introduce IMILIA (Interpretable Multiple Instance Learning for Inflammation Analysis), an end-to-end framework designed for the prediction of inflammation presence in IBD digitized slides stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), followed by the automated computation of markers characterizing tissue regions driving the predictions. IMILIA is composed of an inflammation prediction module, consisting of a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) model, and an interpretability module, divided in two blocks: HistoPLUS, for cell instance detection, segmentation and classification; and EpiSeg, for epithelium segmentation. IMILIA achieves a cross-validation ROC-AUC of 0.83 on the discovery cohort, and a ROC-AUC of 0.99 and 0.84 on two external validation cohorts. The interpretability module yields biologically consistent insights: tiles with higher predicted scores show increased densities of immune cells (lymphocytes, plasmocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils), whereas lower-scored tiles predominantly contain normal epithelial cells. Notably, these patterns were consistent across all datasets. Code and models to partially replicate the results on the public IBDColEpi dataset can be found at https://github.com/owkin/imilia."

Performing T-dualities, all the inequivalent vacua can be found in type IIB with either O9-, O5- or O3-planes. We show that: $i)\\,$ type IIB with O$9$ fails to stabilise the volume of the internal space. $ii)\\,$ type IIB with O5 realises the only cases of scale-separated AdS$_{3}$ vacua. $iii)\\,$ type IIB with O$3$ provides only Mkw$_{3}$ vacua exhibiting a rich variety of supersymmetry-breaking patterns. Assuming that some mechanism (possibly non-perturbative) fixes the unstabilised modulus in type IIB with O$9$, we re-examine the possibility of achieving a weakly-coupled and scale-separated regime."

    "abstract": "Pulsar glitches are unresolved increments of the rotation rate that sometimes trigger an enhancement of the spin-down rate. On occasions, the augmented spin-down decays gradually in an exponential manner, particularly after the largest glitch events. The young pulsar PSR J0537-6910 exhibits the highest known glitching rate, with 60 events detected in nearly 18 years of monitoring. Despite most PSR J0537-6910 glitches being large, only one exponential recovery has been reported, following its first discovered glitch. This is puzzling, as pulsars of similar characteristics typically present significant exponential recoveries. We aim to determine whether this reflects an intrinsic difference in PSR J0537-6910 or a detectability issue, for example due to its high glitch frequency. The full dataset, including recent NICER observations, was systematically searched for exponential relaxations. Each glitch was tested for evidence of a recovery over a broad range of trial timescales. Promising candidates were investigated further by comparing recovery models with and without an exponential term using Bayesian evidence. We discovered six new glitches, bringing the total to 66. Our criteria strongly indicates the presence of 11 previously undetected exponential recoveries. We presente updated glitch and timing solutions. Exponential recoveries are detected only for the largest glitches, though not all of them. The inferred timescales range from 4 to 37 d, with the decaying frequency increment generally below $1\\%$ of the total. We find that $\\ddotν$ can remain stable across several glitches, with persistent changes associated with only some events. In particular, it tends to be lowest after glitches with exponential recoveries, yielding inter-glitch braking indices between 6 and 9. Following glitches without recoveries, $\\ddotν$ is higher, leading to braking indices between 10 and 35."

By using large-deviation Markov chain sampling, we are able to obtain the distribution $P(W)$ of the spanning-tree weight $W$ down to probability densities as small as $10^{-300}$. For the complete graph, we confirm analytical predictions with respect to the expectation value. For both ensembles, the large deviation principle is fulfilled. For the connected ER graphs, we observe a remarkable change of the distributions at the value of $c=1$, which is the percolation threshold for the original ER ensemble."

The 2024 TSE path covered a large geographic swath of North America and we recruited and trained 36 teams of community participants (\"citizen scientists\") representative of the various communities along the path of totality. Afterwards, these teams retained the equipment in their communities for ongoing education and public engagement activities.

In addition to equipment for their communities, CATE 2024 teams received hands-on telescope training, educational and learning materials, and instruction on data analysis techniques. CATE 2024 used high-cadence, high-dynamic-range (HDR) polarimetric observations of the solar corona to characterize the physical processes that shape its heating, structure, and evolution at scales and sensitivities that cannot be studied outside of a TSE. Conventional eclipse observations do not span sufficient time to capture changing coronal topology, but the extended observation from CATE 2024 does. Analysis of the fully calibrated dataset will provide deeper insight and understanding into these critical physical processes.

The renormalized t Hooft coupling c gets significantly stronger when the meson self energies due to quark loops are computed using the pole masses of mesons and parameters are fixed on shell in the Ref. [141] after consistent treatment of the quark one-loop vacuum fluctuation for the RQM model where the light and strange chiral symmetry breaking strengths also become weaker. The impact of the above novel features on the critical fluctuations have been computed. The improved PolyLog-glue form of the Polyakov loop potential of the Ref. [46], is employed to study the effect of the quark back reaction on critical fluctuations and results are compared with the scenario where quark back reaction is absent in the RPQM model with the Log form of the Polyakov loop potential. Using the large Nc standard chiral perturbation theory inputs,~the phase diagrams are computed in the light chiral limit of zero pion mass and the proximity of the tricritical point (TCP) with the CEP is quantified in the chemical potential-temperature plane.The RQM, RPQM model critical regions are compared with those reported in the Ref.

Current image-to-video pipelines produce plausible motion but struggle to generate predictable, articulated motions while enforcing user-specified content in newly revealed areas. Our key idea is to separate motion specification from appearance synthesis: we introduce a lightweight, user-editable Proxy Dynamic Graph (PDG) that deterministically yet approximately drives part motion, while a frozen diffusion prior is used to synthesize plausible appearance that follows that motion. In our training-free pipeline, the user loosely annotates and reposes a PDG, from which we compute a dense motion flow to leverage diffusion as a motion-guided shader. We then let the user edit appearance in the disoccluded areas of the image, and exploit the visibility information encoded by the PDG to perform a latent-space composite that reconciles motion with user intent in these areas. This design yields controllable articulation and user control over disocclusions without fine-tuning. We demonstrate clear advantages against state-of-the-art alternatives towards images turned into short videos of articulated objects, furniture, vehicles, and deformables. Our method mixes generative control, in the form of loose pose and structure, with predictable controls, in the form of appearance specification in the final frame in the disoccluded regions, unlocking a new image-to-video workflow.

Nevertheless properties inherent to quantum chaos can take on those roles: i) the dynamical sensitivity to weak perturbations, measured by the fidelity decay, serves a similar purpose as the classical sensitivity to initial conditions; and ii) paired with the fact that quantum chaotic systems are conjectured to be statistically described by random matrix theory, implies a method to translate the ergodic feature into the control of quantum dynamics. With those two properties, it can be argued that quantum chaotic dynamical systems, in principle, allow for full controllability beyond a characteristic time that scales only logarithmically with system size and $\\hbar^{-1}$. In the spirit of classical targeting, it implies that it is possible to fine tune the immense quantum interference with weak perturbations and steer the system from any initial state into any desired target state, subject to constraints imposed by conserved quantities. In contrast, integrable dynamics possess neither ergodicity nor exponential instability, and thus the weak perturbations apparently must break the integrability for control purposes. The main ideas are illustrated with the quantum kicked rotor. The production of revivals, cat-like entangled states, and the transition from any random state to any other random state is possible as demonstrated."

    "abstract": "This paper presents high-resolution ALMA observations of the massive young stellar object G25.65+1.05, which is known to host water maser super flares. To investigate the nature of compact continuum sources that have been previously identified in this region, we analyzed 1.3 mm dust continuum and molecular line emission. The central millimeter peak MM1 coincides with the centimeter source VLA 2, has a complex molecular spectrum, and is identified as a hot molecular core. Molecular emission of SiO and CH3CN in the vicinity of MM1 reveals kinematics consistent with wide-angle outflow structures and a possible rotating disk in the source. VLA sources 1A, 1B, and 3 are lacking compact millimeter counterparts and trace shocked regions where the outflow interacts with the surrounding material. In particular, VLA 1A, the site of H2O maser super flares, is interpreted as a shock interface that exhibits developed turbulent movements seen in the SiO molecular line. The observed turbulence creates conditions required for H2O maser action, directly linking the nature of VLA 1A to the origin of the H2O maser super flares."

First, we show that the intensity at the output of a multiply scattering system can be described by a dyadic matrix, the optical-synaptic matrix, exhibiting the same form as a Hebbian synaptic matrix containing a single memory. Then, we employ emergent learning - an approach inspired by neuroscience - to exploit the vast dictionary of raw memories inherently available within a disordered optical structure, thereby engineering the optical-synaptic matrix to store a user-defined attractor, or tailored memory. Importantly these photonic structures also works as an optical comparators providing an intensity-based measure of the degree of similitude between a query pattern and the stored pattern, realizing an hardware co-localization between memory and optical operator. Our system has an almost infinite hardware capacity of tailored memories/ operators ($\\mathcal{M} \\sim 10^{60557}$), thus these tailored memories can be then employed as examples to build a classifier hardware based on intensity comparison without the need of additional digital transformation layers. Remarkably, this Photonic Emergent Learning platform is not only flexible and fabrication-free, but also relies primarily on analog processes, thus shifting the computational burden of training from the digital layers to the optical domain reducing the computational cost and enhancing performance."

Observations in the case of molecular neutral solutes are rather scarce, due to the low drift velocities in dilute solutions, and the difficulty in distinguishing DP from other phenomena in concentrated solutions. We investigated experimentally DP of dispersed colloids driven by concentration gradients of sucrose in water at relatively high concentrations, $C \\simeq 1$ mol L$^{-1}$. More precisely, we designed a microfluidic chip to impose a time-dependent sucrose gradient in dead-end microchannels with minimized parasitic flows. Significant migration of the particles toward the regions of low sucrose concentration has been observed, with velocities up to a few $μ$m s$^{-1}$. Particle tracking and Raman confocal spectroscopy were used to measure individual trajectories and the unsteady sucrose concentration profile respectively. The latter is correctly described by a diffusion equation, but with an interdiffusion coefficient that significantly depends on $C$ in the range of concentrations investigated. We then showed that a model of DP based on a steric exclusion of sucrose molecules from the particle surface with an exclusion length $R_i = 5 \\pm 0.9$ angstrom (close to the characteristic size of the sucrose molecule), accounts for the observed trajectories. Possible sources for the observed scattering of our experimental data are finally discussed: Brownian motion and advection of the particles by bulk flows driven by diffusioosmosis at the channel walls and buoyancy."

    "abstract": "We investigate three-dimensional turbulence in a stably stratified fluid driven by a vertically sheared Kolmogorov flow using direct numerical simulations of the Boussinesq equations. As stratification increases, mean profiles evolve toward piecewise-linear shapes while layered density structures emerge, with sharp interfaces separating well-mixed bulk layers. These highly stable interfaces form in the low-shear regions of the mean velocity profile and tend to promote flow relaminarisation, while shear-generated turbulence persists in the bulk layers. We analyse turbulent fluctuations, buoyancy transport and its spatial organisation, and flow stability via profiles of the gradient Richardson number $Ri_g$. The Richardson number in the bulk layers remains of order unity or less, $Ri_g \\lesssim 1$, so that efficient turbulent shear production can take place there. Mixing efficiency analysis shows that the Nusselt number scales with the buoyancy Reynolds number $Re_b$ as $Nu = 1 + ΓRe_b$ (with $Γ= ε_p / ε$), with the data collapsing onto a robust master curve and roughly following a power-law $Nu \\sim Re_b^{0.8}$. Further increase of stratification leads to a temporally intermittent turbulent regime, characterised by quasi-periodic bursts. We propose that the transition from stationary turbulence to this temporally intermittent regime is controlled by the buoyancy Reynolds number and highlight the mechanisms disrupting the turbulence and layered structures."

In this work, we develop a unified framework that clarifies the origin of ETH by separating kinematic typicality from dynamical input. We show that the characteristic ETH structure of local operator matrix elements follows from four ingredients: the maximum entropy principle, the geometry of high-dimensional Hilbert space, the locality of physical observables, and a minimal dynamical principle, which we term the eigenstate typicality principle (ETP). ETP asserts that in quantum-chaotic systems, energy eigenstates are statistically indistinguishable from typical states within a narrow microcanonical shell with respect to local measurements. Within this framework, diagonal ETH emerges from measure concentration, while the universal exponential suppression and smooth energy-frequency dependence of off-diagonal matrix elements arise from entropic scaling and local dynamical correlations, without invoking random-matrix assumptions. Our results establish ETH as a consequence of entropy, geometry, and chaos-induced typicality, and clarify its scope, thereby deepening our understanding of quantum thermalization and the emergence of statistical mechanics from unitary many-body dynamics."

    "abstract": "Machine unlearning (MU) seeks to eliminate the influence of specific training examples from deployed models. As large language models (LLMs) become widely used, managing risks arising from insufficient forgetting or utility loss is increasingly crucial. Current MU techniques lack effective mechanisms for evaluating and controlling these risks, hindering the selection of strategies that appropriately balance safety and utility, and raising trust concerns surrounding the \"right to be forgotten.\" To address these issues, we propose FROC, a unified framework with Risk-Optimized Control for machine unlearning in LLMs. FROC is built around a conformal-style risk-control formulation that expresses a user-specified risk budget on unlearning behavior. This probability-based constraint enables FROC to compare MU strategies, identify feasible operating regions, and guide hyperparameter selection according to desired trade-offs between forgetting sufficiency and utility preservation. To operationalize this constraint, FROC introduces a smoothly varying continuous risk model that aggregates forgetting deficiency and utility degradation into a single configuration-level score. Building on conformal risk analysis, FROC computes (1) the Conformal Unlearning Risk (CUR), a data-driven estimated value on the probability that forgotten samples continue to influence model predictions, and (2) risk-controlled configuration sets, which identify unlearning hyperparameters that are valid under the specified risk budget. Experiments across multiple LLM MU methods demonstrate that FROC produces stable, interpretable risk landscapes and reveals consistent relationships between unlearning configurations, semantic shift, and utility impact. FROC reframes MU as a controllable, risk-aware process and offers a practical foundation for managing unlearning behavior in large-scale LLM deployments."

We report here an unprecedented two-orthogonal-plane perspective of ICME ICME interactions for the first time from the L1 point. The investigation reveals a special interaction region formed by the propagation of the forward shock driven by complex ejecta in the preceding ICME. The interaction causes the formation of a downstream region spanning over 13 hours, which propagates in the interplanetary medium. The observations reveal that this region serves as a site for proton and alpha particle energization, and the particles within this region get distributed from one plane to the other. The presence of forward shock and particle energization is confirmed by the energetic particle flux measurements by the SupraThermal and Energetic Particle Spectrometer (STEPS) of ASPEX. These observations provide an unprecedented perspective on how solar wind ions become energized and distributed in an ICME-ICME interaction region."

    "abstract": "Face recognition systems rely on learning highly discriminative and compact identity clusters to enable accurate retrieval. However, as with other surveillance-oriented technologies, such systems raise serious privacy concerns due to their potential for unauthorized identity tracking. While several works have explored machine unlearning as a means of privacy protection, their applicability to face retrieval - especially for modern embedding-based recognition models - remains largely unexplored. In this work, we study the problem of face identity unlearning for retrieval systems and present its inherent challenges. The goal is to make selected identities unretrievable by dispersing their embeddings on the hypersphere and preventing the formation of compact identity clusters that enable re-identification in the gallery. The primary challenge is to achieve this forgetting effect while preserving the discriminative structure of the embedding space and the retrieval performance of the model for the remaining identities. To address this, we evaluate several existing approximate class unlearning methods (e.g., Random Labeling, Gradient Ascent, Boundary Unlearning, and other recent approaches) in the context of face retrieval and propose a simple yet effective dispersion-based unlearning approach. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks (VGGFace2, CelebA) demonstrate that our method achieves superior forgetting behavior while preserving retrieval utility."

Here we present an integrated apparatus engineered specifically for high-accuracy, field-strength and orientation-dependent HHG measurements in bulk solids. The system incorporates dispersion-neutral intensity-control for few-cycle pulses, a vacuum HHG module with sub-micrometer and sub-degree sample positioning, and an imaging assembly that stabilizes the focal spot position and enables spatial filtering of the emitted harmonics. A synchronized dual-spectrometer scheme provides simultaneous UV/VUV and EUV radiation detection, while absolute electric field calibration is achieved through gas-phase attosecond streaking. Together, these capabilities establish a versatile and quantitatively reliable platform for solid-state HHG spectroscopy. The methodology is broadly adaptable to various laser sources and material classes, and supports future efforts aimed at reconstructing valence-electron potentials, tracking strong-field dynamics, and mapping electronic structure with sub-cycle temporal resolution."

We initiated a long-term, continuous AGN photometric monitoring program in 2024, titled 'Hubble constant constraints through AGN Light curve Observations' (HALO) using intermediate and broad band filters. Here, we present the first results from HALO, focusing on photometric light curves and continuum time-delay measurements for Fairall~9. To complement these observations and extend the wavelength coverage of the lag-spectrum, we also reanalyzed archival Swift light curves and spectroscopic data available in the literature. Using HALO and Swift light curves, we measured inter-band continuum delays to construct the lag-spectrum of Fairall~9. Excess lags appear in the $u$ and $U$ bands (Balmer continuum contamination) and in the $I$ band (Paschen jump/dust emission from the torus). Overall, the lag-spectrum deviates significantly from standard disk model predictions. We find that inter-band delays deviate from the power-law, $τ_λ \\propto λ^β$ due to BLR scattering, reprocessing, and dust contributions at longer wavelengths. Power-law fits are therefore not well suited for characterizing the nature of the time delays."

While long-predicted, the definitive observation of a 2D supersolid has remained an outstanding experimental goal. Here, we report the observation of a supersolid stripe phase in a strongly dipolar quantum gas of erbium atoms confined to 2D. We directly image the periodic density modulation, confirming its global phase coherence through matter-wave interference and demonstrating its phase rigidity relevant to the low-energy Goldstone mode, consistent with numerical calculations. Through collective excitation measurements, we demonstrate the hydrodynamic behavior of the supersolid. This work highlights a novel mechanism for supersolid formation in low dimensions, and opens the door for future research on the intricate interplay between temperature, supersolidity, and dimensionality."

Despite their generality, these identification strategies have seen limited empirical use, largely because the implied estimation procedure requires solving a functional minimization problem for the target density. We show that this problem can be solved using the iterative proportional fitting (raking) algorithm, which converges rapidly even with continuous and moderately high-dimensional data. This resulting density estimator is then used as input into a parametric moment condition. We establish consistency and convergence rates for both the raking-based density estimator and the resulting moment estimator when the distributions of the observed data are parametric. We also derive a simple recursive procedure for estimating the asymptotic variance. Finally, we demonstrate the satisfactory performance of our estimator in simulations and provide an empirical illustration using data from the Understanding America Study panel."

Numerical experiments on distributions with explicit potential functions demonstrate its efficacy, particularly in exploring stiff energy landscapes.

    "abstract": "Inverse power-law interaction forms, such as the inverse-square law, recur across a wide range of physical, social, and spatial systems. While traditionally derived from specific microscopic mechanisms, the ubiquity of these laws suggests a more general organizing principle. This article proposes a statistical-mechanics framework in which such interaction laws emerge as macroscopic fixed points of aggregation processes involving strongly heterogeneous microscopic contributions. We consider systems where individual interaction sources exhibit heavy-tailed heterogeneity consistent with Zipf-Pareto statistics and where aggregation proceeds without intrinsic length scales. Under minimal assumptions of heterogeneity, multiplicativity, scale invariance, and stability under coarse-graining, we show that the resulting macroscopic interaction field must adopt a scale-free, power-law form. The associated exponent is not imposed a priori but emerges from effective dimensionality, symmetry, and aggregation structure. Within this framework, the inverse-square law is interpreted as a stable statistical fixed point corresponding to isotropic aggregation in an effective three-dimensional space, while deviations from this regime naturally arise from anisotropy, constrained geometries, or nontrivial effective dimensions. This perspective provides a unified interpretation of interaction laws observed in physics, spatial economics, and human geography, without invoking domain-specific microscopic mechanisms. The proposed framework reframes inverse power-law interactions as robust emergent features of Zipfian aggregation rather than as unique consequences of particular physical forces, thereby offering a common statistical explanation for their cross-disciplinary recurrence."

A convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approach is used to estimate the fractional composition of two-phase dielectric mixtures inside a resonant cavity using scattering parameter (S-parameter) measurements. A rectangular cavity sensor with a strip feed structure is characterized using a vector network analyzer (VNA) from 0.01--20~GHz. The CNN is trained using both simulated and experimentally measured S-parameters and achieves high predictive accuracy even without de-embedding or filtering, demonstrating robustness to measurement imperfections. The simulation results achieve a coefficient of determination ($R^2$)=0.99 using $k$-fold cross-validation, while the experimental model using raw data achieves an $R^2=0.94$ with a mean absolute error (MAE) below 6\\%. Data augmentation further improves the accuracy of the experimental prediction to above $R^2=0.998$ (MAE$<$0.72\\%).

Among these, stealthy attacks, those that evade conventional detection mechanisms, pose a critical threat to closed-loop performance. This paper introduces a controller-oriented method to enhance CPS resiliency against such attacks without compromising nominal closed-loop behavior. Specifically, we propose the concept of plant equivalent controller (PEC) realizations, representing a class of dynamic output-feedback controllers that preserve the input-output behavior of a given base controller while exhibiting distinct robustness properties in the presence of disturbances and sensor attacks. To quantify and improve robustness, we employ reachable set analysis to assess the impact of stealthy attacks on the closed-loop dynamics. Building on this analysis, we provide mathematical tools (in terms of linear matrix inequalities) to synthesize the optimal PEC realization that minimizes the reachable set under peak-bounded disturbances. The proposed framework thus provides systematic analysis and synthesis tools to enhance the attack resilience of CPSs while maintaining the desired nominal performance. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated on the quadruple-tank process subject to stealthy sensor attacks."

Recently, a new class of stochastic momentum algorithms has emerged within the Linear Minimization Oracle (LMO) framework--leading to state-of-the-art methods, such as Muon, Scion, and Gluon, that effectively solve deep neural network training problems. However, traditional stochastic momentum methods offer convergence guarantees no better than the ${O}(1/K^{1/4})$ rate. While several approaches--such as Hessian-Corrected Momentum (HCM)--have aimed to improve this rate, their theoretical results are generally restricted to the Euclidean norm setting. This limitation hinders their applicability in problems, where arbitrary norms are often required. In this paper, we extend the LMO-based framework by integrating HCM, and provide convergence guarantees under relaxed smoothness and arbitrary norm settings. We establish improved convergence rates of ${O}(1/K^{1/3})$ for HCM, which can adapt to the geometry of the problem and achieve a faster rate than traditional momentum. Experimental results on training Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks verify our theoretical observations."

    "abstract": "Dust is an important tracer of the structure of interstellar clouds, as well as a central factor in the thermal balance and chemistry of the clouds. Our knowledge of the dust properties is nevertheless incomplete, especially regarding the dense star-forming clouds. The aim is to study dust evolution in the Orion Molecular Cloud 3 (OMC-3) and how uncertainty regarding dust properties affects estimates of the radiation field and the cloud mass. We constructed three-dimensional radiative transfer (RT) models to fit the far-infrared (FIR) observations of dust emission in the OMC-3 field and used near-infrared (NIR) extinction measurements as additional constraints. We examined fits to the dense star-forming filaments and to the surrounding cloud, including some tests with spatial dust property variations.The 160-250 $μ$m observations of dust emission could be fitted moderately well with any of the dust models tested, but few models are consistent with the measured NIR extinction. The best match to observations is found with dust models such as the THEMIS model of large porous grains, with or without ice mantles, and with mean grain sizes up to ~ 0.3$μ$m. The flattening of the NIR extinction curve excludes larger grain sizes, except possibly in the central ridge. Compared to models of lower column density clouds, the results were relatively insensitive to the line-of-sight (LOS) cloud size and the spectral shape of the heating radiation field. In addition, the effect of embedded stars remained very localised in OMC-3. The results suggest that the dust in the OMC-3 region is evolved with a grain of average size $a$=0.1-0.3 $μ$m, potentially with ice mantles."

The CED extends edit-distance ideas to TVPDs by combining local substitution costs with penalized deletions/insertions, controlled by two parameters: \\(α\\) (trade-off between temporal misalignment and diagram discrepancy) and \\(β\\) (gap penalty). We also provide an explicit construction of CED-geodesics. Building on these ingredients, we present two practical barycenter solvers, one stochastic and one greedy, that monotonically decrease the CED Frechet energy. Empirically, the CED is robust to additive perturbations (both temporal and spatial), recovers temporal shifts, and supports temporal pattern search. On real-life datasets, the CED achieves clustering performance comparable or better than standard elastic dissimilarities, while our clustering based on CED-barycenters yields superior classification results. Overall, the CED equips TVPD analysis with a principled distance, interpretable geodesics, and practical barycenters, enabling alignment, comparison, averaging, and clustering directly in the space of TVPDs. A C++ implementation is provided for reproducibility at the following address https://github.com/sebastien-tchitchek/ContinuousEditDistance."

Specifically, we first introduce a two-stage flow-guided deformable warping mechanism that refines motion compensation with coarse-to-fine offset prediction and mask modulation, enabling precise feature alignment. Second, we propose a multi-reference quality aware strategy that adjusts distortion weights based on reference quality, and applies it to hierarchical training to reduce error propagation. Third, we integrate a training-free module that downsamples frames by motion magnitude and resolution to obtain smooth motion estimation. Experimental results on standard test datasets demonstrate that our framework CAMA achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art Neural Video Compression models, achieving a 24.95% BD-rate (PSNR) savings over our baseline model DCVC-TCM, while also outperforming reproduced DCVC-DC and traditional codec HM-16.25."

However, aggressive bitwidth reduction remains challenging due to activation outliers, leading to accuracy degradation. Existing methods, such as outlier-handling and group quantization, achieve high accuracy but incur substantial energy consumption. To address this, we propose SeVeDo, an energy-efficient SVD-based heterogeneous accelerator that structurally separates outlier-sensitive components into a high-precision low-rank path, while the remaining computations are executed in a low-bit residual datapath with group quantization. To further enhance efficiency, Hierarchical Group Quantization (HGQ) combines coarse-grained floating-point scaling with fine-grained shifting, effectively reducing dequantization cost. Also, SVD-guided mixed precision (SVD-MP) statically allocates higher bitwidths to precision-sensitive components identified through low-rank decomposition, thereby minimizing floating-point operation cost. Experimental results show that SeVeDo achieves a peak energy efficiency of 13.8TOPS/W, surpassing conventional designs, with 12.7TOPS/W on ViT-Base and 13.4TOPS/W on Llama2-7B benchmarks."

Those imaging results show that the visibility of ghost image can be significantly improved whether the reference signal is the reconstruction pattern or the target pattern of computational holography. Furthermore, we realize positive and negative copies of ghost image by the aid of computational holography in which symmetrical target patterns are artificially designed.

The findings reveal two distinct transmembrane transport mechanisms for polymer brush-grafted nanoparticles, which are governed by membrane thickness and grafting density.

The current state of the scenario is assumed to be known from sensors and the prediction is taking into account various hypotheses about the behavior of traffic participants. This way, the uncertainties regarding the behavior of traffic participants can be modelled in detail. In the first part of this paper a model-based approach is presented to compute Predicted-Occupancy Grids (POG), which are introduced as a grid-based probabilistic representation of the future scenario hypotheses. However, due to the large number of possible trajectories for each traffic participant, the model-based approach comes with a very high computational load. Thus, a machine-learning approach is adopted for the computation of POGs. This work uses a novel grid-based representation of the current state of the traffic scenario and performs the mapping to POGs. This representation consists of augmented cells in an occupancy grid. The adopted machine-learning approach is based on the Random Forest algorithm. Simulations of traffic scenarios are performed to compare the machine-learning with the model-based approach. The results are promising and could enable the real-time computation of POGs for vehicle safety applications. With this detailed modelling of uncertainties, crucial components in vehicle safety systems like criticality estimation and trajectory planning can be improved."

While exciton-electron interactions have been used as a sensor for Wigner crystallization, its impact on exciton properties has been poorly understood so far. Here, we show that the weak potential induced by periodically ordered Wigner crystal electrons has a major impact on exciton propagation, albeit having only a minor influence on exciton energy. The effect is tunable with carrier density determining the Wigner crystal confinement and temperature via thermal occupation of higher subbands. Our work provides microscopic insights into the interplay between excitons and charge-ordered states identifying key signatures in exciton transport, and establishes a theoretical framework for understanding exciton propagation in the presence of strong electronic correlations."

Using time-domain terahertz spectroscopy, we probe this coupling in PrSi, a metallic ferromagnet. The optical response exhibits pronounced Drude-Smith behavior over a broad temperature range, indicating persistent carrier scattering. A classical Kondo-lattice model (CKLM) attributes this non-Drude conductivity to scattering of itinerant electrons by localized magnetic moments, persisting down to temperatures well below the magnetic ordering scale. At lower temperatures, beyond the scope of CKLM, our experiment reveals that the response is dominated by crystal-field excitations, with sharp transitions at 0.6 THz and 1.54 THz. The mode at 1.54 THz shows a dynamic correlation with the onset of ferromagnetic order, marking the onset of a crystal-field-governed low temperature regime."

The MAP estimation problem is reformulated as a continuous-time optimal control problem based on the Onsager-Machlup functional. This reformulation enables the use of a previously proposed parallel-in-time solution for optimal control problems, which we adapt to the current problem. The structure of the resulting optimal control problem admits a parallel solution based on parallel associative scan algorithms. In the linear Gaussian special case, it yields a parallel Kalman-Bucy filter and a parallel continuous-time Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother. These linear computational methods are further extended to nonlinear continuous-time state-space models through Taylor expansions. We also present the corresponding parallel two-filter smoother. The graphics processing unit (GPU) experiments on linear and nonlinear models demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves a significant speedup in computations while maintaining the accuracy of sequential algorithms."

Recent advances in semiconductor-superconductor hybrid quantum dot arrays have allowed to realize degenerate quantum systems in a controllable way, e.g., allowing to observe robust zero-bias peaks in Kitaev chains, indicative for Majorana bound states. In this work, we connect these two domains. Noting the strong on-site Coulomb repulsion within quantum dots, we study small arrays of spinful hybrid quantum dots implemented in a two-dimensional electron gas. This system constitutes a Fermi-Hubbard model with inter-site superconducting correlations. For two electronic sites, we find robust zero-bias peaks indicative of a strongly degenerate spectrum hosting emergent Majorana Kramers pairs or $\\mathbb{Z}_3$-parafermions. Extending to three sites, we find that these spinful systems scale very differently compared to spinless Kitaev chains. When the sweet-spot conditions are satisfied pairwise, we find that the ground state degeneracy of the full three-site system is lifted. This degeneracy can be restored by tuning the superconducting phase difference between the hybrid segments. However, these states are not robust to quantum dot detuning. Our observations are a first step towards studying degeneracies in strongly interacting Fermi-Hubbard systems with superconducting correlations."

In addition, existing semantic mapping systems lack support for integrating both fixed-category and open-language label predictions within a single framework. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D semantic mapping system that leverages the OpenVDB data structure and integrates a unified Bayesian update framework for both closed- and open-set semantic fusion.

However, existing approaches face three critical challenges: (1) fixed-weight fusion strategies fail across cross modal noise and ambiguous queries, (2) temporal modeling struggles to capture coherent event sequences while penalizing unrealistic gaps, and (3) systems require manual modality selection, reducing usability. We propose a unified multimodal moment retrieval system with three key innovations. First, a cascaded dual-embedding pipeline combines BEIT-3 and SigLIP for broad retrieval, refined by BLIP-2 based reranking to balance recall and precision. Second, a temporal-aware scoring mechanism applies exponential decay penalties to large temporal gaps via beam search, constructing coherent event sequences rather than isolated frames. Third, Agent-guided query decomposition (GPT-4o) automatically interprets ambiguous queries, decomposes them into modality specific sub-queries (visual/OCR/ASR), and performs adaptive score fusion eliminating manual modality selection. Qualitative analysis demonstrates that our system effectively handles ambiguous queries, retrieves temporally coherent sequences, and dynamically adapts fusion strategies, advancing interactive moment search capabilities."

    "abstract": "The pseudopotential lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is a prominent approach for simulating multiphase flows, valued for its physical intuitiveness and computational tractability. However, existing immiscible pseudopotential methods for modeling dynamic multi-component immiscible fluid systems involving open boundaries face persistent challenges, notably the influence of spurious currents on interface formation and breakup, as well as the effects of inlet and outlet boundary configurations on simulation stability. Therefore, this paper proposes a corrected open boundary framework based on Multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) for the immiscible pseudopotential model. Our method includes three key improvements: firstly, introducing correction coefficients to reconstruct the distribution function, in order to accurately recover the macroscopic quantities at the inlet boundary. Secondly, based on real-time mass flow rates at the inlet and outlet, the outlet boundary velocity is adjusted to ensure global mass conservation in the computational domain. Finally, the relaxation coefficient related to numerical stability is adjusted based on the viscosity of two-phase fluids to reduce spurious currents. To validate the reliability of the proposed corrected method, four benchmark cases were simulated: Laplace tests and Taylor deformation, two-phase Poiseuille flow, migration of droplets in microchannels, as well as droplet generation in T-shaped and co-flow devices. The results demonstrate that the corrected approach accurately captures various dynamic complex immiscible multiphase flows."

However, such models often rely on millions to billions of training sequences and billions of parameters, resulting in prohibitive computational costs and significant barriers to reproducibility and accessibility, particularly for academic labs. To address these challenges, we investigate the feasibility of data pruning for BioFM pretraining and propose a post-hoc influence-guided data pruning framework tailored to biological domains. Our approach introduces a subset-based self-influence formulation that enables efficient estimation of sample importance at low computational cost, and builds upon it two simple yet effective selection strategies, namely Top-k Influence (Top I) and Coverage-Centric Influence (CCI). We empirically validate our method on two representative BioFMs, RNA-FM and ESM-C. For RNA, our framework consistently outperforms random selection baselines under an extreme pruning rate of over 99 percent, demonstrating its effectiveness. Furthermore, we show the generalizability of our framework on protein-related tasks using ESM-C. In particular, our coreset even outperforms random subsets that are ten times larger in both RNA and protein settings, revealing substantial redundancy in biological sequence datasets. These findings underscore the potential of influence-guided data pruning to substantially reduce the computational cost of BioFM pretraining, paving the way for more efficient, accessible, and sustainable biological AI research."

A critical yet often overlooked dimension in this context is the inherent priority difference among clients; for instance, business-critical functions demand higher performance guarantees, as fulfilling such requests yields significantly greater business value. However, existing LLM serving schedulers fail to jointly optimize for both SLO attainment and client-level priorities. To bridge this gap, we first \\textit{formalize multi-priority request scheduling as a service gain maximization problem}, where satisfying latency requirements for requests of different priorities contributes varying levels of gain. We then propose PROSERVE, a unified two-tier scheduling framework designed to maximize overall service gain. At the engine level, SlideBatching dynamically adapts batch formation and request ordering under varying load conditions, employing a sliding boundary mechanism to balance deadline-first and density-first strategies. At the service level, GoRouting performs gain-oriented and capability-aware dispatching across distributed instances, proactively reserving capacity for future high-priority or long requests. Extensive evaluation across four open-source datasets and a real-world industrial trace demonstrates that \\systemname{} consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, improving system gain by up to 35% and boosting SLO attainment by up to 52%."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are often fine-tuned to adapt their general-purpose knowledge to specific tasks and domains such as cyber threat intelligence (CTI). Fine-tuning is mostly done through proprietary datasets that may contain sensitive information. Owners expect their fine-tuned model to not inadvertently leak this information to potentially adversarial end users. Using CTI as a use case, we demonstrate that data-extraction attacks can recover sensitive information from fine-tuned models on CTI reports, underscoring the need for mitigation. Retraining the full model to eliminate this leakage is computationally expensive and impractical. We propose an alternative approach, which we call privacy alignment, inspired by safety alignment in LLMs. Just like safety alignment teaches the model to abide by safety constraints through a few examples, we enforce privacy alignment through few-shot supervision, integrating a privacy classifier and a privacy redactor, both handled by the same underlying LLM. We evaluate our system, called CTIGuardian, using GPT-4o mini and Mistral-7B Instruct models, benchmarking against Presidio, a named entity recognition (NER) baseline. Results show that CTIGuardian provides a better privacy-utility trade-off than NER based models. While we demonstrate its effectiveness on a CTI use case, the framework is generic enough to be applicable to other sensitive domains."

Let $j$ be the smallest index with $κ(P_j)\\ge k$ and $R := k - κ(P_{j-1})$. We prove a structural decomposition theorem showing that an optimal $k$-cut can be expressed as the level-$(j\\!-\\!1)$ boundary $A_{\\le j-1}$ together with exactly $(R-r)$ \\emph{non-trivial} internal cuts of value at most~$λ_j$ and $r$ \\emph{singleton isolations} (``islands'') inside the parts of~$P_{j-1}$.

We study why this happens and what role temperature plays. With open reasoning models, we find that looping is common at low temperature. Larger models tend to loop less, and distilled students loop significantly even when their teachers rarely do. This points to mismatches between the training distribution and the learned model, which we refer to as errors in learning, as a key cause. To understand how such errors cause loops, we introduce a synthetic graph reasoning task and demonstrate two mechanisms. First, risk aversion caused by hardness of learning: when the correct progress-making action is hard to learn but an easy cyclic action is available, the model puts relatively more probability on the cyclic action and gets stuck. Second, even when there is no hardness, Transformers show an inductive bias toward temporally correlated errors, so the same few actions keep being chosen and loops appear. Higher temperature reduces looping by promoting exploration, but it does not fix the errors in learning, so generations remain much longer than necessary at high temperature; in this sense, temperature is a stopgap rather than a holistic solution. We end with a discussion of training-time interventions aimed at directly reducing errors in learning."

Monolithic ribbon-like, or multi-filar suspension geometries provide a key to such dilution in torsion, but are challenging to make. As a solution, we introduce a lithographically defined silicon nitride (Si$_3$N$_4$) ribbon suspension in a wafer-scale approach to pendulum fabrication that is conducive to such 2-D geometries, making extreme aspect ratios, and even multi-filar designs, a possibility. A monofilar, monolithic, centimeter scale torsion pendulum is fabricated and released in a first proof of concept. Mounted in vacuum, it is optically excited and cooled using measurement based feedback.

    "abstract": "Unexploitable example generation aims to transform personal images into their unexploitable (unlearnable) versions before they are uploaded online, thereby preventing unauthorized exploitation of online personal images. Recently, this task has garnered significant research attention due to its critical relevance to personal data privacy. Yet, despite recent progress, existing methods for this task can still suffer from limited practical applicability, as they can fail to generate examples that are broadly unexploitable across different real-world computer vision tasks. To deal with this problem, in this work, we propose a novel Meta Cross-Task Unexploitable Example Generation (MCT-UEG) framework. At the core of our framework, to optimize the unexploitable example generator for effectively producing broadly unexploitable examples, we design a flat-minima-oriented meta training and testing scheme. Extensive experiments show the efficacy of our framework."

Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time will be capable of discovering thousands of TDEs each year, allowing for a dramatic increase in the number of discovered TDEs. The optical light curves from TDEs can be used to model the physical parameters of the black hole and disrupted star, but the sampling and photometric uncertainty of the real data will couple with model degeneracies to limit our ability to recover these parameters. In this work, we aim to model the impact of the Rubin survey strategy on simulated TDE light curves to quantify the typical errors in the recovered parameters. Black hole masses $5.5< \\log M_{\\rm BH}/M_\\odot < 8.2$ can be recovered with typical errors of 0.26 dex, with early coverage removing large outliers. Recovery of the mass of the disrupted star is difficult, limited by the degeneracy with the accretion efficiency. Only 57\\% of the cases have accurate recovery of whether the events are full or partial, so we caution the use this method to assess whether TDEs are partially or fully disrupted systems. Black hole mass measurements obtained from Rubin observations of TDEs will provide powerful constraints on the black hole mass function, black hole -- galaxy co-evolution, and the population of black hole spins, though continued work to understand the origin of TDE observables and how the TDE rate varies among galaxies will be necessarily to fully utilize the upcoming rich data set from Rubin."

    "abstract": "Magnetic field evolution in neutron star cores is not fully understood. We describe the field evolution both for one barotropic fluid as well as two collisionally coupled barotropic fluids with different density profiles using the anelastic approximation and the Navier-Stokes equations to simulate the evolution in three dimensions. In the one-fluid case, a single fluid describes the motion of the charged particles. In the two-fluid model, the neutral fluid is coupled to the electrically conductive fluid by collisions, the latter being dragged by the magnetic field. In this model, both fluids have distinct density profiles. This forces them to move at slightly different velocities, resulting in a relative motion between the two barotropic fluids -- ambipolar diffusion. We develop a code based on Dedalus and study the evolution of simple poloidal dipolar and toroidal magnetic fields. Previous 2D studies found that poloidal magnetic fields evolve towards a stable Grad-Shafranov equilibrium. In our 3D simulations we find an instability of the two-fluid system similar to the one in the barotropic fluid system. After the instability saturates, a highly non-linear Lorentz force introduces small-scale fluid motion that leads to turbulence, development of a cascade and significant, non-axially symmetric changes in the magnetic field configuration. Fluid viscosity plays an essential role in regularizing the small-scale fluid motion, providing an energy drain."

Current systems based on intraoperative radiographic imaging and bone-anchored markers are invasive, radiation-intensive and workflow disruptive. Recent markerless RGB-D registration methods offer a promising alternative, but existing approaches rely on weak segmentation labels to isolate relevant anatomical structures, which can propagate errors throughout registration. Methods: We present End2Reg an end-to-end deep learning framework that jointly optimizes segmentation and registration, eliminating the need for weak segmentation labels and manual steps. The network learns segmentation masks specifically optimized for registration, guided solely by the registration objective without direct segmentation supervision. Results: The proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on ex- and in-vivo benchmarks, reducing median Target Registration Error by 32% to 1.83mm and mean Root Mean Square Error by 45% to 3.95mm, respectively. An ablation study confirms that end-to-end optimization significantly improves registration accuracy. Conclusion: The presented end-to-end RGB-D registration pipeline removes dependency on weak labels and manual steps, advancing towards fully automatic, markerless intraoperative navigation.

    "abstract": "Firms often develop targeting policies to personalize marketing actions and improve incremental profits. Effective targeting depends on accurately separating customers with positive versus negative treatment effects. We propose an approach to estimate the conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) of marketing actions that aligns their estimation with the firm's profit objective. The method recognizes that, for many customers, treatment effects are so extreme that additional accuracy is unlikely to change the recommended actions. However, accuracy matters near the decision boundary, as small errors can alter targeting decisions. By modifying the firm's objective function in the standard profit maximization problem, our method yields a near-optimal targeting policy while simultaneously estimating CATEs. This introduces a new perspective on CATE estimation, reframing it as a problem of profit optimization rather than prediction accuracy. We establish the theoretical properties of the proposed method and demonstrate its performance and trade-offs using synthetic data."

    "abstract": "Accurately predicting topologically correct masks remains a difficult task for general segmentation models, which often produce fragmented or disconnected outputs. Fixing these artifacts typically requires hand-crafted refinement rules or architectures specialized to a particular task. Here, we show that Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) can be directly re-purposed as an effective refinement mechanism, using local, iterative updates guided by image context to repair segmentation masks. By training on imperfect masks and ground truths, the automaton learns the structural properties of the target shape while relying solely on local information. When applied to coarse, globally predicted masks, the learned dynamics progressively reconnect broken regions, prune loose fragments and converge towards stable, topologically consistent results. We show how refinement NCA (rNCA) can be easily applied to repair common topological errors produced by different base segmentation models and tasks: for fragmented retinal vessels, it yields 2-3% gains in Dice/clDice and improves Betti errors, reducing $β_0$ errors by 60% and $β_1$ by 20%; for myocardium, it repairs 61.5% of broken cases in a zero-shot setting while lowering ASSD and HD by 19% and 16%, respectively. This showcases NCA as effective and broadly applicable refiners."

    "abstract": "Multi-scenario multi-task recommendation (MSMTR) systems must address recommendation demands across diverse scenarios while simultaneously optimizing multiple objectives, such as click-through rate and conversion rate. Existing MSMTR models typically consist of four information units: scenario-shared, scenario-specific, task-shared, and task-specific networks. These units interact to generate four types of relationship information flows, directed from scenario-shared or scenario-specific networks to task-shared or task-specific networks. However, these models face two main limitations: 1) They often rely on complex architectures, such as mixture-of-experts (MoE) networks, which increase the complexity of information fusion, model size, and training cost. 2) They extract all available information flows without filtering out irrelevant or even harmful content, introducing potential noise. Regarding these challenges, we propose a lightweight Automated Information Flow Selection (AutoIFS) framework for MSMTR. To tackle the first issue, AutoIFS incorporates low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to decouple the four information units, enabling more flexible and efficient information fusion with minimal parameter overhead. To address the second issue, AutoIFS introduces an information flow selection network that automatically filters out invalid scenario-task information flows based on model performance feedback. It employs a simple yet effective pruning function to eliminate useless information flows, thereby enhancing the impact of key relationships and improving model performance. Finally, we evaluate AutoIFS and confirm its effectiveness through extensive experiments on two public benchmark datasets and an online A/B test."

    "abstract": "The factors that control the maximum energy attained by protons and electrons during magnetic reconnection are investigated analytically and using large-scale simulations with the \\textit{kglobal} model. Previous work revealed that a strong ambient guide field strongly impacts particle energy gain during reconnection, suppressing energy gain from Fermi reflection by increasing the radius of curvature of reconnected field lines. However, previous simulations have also shown that the maximum energy gain increases with the system size. The physical basis for this result has not been explored. We perform simulations that vary the effective system size over a large range to isolate the processes determining the maximum energy gain. The maximum energy $W_{max}$ is regulated by the number of magnetic-island mergers that occur, as multiple flux ropes that form at early time repeatedly merge until the largest approaches the system scale. Fermi reflection in these repeated mergers dominates particle energy gain. The number of mergers is linked to the effective system size -- larger systems produce a larger number of flux ropes and more mergers. That $W_{max}$ is linked to the number of flux rope mergers has implications for understanding why particle-in-cell simulations only produce powerlaw distributions of energetic particles with a limited range in energy."

Coexistence control is formulated as a constrained Markov decision process with an explicit delay constraint for high-priority traffic and fairness as the optimization goal. Our simulation results show three key findings: (1) signed, threshold-invariant cost scaling with temporal smoothing stabilizes learning and strengthens long-term constraint adherence; (2) use of the contention window parameter for control provides smoother adaptation and better delay compliance than other MAC parameters; and (3) enhanced LBT significantly reduces collisions and improves airtime efficiency. These findings provide practical insights for achieving robust, QoS-aware coexistence control."

However, recent developments in RL have attracted interest due to their potential applications in the control of multirotors. The Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm was used in this paper to train the RL agent. This algorithm is used for environments with continuous state and action spaces, similar to the TRAS, as it does not require a model of the system. The simulation results illustrated the effectiveness of the RL control method. Next, external disturbances in the form of wind disturbances were used to test the controller's effectiveness compared to conventional PID controllers. Lastly, experiments on a laboratory setup were carried out to confirm the controller's effectiveness in real-world applications."

In all tested cases, the student model preserved the teacher's physical accuracy, with a mean RMSE increase below 0.64%, and achieved inference speedups ranging from 4.8x (Navier-Stokes) to 6.9x (Burgers).

Building on the geometric framework developed by Bressan and Chen for quasilinear second-order wave equations, we prove that the solution retains $C^k$ regularity away from a finite number of piecewise $C^{k-1}$ characteristic curves. Furthermore, we provide a description of the solution behavior in the vicinity of these curves. By introducing a Finsler norm on tangent vectors in the space of solutions, expressed in the transformed Bressan-Constantin variables, we introduce a Lipschitz metric representing the minimal energy transportation cost between two solutions."

    "abstract": "The high computational and memory demands of modern deep learning (DL) workloads have led to the development of specialized hardware devices from cloud to edge, such as AMD's Ryzen AI XDNA NPUs. Optimizing general matrix multiplication (GEMM) algorithms for these architectures is critical for improving DL workload performance. To this end, this paper presents a common systematic methodology to optimize GEMM workloads across the two current NPU generations, namely XDNA and XDNA2. Our implementations exploit the unique architectural features of AMD's NPUs and address key performance bottlenecks at the system level. End-to-end performance evaluation across various GEMM sizes demonstrates state-of-the-art throughput of up to 6.76 TOPS (XDNA) and 38.05 TOPS (XDNA2) for 8-bit integer (int8) precision. Similarly, for brain floating-point (bf16) precision, our GEMM implementations attain up to 3.14 TOPS (XDNA) and 14.71 TOPS (XDNA2). This work provides significant insights into key performance aspects of optimizing GEMM workloads on Ryzen AI NPUs."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in video generation have produced vivid content that are often indistinguishable from real videos, making AI-generated video detection an emerging societal challenge. Prior AIGC detection benchmarks mostly evaluate video without audio, target broad narrative domains, and focus on classification solely. Yet it remains unclear whether state-of-the-art video generation models can produce immersive, audio-paired videos that reliably deceive humans and VLMs. To this end, we introduce Video Reality Test, an ASMR-sourced video benchmark suite for testing perceptual realism under tight audio-visual coupling, featuring the following dimensions: \\textbf{(i) Immersive ASMR video-audio sources.} Built on carefully curated real ASMR videos, the benchmark targets fine-grained action-object interactions with diversity across objects, actions, and backgrounds. \\textbf{(ii) Peer-Review evaluation.} An adversarial creator-reviewer protocol where video generation models act as creators aiming to fool reviewers, while VLMs serve as reviewers seeking to identify fakeness. Our experimental findings show: The best creator Veo3.1-Fast even fools most VLMs: the strongest reviewer (Gemini 2.5-Pro) achieves only 56\\% accuracy (random 50\\%), far below that of human experts (81.25\\%). Adding audio improves real-fake discrimination, yet superficial cues such as watermarks can still significantly mislead models. These findings delineate the current boundary of video generation realism and expose limitations of VLMs in perceptual fidelity and audio-visual consistency.

    "abstract": "LLMs achieve remarkable multi-step reasoning capabilities, yet effectively transferring these skills via post-training distillation remains challenging. Existing data selection methods, ranging from manual curation to heuristics based on length, entropy, or overall loss, fail to capture the causal importance of individual reasoning steps, limiting distillation efficiency. To address this, we propose Attention Influence for Reasoning (AIR), a principled, unsupervised and training-free framework that leverages mechanistic insights of the retrieval head to select high-value post-training data. AIR first identifies reasoning-critical attention heads of an off-the-shelf model, then constructs a weakened reference model with disabled head influence, and finally quantifies the resulting loss divergence as the Attention Influence Score. This score enables fine-grained assessment at both the step and sample levels, supporting step-level weighted fine-tuning and global sample selection. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that AIR consistently improves reasoning accuracy, surpassing heuristic baselines and effectively isolating the most critical steps and samples. Our work establishes a mechanism-driven, data-efficient approach for reasoning distillation in LLMs."

In this paper, we mainly study generalized HRS tilting. We first show that an interval of torsion pairs in extriangulated categories with negative first extensions is bijectively associated with torsion pairs in the corresponding heart, which yields several new observations in triangulated categories. Then we obtain a generalization of HRS tilting by replacing hearts of $t$-structures with extended hearts. As an application, we show that certain $t$-structures on triangulated subcategories can be extended to $t$-structures on the whole triangulated categories."

In this work, we performed an EIT experiment in microwave frequency range utilizing a single Fluxonium qubit within a microwave waveguide. The Lambda system is consisted of two plasmon transitions in combination with one metastable state originating from the fluxon transition. In this configuration, the controlling and probing transitions are strongly coupled to the transmission line, safeguarding the transition between 0 and 1 states, and ensuring the Fluxonium qubit is close to the sweet spot. Our observations include the manifestation of EIT, a slowdown of light with a delay time of 217 ns, and photon storage.

While imitation learning models generate realistic trajectories, they often inherit biases from datasets dominated by safe demonstrations, limiting robustness in safety-critical cases. Moreover, most studies rely on open-loop evaluation, overlooking compounding errors in closed-loop execution. We address these limitations with two complementary strategies. First, we propose Group Relative Behavior Optimization (GRBO), a reinforcement learning post-training method that fine-tunes pretrained behavior models via group relative advantage maximization with human regularization. Using only 10% of the training dataset, GRBO improves safety performance by over 40% while preserving behavioral realism. Second, we introduce Warm-K, a warm-started Top-K sampling strategy that balances consistency and diversity in motion selection. Our Warm-K method-based test-time scaling enhances behavioral consistency and reactivity at test time without retraining, mitigating covariate shift and reducing performance discrepancies.

This candidate implies an exceptionally large $J$-factor of $\\sim 10^{23}\\,{\\rm GeV^2\\,cm^{-5}}$, exceeding that of known classical dwarf spheroidal galaxies by orders of magnitude and rivaling the Galactic Center. In this work, we utilize more than 17 years of $\\textit{Fermi}$-LAT data to search for gamma-ray emission from this subhalo. We identify a tentative excess in the region with ambiguous origin. Adopting a conservative strategy, we retain this excess without modeling additional astrophysical components, treating it instead as unmodeled background to derive upper limits on the dark matter annihilation cross-section for the $b\\bar{b}$ and $τ^+τ^-$ channels. Despite this conservative treatment, the resulting limits remain stringent due to the exceptionally large $J$-factor. Subject to the dynamical confirmation of the subhalo, these constraints are potentially orders of magnitude stronger than those obtained from combined analyses of dwarf spheroidal galaxies and blind subhalo searches."

    "abstract": "Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a lightweight and effective alternative to Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF) for aligning large language and vision-language models. However, the standard DPO formulation, in which both the chosen and rejected responses are generated by the same policy, suffers from a weak learning signal because the two responses often share similar errors and exhibit small Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. This leads to slow and unstable convergence. To address this limitation, we introduce Reflective Preference Optimization (RPO), a new framework that incorporates hint-guided reflection into the DPO paradigm. RPO uses external models to identify hallucination sources and generate concise reflective hints, enabling the construction of on-policy preference pairs with stronger contrastiveness and clearer preference signals. We theoretically show that conditioning on hints increases the expected preference margin through mutual information and improves sample efficiency while remaining within the policy distribution family. Empirically, RPO achieves superior alignment with fewer training samples and iterations, substantially reducing hallucination rates and delivering state-of-the-art performance across multimodal benchmarks."

Following a ``Wizard of OZ'' data collection paradigm, the expert enacts a wearable intelligent assistant, looking at the activities performed by the trainee exclusively from their egocentric point of view, answering questions when asked by the trainee, or proactively interacting with suggestions during the procedures. This unique data collection protocol enables Ego-EXTRA to capture a high-quality dialogue in which expert-level feedback is provided to the trainee. Two-way dialogues between experts and trainees are recorded, transcribed, and used to create a novel benchmark comprising more than 15k high-quality Visual Question Answer sets, which we use to evaluate Multimodal Large Language Models.

    "abstract": "The mechanical performance of plant fibres is linked to the presence of crystalline elements dispersed within an amorphous cohesive matrix. The more the crystalline reinforcement is aligned with the fibre axis, the better the mechanical properties of the fibre. With the aim of developing entirely biobased biomimetic fibres as alternatives to synthetic or resource-consuming fibres, we have studied the fabrication of hydrogel filaments made from mixtures of nanocelluloses, biobased crystalline nanoparticles acting as reinforcement, and xyloglucans, a plant wall hemicellulose with a strong affinity for cellulose surfaces. These will ensure cohesion between the nanocelluloses. To optimize the orientation of the nanocelluloses within the filaments, and thus potentially improve the mechanical properties of the fibres, we present a study on the development of a millifluidic method of flow-focusing. The developed setup uses external sheath flows to focus and align a nanocellulose suspension central flow. Different configurations in terms of concentrations, circuit designs and flow velocities are tested. 3D printed circuits are explored to produce versatile geometries and optimize the process design. To qualify the orientations during the process, observations with a polarized microscope (POM) are made, as the alignment of the nanocellulose crystalline structures creates birefringence in suspensions. Significant optical phase shifts related to the nanocellulose particles' orientations are visible by color gradients, varying with the suspensions' concentrations and flow velocities. Results demonstrate successful tuning of nanocellulose orientation into anisotropic hydrogels using different millifluidic circuit geometries, with the introduction of xyloglucans to produce new types of biosourced fibres."

However, the interest around C. reinhardtii goes beyond its swimming capabilities. In fact, light can drastically alter its behavior: under blue illumination, the cell attaches to a nearby surface and intermittently glides on it. Such a gliding motility is powered by molecular-motor proteins operating on the cell's cilia, and the related machinery has established the cell as a prime reference for the study of intraciliary-transport mechanisms. This is what we focus on in the present work, by combining in-line holographic microscopy -which leads to unprecedented spatial and temporal resolutions on the gliding dynamics -and statistical inference. We show that, while gliding, the cells exhibit anomalous-diffusive features, including Lorentzian-like distributions of displacements, which are reminiscent of enhanced search strategies. The latter may be exploited by the cells to facilitate colony formation, or, more broadly, by organisms possessing an intraciliary-transport machinery for the transport of cargo molecules and signaling. Furthermore, gliding trajectories, by being intermittent, are valid candidates to infer forces at the molecular-motor scale that are necessary for the cells to move, or symetrically, to transport cargo molecules. We report a gliding threshold of about 20 pN, compatible with the activity of single molecular motors."

Deep learning enables high-resolution spatiotemporal forecasts that can surpass traditional numerical models, while FL allows institutions in different locations to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data, addressing efficiency and security concerns. While FL has shown promise across heterogeneous regions, its distributed nature introduces new vulnerabilities. In particular, data poisoning attacks, in which compromised clients inject manipulated training data, can degrade performance or introduce systematic biases. These threats are amplified by spatial dependencies in meteorological data, allowing localized perturbations to influence broader regions through global model aggregation. In this study, we investigate how adversarial clients distort federated surface temperature forecasts trained on the Copernicus European Regional ReAnalysis (CERRA) dataset. We simulate geographically distributed clients and evaluate patch-based and global biasing attacks on regional temperature forecasts. Our results show that even a small fraction of poisoned clients can mislead predictions across large, spatially connected areas. A global temperature bias attack from a single compromised client shifts predictions by up to -1.7 K, while coordinated patch attacks more than triple the mean squared error and produce persistent regional anomalies exceeding +3.5 K. Finally, we assess trimmed mean aggregation as a defense mechanism, showing that it successfully defends against global bias attacks (2-13\\% degradation) but fails against patch attacks (281-603\\% amplification), exposing limitations of outlier-based defenses for spatially correlated data."

Here we harness this universality, encoded in the Navier-Stokes-Fourier (NSF) equations, to find general scaling laws for the stationary uniaxial solutions of the compressible NSF problem far from equilibrium. We show for general transport coefficients that the steady density and temperature fields are functions of the pressure and a kinetic field that quantifies the quadratic excess velocity relative to the ratio of heat flux and shear stress. This kinetic field obeys in turn a spatial scaling law controlled by pressure and stress, which is inherited by the stationary density and temperature fields. We develop a scaling approach to measure the associated master curves, and confirm our predictions through compelling data collapses in large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of paradigmatic model fluids. Interestingly, the robustness of the scaling laws in the face of significant finite-size effects reveals the surprising accuracy of NSF equations in describing molecular-scale stationary flows. Overall, these scaling laws provide a novel characterization of stationary states in driven fluids."

The framework encodes model parameters as quantum states with adaptive gate reparameterization, ensuring bounded-error convergence and provable resilience under Completely Positive Trace-Preserving (CPTP) dynamics. NR-QFL employs quantum entropy-based client selection and multi-server coordination for fairness and stability. Empirical validation shows consistent convergence with reduced gradient variance, lower communication overhead, and enhanced noise tolerance under constrained edge conditions. The framework establishes a scalable foundation for quantum-enhanced federated learning, enabling secure, efficient, and dynamically stable ADAS intelligence at the vehicular edge."

    "abstract": "Collaborative perception has garnered significant attention as a crucial technology to overcome the perceptual limitations of single-agent systems. Many state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods have achieved communication efficiency and high performance via intermediate fusion. However, they share a critical vulnerability: their performance degrades under adverse communication conditions due to the misalignment induced by data transmission, which severely hampers their practical deployment. To bridge this gap, we re-examine different fusion paradigms, and recover that the strengths of intermediate and late fusion are not a trade-off, but a complementary pairing. Based on this key insight, we propose CoRA, a novel collaborative robust architecture with a hybrid approach to decouple performance from robustness with low communication. It is composed of two components: a feature-level fusion branch and an object-level correction branch. Its first branch selects critical features and fuses them efficiently to ensure both performance and scalability. The second branch leverages semantic relevance to correct spatial displacements, guaranteeing resilience against pose errors. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of CoRA. Under extreme scenarios, CoRA improves upon its baseline performance by approximately 19% in AP@0.7 with more than 5x less communication volume, which makes it a promising solution for robust collaborative perception."

    "abstract": "The Automatic Identification System (AIS) enables data-driven maritime surveillance but suffers from reliability issues and irregular intervals. We address vessel destination estimation using global-scope AIS data by proposing a differentiated approach that recasts long port-to-port trajectories as a nested sequence structure. Using spatial grids, this method mitigates spatio-temporal bias while preserving detailed resolution. We introduce a novel deep learning architecture, WAY, designed to process these reformulated trajectories for long-term destination estimation days to weeks in advance. WAY comprises a trajectory representation layer and Channel-Aggregative Sequential Processing (CASP) blocks. The representation layer generates multi-channel vector sequences from kinematic and non-kinematic features. CASP blocks utilize multi-headed channel- and self-attention for aggregation and sequential information delivery. Additionally, we propose a task-specialized Gradient Dropout (GD) technique to enable many-to-many training on single labels, preventing biased feedback surges by stochastically blocking gradient flow based on sample length. Experiments on 5-year AIS data demonstrate WAY's superiority over conventional spatial grid-based approaches regardless of trajectory progression. Results further confirm that adopting GD leads to performance gains. Finally, we explore WAY's potential for real-world application through multitask learning for ETA estimation."

    "abstract": "Machine-learning (ML) models in polymer science typically treat a polymer as a single, perfectly defined molecular graph, even though real materials consist of stochastic ensembles of chains with distributed lengths. This mismatch between physical reality and digital representation limits the ability of current models to capture polymer behaviour. Here we introduce PolySet, a framework that represents a polymer as a finite, weighted ensemble of chains sampled from an assumed molar-mass distribution. This ensemble-based encoding is independent of chemical detail, compatible with any molecular representation and illustrated here in the homopolymer case using a minimal language model. We show that PolySet retains higher-order distributional moments (such as Mz, Mz+1), enabling ML models to learn tail-sensitive properties with greatly improved stability and accuracy. By explicitly acknowledging the statistical nature of polymer matter, PolySet establishes a physically grounded foundation for future polymer machine learning, naturally extensible to copolymers, block architectures, and other complex topologies."

Our main goal is to classify positive solutions of the equation at the Sobolev-critical exponent, and furthermore to prove that the existence of such solutions implies rigidity of the manifold and triviality of the weight. This is possible when the weighted manifold has non-negative finite dimensional Bakry-Émery Ricci curvature, and even under the weaker condition of non-negative infinite dimensional Bakry-Émery Ricci curvature, up to imposing some additional conditions in the latter case. To exhibit the sharpness of these additional conditions, we construct a non-trivial positive solution of the critical problem on a weighted manifold with positive infinite dimensional curvature. We also obtain a corresponding rigidity result for solutions of the Liouville equation on weighted Riemannian surfaces. Finally, we prove some non-existence theorems when the nonlinearity is sub-critical or simply under certain volume growth conditions. In particular, the latter rules out all positive solutions on shrinking gradient Ricci solitons."

However, this comes at the cost of increased memory access latency due to the need to rely on the network fabric to transfer data between remote nodes. As such, it is crucial to ascertain an application's memory latency sensitivity to minimize the overall performance impact. Existing tools for measuring memory latency sensitivity often rely on custom ad-hoc hardware or cycle-accurate simulators, which can be inflexible and time-consuming. To address this, we present EDAN (Execution DAG Analyzer), a novel performance analysis tool that leverages an application's runtime instruction trace to generate its corresponding execution DAG. This approach allows us to estimate the latency sensitivity of sequential programs and investigate the impact of different hardware configurations. EDAN not only provides us with the capability of calculating the theoretical bounds for performance metrics, but it also helps us gain insight into the memory-level parallelism inherent to HPC applications. We apply EDAN to applications and benchmarks such as PolyBench, HPCG, and LULESH to unveil the characteristics of their intrinsic memory-level parallelism and latency sensitivity."

The ecological interactions include interspecific competition for shared substrates, and commensalism, whereby one species benefits from the metabolic by-products of another. The main motivation comes from individual-based models (IBMs) of microbial aggregates, where simulations reveal that substrate-limited conditions can give rise to rich spatial patterns. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our PDE-based model captures the key qualitative features of three verification scenarios that have previously been investigated with IBMs. Moreover, we formally derive a competition system from an on-lattice biased random walk, and establish local well-posedness for a parameter-symmetric subcase of it. We then formally analyse the travelling wave behaviour of this case in one spatial dimension and compare the minimal travelling wave speed with the wave speed measured in the simulations."

    "abstract": "The problem of depth completion involves predicting a dense depth image from a single sparse depth map and an RGB image. Unsupervised depth completion methods have been proposed for various datasets where ground truth depth data is unavailable and supervised methods cannot be applied. However, these models require auxiliary data to estimate depth values, which is far from real scenarios. Monocular depth estimation (MDE) models can produce a plausible relative depth map from a single image, but there is no work to properly combine the sparse depth map with MDE for depth completion; a simple affine transformation to the depth map will yield a high error since MDE are inaccurate at estimating depth difference between objects. We introduce StarryGazer, a domain-agnostic framework that predicts dense depth images from a single sparse depth image and an RGB image without relying on ground-truth depth by leveraging the power of large MDE models. First, we employ a pre-trained MDE model to produce relative depth images. These images are segmented and randomly rescaled to form synthetic pairs for dense pseudo-ground truth and corresponding sparse depths. A refinement network is trained with the synthetic pairs, incorporating the relative depth maps and RGB images to improve the model's accuracy and robustness. StarryGazer shows superior results over existing unsupervised methods and transformed MDE results on various datasets, demonstrating that our framework exploits the power of MDE models while appropriately fixing errors using sparse depth information."

    "abstract": "Understanding how noise influences nonequilibrium quantum critical dynamics is essential for both fundamental physics and the development of practical quantum technologies. While the quantum Kibble-Zurek (QKZ) mechanism predicts universal scaling during quenches across a critical point, real quantum systems exhibit complex decoherence that can substantially modify these behaviors, ranging from altering critical scaling to completely suppressing it. By considering a specific case of nondemolishing noise, we first show how decoherence can reshape universal scaling and verify these theoretical predictions using numerical simulations of spin chains across a wide range of noise strengths. Then, we study linear quenches in the transverse-field Ising model on IBM superconducting processors where the noise model is unknown. Using large system sizes of 80-120 qubits, we measure equal-time connected correlations, defect densities, and excess energies across various quench times. Surprisingly, unlike earlier observations where noise-induced defect production masked universal behavior at long times, we observe clear scaling relations, pointing towards persistent universal structure shaped by decoherence. The extracted scaling exponents differ from both ideal QKZ predictions and analytic results for simplified noise models, suggesting the emergence of a distinct noise-influenced universality regime. Our results, therefore, point toward the possibility of using universal dynamical scaling as a high-level descriptor of quantum hardware, complementary to conventional gate-level performance metrics."

Yet, near their plasma frequency, conventional isotropic ENZ media remain highly absorptive, limiting nonlinear operations that require good transparency. Longitudinal epsilon near zero metamaterials (LENZ), characterized by a vanishing permittivity along the optical axis provide an exceptional platform for field enhancement while mitigating absorption losses and impedance mismatch. We experimentally show that a Si and ITO multilayer engineered for a LENZ resonance in the near-infrared enables broadband, high pump transmission while still harnessing ENZ enhanced nonlinearity to generate a strong third harmonic signal. This demonstrates that efficient nonlinear processes can be driven without the high-loss conditions typical of isotropic ENZ media and regardless of intrinsic absorption at the harmonic frequency. The resulting third harmonic efficiency is comparable to isotropic ENZ films but without the absorption-induced heating constraints of ENZ operation. The high pump transmission enables transparent LENZ (TLENZ) stacks to be integrated into optical cavities, where resonant field buildup could amplify the nonlinear response without compromising thermal management. These results establish TLENZ multilayers as a robust, versatile platform for transparent, field enhanced nonlinear nanophotonics, combining strong light matter interaction with low-loss operation."

Predominant research efforts focus on end-to-end generation schemes to generate co-speech gestures, spanning GANs, VQ-VAE, and recent diffusion models. As an ill-posed problem, in this paper, we argue that these prevailing learning schemes fail to model crucial inter- and intra-correlations across different motion units, i.e. head, body, and hands, thus leading to unnatural movements and poor coordination. To delve into these intrinsic correlations, we propose a unified Hierarchical Implicit Periodicity (HIP) learning approach for audio-inspired 3D gesture generation. Different from predominant research, our approach models this multi-modal implicit relationship by two explicit technique insights: i) To disentangle the complicated gesture movements, we first explore the gesture motion phase manifolds with periodic autoencoders to imitate human natures from realistic distributions while incorporating non-period ones from current latent states for instance-level diversities. ii) To model the hierarchical relationship of face motions, body gestures, and hand movements, driving the animation with cascaded guidance during learning. We exhibit our proposed approach on 3D avatars and extensive experiments show our method outperforms the state-of-the-art co-speech gesture generation methods by both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

We implement a simple and interpretable QuanvNN architecture that can be directly compared to its classical CNN counterpart, and evaluate its performance on a synthetic NMR-inspired dataset. Our results demonstrate that QuanvNNs outperform classical CNNs on challenging spectra, achieving an 11\\% improvement in F1 score and a 30\\% reduction in mean absolute error for peak position estimation.

This non-vanishing four-part quantum conditional mutual information entropy directly signals the presence of long-range entanglement. In contrast, all other combination of $N$ and $m$ yield vanishing four-part quantum conditional mutual information entropy. Remarkably, in the case of $N, m \\in \\text{odd}$, these long-range entangled features persist even in the presence of a finite transverse field, demonstrating their robustness against quantum fluctuations.

Specifically, UnCoL distills both visual and semantic representations from a frozen foundation model to transfer general knowledge, while concurrently maintaining a progressively adapting teacher to capture fine-grained and task-specific representations. To balance guidance from both teachers, pseudo-label learning in UnCoL is adaptively regulated by predictive uncertainty, which selectively suppresses unreliable supervision and stabilizes learning in ambiguous regions. Experiments on diverse 2D and 3D segmentation benchmarks show that UnCoL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods and foundation model baselines. Moreover, our model delivers near fully supervised performance with markedly reduced annotation requirements."

However, their extension to multi-robot settings with flexible, language-conditioned task specifications remains limited. Furthermore, current diffusion-based approaches incur high computational cost during inference and struggle with generalization because they require explicit construction of environment representations and lack mechanisms for reasoning about geometric reachability. To address these limitations, we present Language-Conditioned Heat-Inspired Diffusion (LCHD), an end-to-end vision-based framework that generates language-conditioned, collision-free trajectories. LCHD integrates CLIP-based semantic priors with a collision-avoiding diffusion kernel serving as a physical inductive bias that enables the planner to interpret language commands strictly within the reachable workspace. This naturally handles out-of-distribution scenarios -- in terms of reachability -- by guiding robots toward accessible alternatives that match the semantic intent, while eliminating the need for explicit obstacle information at inference time. Extensive evaluations on diverse real-world-inspired maps, along with real-robot experiments, show that LCHD consistently outperforms prior diffusion-based planners in success rate, while reducing planning latency."

This paper introduces and formalizes a new, unified theory: the General Theory of Piping Transportation (GTPT), formulated by Darwisman. The GTPT posits that a pipeline system is a complex socio-technical entity whose state and long-term viability are determined by the fully coupled interaction of three interdependent domains: Physical Dynamics (Φ), Life-Cycle Dynamics (Λ), and Socio-Economic Dynamics (Σ). This paper presents the core postulates of the GTPT, which are derived from a systematic synthesis of the fragmented existing literature. The prescriptive power of the theory is illustrated by contrasting the strategic outcomes derived from the GTPT against those from classical theories. By defining resilience as the primary design objective and operationalizing the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the GTPT provides a new theoretical foundation for the design, management, and governance of infrastructure across all critical sectors."

Existing LLM personalization benchmarks are largely centered on two axes: accurately recalling user information and accurately applying remembered information in downstream tasks. We argue that a third axis, likability, is both subjective and central to user experience, yet under-measured by current benchmarks. To measure likability holistically, we introduce LikeBench, a multi-session, dynamic evaluation framework that measures likability across multiple dimensions by how much an LLM can adapt over time to a user's preferences to provide more likable responses. In LikeBench, the LLMs engage in conversation with a simulated user and learn preferences only from the ongoing dialogue. As the interaction unfolds, models try to adapt to responses, and after each turn, they are evaluated for likability across seven dimensions by the same simulated user. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to decompose likability into multiple diagnostic metrics: emotional adaptation, formality matching, knowledge adaptation, reference understanding, conversation length fit, humor fit, and callback, which makes it easier to pinpoint where a model falls short. To make the simulated user more realistic and discriminative, LikeBench uses fine-grained, psychologically grounded descriptive personas rather than the coarse high/low trait rating based personas used in prior work. Our benchmark shows that strong memory performance does not guarantee high likability: DeepSeek R1, with lower memory accuracy (86%, 17 facts/profile), outperformed Qwen3 by 28% on likability score despite Qwen3's higher memory accuracy (93%, 43 facts/profile). Even SOTA models like GPT-5 adapt well in short exchanges but show only limited robustness in longer, noisier interactions."

Leveraging our 18-million multimodal and comprehensive medical retrieval database derived from PubMed scientific papers, we pioneer the integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) into CL. Specifically, we employ a multi-modal, multi-layer RAG system that provides real-time guidance for model fine-tuning through dynamic, on-demand knowledge retrieval.

    "abstract": "Self-supervised reinforcement learning (RL) presents a promising approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) without reliance on expensive human-annotated data. However, we find that existing methods suffer from a critical failure mode under long-horizon training: a \"policy collapse\" where performance precipitously degrades. We diagnose this instability and demonstrate that simply scaling the number of rollouts -- a common strategy to improve performance -- only delays, but does not prevent, this collapse. To counteract this instability, we first introduce M-GRPO (Momentum-Anchored Group Relative Policy Optimization), a framework that leverages a slowly evolving momentum model to provide a stable training target. In addition, we identify that this process is often accompanied by a rapid collapse in policy entropy, resulting in a prematurely confident and suboptimal policy. To specifically address this issue, we propose a second contribution: an adaptive filtering method based on the interquartile range (IQR) that dynamically prunes low-entropy trajectories, preserving essential policy diversity. Our extensive experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that M-GRPO stabilizes the training process while the IQR filter prevents premature convergence. The combination of these two innovations leads to superior training stability and state-of-the-art performance."

    "abstract": "We study group-averaged Markov chains obtained by augmenting a $π$-stationary transition kernel $P$ with a group action on the state space via orbit kernels. Given a group $\\mathcal{G}$ with orbits $(\\mathcal{O}_i)_{i=1}^k$, we analyse three canonical orbit kernels: namely the Gibbs $(G)$, Metropolis-Hastings $(M)$, and Barker $(B)$ kernels, as well as their multiplicative sandwiches $QPQ$ and the additive mixtures $\\frac{1}{2}(P+Q)$ where $Q\\in\\{G,M,B\\}$. We show that $M^t, B^t \\to G$ blockwise as $t \\to \\infty$ under suitable conditions, that the projection chains induced by $(\\mathcal{O}_i)_{i=1}^k$ coincide for $GPG$ and $P$, and that orbit averaging never deteriorates the absolute spectral gap or asymptotic variance when $P$ is reversible. We give a direct and simple proof of Pythagorean identity under the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, showing that $GPG$ arises naturally as an information projection of $P$ onto the set of $G$-invariant transition matrices. For a given $P$, we characterise the optimal choice of $G$ with a fixed number of orbits that minimises the one-step KL divergence to stationarity. Analogously, for a given $G$, we characterise the optimal choice of $P$ and give sufficient conditions under which $GPG = Π$. We further show that alternating projections over multiple group actions converge at a rate governed by the singular values of an overlap matrix, and that in structured cases, this yields exact sampling where the number of group actions grows logarithmically with the size of the state space. Based on the theory, we propose two heuristics to tune $G$ in practice. We also illustrate the results on discrete uniform and multimodal examples, including the Curie-Weiss model where $GPG$ achieves polynomial (in inverse temperature and dimension) mixing while Glauber dynamics remains exponentially slow."

    "abstract": "The study of mechanisms for enhancing superconductivity has been a central topic in condensed matter physics due to the combination of fundamental and technological interests. One promising route is to exploit non-equilibrium effects in the steady state. Efforts in this direction have so far focused on enhancing the pairing mechanism known from thermal equilibrium through modified distributions for the electrons or the bosons mediating the electron-electron interaction. In this work, we identify an additional pairing mechanism that is active only outside thermal equilibrium. By generalizing Eliashberg theory to non-equilibrium steady states using the Keldysh formalism, we derive a set of Eliashberg equations that capture the effect of this genuinely non-thermal pairing glue even in the weak-coupling regime. We discuss two examples where this mechanism has a major impact. First, in a temperature-bias setup, we find that superconductivity is enhanced when the boson mediator is colder than the electrons. Second, we find that an incoherent drive of the boson mediator at energies much greater than the temperature pushes the system far from thermal equilibrium but leaves the critical coupling essentially unchanged, owing to a competition between electron heating and the enhancement of pairing by the non-thermal glue."

We introduce a unified mathematical framework for modeling concession dynamics based on a hyperbolic tangent curve, and propose two metrics burstiness tau and the Concession-Rigidity Index (CRI) to quantify the timing and rigidity of offer trajectories. We conduct a large-scale empirical comparison between human negotiators and four state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) across natural-language and numeric-offers settings, with and without rich market context, as well as six controlled power-asymmetry scenarios. Our results reveal that, unlike humans who smoothly adapt to situations and infer the opponents position and strategies, LLMs systematically anchor at extremes of the possible agreement zone for negotiations and optimize for fixed points irrespective of leverage or context. Qualitative analysis further shows limited strategy diversity and occasional deceptive tactics used by LLMs. Moreover the ability of LLMs to negotiate does not improve with better models. These findings highlight fundamental limitations in current LLM negotiation capabilities and point to the need for models that better internalize opponent reasoning and context-dependent strategy."

    "abstract": "We developed Macular, a simulation platform with a graphical interface, designed to produce in silico experiment scenarios for the retina and the primary visual system. A scenario consists of generating a three-dimensional structure with interconnected layers, each layer corresponding to a type of 'cell' in the retina or visual cortex. The cells can correspond to neurons or more complex structures (such as cortical columns). The inputs are arbitrary videos. The user can use the cells and synapses provided with the software, or create their own using a graphical interface where they enter the constituent equations in text format (e.g., LaTeX). They also create the three-dimensional structure via the graphical interface. Macular then automatically generates and compiles the C++ code and generates the simulation interface. This allows the user to view the input video and the three-dimensional structure in layers. It also allows the user to select cells and synapses in each layer and view the activity of their state variables. Finally, the user can adjust the phenomenological parameters of the cells or synapses via the interface. We provide several example scenarios, corresponding to published articles, including an example of a retino-cortical model. Macular was designed for neurobiologists and modelers, specialists in the primary visual system, who want to test hypotheses in silico without the need for programming. By design, this tool allows natural or altered conditions (pharmacology, pathology, development) to be simulated."

By encoding fermionic and gauge degrees of freedom into qubits using the Jordan-Wigner and quantum-link schemes, we obtain a compact Pauli Hamiltonian that retains the relevant topological vacuum structure. Ground states are prepared using a feedback-based quantum optimization protocol, enabling numerical evaluation of the vacuum energy E0(θ) on a few-qubit simulator. Our results show a displaced vacuum at nonzero θin agreement with strong-interaction expectations, and demonstrate that introducing a dynamical axion field drives the system toward θ= 0, thereby realizing the Peccei-Quinn mechanism within a minimal quantum simulation. These results illustrate how quantum hardware can examine symmetry violation and its dynamical resolution in gauge theories."

However, the rapid fading of their afterglows and the scarcity of spectroscopic measurements make photometric classification crucial for timely high-redshift identification. We present an ensemble machine learning framework for redshift classification of GRBs based solely on their optical plateau and prompt emission properties. Our dataset comprises 171 long GRBs observed by the Swift UVOT and more than 450 ground-based telescopes. The analysis pipeline integrates robust statistical techniques, including M-estimator outlier rejection, multivariate imputation using Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations, and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator feature selection, followed by a SuperLearner ensemble combining parametric, semi-parametric, and non-parametric algorithms. The optimal model, trained on raw optical data with outlier removal at a redshift threshold of z equals 2.0, achieves a true positive rate of 74 percent and an area under the curve of 0.84, maintaining balanced generalization between training and test sets. At higher thresholds, such as z equals 3.0, the classifier sustains strong discriminative power with an area under the curve of 0.88. Validation on an independent GRB sample yields 97 percent overall accuracy, perfect specificity, and an ensemble area under the curve of 0.93. Compared to previous prompt- and X-ray-based classifiers, our optical framework offers enhanced sensitivity to high-redshift events, improved robustness against data incompleteness, and greater applicability to ground-based follow-up. We also publicly release a web application that enables real-time redshift classification, facilitating rapid identification of candidate high-redshift GRBs for cosmological studies."

Through consistent experimental validation across various decomposition and projection setups, we provide strong theoretical evidence: the standard attention gradient is suboptimal. We demonstrated that selectively scaling these components, focusing primarily on $0^{th}$ order bidirectional parallel spans, yields the most effective learning signal. On the limited WikiText-2 dataset, and using a crude configuration, this method achieved a $0.56\\%$ reduction in validation loss, confirming the framework's fundamental validity and suggesting significant potential gains on larger datasets and deeper training regimes"

Specifically, the main linac of the ILC demands a BPM resolution better than 5 μm to support stable beam transport and minimize emittance growth. To address this, we have developed an L-band cavity BPM optimized for the beam conditions of the ILC. In this paper, we introduce a prototype of an L-band cavity BPM and its signal processing system, describe the methodology for position resolution measurements, discuss the problems and solutions encountered in the past experiment, and report the projected position resolutions of about 300 nm at best."

Experimental results collected across two environments with different layouts demonstrate that sigmoid-based amplitude weighting consistently achieves superior cross-environment performance, yielding 50.1% and 55.2% reductions in root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE), respectively, compared with baseline methods. Data augmentation provides additional though modest benefits, with improvements up to 8.8% in MAE. By contrast, transfer learning proves indispensable for large spatial shifts, achieving 82.1% and 91.3% reductions in RMSE and MAE, respectively, with 540 target-domain samples. Taken together, these findings establish a highly practical direction for developing radar sensing systems capable of maintaining robust accuracy under spatial variations by integrating deep learning models with amplitude-based preprocessing and efficient transfer learning."

Two of the limiting factors include the increased computational cost of adding more statistics to overcome gauge noise, as well as suppressed overlap with the ground state of the boosted pion. Here we apply two noise reduction techniques, all-mode averaging (AMA) and momentum smearing, to the computation of $F_π(Q^2)$ at high momentum transfers using the Feynman-Hellmann (FH) theorem. First, we show that all-mode averaging by itself produces good improvement compared to previous results, at an equal computational cost. We also implement a momentum smearing technique to further reduce statistical uncertainties. In contrast to conventional smearing approaches, our Feynman-Hellmann method requires combining back-to-back momentum states, and hence we adapt a version of smearing involving a superposition of back-to-back smearing operations. This method is then implemented to compute $F_π(Q^2)$ at $Q^2 = 6.6 \\;\\mathrm{GeV^2}$, demonstrating good improvement over the regular smeared counterpart. Finally both all-mode averaging and momentum smearing are combined to determine $F_π(Q^2)$ at $Q^2 = 6.6 \\;\\mathrm{GeV^2}$ showing an excellent preliminary improvement over previous calculations."

To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose K-VARK (Kernelized Variance-Aware Residual Kalman filter), a novel approach that integrates a kernelized, probabilistic model of joint residual torques into an adaptive Kalman filter framework. Through Kernelized Movement Primitives trained on optimized excitation trajectories, K-VARK captures both the predictive mean and input-dependent heteroscedastic variance of residual torques, reflecting data variability and distance-to-training effects. These statistics inform a variance-aware virtual measurement update by augmenting the measurement noise covariance, while the process noise covariance adapts online via variational Bayesian optimization to handle dynamic disturbances. Experimental validation on a 6-DoF collaborative manipulator demonstrates that K-VARK achieves over 20% reduction in RMSE compared to state-of-the-art sensorless force estimation methods, yielding robust and accurate external force/torque estimation suitable for advanced tasks such as polishing and assembly."

Periodicities may originate from different physical processes, including the intermittent gas feeding of the black holes caused by the time-varying non-axisymmetric binary potential, the Doppler boosting of the flux emitted by individual accretion discs bound to the orbiting BHs, and the gravitational lensing of the accretion disc of one black hole due to the presence of the other. Only the Doppler boost scenario applied to circular binaries with non-modulated accretion predicts a sinusoidal light curve, while in the general case, binary signals are expected to show more complex periodic patterns. Current searches for massive black hole binaries rely on techniques tailored to quasi-sinusoidal light curves, but fail to identify the more complex periodicities predicted. We present an alternative method that leverages Gaussian processes, making use of a generic periodic kernel flexible enough for the identification of arbitrary periodicities in unevenly sampled light curves with realistic quasar noise. We demonstrate that it outperforms previously proposed strategies in identifying general periodicities by analysing mock light curves with different baselines. Specifically, we find that our analysis can detect non-sinusoidal periodicities (e.g., sawtooth-shaped) and retrieves a higher fraction of true periodicities when compared to periodogram analysis or Gaussian processes analysis with less flexible periodic kernels. Furthermore, by comparing the retrieved fraction of periodicities between mock PTF light curves and mock LSST light curves, we find that our analysis is most sensitive to the number of observed cycles. The application of this analysis has the potential to greatly increase the scientific return of current and upcoming large time-domain photometric surveys."

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition that adversely affects cognitive abilities. Language-related changes can be automatically identified through the analysis of outputs from linguistic assessment tasks, such as picture description. Language models show promise as a basis for screening tools for AD, but their limited interpretability poses a challenge in distinguishing true linguistic markers of cognitive decline from surface-level textual patterns. To address this issue, we examine how surface form variation affects classification performance, with the goal of assessing the ability of language models to represent underlying semantic indicators. We introduce a novel approach where texts surface forms are transformed by altering syntax and vocabulary while preserving semantic content. The transformations significantly modify the structure and lexical content, as indicated by low BLEU and chrF scores, yet retain the underlying semantics, as reflected in high semantic similarity scores, isolating the effect of semantic information, and finding models perform similarly to if they were using the original text, with only small deviations in macro-F1. We also investigate whether language from picture descriptions retains enough detail to reconstruct the original image using generative models. We found that image-based transformations add substantial noise reducing classification accuracy. Our methodology provides a novel way of looking at what features influence model predictions, and allows the removal of possible spurious correlations. We find that just using semantic information, language model based classifiers can still detect AD. This work shows that difficult to detect semantic impairment can be identified, addressing an overlooked feature of linguistic deterioration, and opening new pathways for early detection systems."

    "abstract": "Generalization remains the central challenge for interactive 3D scene generation. Existing learning-based approaches ground spatial understanding in limited scene dataset, restricting generalization to new layouts. We instead reprogram a pre-trained 3D instance generator to act as a scene level learner, replacing dataset-bounded supervision with model-centric spatial supervision. This reprogramming unlocks the generator transferable spatial knowledge, enabling generalization to unseen layouts and novel object compositions. Remarkably, spatial reasoning still emerges even when the training scenes are randomly composed objects. This demonstrates that the generator's transferable scene prior provides a rich learning signal for inferring proximity, support, and symmetry from purely geometric cues. Replacing widely used canonical space, we instantiate this insight with a view-centric formulation of the scene space, yielding a fully feed-forward, generalizable scene generator that learns spatial relations directly from the instance model. Quantitative and qualitative results show that a 3D instance generator is an implicit spatial learner and reasoner, pointing toward foundation models for interactive 3D scene understanding and generation.

We study the ability of future Stage IV surveys to obtain an unbiased reconstruction of the $m$-bias in differing scenarios, considering differing bias morphologies, and characteristic scales, as well as differing metrics to quantify the signal-to-noise ratio of the reconstructed map. Considering an $m$ pattern repeating on $\\sim 1^\\circ\\times1^\\circ$ sky patches, as might be the case for an $m$ field caused by focal-plane systematics. With a Euclid-like redshift distribution, we find that $\\sim5\\%$ rms variations in $m$-bias may be detected at the 20$σ$ level, after stacking between $\\sim400$ and $\\sim1000$ patches (rising to between $\\sim2800$ and $\\sim7600$ for $1\\%$ rms variations, data volumes that are becoming available with upcoming surveys), depending on the morphology of the $m$ pattern. We show that these results are robust against the cosmological model assumed in the reconstruction, as well as the presence of intrinsic alignments or baryonic effects, and that the method shows no spurious response to additive ($c-$) bias.

Under these conditions, and assuming 100 e-folds for the homogeneous solution, the requirement for 60 e-folds of inflation occurs at a critical characteristic scale $μ_{crit} \\approx 0.02m_{P}$, corresponding to an $r_{crit} \\approx 10^{-6}$.

In this work, we present QFANG, a scientific reasoning language model capable of generating precise, structured experimental procedures directly from reaction equations, with explicit chain-of-thought reasoning. To develop QFANG, we curated a high-quality dataset comprising 905,990 chemical reactions paired with structured action sequences, extracted and processed from patent literature using large language models. We introduce a Chemistry-Guided Reasoning (CGR) framework that produces chain-of-thought data grounded in chemical knowledge at scale. The model subsequently undergoes supervised fine-tuning to elicit complex chemistry reasoning. Finally, we apply Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to further enhance procedural accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that QFANG outperforms advanced general-purpose reasoning models and nearest-neighbor retrieval baselines, measured by traditional NLP similarity metrics and a chemically aware evaluator using an LLM-as-a-judge. Moreover, QFANG generalizes to certain out-of-domain reaction classes and adapts to variations in laboratory conditions and user-specific constraints. We believe that QFANG's ability to generate high-quality synthesis procedures represents an important step toward bridging the gap between computational synthesis planning and fully automated laboratory synthesis."

However, existing methods struggle with this compositional task. To this end, we propose RoboTracer, a 3D-aware VLM that first achieves both 3D spatial referring and measuring via a universal spatial encoder and a regression-supervised decoder to enhance scale awareness during supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Moreover, RoboTracer advances multi-step metric-grounded reasoning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) with metric-sensitive process rewards, supervising key intermediate perceptual cues to accurately generate spatial traces. To support SFT and RFT training, we introduce TraceSpatial, a large-scale dataset of 30M QA pairs, spanning outdoor/indoor/tabletop scenes and supporting complex reasoning processes (up to 9 steps). We further present TraceSpatial-Bench, a challenging benchmark filling the gap to evaluate spatial tracing. Experimental results show that RoboTracer surpasses baselines in spatial understanding, measuring, and referring, with an average success rate of 79.1%, and also achieves SOTA performance on TraceSpatial-Bench by a large margin, exceeding Gemini-2.5-Pro by 36% accuracy. Notably, RoboTracer can be integrated with various control policies to execute long-horizon, dynamic tasks across diverse robots (UR5, G1 humanoid) in cluttered real-world scenes."

This study evaluates four abliteration tools (Heretic, DECCP, ErisForge, FailSpy) across sixteen instruction-tuned models (7B-14B parameters), reporting tool compatibility on all 16 models and quantitative metrics on subsets dictated by tool support. Single-pass methods demonstrated superior capability preservation on the benchmarked subset (avg GSM8K change across three models: ErisForge -0.28 pp; DECCP -0.13 pp), while Bayesian-optimized abliteration produced variable distribution shift (KL divergence: 0.043-1.646) with model-dependent capability impact. These findings provide researchers with evidence-based selection criteria for abliteration tool deployment across diverse model architectures. The principal finding indicates that mathematical reasoning capabilities exhibit the highest sensitivity to abliteration interventions, with GSM8K change ranging from +1.51 pp to -18.81 pp (-26.5% relative) depending on tool selection and model architecture."

We perform a deep dive into a classification task based on United States Supreme Court (SCOTUS) decisions. The SCOTUS corpus is an ideal classification task to study for LLM memory accuracy because it presents significant challenges due to extensive sentence length, complex legal terminology, non-standard structure, and domain-specific vocabulary. Experimentation is performed with the latest LLM fine tuning and retrieval-based approaches, such as parameter-efficient fine-tuning, auto-modeling, and others, on two traditional category-based SCOTUS classification tasks: one with 15 labeled topics and another with 279. We show that prompt-based models with memories, such as DeepSeek, can be more robust than previous BERT-based models on both tasks scoring about 2 points better than previous models not based on prompting."

We consider two spherically-symmetric static mini-superspace models with matter fields and verify the robustness of this emergent symmetry at the classical level: (i) Maxwell field with cosmological constant and (ii) $n$ massless scalar fields. We develop a method based on canonical transformations and show that: for model (i), 3D Schrödinger symmetry emerges, and the solution is the (anti-) de Sitter Reissner-Nordström spacetime, and for model (ii), $(2+n)$D Schrödinger symmetry appears, and the solution is a generalized Janis-Newman-Winicour spacetime and its ``interior\", a Kantowski-Sachs type closed universe. In the matter decoupling limit, both cases lead to 2D Schrödinger symmetry in different lapse functions and mini-superspace coordinates, which implies the covariance of Schrödinger symmetry. Finally, we propose a physical interpretation of the symmetry under Hamiltonian constraints $H$ and explain it with examples: Symmetry generators commuting with $H$ map a solution to another one, while those non-commuting with $H$ generate a new theory with the Schrödinger symmetry and the transformed configuration is a solution to the new theory. These support the robustness of the emergence of Schrödinger symmetry and open new possibilities for exploring quantum dynamics of matter and gravity based on the symmetry."

By defining `time' variables and computing observables in a flat region attached to the dS boundary, we evaluate bra-ket wormhole contributions to scalar two-point functions and find a late-time transition in the dominant saddle, accompanied by ramp-and-plateau behavior of correlations and characteristic timescale comparable to the fast scrambling. Our results are built upon (i) inflationary horizon exit and re-entry, (ii) enhancement of correlation at small comoving momentum $k$ by wormhole contribution, and (iii) a competition between mode counting and topological suppression that drives a transition to wormhole dominance. Although results are qualitatively consistent, one needs to address wormhole stabilization to clearly interpret in terms of the entropy context."

A negative Ricci scalar flips the sign of a non-minimally coupled mass term for a non-minimally coupled complex field $Φ$, driving its radial mode to large amplitudes via a tachyonic instability. At large $|Φ|$, higher-dimensional $U(1)$-breaking operators become relevant and impart a kick in the angular direction, generating a conserved $U(1)$ charge that sustains rotation as the symmetry is approximately restored. Because phases randomize across causally disconnected regions, multiple domains with distinct charges form. The subsequent axion potential converts the domain charges into an axion abundance, yielding dark matter even when the net global charge vanishes. We analyze the dynamics through a linear, domain-averaged treatment and identify two thermal histories: (i) Ricci reheating via saxion decays to Higgs bosons; (ii) external reheating with efficient damping of saxion energy by Higgs/fermion scatterings. The mechanism populates regions underabundant in standard misalignment, which are accessible to next generation axion searches."

We compared two statistical frameworks tailored to such endpoints: the joint frailty model (JFM) and the last-event assisted recurrent-event win ratio (LWR). The JFM specifies proportional hazards for the recurrent and terminal events linked through a shared frailty, yielding covariate-adjusted, component-specific hazard ratios that account for informative recurrences and dependence with death. The LWR is a nonparametric, prioritized pairwise comparison that incorporates all observed events over follow-up and summarizes a population-level benefit of treatment while respecting a pre-specified hierarchy between death and recurrences. We first assessed the performance of the methods using simulations that varied both the gamma-frailty variance and the event rates. Next, we investigated these two frameworks using practical clinical applications, to assess the performance of the methods and to estimate the sample size required to achieve adequate power. These two approaches delivered complementary insights. The JFM provided component-specific estimates, while the LWR led to a summary measure of treatment effect with direction. Power was systematically improved with JFM, which thus appeared as the most reliable approach for inference and sample size estimation. Methodological extensions of the LWR to appropriately handle censoring and to formalize causal estimands remain a promising direction for future research."

In contrast with classical null controllability, systems with memory require the simultaneous annihilation of both the state and the accumulated memory at the terminal time in order to prevent post-control reactivation of the dynamics. Assuming that the memory kernel is a finite sum of exponentials, we reformulate the problem as a coupled parabolic--ODE system. Within this framework, we introduce a geometric condition on moving control regions, referred to as the Memory Geometric Control Condition (MGCC), which requires that every spatial point be visited by the control region during the control horizon. Under MGCC, we establish an augmented observability inequality for the adjoint system by means of a flow-adapted Carleman estimate. This observability result, which explicitly accounts for the memory variables, allows us to derive memory-type null controllability via the Hilbert Uniqueness Method. We also discuss the limitations of the approach and explain why full geometric necessity results remain out of reach in the presence of memory effects. The analysis provides a rigorous sufficient geometric condition for memory-type null controllability of parabolic equations with exponential memory kernels and moving controls."

In practice, however, earthquake catalogs report magnitudes with finite resolution, resulting in a discrete (geometric) distribution. To determine the lowest magnitude above which seismic events are completely recorded, the Lilliefors test is commonly applied. Because this test assumes continuous data, it is standard practice to add uniform noise to binned magnitudes prior to testing exponentiality. This work shows analytically that uniform dithering cannot recover the exponential distribution from its geometric form. It instead returns a piecewise-constant residual lifetime distribution, whose deviation from the exponential model becomes detectable as catalog size or bin width increases. Numerical experiments confirm that this deviation yields an overestimation of the magnitude of completeness in large catalogs. We therefore derive the exact noise distribution - a truncated exponential on the bin interval - that correctly restores the continuous exponential distribution over the whole magnitude range. Numerical tests show that this correction yields Lilliefors rejection rates consistent with the significance level for all bin widths and catalog sizes. The proposed solution eliminates a methodological bias in completeness estimation, which especially impacts high-resolution catalogs."

    "abstract": "Denoising language models (DLMs) have been proposed as a powerful alternative to traditional language models (LMs) for automatic speech recognition (ASR), motivated by their ability to use bidirectional context and adapt to a specific ASR model's error patterns. However, the complexity of the DLM training pipeline has hindered wider investigation. This paper presents the first independent, large-scale empirical study of DLMs. We build and release a complete, reproducible pipeline to systematically investigate the impact of key design choices. We evaluate dozens of configurations across multiple axes, including various data augmentation techniques (e.g., SpecAugment, dropout, mixup), different text-to-speech systems, and multiple decoding strategies. Our comparative analysis in a common subword vocabulary setting demonstrates that DLMs outperform traditional LMs, but only after a distinct compute tipping point. While LMs are more efficient at lower budgets, DLMs scale better with longer training, mirroring behaviors observed in diffusion language models. However, we observe smaller improvements than those reported in prior character-based work, which indicates that the DLM's performance is conditional on factors such as the vocabulary. Our analysis reveals that a key factor for improving performance is to condition the DLM on richer information from the ASR's hypothesis space, rather than just a single best guess. To this end, we introduce DLM-sum, a novel method for decoding from multiple ASR hypotheses, which consistently outperforms the previously proposed DSR decoding method. We believe our findings and public pipeline provide a crucial foundation for the community to better understand, improve, and build upon this promising class of models.

    "abstract": "Space-time modulation of refractive index can produce synthetically moving interfaces with arbitrary apparent velocities, including superluminal motion, offering new ways to control light in dynamic media. On the other hand, space-time wave packets are structured waves whose spatio-temporal spectra lie on tilted space-time planes, so their group velocity can be programmed, including superluminal values, even in a uniform medium. Here we develop a general theory of space-time refraction for such structured waves at a planar moving interface and show how a single boundary reshapes their velocity content. By identifying the invariants of a translating boundary, we obtain refraction laws for baseband, X-wave, and sideband packets that apply for arbitrary interface velocities and connect smoothly to static and purely temporal limits. These laws reveal regimes of \"space-time anomalous optical push broom,\" where a moving interface compresses a wide range of incident velocities into a narrow transmitted band, and \"velocity spectral optical fission,\" where an incident X-wave splits into two propagation-invariant branches with distinct velocities. The combined freedom to prepare waves with superluminal group velocity and to prescribe equally unconstrained interface speeds points toward reconfigurable time gating, optical buffering, velocity multiplexing, and controlled emission in moving media, and provides a route to photonic settings capable of emulating dynamical effects traditionally associated with gravitational or quantum processes."

Understanding how redundant and synergistic interaction emerges from elementary connectivity patterns is important in characterizing the behavior of physical, biological, and engineering systems. In this study, the information-theoretic framework of Partial Information Decomposition (PID) is employed to investigate how pairs of signals measured at the nodes of large network systems contribute individually and in cooperation with each other to determine the overall state of the network. The analyzed systems are networks of numerically simulated Roessler oscillators and physical single-transistor electronic chaotic oscillators, reproducing purely pairwise and symmetric links in biological neuronal cultures, and cortical electroencephalographic networks assessed in humans. In the two settings, PID was extensively applied to decompose the information brought by pairs of signals to the overall state of the system, assessed respectively as the dynamic regime (from asynchronous chaos to synchronization) and the subject condition (open vs. closed eyes). Our approach highlights the coexistence of redundant and synergistic interplay in determining the effect of the pairwise dynamics on the system's state. Specifically, we demonstrate how, in a highly synchronized system, where units act following overlapped redundant behaviors, their joint consideration helps determine the system's state though their synergistic interactions. Our findings reveal the emergence of non-trivial behaviors in networked system based on pairwise connections and straightforward neural states, highlighting the need for using appropriate analytical tools to capture complex phenomena."

In a practice-oriented simulation study, the mean-field approximation clearly stands its ground in comparison to naïve Monte Carlo methods."

Current NN mitigation relies on seismometer arrays and Wiener filtering, while distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) offers a complementary, low-cost means of obtaining dense strain measurements. We investigate fusion sensor arrays composed of both displacement-measuring seismometers and strain-measuring DAS-type sensors. We extend the Wiener filter formalism to mixed sensor types and introduce analytic S-wave strain correlation coefficients. Using a hybrid differential evolution and covariance matrix adaptation scheme, we validate our approach against established seismometer-only results and analyze the geometry, robustness, and performance of optimized fusion arrays. Fusion arrays enhance P/S-wave disentanglement and achieve NN cancellation levels comparable to, and sometimes exceeding, those of seismometer-only arrays, particularly for small sensor numbers. When sensors are constrained to the ET infrastructure, we find that six seismometers complemented by fourteen strainmeters inside the ET arms can match the performance of twenty seismometers in boreholes, achieving a residual at the 10% level, and thereby offering a cost-efficient pathway toward ET-scale NN mitigation."

Our approach leverages both Nesterov's acceleration technique and the Krasnosel'skii-Mann (KM) iteration, while accounting for delayed inexact oracles, a key mechanism in asynchronous algorithms. We also introduce a unified approximate error condition for delayed inexact oracles, which can cover various practical scenarios. Under mild conditions and appropriate parameter updates, we establish both $\\mathcal{O}(1/k^2)$ non-asymptotic and $o(1/k^2)$ asymptotic convergence rates in expectation for the squared norm of residual. Our rate significantly improves the $\\mathcal{O}(1/k)$ rates in classical KM-type methods, including their asynchronous variants. We also establish $o(1/k^2)$ almost sure convergence rates and the almost sure convergence of iterates to a solution of the problem. Within our framework, we instantiate three settings for the underlying operator: (i) a deterministic universal delayed oracle; (ii) a stochastic delayed oracle; and (iii) a finite-sum structure with asynchronous updates. For each case, we instantiate our framework to obtain a concrete algorithmic variant for which our convergence results still apply, and whose iteration complexity depends linearly on the maximum delay. Finally, we verify our algorithms and theoretical results through two numerical examples on both matrix game and shallow neural network training problems."

This paper considers specifications given in the form of compositionally defined safe nets. The paper discusses a novel concept of distributed place which implements the behaviour of an individual net place. It is shown that if distributed places cover a safe Petri net, then it is possible to delete some places without changing the behaviour. Crucially, the reduction is both static and local, making it computationally feasible in practice. The resulting reduction technique is then applied to an algebra of safe Petri nets (boxes) derived compositionally from process (box) expressions. Though the original derivation can yield exponentially large boxes, prior research demonstrated that if a box expression does not involve cyclic behaviours, the exponential number of places can be reduced down to polynomial (quadratic). In this paper, using distributed places, it is show that similar optimisation can also be achieved in the case of process expressions with iteration."

    "abstract": "In modern manufacturing, Visual Anomaly Detection (VAD) is essential for automated inspection and consistent product quality. Yet, increasingly dynamic and flexible production environments introduce key challenges: First, frequent product changes in small-batch and on-demand manufacturing require rapid model updates. Second, legacy edge hardware lacks the resources to train and run large AI models. Finally, both anomalous and normal training data are often scarce, particularly for newly introduced product variations. We investigate on-device continual learning for unsupervised VAD with localization, extending the PatchCore to incorporate online learning for real-world industrial scenarios. The proposed method leverages a lightweight feature extractor and an incremental coreset update mechanism based on k-center selection, enabling rapid, memory-efficient adaptation from limited data while eliminating costly cloud retraining. Evaluations on an industrial use case are conducted using a testbed designed to emulate flexible production with frequent variant changes in a controlled environment. Our method achieves a 12% AUROC improvement over the baseline, an 80% reduction in memory usage, and faster training compared to batch retraining. These results confirm that our method delivers accurate, resource-efficient, and adaptive VAD suitable for dynamic and smart manufacturing."

However, the planning and design of such complex projects currently lack a transparent and systematic process that system operators can follow when considering such investments in their grids. This paper identifies and classifies the main technical design constraints and considerations relevant to the planning of transmission grid expansion projects, and more specifically, electrical energy hubs. Seven key areas of interest are identified, namely network integration, HVDC technologies, costs (CAPEX, OPEX, and space requirements), electricity market design, future proofness and modular expandability, reliability-availability-maintainability, and sustainability. Each area of interest is analyzed in terms of its technical and operational relevance, with technical design constraints and considerations derived from such analysis. In addition, a hierarchical classification of the identified constraints and considerations (and therefore areas of interest) is introduced, distinguishing them between three criticality classes, namely hard constraints, main drivers, and key considerations. The dependencies between the different areas are discussed, too. Therefore, this work provides system operators and policymakers with a structured basis to support a transparent planning methodology with clear decision hierarchies for investments in transmission grid expansion projects."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLM) have achieved remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks. However, their substantial parameter sizes pose significant challenges for deployment on edge devices with limited computational and memory resources. Low-rank compression is a promising approach to address this issue, as it reduces both computational and memory costs, making LLM more suitable for resource-constrained environments. Nonetheless, naïve low-rank compression methods require a significant reduction in the retained rank to achieve meaningful memory and computation savings. For a low-rank model, the ranks need to be reduced by more than half to yield efficiency gains. Such aggressive truncation, however, typically results in substantial performance degradation. To address this trade-off, we propose SkipCat, a novel low-rank compression framework that enables the use of higher ranks while achieving the same compression rates. First, we introduce an intra-layer shared low-rank projection method, where multiple matrices that share the same input use a common projection. This reduces redundancy and improves compression efficiency. Second, we propose a block skipping technique that omits computations and memory transfers for selected sub-blocks within the low-rank decomposition. These two techniques jointly enable our compressed model to retain more effective ranks under the same compression budget. Experimental results show that, without any additional fine-tuning, our method outperforms previous low-rank compression approaches by 7% accuracy improvement on zero-shot tasks under the same compression rate. These results highlight the effectiveness of our rank-maximized compression strategy in preserving model performance under tight resource constraints."

Using LCURVE we could determine its size, and hence mass, with a direct method and with unprecedented accuracy. We determined the mass of the white dwarf as 0.78 +- 0.02 Msun, the mass ratio Q= MWD / Msec = 4.59, and the orbital inclination i=87.4 +- 0.9. An extended warm region with a central temperature of ~33,000 K was observed in the u-band at the location of the previous high-state accretion spot. Weak accretion was ongoing in the low state that led to cyclotron emission that could best be studied with the r-band data. It has a diameter of only 3deg to 4deg and is located much closer to the binary meridian than the accretion-heated region studied in the u-band. The longitudinal shift of the two accretion regions is of order 30deg, due to early and late coupling of accreted matter onto the magnetic field lines in low and high accretion states, respectively. The low-state cyclotron-emitting region has a vertical extent of 0.005 - 0.016 Rwd, a value that seems to be correlated to the instantaneous accretion rate."

    "abstract": "Code large language models (Code LLMs) are powerful but costly to train, with scaling laws predicting performance from model size, data, and compute. However, different programming languages (PLs) have varying impacts during pre-training that significantly affect base model performance, leading to inaccurate performance prediction. Besides, existing works focus on language-agnostic settings, neglecting the inherently multilingual nature of modern software development. Therefore, it is first necessary to investigate the scaling laws of different PLs, and then consider their mutual influences to arrive at the final multilingual scaling law. In this paper, we present the first systematic exploration of scaling laws for multilingual code pre-training, conducting over 1000+ experiments (Equivalent to 336,000+ H800 hours) across multiple PLs, model sizes (0.2B to 14B parameters), and dataset sizes (1T tokens). We establish comprehensive scaling laws for code LLMs across multiple PLs, revealing that interpreted languages (e.g., Python) benefit more from increased model size and data than compiled languages (e.g., Rust). The study demonstrates that multilingual pre-training provides synergistic benefits, particularly between syntactically similar PLs. Further, the pre-training strategy of the parallel pairing (concatenating code snippets with their translations) significantly enhances cross-lingual abilities with favorable scaling properties. Finally, a proportion-dependent multilingual scaling law is proposed to optimally allocate training tokens by prioritizing high-utility PLs (e.g., Python), balancing high-synergy pairs (e.g., JavaScript-TypeScript), and reducing allocation to fast-saturating languages (Rust), achieving superior average performance across all PLs compared to uniform distribution under the same compute budget."

In this study, we identify linear operators that characterize the behavior of fluid systems across a wide parameter range by using flow field datasets at several representative parameter values. We then comprehensively assess the applicability of ROMs constructed through the interpolation of these operators. Specifically, we consider two intrusive operator-based ROMs: one derived from Galerkin projection and the other based on operator inference using dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). The performance of these ROMs is evaluated for flows around circular and elliptical cylinders over a range of Reynolds numbers and aspect ratios. The Galerkin-based ROM successfully predicts only the eigenvalue and eigenmode corresponding to the fundamental frequency of the Kármán vortex shedding, while other frequencies are not captured and show a decaying behavior. In contrast, the DMD-based ROM accurately predicts both the fundamental frequency and its higher harmonics. Furthermore, visualization of the linear operator matrix elements reveals that interpolation fails when the subspace includes bases contaminated by numerical errors. However, by carefully selecting the subspace dimension and reference conditions, it is possible to accurately predict eigenvalues and corresponding modes even under conditions where multiple low-frequency modes exist outside the harmonic structure of the fundamental frequency. These findings underscore the robustness of the DMD-based parametric operator ROM approach."

Here we show that a phase space theory previously developed to capture electronic momentum and model vibrational circular dichroism -- and which we have postulated should also describe the Einstein-de Haas effect, a macroscopic manifestation of angular momentum conservation -- is also able to recover the $Λ$-doubling energy splitting (or $Λ$-splitting) of the NO molecule nearly quantitatively. The key observation is that, by parameterizing the electronic Hamiltonian in terms of both nuclear position ($\\mathbf{X}$) and nuclear momentum ($\\mathbf{P}$), a phase space method yields potential energy surfaces that explicitly include the electron-rotation coupling and correctly conserve angular momentum (which we show is essential to capture $Λ-$doubling). The data presented in this manuscript offers another small glimpse into the rich physics that one can learn from investigating phase space potential energy surfaces $E_{PS}(\\mathbf{X},\\mathbf{P})$ as a function of both nuclear position and momentum, all at a computational cost comparable to standard Born-Oppenheimer electronic structure calculations."

    "abstract": "As processor designs grow more complex, verification remains bottlenecked by slow software simulation and low-quality random test stimuli. Recent research has applied software fuzzers to hardware verification, but these rely on semantically blind random mutations that may generate shallow, low-quality stimuli unable to explore complex behaviors. These limitations result in slow coverage convergence and prohibitively high verification costs. In this paper, we present Lyra, a heterogeneous RISC-V verification framework that addresses both challenges by pairing hardware-accelerated verification with an ISA-aware generative model. Lyra executes the DUT and reference model concurrently on an FPGA SoC, enabling high-throughput differential checking and hardware-level coverage collection. Instead of creating verification stimuli randomly or through simple mutations, we train a domain-specialized generative model, LyraGen, with inherent semantic awareness to generate high-quality, semantically rich instruction sequences. Empirical results show Lyra achieves up to $1.27\\times$ higher coverage and accelerates end-to-end verification by up to $107\\times$ to $3343\\times$ compared to state-of-the-art software fuzzers, while consistently demonstrating lower convergence difficulty."

    "abstract": "In a seminal paper, Abbott et al. analyzed the relationship between a particle's trajectory and the resolution of position measurements performed by an observer at fixed time intervals. They predicted that quantum paths exhibit a universal Hausdorff dimension that transitions from $d=2$ to $d=1$ as the momentum of the particle increases. However, although measurements were assumed to occur at intervals of time, the calculations only involved evaluating the expectation value of operators for the free evolution of wave function within a single interval, with no actual physical measurements performed. In this work we investigate how quantum measurements alter the fractal geometry of quantum particle paths. By modelling sequential measurements using Gaussian wave packets for both the particle and the apparatus, we reveal that the dynamics of the measurement change the roughness of the path and shift the emergent Hausdorff dimension towards a lower value in nonselective evolution. For selective evolution, feedback control forces must be introduced to counteract stochastic wave function collapse, stabilising trajectories and enabling dimensionality to be tuned. When the contribution of the measurement approaches zero, our result reduces to that of Abbott et al. Our work can thus be regarded as a more realistic formulation of their approach, and it connects theoretical quantum fractality with measurement physics, quantifying how detectors reshape spacetime statistics at quantum scales."

    "abstract": "Mixture models are widely used in modeling heterogeneous data populations. A standard approach of mixture modeling is to assume that the mixture component takes a parametric kernel form, while the flexibility of the model can be obtained by using a large or possibly unbounded number of such parametric kernels. In many applications, making parametric assumptions on the latent subpopulation distributions may be unrealistic, which motivates the need for nonparametric modeling of the mixture components themselves. In this paper we study finite mixtures with nonparametric mixture components, using a Bayesian nonparametric modeling approach. In particular, it is assumed that the data population is generated according to a finite mixture of latent component distributions, where each component is endowed with a Bayesian nonparametric prior such as the Dirichlet process mixture. We present conditions under which the individual mixture component's distributions can be identified, and establish posterior contraction behavior for the data population's density, as well as densities of the latent mixture components. We develop an efficient MCMC algorithm for posterior inference and demonstrate via simulation studies and real-world data illustrations that it is possible to efficiently learn complex distributions for the latent subpopulations. In theory, the posterior contraction rate of the component densities is nearly polynomial, which is a significant improvement over the logarithm convergence rate of estimating mixing measures via deconvolution."

Two of the most prominent concerns are training data extraction and Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs).

In this study, we integrate multiple MIA techniques into the data extraction pipeline to systematically benchmark their effectiveness. We then compare their performance in this integrated setting against results from conventional MIA benchmarks, allowing us to evaluate their practical utility in real-world extraction scenarios."

    "abstract": "Laser Wakefield Acceleration (LWFA) is a promising approach for producing high-brightness electron beams in the GeV energy range, offering significant potential for compact next-generation accelerator facilities. In this work, we present a computational study of LWFA in a specially designed single-stage capillary gas-cell target aimed at producing high-quality, GeV-class electron beams. The capillary cell includes a short (~2 mm) injection region at the entrance filled with a helium (He) and nitrogen (N2 ) gas mixture. This is followed by a longer (~12 mm) pure He section, which provides the required acceleration length and limits continuous ionization injection, thereby significantly reducing the energy spread of the accelerated beam. Hydrodynamic simulations are performed to optimize the capillary geometry and generate the required two-section gas-pressure profile. The resulting gas-density distributions for various cases are then directly incorporated in Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations to study LWFA. In particular, our hydrodynamic simulations demonstrate how tailored density profiles with longitudinal density tapering in the acceleration section can be realized in a capillary gas cell, while the corresponding PIC simulations reveal how these profiles influence the acceleration process and the resulting beam quality. Using a 100 TW-class laser system with parameters relevant to the L2-DUHA laser at the ELI Beamlines Facility, the PIC results demonstrate electron acceleration to mean energies exceeding 1.0 GeV with high-quality beam properties. Self-injected He electrons are also observed, and their impact on the main beam quality is evaluated. The findings of this study provide valuable insights for upcoming LWFA experiments planned within the EuPRAXIA Project at the ELI Beamlines Facility."

Existing approaches often fall short in modeling temporal dependencies across multiple events and in handling queries that reference unseen or rare visual concepts. To address these challenges, we introduce MADTempo, a video retrieval framework developed by our team, AIO_Trinh, that unifies temporal search with web-scale visual grounding. Our temporal search mechanism captures event-level continuity by aggregating similarity scores across sequential video segments, enabling coherent retrieval of multi-event queries. Complementarily, a Google Image Search-based fallback module expands query representations with external web imagery, effectively bridging gaps in pretrained visual embeddings and improving robustness against out-of-distribution (OOD) queries. Together, these components advance the temporal reasoning and generalization capabilities of modern video retrieval systems, paving the way for more semantically aware and adaptive retrieval across large-scale video corpora."

We further confirm this operator counting through an independent analysis using the scattering amplitude formalism in four-dimensional flat spacetime.

Fourier-Floquet decompositions of the electromagnetic fields are used in order to obtain the reflectance, transmittance and absorbance of the nanoribbon array. The spherical particles consist of a vacuum or dielectric core, coated by single 2D material layers. A Mie theory, with boundary conditions modified to accommodate a 2D material at the interface, is applied to theoretically examine these spherical particles. As examples of 2D materials, we consider the excitonic response of hexagonal boron nitride in the ultraviolet, and of the transition-metal dichalcogenide WS2 in the visible. The most important steps and equations for implementing the various methods are provided as a means to an easy introduction to the theory of patterned 2D materials. This renders the article a toolset for investigating the patterning of any 2D material with the intention to tune their optical response and/or introduce hybridization schemes with their excitons. The methods are not restricted to exciton polaritons in 2D semiconductors, but can be applied, by simple replacement of the optical conductivity, to 2D materials exhibiting any polaritonic response."

The numerical analysis is employed to study the coupling characteristics of a representative shielded multiconductor cable under different conditions first. The impacts of cable wiring configurations, cable parameters, and propagation direction of incident electromagnetic waves are given. Then, a horizontally polarized hybrid EMP simulator is constructed, and some radiated tests are conducted to validate the conclusions obtained in numerical analysis. The results show that the open circuit of the shielding layer results in the core wire coupling to the same high voltage as the shielding layer, while grounding the shielding layer significantly reduces the coupling voltage on core wires. In addition, increasing cable height, cable length, elevation angle, and azimuth angle all result in an amplification of the level of coupled current. The experimental outcomes of the radiated tests validate the effectiveness of the simulation and the precision of the numerical analysis results."

    "abstract": "Real-time analytics on video data requires substantial computational resources and high energy consumption, and computational offloading has emerged as a promising solution to support such resource-intensive services. Nevertheless, most of the existing research overlook the resource dependencies induced by object-level correlations in dependent video processing tasks. To address this challenges, we propose a theoretical framework employing a novel scaling factor to model resource dependencies among video tasks, enabling accurate estimation of computation and transmission demands for video blocks with multiple interdependent objects. In contrast to conventional single-objective methods, we formulate the problem as a constrained multi-objective optimization and present a decomposition-based meta-deep reinforcement learning (DOMDRL) framework to balance competing objectives. The proposed approach employs meta-learning to train a meta-model, which is then fine-tuned through limited gradient updates to construct the Pareto front. Simulation results based on real-world datasets demonstrate that DOMDRL reduces average task delay by approximately 9.32%, decreases energy consumption by around 6.26%, and improves video analytics accuracy by about 18.9% compared to state-of-the-art task offloading methods."

    "abstract": "In this paper, a compact wideband circularly polarized (CP) magneto-electric (ME) dipole antenna array is proposed. The CP unit is fed by a microstrip line and coupled to the upper substrate through irregular slots. The radiation patch comprises a pair of L-shaped notched patches and a pair of rectangular patches, forming an electric dipole, while the grounded metal via and ground plane establish a magnetic dipole. By combining the slot and radiating patch design, the electric field vectors of the antenna constitute energies with the same amplitude and a phase difference of 90°, resulting in a circular polarization. Moreover, the CP units are configured in a <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$2 \\times 2$</tex> sequential rotation array, incorporating a metal cavity constructed with substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) to distribute energy more evenly across each CP unit. This approach preserves the wideband and stable radiation characteristics of the ME dipole unit while enhancing the axial ratio bandwidth (ARBW) and gain. HFSS simulations demonstrate that the antenna array achieves an impedance bandwidth (IBW) of 27 % at <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$40.3-52.9 \\text{GHz}$</tex> and an ARBW of 20.8 % at <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$39.3-48.4 \\text{GHz}$</tex>, with a stable and flat gain over the entire frequency band and a peak gain of 13.4 dBic. The antenna array exhibits stable radiations in both horizontal and vertical planes, cross-polarization discrimination (XPD) exceeding 17 dB, and low side-lobe levels (SLL). The proposed circularly polarized antenna array can meet the demands of high bandwidth, low interference and high resolution, especially in the high-speed mobile environment, and its directional beam and circularly polarized characteristics can greatly improve the reliability and stability of communication."

Initially, DNS was designed to support ASCII characters only. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) introduced Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs). IDNs enhanced inclusivity by enabling the use of non-ASCII characters in the DNS. However, vulnerabilities in DNS have also increased with the use of IDNs, due to visually similar characters between different scripts. Various scripts present characteristics that further contribute to DNS vulnerabilities. The Ethiopic script used in several languages within Ethiopia presents unique challenges, which make the DNS open to spoofing attacks. This is due to phonetically redundant characters that are used interchangeably in the Amharic language.This research develops a Machine Learning (ML) model designed to detect domains written in the Ethiopic script, specifically the issue of phonetic redundancy associated with the Amharic language. The model also takes into account homographs and typosquatting. Pairs of benign and malicious domain names were generated using Ethiopic scripts. Eight Machine Learning (ML) models were trained and compared. The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model achieved the highest overall performance, with an accuracy and an AUC-ROC of, 95.82% and 97% respectively.

    "abstract": "We synthesize the literature at the intersection of healthcare and data analytics and examine the use of data analytics methods to improve responsiveness, resilience, and restoration capabilities of healthcare systems when dealing with pandemic/epidemic outbreaks. We develop a conceptual framework to help us organize, analyze, and identify gaps in current research. Analysis of the literature helps us conclude that most of the work in the field supports healthcare institutions improve in terms of responsiveness and resilience, but more focus is needed to help systems restore to normalcy. We identify research gaps such as the development of robust disease surveillance tools based on novel technologies like AI, evaluating the benefits of coordinating limited resources within regional healthcare systems, and reducing risk within the complex healthcare supply chain. Moreover, based on our findings and interactions with practitioners we identify the need to channel more efforts on developing research that supports healthcare institutions as they seek to return to normalcy in the post pandemic world. Health systems are now operating with fewer resources while dealing with an increased number of patients who present multiple comorbidities, while dealing with ongoing shortages of critical supplies. These challenging conditions have resulted in significant financial losses for several healthcare systems post-pandemic. We propose future research directions that can provide a research agenda to scholars in our field seeking to enhance the responsiveness, resilience, and restoration of healthcare systems in preparation for future disease outbreaks."

    "abstract": "A time transfer link consisting of PTP High Accuracy equipment (PTP-HA, e.g., White Rabbit) can transfer time with sub-nanosecond accuracy. Originally PTP-HA equipment is calibrated as a set of two devices. Progress in calibration makes exchange of individual components, such as pluggable transceivers, possible without the need for expensive in-situ end-to-end calibrations. This is expected to be covered in a future release of the IEEE 1588 standard.To determine the latencies of a pluggable transceiver, a time delay calibrated reference photodetector is essential. Latency values are stored in the transceiver memory, which enables exchange without breaking calibration.This paper describes the results of inter-comparing several calibrated reference photodetectors that were calibrated in different calibration setups. These photodetectors were exchanged between laboratories to cross-verify their stated optical to electrical time delays. The initial cross-verification results lead to further investigation of the calibration setup. The results of this investigation will be reported."

    "abstract": "With the increasing integration of photovoltaic (PV) power generation into modern power grids, mitigating output fluctuations caused by weather variability has become a critical challenge. These fluctuations not only jeopardize grid stability but also accelerate the degradation of lithium-ion battery energy storage systems (BESS) when used for smoothing purposes. This paper proposes a fuzzy logic-based power smoothing control strategy that dynamically adjusts the smoothing window size based on real-time weather conditions, including cloud coverage, cloud height, and wind speed. By intelligently determining the window size of a sliding window filter, the proposed method effectively balances power fluctuation mitigation and battery health preservation. The performance of the proposed approach was evaluated using actual PV generation data and compared against traditional smoothing techniques, including moving average, double moving average, low-pass filter, Savitzky-Golay filter, and Gaussian filter. Results indicate that in July, the proposed method reduced the battery cycling frequency to 0.19 cycles per day, which is significantly lower than other filters. Furthermore, the required battery capacity was minimized to 2869.58 kWh, representing an 11.36 % to 66.88 % reduction compared to other methods. The life cycle cost analysis reveals that the proposed method achieved a total cost of USD 46,530.52, which is 7.78 % to 58.03 % lower than the conventional methods evaluated. These results confirm the proposed method's capability to enhance smoothing performance while extending battery life and reducing system costs."

    "abstract": "Lysine crotonylation (Kcr) is an important protein modification occurring after translation in biology, serving an essential function in a range of biological processes in both plants and animals, including the regulation of gene expression, the maintenance of cellular metabolic balance, and the enhancement of photosynthesis. Exploring the detection of Kcr sites is essential for uncovering their biological functions. Nonetheless, conventional experimental approaches for detection are often time-consuming, expensive, and hindered by various technical constraints, making the precise identification of Kcr sites a significant challenge. This study seeks to develop a computational approach for the rapid and accurate prediction of Kcr sites in plant non-histone proteins. We introduce a novel deep learning framework named DeepNhKcr, which integrates the protein language model (ESM2) with a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network. To address the challenge of data imbalance, the model replaces the conventional cross-entropy loss with the focal loss function. In addition, DeepNhKcr combines advanced deep learning approaches with traditional protein encoding strategies to enable effective feature extraction and integration. This method not only significantly boosts the accuracy of predicting Kcr sites in non-histone proteins of plants. but also provides interpretability, shedding light on the potential links between key sequence characteristics and their biological roles. DeepNhKcr delivers outstanding results, surpassing existing machine learning and deep learning models, and demonstrating excellent performance in both five-fold cross-validation and independent test experiments. Moreover, the model integrates interpretability analysis techniques to investigate the connections between important sequence features and their biological roles. DeepNhKcr acts as a powerful method for detecting Kcr sites in plant non-histone proteins and is anticipated to greatly advance future studies in plant Kcr site prediction.

While previous studies have primarily focused on the intrinsic frequency nonlinearity of laser diode, this work considers the broader impact of the entire transmit (TX) chain on ranging accuracy. The nonlinearity of the TX system is newly classified into a static component and a residual component, each requiring independent optimization strategies. To address this, we introduce a double-resampling approach that combines pre-distortion with a post-processing algorithm. Both stages employ similar Hilbert transform-based structures, minimizing algorithmic complexity while enabling high-precision operation even with low-cost or aged TX hardware, which demonstrates strong commercial potential. Experimental results under free-space conditions show a standard deviation (STD) of 0.18 mm and an error rate (Accuracy) of 0.17% at 1 m, with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 6.28 mm, indicating the distance resolution."

These students thus gain not only theoretical skills and knowledge but are also able to apply these skills and knowledge in real practice. The form of teaching presented in this article is focused not only on simple, practical and repetitive applications. Students must study the theory, they have access to practical laboratory measurements of the phenomenon (the coronary noise in our case), which they have to understand thoroughly, and their task will be to apply the theoretical knowledge and the results of research-oriented laboratory measurements to solve real-world problems in practice, in our case, in the urbanised environment of cities and towns. That means generalising theoretical knowledge and the results of laboratory measurements and implementing them into the real problem that occurs in our practice. The issue is deliberately selected because no generalised exact procedures for solving it in practice exist, only general guidelines of how to proceed in such cases. Students must design a methodology and apply that methodology to a real problem. The skills which students thus acquire are priceless for their future practical life."

This paper presents the initial investigation on implementation of Hausdorff window in antenna power weighting, focusing on preliminary findings and practical implications. The investigation includes a theoretical analysis of characteristics and potential advantages of Hausdorff window compared to other window functions. Technical challenges and practical implications in implementing Hausdorff window in antenna power weighting are also investigated. Through simulations, the radiation pattern performance of Hausdorff linear array (HLA) is evaluated, particularly in sidelobe level (SLL) suppression. Initial findings based on array factor observations indicate that the Hausdorff coefficient set is closely similar to the Kaiser coefficient set. Further comparisons will also be made with the Chebyshev and uniform distribution. The SLL suppressions of Hausdorff, Kaiser, Chebyshev, and uniform linear array antenna demonstrate interesting results. The evidences using array factor observation reveal the SLL suppression values of 35.1 dB for Hausdorff, 34.55 dB for Kaiser, 43.21 dB for Chebyshev, and 13.44 dB for uniform.

These techniques commonly utilize only detection algorithms whose main purpose is to detect events in electroencephalography (EEG) recordings. In addition to those, estimation techniques can potentially provide insight into the brain development and indicate regions of higher convulsion rate. The estimation of electrical activity of the brain in adults has been a subject of considerable research interest in adults. To this purpose in this paper we investigate the possibility of estimating the cortical activity of the neonates using physics informed neural networks.

As advanced technology systems become increasingly prevalent across various sectors, the need for robust defence mechanisms against adversarial attacks becomes paramount.

Through a comprehensive literature review, experimental validation using the CIFAR-10 and Insurance Claims datasets, and the development of innovative algorithms, this paper seeks to enhance the resilience of AI models against malicious data manipulation. The study explores various methods, including anomaly detection, robust optimization strategies, and ensemble learning, to identify and mitigate the effects of poisoned data during model training. Experimental results indicate that data poisoning significantly degrades model performance, reducing classification accuracy by up to 27 % in image recognition tasks (CIFAR-10) and 22 % in fraud detection models (Insurance Claims dataset). The proposed defence mechanisms, including statistical anomaly detection and adversarial training, successfully mitigated poisoning effects, improving model robustness and restoring accuracy levels by an average of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$15-20 \\%$</tex>.

However, traditional methods struggle with efficient and accurate electromagnetic reconstruction because of the nonlinear and ill-posed nature of the problem. In recent years, deep learning techniques have rapidly advanced and have been applied to solve the electromagnetic inverse scattering problem, thereby improving reconstruction efficiency. Nevertheless, the lack of a priori information poses significant challenges, leading to poor reconstruction accuracy. This paper introduces a hybrid optimization algorithm that integrates Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) with the U-Net neural network, which excels in image segmentation, to address the electromagnetic reconstruction of regular targets. The most critical step in PSO is to compute the fitness metric, which significantly influences optimization search speed. This metric evaluates each particle's performance and proximity to an optimal solution within the search space. By applying U-Net to accelerate the complex matrix computations required for the fitness value in PSO, the proposed hybrid method not only retains the high accuracy of PSO, but also substantially improves computational speed."

    "abstract": "The decline in the capability of estimating the direction of arrival with high resolution due to the mutual coupling effects has been well known. Many methods have been proposed throughout the year to tackle these problems. In this paper, a new method for increasing the isolation between very closely spaced compact omnidirectional MIMO arrays is proposed. The method is based on introducing an Electromagnetic Band Gap (EBG) structure named the ladder-shaped decoupling structure between closely spaced MIMO arrays to modify the mutual coupling matrix. Comprehensive simulations are conducted with CST Microwave Studio software utilizing a simulated Z-parameters. MUSIC algorithm is applied to evaluate how well the new method performs when mutual coupling is applied. The outcomes are compared to conventional MUSIC approach that does not account for mutual coupling compensation. The findings derived from estimating the DOA illustrates the validity and the efficiency of the suggested method."

    "abstract": "In low-light environments, the visual information in images becomes limited, which often leads to a significant degradation in image classification performance. This is particularly problematic for transformer-based models such as the Vision Transformer, which relies on global attention learned from image patches and is therefore highly sensitive to input quality. In this study, we propose a preprocessing-based approach to improve the classification performance of Vision Transformer under low-light conditions. Specifically, we apply histogram equalization to input images in order to restore contrast and enhance visual features that are often lost in low-light scenes. This enhancement enables Vision Transformer to learn richer and more meaningful visual representations, resulting in improved classification accuracy. Experiments were conducted using the ExDark dataset, which contains images captured under real-world low-light conditions, and the effectiveness of the proposed preprocessing technique was quantitatively evaluated. The results demonstrate that even without modifying the model architecture, histogram-based preprocessing significantly improves the classification performance of Vision Transformer. This study highlights the importance of preprocessing in low-light image classification and presents an efficient strategy for enhancing the practical utility of transformer-based vision models."

    "abstract": "Reasonable forecasting of pork prices is of great significance for stabilizing price fluctuations in the pig market and promoting the healthy and sustainable development of the pig industry.The study addresses the high volatility and nonlinear characteristics of pork prices by proposing a composite forecasting framework that integrates a dynamic state transition mechanism with a dual random forest model to predict the monthly average pork prices. The accuracy of price forecasting is significantly enhanced through the introduction of adaptive feature engineering, a reinforcement learning-driven state transition mechanism, and a trend correction module. The core of the algorithm comprises three innovative mechanisms: (i) a volatility state detection system based on dynamic time warping, which accurately categorizes market states through the synergistic analysis of annualized volatility matrices and price momentum;(ii) a parallel architecture of dual random forest models, designed with differentiated parameters for stable and volatile periods;(iii) a reinforcement learning-driven adaptive weight adjustment mechanism that achieves online optimization of model weights by integrating state transition probability matrices and dynamic threshold control. Empirical research using pork price data from China from 2002 to 2024 demonstrates that the proposed hybrid model achieves an MSE of 0.4691, MAE of 0.4892, RMSE of 0.6849, and MAPE of 2.4056%. The research findings offer a novel methodological framework for agricultural product price forecasting and hold practical value for stabilizing the supply chain of the pork market."

Through a review of current literature and simulations of quantum attacks on legacy protocols, this research identifies critical gaps in preparedness and evaluates emergent quantumresistant solutions. The findings highlight the immediate risks of “store now, decrypt later” attacks, emphasizing the importance of transitioning to PQC algorithms.

    "abstract": "The challenges of marine target detection in polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images include the varied sea state, the secondary sidelobe echoes interference, and similar false alarms on the sea surface. To reduce false alarms that are prone to be detected by the traditional constant false alarm rate (CFAR) and deep learning approaches, a method based on the polarimetric three-component decomposition and the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) is proposed. First, the surface, double-bounce and volume scattering powers of land covers are extracted by the three-component decomposition of reflection symmetry approximation (RSA). Subsequently, using the scattering difference between targets and the sea surface, the GLRT threshold segmentation is carried out on the volume scattering power to extract regions of interest (ROIs) for marine targets. Finally, determining the dynamic range of the double-bounce scattering power of ROIs, ROIs are discriminated by determining whether the average double-bounce scattering power is within the range or not. Experiments are conducted using datasets acquired from RADARSAT-2 and GAOFEN-3 data, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an overall detection rate of over 95 % with a false alarm rate below 10 %, outperforming traditional polarimetric whitening filter and power-based detection methods."

    "abstract": "In high-power RF systems, designing a standing wave detection system is essential for measuring the standing wave ratio (SWR), which reflects the degree of impedance matching between the load antenna and the pre-stage power amplifier. When the signal is in a superior impedance matching state, its transmission will be more efficient, the power loss will be decreased, and the transmission stability will be enhanced, enabling the overall performance of the system to reach the optimum. In practical engineering applications, a standing wave meter is typically utilized to measure the standing wave ratio, forward power, and reverse power. The existing medium and long wave standing wave meters are mainly of several hundred watts, so it is highly meaningful to design and manufacture a high-power, high-precision, small-sized medium and long wave standing wave detection system. The design adopts the centralized parameter bidirectional coupler. Through the reasonable setting of magnetic devices, topology structure, and heat dissipation mode, the system power capacity can reach more than 5 kW, and the working frequency range is set at <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$150 \\text{kHz} \\sim 500 \\text{kHz}$</tex>. A nonlinear compensation circuit is designed to mitigate the nonlinear distortion in the forward and reverse voltage detector. Aiming at the nonlinear issue of the bidirectional coupler topology itself, a high-order curve fitting model is introduced to correct the detection results, ultimately obtaining a more accurate measurement result with the measurement error controlled within 2 %. The system possesses the characteristics of high power, high precision, small volume, and good stability, which is suitable for military and civilian medium and long wave communication. It can operate stably in a special environment and has significant application value."

Traditional farming and current precision agriculture often overlook the spatial variability of soil conditions, leading to suboptimal crop performance and inefficient resource use. Existing mechanical and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based seeding systems are typically designed for monocrop strategies. This study proposes a system that leverages real-time soil analysis and intelligent seeddispensing mechanisms to address these inefficiencies. The core problem is the absence of an integrated, autonomous drone-based system that can detect and analyze spatial soil variations in real time, intelligently select suitable crop types based on conditions, and execute precise multi-crop planting. The proposed system aims to improve land use efficiency, enhance crop yields, promote soil health, and contribute to sustainable agriculture by enabling a UAV to autonomously analyze soil conditions and dynamically plant the most suitable crops in distinct zones within a single field."

However, its application in education remains limited, despite the critical importance of being able to monitor and assess student focus, engagement, and participation in real time to improve learning outcomes and provide timely interventions. This study proposes an IoB-based system that employs deep learning and computer vision to assess and enhance student engagement in real-time. The system's architecture integrates two YOLOv8-based models: a multiclassifier for recognizing six classroom behaviors, and a binary classifier for distinguishing between focused and unfocused states. Anonymized identifiers are used to ensure a consistent and ethical tracking of individual behavior over time. These classifications trigger adaptive interventions designed to maintain or restore students' attention. Given the lack of standard benchmarks for assessing focus in classroom settings, especially under realistic conditions that include ambient noise and peer influence, a dedicated dataset was collected and used to train and evaluate the proposed system's performance in a university classroom context. The experimental results showed that the multi-class model achieved 97% accuracy, while the binary classification model reached 99% accuracy, both outperforming three state-of-the-art baseline methods. In a real-world classroom deployment, 75% of the students who received interventions subsequently re-engaged, underscoring the potential of the framework to improve learning outcomes through timely data-driven behavioral feedback."

    "abstract": "The development of intelligent smart solutions that can analyze satellite images in real conditions represents a major challenge in computer vision applied to environmental monitoring. In this paper, we introduce a new hybrid deep learning architecture, called DESiT (Data Efficient Satellite Image Transformer), combining an optimized Vision Transformer with an attention-based distillation mechanism. This approach integrates local feature extraction through convolutions and global modeling of spatial dependencies using Transformers to enhance the model’s accuracy, robustness, and generalization. The effectiveness of DESiT was evaluated on standard datasets and then validated on a multi-temporal set of real images. The results demonstrate its robustness to seasonal and spectral variations, with performance superior to conventional CNN and hybrid CNN-ViT approaches. Thus, this contribution provides a powerful and adaptable IT solution, enabling continuous, automated, and responsive monitoring of forest fires. Beyond environmental surveillance, this approach also serves as a technological catalyst for the advancement of smart agriculture and optimized crop management through enhanced spatiotemporal understanding of land dynamics."

    "abstract": "Time-series forecasting is widely applied in areas such as energy management, retail demand planning, and operational logistics, where accurate predictions can enhance strategic decision-making. This paper addresses a fundamental challenge in applying transformer architectures to multivariate time-series data: how to preserve inter-feature relationships at each time step when adapting models designed for discrete tokens to continuous numerical sequences. Unlike existing approaches that process each feature dimension independently (column-wise), we propose channel-aware embedding strategies that treat each time step as a unified multivariate observation, preserving the correlations between features within each temporal instance. We systematically evaluate five embedding approaches across two architectural paradigms. First, using GPT-2 as a controlled testbed, we compare three strategies: (1) direct projection of complete time steps into embedding space, (2) windowed tokenization that groups consecutive observations, and (3) adaptive feature binning that creates overlapping sub-vectors to capture local feature correlations while maintaining temporal order. Each approach is tested both with and without Haar wavelet decomposition to separate multi-scale temporal patterns. Second, we develop purpose-built encoder-decoder transformers (DET and ABT) that integrate these channel-aware representations with wavelet processing, demonstrating the transferability of insights from the GPT experiments to more parameter-efficient architectures. On ETTm2 dataset, our bin-based approach reduces MSE by half versus the GPT-based direct embedding for long-horizon forecasts, while our transformer models shows significant improvements on shorter horizons. Our methods also demonstrate strong performance across traffic, weather, and illness datasets."

    "abstract": "Weather radar observations with high spatiotemporal resolution are crucial for predicting and deeply analyzing hazardous weather events and their causes. In scenarios where radar observation equipment is limited, super-resolution algorithms provide an effective solution for generating high spatiotemporal resolution weather radar data. To address this, this study proposes a spatiotemporal super-resolution algorithm for radar precipitation echoes, termed RadBDCL, based on bidirectional deformable convolutional LSTM. By leveraging data from X-band phased-array radar with high spatiotemporal resolution, the proposed algorithm doubles the resolution of S-band dual-polarization radar observations from 6 minutes and 1000 meters to 3 minutes and 500 meters. Compared to the optical flow method combined with bicubic interpolation, RadBDCL achieves a 5.03% improvement in PSNR and a 2.05% increase in SSIM. Furthermore, subjective evaluations by meteorological experts reveal that RadBDCL offers a distinct advantage. These results demonstrate the potential of RadBDCL to improve spatiotemporal super-resolution in meteorological radar precipitation echo applications."

This article is a state-of-the-art literature-driven review addressing the multimodal detection of toxic memes with a specific focus on underrepresented Dravidian languages. The research explores five areas in a structured manner: effectiveness of OCR engines for extracting text from non-Latin script-based memes, coverage of current content moderation frameworks for low-resource languages, privacy issues with automated detection mechanisms, difficulties with multimodal sentiment analysis of Indic memes, and perceptions about automated content moderation for online safety. Through the integration of both meme sentiment analysis and regional language processing, this research points to current deficiencies in multilingual multimodal analysis and construes possibilities for future growth. It highlights that our results underscore the need for culture-sensitive, ethically sound, and technically resilient systems to fight offensive content in multinational digital environments. The manuscript concludes with proposals for data development, model improvement, and user-oriented design for fair content moderation in the Indic environment."

Their high wavelength selectivity and high quality factor are especially useful to implement tunable laser sources having narrow linewidths. The linewidth at the resonant frequency of a microring resonator depends on the gap width between the ring and the straight waveguide. In this work, it is reported the experimental results of several silicon-on-insulator (SOI) micro-ring resonators designed for having different gap widths (100 nm, 150 nm, 200 nm). Moreover, this comparative work is supplemented with comparison between different radii of micro-ring resonators (5 um, 7.5 um, 10um and 17.5 um). The micro-ring resonators made up of the silicon waveguides having 220nm thick and 500nm width, were manufactured using the electron beam lithography (EBL). Apart from the resonance frequencies and free spectral range (FSR) data, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) bandwidth were extracted from the measured data by observing the intersection of the measured power spectral responses at the drop port and through port of the ring resonators. The relationship between the gap width and FWHM bandwidth was established and thereby FWHM bandwidth can be estimated for other gap widths. Moreover, resonance splitting observed for micro-ring resonators having large gap width and small radius were also reported. The coupling coefficient was estimated using the FWHM and the resonant frequency data."

    "abstract": "Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated success in solving complex sequential decision-making problems by integrating neural networks with the RL framework. However, training deep RL models poses several challenges, such as the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning and high computational costs. Transfer learning has emerged as a promising strategy to address these challenges by enabling the reuse of knowledge from previously learned tasks for new, related tasks. This avoids the need for retraining models entirely from scratch. A commonly used approach for transfer learning in RL is to leverage the internal representations learned by the neural network during training. Specifically, the activations from the last hidden layer can be viewed as refined state representations that encapsulate the essential features of the input. In this work, we investigate whether these representations can be used as input for training simpler models, such as linear function approximators, on new tasks. We observe that the representations learned by standard deep RL models can be highly correlated, which limits their effectiveness when used with linear function approximation. To mitigate this problem, we propose a novel deep Q-learning approach that introduces a regularization term to reduce positive correlations between feature representation of states. By leveraging these reduced correlated features, we enable more effective use of linear function approximation in transfer learning. Through experiments and ablation studies on standard RL benchmarks and MinAtar games, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in improving transfer learning performance and thereby reducing computational overhead."

    "abstract": "Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) for cardiac procedures was adopted in the late 90s as a valid alternative to open-heart surgeries, allowing for a minor operative trauma and a faster post-operative recovery. In the context of MIS, the presence of accurate imaging techniques is of paramount importance, as surgeons operate without a direct view of the surgical site. Nowadays, fluoroscopic and ultrasound (US) images, using a Trans-Esophageal probe, are simultaneously employed. The development of real-time three-dimensional Trans-Esophageal Echocardiography has enabled the execution of various trans-catheter procedures. However, recent studies have highlighted the occurrence of esophageal lesions following TEE-guided cardiac interventions. Specifically, blind probe insertion and repeated adjustment for optimal instrument guidance, along with prolonged use-induced heating, appear to be the primary causes of complications. The major reason for using a dual imaging technique is that commercial probes automatically switch off once a temperature threshold of approximately 42.5∘C is reached; for safety reasons related to potential thermal damage to the internal walls of the esophagus. Based on numerical simulations and experimental results, a miniaturized cooling device for TEE probes is proposed, thus reinforcing the reliability of US images in the intraoperative scenario, as they are completely harmless to both patients and doctors. The proposed system consists of a silicone cap incorporating an internal cooling circuit. It does not interfere with the clinical workflow, effectively maintains the probe within a safe temperature range for the entire duration of a surgical procedure, and does not compromise intraoperative image quality."

    "abstract": "Accurate segmentation of multi-branched blood vessels from Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) images is essential to improve efficiency and safety of vascular interventional procedures. However, the high-speed flow of contrast agents may lead to incomplete visualization of multiple blood vessel branches and unclear boundary contours, resulting in the so-called partial labeling issue. This significantly undermines the network’s ability to extract and understand the features of multi-branched vascular structures with uncertain region, thereby severely impairing the accuracy of the recognition results. In this paper, we introduce a novel pseudo-label guided multi-task learning strategy, capable of effectively learning feature representation completion under partial label supervision. Specifically, a pretext task branch that generates boundary pseudo-label signals extracts absence structural information and transfers it to the target task for multi-branch vascular segmentation. To achieve more precise semantic-supplementing between tasks, an affinity-based criss-cross feature propagation (CCFP) module is designed to dynamically fill semantic and structural voids caused by missing categories. Furthermore, to mitigate performance degradation caused by unreliable pseudo-labels, a unique loss function is proposed to constrain redundant information at both the pixel and structural levels. We validate our approach through the creation of an in-house DSA dataset composed of six sub-datasets, each containing different vascular branches. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method not only addresses the challenge of partial labeling but also strikes a balance between pixel-wise accuracy and the preservation of structural integrity, offering potential value in the field of clinical applications."

However, existing studies have primarily focused on one-dimensional (1D) angle estimation using scalar sensor arrays, where ideal uniform white noise is presumed. In this paper, an off-grid framework for joint four-dimensional (4D) parameter estimation is proposed for polarization-sensitive arrays under non-uniform noise. Under this framework, a two-dimensional (2D) dynamic steering matrix-based off-grid estimation (2D DSM-OGE) algorithm is developed for 2D DOA estimation. This algorithm is implemented through an alternating update of the steering matrix and the signal matrix, and it does not rely on the vector cross-product technique, thus without requiring six complete electromagnetic components. In particular, the signal matrix is updated via a stepwise concentration process, which effectively compensates for the impact of non-uniform noise. Furthermore, a combined error minimization estimation (CEME) method is introduced, which enables closed-form estimation of polarization parameters independently of the estimated DOA, without requiring an additional pairing process. Finally, the Cramér-Rao Bound is derived. A series of experimental findings confirm that the proposed method delivers enhanced estimation precision."

Moreover, the security performance of the proposed CF-STIN system is analyzed under cross-layer eavesdropping scenarios, providing valuable insights into its anti-eavesdropping robustness in complex network environments. The structure of this paper is shown as follows: the system model and problem formulation are presented first, followed by the proposed non-SDR optimization algorithm. Simulation evaluation are then discussed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the main findings are summarized in the conclusion."

However, most existing studies for certifiable robustness are about classifiers, and adapting their techniques for FR is a non-trivial problem. In this study, we show that, similar to the image classifications, the 1-Lipschitz condition is sufficient for certifiable robustness of the face recognition system against any ℓ<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><i>p</i></sub> norm adversaries for <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</i> ∈ N∪{∞}.

However, achieving efficient, trusted, and privacy-preserving computing resource sharing in this decentralized environment poses significant challenges. To address these intertwined issues, this article proposes a holistic blockchain and evolutionary algorithm-based computing resource sharing (BECS) mechanism. BECS is designed to dynamically and adaptively balance task offloading among computing resources within the 6 G CPN, thereby enhancing resource utilization. We model computing resource sharing as a multi-objective optimization problem, aiming to navigate these trade-offs. To tackle this NP-hard problem, we devise a kernel-distance-based dominance relation and incorporate it into the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (NSGA-III), thereby significantly enhancing population diversity. In addition, we propose a pseudonym scheme based on zero-knowledge proofs to protect user privacy during computing resource sharing. Finally, security analysis and simulation results demonstrate that BECS can effectively leverage all computing resources in the 6 G CPN, thereby significantly improving resource utilization while preserving user privacy."

    "abstract": "Consumer electronics (CE) in Internet of Things (IoT)-based smart home applications are rapidly growing and used as a daily life part. Authentication has been utilized for decades to secure wireless communication between CE and their interconnected devices. However, the traditional authentication models depend on the user's physiological biometrics, including passwords and fingerprints. These protocols suffers from various attacks, including side-channel attacks, such as shoulder surfing, smudge, and heat-based attacks, due to their limited verification in login sessions only. Particularly in heat-based attacks, such as thermal attacks, where an adversary uses thermal cameras to capture the temperature gradient caused by a thermal energy exchange at a contact point on user interfaces, such as keyboards and mobile phones. This vulnerability poses a security concern in smart homes and results in the leakage of user confidential information and bypassing initial authentication. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of IoT-based applications, highlighting the security concerns, existing technologies and their approaches, and their performance measurements. Next, we propose a novel Continuous Authentication (CA) protocol for CE devices in smart applications for user remote access. We utilize a user behavioral biometrics template for CA using the vector similarity search (VSS) technique. This model ensures smooth CA without breaking the ongoing sessions and offers uninterrupted user authentication. This protocol is validated with proof of concept of VSS; a comprehensive performance analysis, testbed experiment, security analysis, and VSS validation prove its efficiency, scalability, and effectiveness in real-world application. Finally, a FastAPI is designed to demonstrate the novelty of the proposed scheme."

    "abstract": "Wind energy is one of the fastest-growing renewable sources both globally and in Brazil. A key challenge in this sector is the accurate estimation of energy production, which is affected by wind variability and other operational factors. The power curve, which relates wind speed to electrical power, is a fundamental tool for evaluating wind turbine performance. This study proposes an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict power curve using operational SCADA data from a wind farm in southern Brazil. A robust pre-processing strategy was employed, featuring outlier filtering using the 3-sigma rule and air density normalization of wind speed as per the IEC 61400-12-1 standard. The proposed ANN model consists of four hidden layers and an output layer, all using the hyperbolic tangent activation function. Using both air density-normalized wind speed and turbulence intensity as inputs, the model was trained with the Adam optimizer to capture their complex non-linear relationship with power output. The model’s performance was benchmarked against the traditional IEC 61400-12-1 binning method, with the ANN demonstrating high predictive capability and achieving coefficients of determination (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R</i><sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>) greater than 0.96.

    "abstract": "In the context of high-dynamic satellite scenarios, the orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional waveforms. Furthermore, the channel estimation results of OTFS can be directly utilized for navigation. Therefore, OTFS is considered as a promising waveform for blue the 6G satellite integrated communication and navigation (ICAN) internet. Traditional OTFS is limited to integer channel estimation, and conventional methods incur computational overhead to improve estimation accuracy. However, the estimation accuracy is gradually approaching its theoretical limits, making further breakthroughs difficult. To address these challenges, a high-resolution channel estimation method based on Artificial Perturbation (AP)-OTFS is proposed, which treats the receiver DD-grid detector as a rounding quantiser whose resolution is enhanced by zero-mean dithering and achieves estimation performance close to Cramér-Rao lower bound. Based on this, we derive the analytical solution for the constraints of unbiased estimation and the blue minimum number of accumulation pilots, providing guidance for ICAN system. In addition, we conduct detailed analysis and experiments of various AP distributions. Results indicate that uniform AP-OTFS achieves the highest accumulation efficiency, which enhances delay resolution by 2–3 orders and improves pilot efficiency by approximately 5–10 dB compared to the no-perturbation case."

    "abstract": "We propose a general deep plug-and-play (PnP) algorithm with a theoretical convergence guarantee. PnP strategies have demonstrated outstanding performance in various image restoration tasks by exploiting the powerful priors underlying Gaussian denoisers. However, existing PnP methods often lack theoretical convergence guarantees under realistic assumptions due to their ad-hoc nature, resulting in inconsistent behavior. Moreover, even when convergence guarantees are provided, they are typically designed for specific settings or require a considerable computational cost in handling non-quadratic data-fidelity terms and additional constraints, which are key components in many image restoration scenarios. To tackle these challenges, we integrate the PnP paradigm with primal-dual splitting (PDS), an efficient proximal splitting methodology for solving a wide range of convex optimization problems, and develop a general convergent PnP framework. Specifically, we establish theoretical conditions for the convergence of the proposed PnP algorithm under a reasonable assumption. Furthermore, we show that the problem solved by the proposed PnP algorithm is not a standard convex optimization problem but a more general monotone inclusion problem, where we provide a mathematical representation of the solution set. Our approach efficiently handles a broad class of image restoration problems with guaranteed theoretical convergence. Numerical experiments on specific image restoration tasks validate the practicality and effectiveness of our theoretical results."

    "abstract": "Dynamic many-objective optimization problems (DMaOPs) are a class of problems involving more than three objectives. Their objective functions, search space, or constraints may change over time. Dynamic many-objective evolutionary algorithms (DMaOEAs) are typically used to solve DMaOPs and primarily consist of a static optimizer, a change detection mechanism, and a change response mechanism. In this paper, a new hybrid DMaOEA based on the reference vector guided evolutionary algorithm (RVEA) and the grid-based evolutionary algorithm (GrEA), called the dynamic reference vector and grid-based evolutionary algorithm (DRVGrEA), is proposed. In the selection stage of DRVGrEA, a new dynamic angle-penalized distance (DAPD) is introduced to balance convergence and diversity uniformly across all dynamic environments of the problem. At this stage, the GrEA grid-based indicators are still used as a secondary selection mechanism. These mechanisms are applied to different parts of the solutions. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, several experiments were conducted that compared DRVGrEA with six DMaOEAs, including five based on classical algorithms from the literature and one recently proposed method. The experiments used the SDP1–15 benchmark with 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 15 objectives. The results demonstrate that DRVGrEA outperforms or at least matches the performance of the other DMaOEAs. Furthermore, DRVGrEA was also applied to a real-world control problem, namely the PID tuning of an Automatic Voltage Regulator system, where it achieved superior performance compared to all competing algorithms."

By integrating measurements from robot kinematics and an image-based tactile sensor, our framework estimates and tracks object pose while simultaneously generating motion plans in a receding horizon fashion to control the pose of a grasped object. This approach consists of a discrete pose estimator that tracks the most likely sequence of object poses in a coarsely discretized grid, and a continuous pose estimator-controller to refine the pose estimate and accurately manipulate the pose of the grasped object. Our method is tested on diverse objects and configurations, achieving desired manipulation objectives and outperforming single-shot methods in estimation accuracy. The proposed approach holds potential for tasks requiring precise manipulation and limited intrinsic in-hand dexterity under visual occlusion, laying the foundation for closed-loop behavior in applications such as regrasping, insertion, and tool use.

    "abstract": "Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in various vision tasks. However, they tend to underperform on smaller datasets due to their inherent lack of inductive biases. Current approaches address this limitation implicitly-often by pairing ViTs with pretext tasks or by distilling knowledge from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to strengthen the prior. In contrast, Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), a widely adopted self-supervised framework, are inherently structured to preserve topology and spatial organization, making them a promising candidate to directly address the limitations of ViTs in limited or small training datasets. Despite this potential, equipping SOMs with modern deep learning architectures remains largely unexplored. In this study, we conduct a novel exploration on how Vision Transformers (ViTs) and Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) can empower each other, aiming to bridge this critical research gap. Our findings demonstrate that these architectures can synergistically enhance each other, leading to significantly improved performance in both unsupervised and supervised tasks.

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions worldwide. Machine learning holds significant promise for aiding PD diagnosis, yet clinical translation is often hindered by models' inability to generalize across heterogeneous patient populations. This study systematically investigates a critical yet frequently overlooked aspect of this challenge: age-dependent performance bias. Through rigorous evaluation of voice-based PD datasets, this study reveals the clinical shortcomings of traditional single-classifier models: in the older group <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(\\geqslant 60$</tex> years), such models exhibit high sensitivity but at the expense of severely compromised specificity, resulting in intolerable false positive rates. Conversely, in the younger group (<60 years), they exhibit the opposite bias, leading to high rates of missed diagnoses. The study found that while standard models achieve acceptable overall performance metrics, they fundamentally fail to meet clinical application requirements. To address this problem, this paper proposes a stacked ensemble learning architecture. Designed as a strategic solution specifically to mitigate age-related disparities, experimental validation demonstrates that the stacked ensemble model significantly enhances diagnostic stability across demographic strata. This architecture not only elevates sensitivity and specificity for the older group to robust levels of 0.857 and 0.871, respectively, but also maintains balanced sensitivity and specificity performance for the younger group. In this study, we establish the critical importance of conducting performance audits across demographic subgroups and confirm stacked generalization as a powerful tool for developing more equitable, reliable, and clinically translatable AI-driven medical diagnostic systems."

The strategy applies a Fractional-Order Proportional-Integral (FOPI) controller whose parameters are optimized through Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to ensure effective Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT). The performance of the proposed controller is compared with that of a conventional Proportional-Integral (PI) controller under varying wind speed conditions. Evaluation metrics include settling time, overshoot, steady-state error, and stator current Total Harmonic Distortion (THD). Simulation outcomes indicate that the FOPI controller attains a faster settling time of 0.5 s versus 0.9 s for the PI controller, with overshoot reduced from 5.63% to 1.52%. The steady-state error is minimized from 0.32% to 0.064%, reflecting an 80% improvement. Furthermore, stator current THD decreases from 12.70% with PI to 0.79% with FOPI, ensuring superior power quality. In addition to outperforming the PI controller, the proposed method also demonstrates better performance compared with several recently published advanced strategies, confirming its robustness and effectiveness for enhancing stability, dynamic response, and energy extraction efficiency in DFIG-based wind energy systems."

We use heavily doped silicon to take advantage of increased carrier concentration, which translates into plasma frequencies lying in the mid-infrared. Further control of the spectral and directional emissivity is enabled by structuring the pristine silicon surface in the form of one-dimensional grating. The resulting radiating plasmonic modes are engineered by changing the geometrical parameters of the grating including the etching depth, duty cycle and periodicity, leading to tailorable resonant spectral response. Our simulation results predict that variation of the incidence angle has an impact not only on shifting the resonance wavelength, but it also appears to have an impact on the peak absorptance level as well as the quality factor. To experimentally validate the theoretical and simulation predictions, three grating samples are fabricated with etching depth of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$0.5 \\mu \\mathrm{m}$</tex> and periodicity of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$7 \\mu \\mathrm{m}, 8 \\mu \\mathrm{m}$</tex> and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$12 \\mu \\mathrm{m}$</tex>.

In this paper, we have used the DVB-T2 channel models specified by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) and added white Gaussian noise (AWGN) to vary the signal to noise ratio at the receiver.

However, low levels of financial literacy remain a significant barrier to the effective utilization of financial technologies, such as cloud accounting. A lack of understanding of basic accounting principles and financial recording practices has led many MSMEs to operate without adequate financial statements, limiting their access to financing and impairing their ability to make sound business decisions. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of cloud accounting training in improving the financial literacy of MSMEs. Employing a quantitative approach, the study uses a quasi-experimental one-group pre-test and post-test design. A total of 30 MSME participants were selected through purposive sampling to take part in cloud accounting training. Their financial literacy levels were measured before and after the intervention. The results indicate a substantial improvement in participants’ understanding of financial statements, transaction recording, and the use of cloud-based accounting applications. Furthermore, the training contributed to the development of positive financial behavior, including consistent cash flow tracking, financial planning, and openness to adopting digital technologies in financial management. These findings confirm that cloud accounting training enhances not only the cognitive aspects of financial literacy but also fosters behavioral changes among MSMEs toward more systematic and data-driven financial practices. The study highlights the need for integrating digital financial literacy programs into MSME development strategies, accompanied by supportive policies that promote the widespread adoption of financial technologies."

    "abstract": "A new approach to solving the problems of excitation of open resonators (OR) by internal sources is formulated and justified in our works. On the basis of the spectral theory of a two-dimensional OR with ideally conducting cylindrical mirrors, an expression is derived for the Green's function of the OR. With the help of this expression the equations describing the complex amplitudes of the resonant modes are obtained which also enables estimation of the non-resonant radiation of the source from the OR. A similar approach to the solution of excitation problems is also developed for quasi-optical OR described in terms of Fredholm's integral equations. The general structure and character of the dependence of the non-resonant part of the excited field in the vicinity of a single resonant mode on the excitation frequency and Q-factor of this mode are established. A formal transition to the equations of the well-known theory of OR excitation is shown. In the same approximation, equations were formulated and corresponding algorithms for calculating EM fields in the OR with diffraction grating were implemented, which are suitable for describing self-oscillatory regimes in diffraction electronics devices with a non-fixed field structure and which account nonresonant radiation. Power balance equations for an OR with an internal source are obtained and studied. Equations are obtained for slowly varying amplitudes of the resonant modes, suitable for describing single-mode and multimode self-oscillations in oscillators based upon OR. A new form of the power balance equations for active and reactive powers in the system \"OR + Source\" is proposed. This form is convenient for analyzing the non-resonant radiation and suggested the way of calculating the coefficient of radiation energy conversion of a given source into the energy of the OR resonant mode, which consists in calculating the ratio of the <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$Q$</tex>-factor of the excited oscillations to the <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$Q$</tex>-factor of the OR resonant mode."

Traditional edge importance assessment methods are mostly based on static structural features, which often fail to accurately capture the true influence of edges during dynamic information propagation. To address this limitation, we propose a novel edge re-ranking algorithm based on an edge information propagation probability function, termed REIP (re-ranking by Edge Information Probability). This method introduces a new metric, Edge Information Probability (EIP), to dynamically adjust the initial edge importance rankings. We systematically evaluate the performance of REIP under various spreading probabilities and edge removal ratios, using the SIR model on one synthetic network and five real-world networks. Experimental results demonstrate that REIP significantly improves the suppression of information spreading across most scenarios and evaluation indexes, particularly under high spreading probabilities or limited edge removal conditions."

The PID controller remains the most used technique for this type of PV applications; however, the system's response depends on the methodology applied to tune the controller's parameters. In this work, it is proposed to apply the intelligent Sliding Mode Controller (SMC) based on a Learning Algorithm for Multivariate Data Analysis to a Dual Active Bridge PV System. The control approach is designed to get maximum power from the PV array independent of weather conditions, without the use of an additional converter to track maximum power. Simulation results show that the control objectives have been met, as well as the efficacy and robustness of the LAMDA controller in the presented system. The performance assessment of the controller is carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the LAMDA controller in comparison to a PI controller."

While effective in controlled environments, its transfer to real-world applications presents challenges such as false alarms, precision loss, and increased analysis complexity due to operational factors (e.g., heating, vibration, etc.). This paper proposes strategies to enhance the reliability of reflectometry for industrial deployment. Numerical simulations and experiments are conducted to optimize reflectometry system settings (e.g., frequency, sampling, etc.) and to characterize the system under test (e.g., attenuation, velocity, etc.). Industrial integration requires embedded systems tailored to specific operational specifications (e.g., accuracy, coverage, size, etc.). The selection of electronic components, such as DAC/ADC, FPGA, etc., during system design is critical to maintaining performance. Distributed strategies, combined with advanced signal processing and AI-based methods, enhance fault diagnostic. Addressing operational factors early in the development process ensures reliable performance in real-world conditions, effectively bridging the gap between laboratory research and industrial applications."

Although content-based filtering guarantees high-quality metamaterial reconstruction and does not require training, its similarity computations treat each parameter in the design space as equally influential, which may not effectively account for the varying degrees of influence each parameter has in determining the desired metamaterial properties. In addition, finding a solution that meets all design criteria can be challenging in rarely-occurring designs due to data imbalance. To address these challenges, this study integrates a subset selection framework with the content-based filtering algorithm. The subset selection framework employs an iterative filtering algorithm within an interval constrained satisfaction scheme to successively distill the search space. This approach achieves superior reconstruction accuracy and offers a streamlined, computationally efficient solution for rapid metamaterial synthesis."

The system uses improved face detection and feature extraction techniques in conjunction with color characteristics, shape-based local binary textures, and local Gabor Transitional Patterns to increase recognition accuracy. To effectively manage real-time data streams, tracking and detection are additionally optimized using a complex Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) approach.

Tapered microstrip-to-SIW transitions are integrated at the ports to ensure proper impedance matching at the input and output. The proposed triple-band SIW filters utilize the Defective Patch Slot (DPS) and Defective Ground Slot (DGS) approaches with open-loop resonators to disrupt the electromagnetic fields within the SIW cavity, thereby creating multiple resonances from a single compact resonator. The dimensions of the filter are obtained using fundamental relations and optimized using ANSYS HFSS. Fabrication is done via photolithography, followed by a chemical etching process. This design achieves high <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$Q$</tex>-factors of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$226.7,1706$</tex>, and 484.78 respectively, demonstrating an effective method for producing high-performance, multi-band SIW filters with desired passbands, controlled by the initial SIW dimensions and rectangular open-loop resonator patterns.

To achieve optimal coordination among these subsystems, a mixed-integer programming model is developed with the objective of minimizing renewable energy curtailment and is validated using real-world data from a region in Yorkshire, United Kingdom. Case studies demonstrate curtailment reductions of 97.58% on a typical day and 56.94% over a 2,208-hour test period. These improvements are attributed to the effectiveness of the multi-energy coupling strategy in enhancing internal energy utilization and system self-sufficiency. Furthermore, the integration of a hydrogen carbon methanation pathway increases the flexibility of the system and the overall economic viability. These results confirm the potential of the proposed approach for integrated energy systems that aim to achieve carbon neutrality."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to adversarial prompt based injects. These injects could jailbreak or exploit vulnerabilities within these models with explicit prompt requests leading to undesired responses. In the context of investigating prompt injects, the challenge is the sheer volume of input prompts involved that are likely to be largely benign. This investigative challenge is further complicated by the semantics and subjectivity of the input prompts involved in the LLM conversation with its user and the context of the environment to which the conversation is being carried out. Hence, the challenge for AI security investigators would be twofold. The first is to identify adversarial prompt injects and then to assess whether the input prompt is contextually benign or adversarial. For the first step, this could be done using existing AI security solutions like guardrails to detect and protect the LLMs. Guardrails have been developed using a variety of approaches. A popular approach is to use signature based. Another popular approach to develop AI models to classify such prompts include the use of NLP based models like a language model. However, in the context of conducting an AI security investigation of prompt injects, these guardrails lack the ability to aid investigators in triaging or assessing the identified input prompts. In this applied research exploration, we explore the use of a text generation capabilities of LLM to detect prompt injects and generate explanation for its detections to aid AI security investigators in assessing and triaging of such prompt inject detections. The practical benefit of such a tool is to ease the task of conducting investigation into prompt injects."

    "abstract": "Superconducting Fault Current Limiters (SFCLs) are devices designed to protect power systems from the detrimental effects of short-circuit currents. In SFCLs, high-temperature superconducting (HTS) tapes of the second generation (2G) are used. These HTS 2G tapes enter a resistive state—a process known as quenching—when the tape's characteristic critical current is exceeded. This transition effectively limits the fault current, and the critical current thus determines the precise activation point of the SFCL. The SFCL can be installed near a power transformer, for example, in a transformer feeder, where it effectively limits short-circuit currents flowing into the transformer. Thanks to this, the ageing of power transformers and other equipment is reduced, which helps to extend the operational lifespan of power system components. The paper presents the research results related to the influence of SFCL operation on power transformers and their protections. Simulation and experimental results reveal certain limitations in power transformer performance and protection when an SFCL is closely installed."

The unique design of the twisted structure provides the sensor with a different SPR incident angle compared to that of without twisting. The SPR incident angle is adjustable, regulated by the spacing of the twisted turns of the optical fiber. This adjustability enables the sensor to have different refractive index sensitivities, addressing the limitation of single sensitivity enhancement of sensitive materials.

    "abstract": "Rapid electrification of transport presents both challenges and opportunities for distribution system operators (DSOs) seeking to balance supply and demand. In particular, the inherent uncertainty in electric vehicle (EV) user behaviour, in particular arrival and departure times, and state-of-charge requirements, complicates day-ahead scheduling and may lead to suboptimal grid utilisation or unmet charging needs. This paper makes two key contributions. First, it formulates a day-ahead robust optimisation model that accounts for early departure uncertainty via a min-max framework, ensuring guaranteed feasibility under worst-case conditions. Second, it proposes a rollinghorizon dynamic optimisation strategy that re-solves convex scheduling problems in real time as EV availability and market prices are revealed. Together, these approaches are compared under identical local energy and flexibility market constructs. The methodology integrates vehicle state-of-charge dynamics, market participation constraints, and flexibility limits into a unified convex optimisation problem. The robust model utilises pessimistic departure times, while the dynamic model updates schedules hourly based on actual EV behaviour. Case studies with a fleet of 50 EVs demonstrate that the proposed methods can achieve cost savings between 18% and 55% for EV owners. Moreover, the dynamic approach yields more efficient outcomes when compared to robust optimisation. These results highlight the impact of real-time adaptability in EV aggregation, providing DSOs and aggregators with actionable insights on scheduling strategies that balance economic performance and reliability in emerging flexibility markets."

While the class attribute is nominal, the binary decomposition is typically done in an unordered way, which can result in a negative impact on the effectiveness and efficiency of learning binary classifiers in some scenarios. In this paper, we explore whether it is achievable to improve the performance of nominal classification by setting virtual class orders for achieving ordered binary decomposition of the class attribute. Specifically, we propose a framework to search for virtual label orders that are suitable for effectively transforming a nominal classification problem into simpler binary ones, where the framework consists of a heuristic search module for searching local optimal orders and an ensemble module for combining the orders. The experimental results show that our framework leads to an improvement of the classification performance in comparison with arbitrarily assigning a label order or setting the class labels to be unordered. The current work can be regarded as a type of class representation learning. Keywords:"

At Comenius University, systematic efforts have been underway for a few years to address these issues, through the development of institutional guidelines that promote responsible and honest use of AI. Building on this foundation, this paper examines both the advantages and risks of AI adoption in academic environments and focuses on a recent training initiative by the Training Center, a part of the Center for Information Technologies at Comenius University. The initiative focuses on the creation of a comprehensive, interactive, and engaging training course aimed at equipping all university employees and students with the skills necessary for the safe and secure use of AI. This paper introduces the structure and pedagogical design of the course, and outlines the rationale for its development. We believe that this training model successfully balances efficiency, accessibility, and quality, and may serve as a replicable blueprint for other universities seeking to implement large-scale educational interventions.

    "abstract": "This study presents an enhanced Probabilistic Optimal Power Flow (POPF) analysis by integrating Zhao’s Point Estimation Method (Zhao’s PEM) with the Nataf Transformation (NT), aiming to improve computational burden and accuracy when considering power system uncertainties.Traditionally, Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) is widely utilized for POPF calculations due to its ability to generate a comprehensive set of scenarios that effectively capture uncertainties. However, MCS is computationally intensive, often requiring a large number of scenarios to achieve accurate results, which leads to high computational time. In contrast, Zhao’s PEM with NT can effectively represent uncertainties using fewer scenarios than MCS, thereby reducing overall computational time. Accordingly, Zhao’s PEM with NT is applied as an efficient approach for scenario generation in POPF calculation. The performances of the 3-point, 5-point, and 7-point of Zhao’s PEM with NT are compared with the results obtained from MCS in terms of their mean and standard deviation of the POPF parameters. The IEEE 14-bus system is employed to test and validate the POPF. Simulation results indicate that the 7-point of Zhao’s PEM with NT delivers mean and standard deviation values most closely aligned with those of the MCS, while achieving a 99.8544% reduction in computational time."

Moving beyond large language models (LLMs), recent technological trends show the emergence of large vision models (LVMs), indicating that the application scope of AI is expanding at an accelerated pace. Currently, most AI services are implemented through software technologies. However, from the perspective of energy saving and environmental pollution, it is a crucial turning point where a shift to hardware-oriented AI technology must take place. Hardware-oriented AI aims to move away from the conventional series high-speed operation, towards low-power computing technologies that maximize computational concurrency. In order to achieve this goal, changes in computing architecture are necessary, with semiconductor memory technology playing a central role. Simultaneously, recent research indicates that high-speed, large-scale computation systems naturally lead to increased system temperatures, which can produce gases harmful to human health. Although these goals differ in terms of the original starting points, all these technological objectives share a common aim of low-power and small-number computing. This paper examines next-generation AI computing technologies based on large-capacity memory technologies, specifically dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) and flash memories built on relatively mature Si fabrication processing suitable for chip production, evaluating pattern recognition accuracies."

Recent advances have widely explored contrastive learning to improve global feature representations for this task. However, we argue that global feature representations often fail to capture the fine-grained local features crucial for distinguishing remote sensing scenes, which typically include numerous small-scale, densely distributed objects. To address this limitation, we propose Dense Supervised Contrastive Learning (DSCL), which applies supervised contrastive learning at the patch level to improve local feature discriminability. By optimizing a dense pairwise similarity loss across local patches, DSCL significantly boosts generalization in few-shot scenarios. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (UCM, WHU-RS19, and NWPU-RESISC45) demonstrate that DSCL achieves competitive performance compared to recent state-of-the-art methods in both 5-way 1-shot and 5-shot settings, highlighting the potential of local-level feature learning for FSRSSC."

This research uses colloid chemistry theory modeling, molecular dynamics simulation, and laser scattering technologies to study the microstructural development of the transformer oil-water interface under an AC electric field. It establishes a quantitative relationship between the grayscale value of the Tyndall Effect, electric field strength, and moisture content, as well as an analysis of the oil expansion phenomenon in high-moisture oil samples caused by high electric fields and the coupling of oil flow fluctuations and localized glow phenomenon. Simulations reveal that an AC electric field can increase the diffusion depth of the water phase and cause uneven thickening of the transition layer. Experimental results reveal that within the range of 0-6 kV, the grayscale value exhibits a linear correlation with the electric field strength. Furthermore, the higher the moisture content, the more electric field-induced scattering occurs. For the first time, the electric field-induced oil swelling lens effect is observed, where localized glow phenomenon migrates with oil flow. The proposed non-intrusive method surpasses traditional techniques, enabling real-time monitoring of interface dynamics for transformer insulation assessment."

This study presents an effective classification approach for CKD detection using the UCI CKD dataset. The raw data set was rigorously preprocessed which involved feature extraction, management of categorical and numerical variables, and appropriate data partitioning. A Random Forest classifier was trained and evaluated using a robust cross-validation strategy, with typical splits involving 80% for training and $20 \\%$ for testing. The proposed model achieves a classification accuracy of 99%, demonstrating the efficacy of our preprocessing strategy combined with the Random Forest algorithm.

The results support the suitability of Random Forest with clean, well-prepared data for reliable CKD prediction in clinical environments. Future work will focus on validating this approach with datasets collected from the Indian subcontinent for better understanding CKD prevalence and facilitate early diagnosis, particularly within specific cohorts such as diabetic or hypertensive populations, where early detection can significantly aid in timely treatment."

    "abstract": "Since traditional diagnostic approaches for Parkinson’s Disease (PD) tend to rely on the detection of signs of neurological impairment, they do not find PD until after irreparable damage has been inflicted. In this paper, the capability of several machine learning models in predicting the early onset of PD was analyzed by using biomarker data. KNN, Logistic Regression, SVM , Decision tree and Random Forest, were all implemented on the AMP-PD dataset which consists of clinical and biomarker indicators obtained from 248 unique participants. This dataset was cleaned by removing irrelevant features, followed by normalization, and standardization. Models were trained by using a 80:20 train-test split with 5-fold cross validation to ensure robust performance. They were then evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score measurement, and ROC-AUC value to determine the performance. It was found that the Decision tree model had the highest accuracy of 97% after the post-pruning technique was applied. Random Forests achieved an accuracy of 96% with a high recall for the PD class making it useful in cases where sensitivity is of utmost priority. This study illustrates the value of contrasting different ML models for PD prediction and aims to address the lack of research in investigating biomarker-based diagnostics."

    "abstract": "The development of a reliable quadrature intermediate frequency (IF) modulator depends significantly on achieving high linearity and a low output noise floor in analog systems. Quadrature modulation is widely employed in digital communication systems, including fifth-generation (5 G) networks. This paper presents a low-cost, miniature, and highly integrated broadband IF quadrature modulator, incorporating an isolated hybrid up-converter IQ mixer and low-noise amplifiers for IF signal modulation. The proposed system is implemented using off-the-shelf components assembled on a printed circuit board (PCB), with a total power consumption of 950 mW. The design utilizes a four-layer PCB, with the top metal layer featuring minimum trace width, trace-to-trace clearance, and via diameter of 0.1 mm. A comprehensive performance analysis is provided, considering bandwidth, modulation gain, isolation, phase noise, and support for various modulation formats. Simulated and measured results show close agreement, validating the modulator’s effectiveness for integration in IF systems where secure bandwidth availability is critical, such as in WiGi applications. The modulator achieves a wide bandwidth of 7 GHz, spanning $6.5 \\mathrm{GHz}-13.5 \\mathrm{GHz}$, as demonstrated by the reflection coefficients of the in-phase and quadrature inputs. The IQ module exhibits a 2.5 dB noise figure, over the $10-16 \\mathrm{GHz}$ RF range, preserving spectral purity. The carrier noise floor at a 1 MHz frequency offset is approximately $-120 \\mathrm{dBc} / \\mathrm{Hz}$. We verified the IQ module’s functionality by integrating it into a radio over fiber (RoF) system to modulate the signal before transmission."

    "abstract": "A physical backdoor attack framework against face recognition systems, using band-aid stickers as visually plausible triggers, is proposed. The proposed method introduces a dual-branch architecture that decouples identity recognition from trigger classification, enabling the model to maintain high recognition accuracy on clean inputs while inducing targeted misclassification when a specific physical trigger is present. To ensure photorealistic integration, the band-aid undergoes a 3D curvature-aware warping and illumination adjustment process before being applied to facial images. Experiments conducted under both digital and real-world conditions demonstrate the effectiveness and specificity of the attack. Compared to a standard single-task model, the dual-branch model achieves significantly higher attack success rates and lower false positive rates, while remaining robust to unseen trigger types. However, results also reveal a performance gap between digital and physical scenarios, emphasizing the importance of visual distinctiveness and domain consistency. This work highlights the practical feasibility of physical backdoor attacks and provides insights into their design and mitigation."

    "abstract": "The challenges associated with designing and developing practical near-field thermophotovoltaic (NFTPV) devices for low-grade heat recovery have predominantly revolved around enhancing the thermoelectric conversion performance. In response to this, we introduce a low-temperature NFTPV device, aimed at achieving both high energy conversion efficiency and substantial electrical output power. The system includes an emitter composed of tungsten nanowire (WNA)-based hyperbolic metamaterial and a TPV cell comprising p-i-n indium antimonide (InSb) nanowires. The WNA emitter demonstrates a hyperbolic dispersion supporting a high density of states, and the photon tunneling through the vacuum gap enhances and regulates the radiative heat flux according to the source temperature. Our innovative NFTPV cell incorporates nanowire structures for the first time, significantly enlarging the <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathrm{p}-\\mathrm{n}$</tex> junction and allowing for increased excitation of photon-generated carriers to elevate the current intensities. This calculation method can also be applied to other novel structures. Under operating temperatures of 500 K for the emitter and 300 K for the TPV cell with a 50 nm vacuum gap between them, the designed device can achieve an approximate 34% conversion efficiency and approximately <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$1363 \\text{Wm}^{-2}$</tex> electrical output power, which are approximately 10 times and 5 times improvement than the traditional bulk scheme. This proposed method offers a promising avenue for advancing NFTPV devices in low-grade heat recovery applications, thus holding significant potential for achieving high-efficiency energy conversion and high power density."

    "abstract": "Fault current analysis is a key part of designing, managing and analysing an electrical network. The traditional IEC 60909 calculation method has been well established in standards for many decades, however it is based on a number of simplified assumptions to make the computational process simple and efficient. A comparison is also included with the ENA G74 short circuit calculation method. The assumptions used in these methods are creating misleading results in large renewable energy generation plants that have a significant portion of Converter Fed Generation (CFG), by overstating the retained voltages and increasing the calculated fault levels. This paper shows how these assumptions break down in generation sites dominated by CFG, and can produce unrealistic results, due to the constant current output of the CFG. The paper also outlines some of the shortfalls in assessment of Grid Forming Inverters fault contribution."

We present an Omniverse extension that procedurally manipulates meshes-adding defects like cracks or deformations-to produce realistic fault scenarios in manufactured components. We also simulate packaging processes (e.g., vacuum sealing) and introduce a cellular-automata-driven surface-aging algorithm to model corrosion and mold growth (demonstrated on rusting rims and decaying apples). By moving beyond purely texture-based defect simulation, our approach enhances dataset realism and generalization, boosting model accuracy in real-world industrial tasks. This scalable, automated extension broadens the applicability of synthetic data for tailored computer vision training pipelines."

The ability to rapidly and reliably differentiate honey types would benefit both producers and consumers. This study examines the application of nearinfrared (NIR) spectroscopy, combined with chemometric analysis, to differentiate between monofloral and polyfloral honey. A total of 102 honey samples (44 monofloral and 58 polyfloral) were collected from various apiaries across Bulgaria, with botanical origins confirmed through melissopalynology analysis. Spectral data were acquired using a NIRQuest 512 scanning spectrometer (Ocean Optics, Inc.) in the 900-1700 nm range, employing a reflection fiber-optic probe. Soft Independent Modeling of Class Analogy (SIMCA) models were created using various preprocessing techniques. The SIMCA model based on autoscaling, smoothing, and first derivative transformation demonstrated the most consistent performance, with calibration and test accuracies of 98.04 % and 96.08 %, respectively. These results emphasize the potential of NIR spectroscopy as a fast, non-destructive screening tool for honey type classification. In addition, such techniques may be incorporated into industrial workflows for honey quality assessment, including the use of portable NIR instruments suitable for on-site applications."

    "abstract": "Multivariate time-series anomaly detection aims to identify deviations from normal behavior in data streams collected simultaneously from multiple sensors and systems. This approach is widely used across diverse industries to support smooth operation, maintenance, and fault prevention. Modeling complex temporal dynamics presents a significant challenge. In recent years, transformer-based models such as Anomaly Transformer have shown remarkable performance due to their ability to model long-range temporal dependencies. However, transformer is burdened by the computational inefficiency of the standard attention mechanism. In this paper, we propose a novel transformer-based model, DozerAnomaly, that can efficiently detect anomalies in multivariate time series. We integrated a sparse attention mechanism, Dozer self-attention, with local and seasonal adaptation that captures the locality and seasonality of data patterns. It addresses the quadratic complexity of the standard self-attention mechanism by focusing only on relevant time steps, thereby reducing computational overhead. We employ the association discrepancy between prior and series associations to distinguish normal and abnormal time series patterns. Experimental results in five real-world datasets show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency, with a <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{4 2 \\%}$</tex> reduction in floating-point operations (FLOPs) compared to baselines, significantly improving computational efficiency without compromising accuracy."

Using the Fourier transform of generalized functions, fundamental and generalized solutions of the equations are constructed at sublight speeds, which are less than the speed of propagation of electromagnetic waves in the medium. The properties of the convolution of the Green's tensor of differential equations are used to construct solutions for emitters, both distributed and concentrated on moving surfaces and spatial curves. The influence of the speed of movement and frequency of the emitter on the characteristics of its electromagnetic field is investigated.

However, most of these methods cannot ensure real-time application, and the lightweight deployment of network models remains challenging. Additionally, the black-box nature of neural network operations lacks interpretability, which constrains further application expansion.

    "abstract": "For over a decade, the iconic Super Mario Bros. game has been used as a benchmark for research in artificial intelligence (AI) and procedural content generation (PCG). Every PCG technique relies on some sort of level validation to ensure that the generated levels are playable. For this, an artificial agent is used to substitute for a human player. The quality of such an agent directly influences the quality of the work built upon it, as it limits the complexity of levels that can be validated, and its performance affects the size of the generative space that can be explored. In this paper, we present a new Super Mario Bros. agent, which first finds a coarse path over the grid-based abstraction of a game level, and then uses the information to guide an A* search through the simulated states of the game. The proposed agent is the first agent that is able to solve all levels with standard Super Mario Bros. features, while also being the most performant (10x fewer node evaluations needed and 8x faster on the most complex level pack), thus it constitutes a new state-of-the-art for the game and should be used as the new level validation standard. Furthermore, we empirically show that the grid-based search alone can be used for the level validation task with almost the same accuracy as the agent while being faster by two orders of magnitude."

    "abstract": "The deconvolution algorithm is effective in eliminating interference components, but it is prone to being influenced by impulse interference, resulting in suboptimal performance in early bearing fault identification. To address this, this paper proposes an optimal minimum entropy-based morphological deconvolution method (OMEMD). Firstly, morphological filtering is enhanced using the morphological mixed-product operator (MMPO) and novel structural element (SE), constructing an optimized adaptive time-varying morphological filter (OATVMF), which enhances filtering performance. Secondly, the OATVMF is incorporated into the optimal minimum entropy deconvolution (OMED), which removes impulse interference components from original samples and enhances the algorithm’s capability to extract periodic fault components under intense impulse interference conditions. Finally, the third-order cumulant diagonal slice spectrum (TODSS) is applied to process the frequency-domain results, enhancing the saliency of faults. This method can effectively eliminate impulse interference and extract weak fault components from incipient fault signals with considerable robustness. The superiority of the proposed method has been verified through multiple sets of experiments."

The isolation network, strategically positioned between the balun’s differential output ports, employs an inverting transformer combined with an optimized series resistor and a shunt capacitor. This configuration facilitates efficient single-ended-to-differential signal conversion while minimizing coupling and interference between the balanced ports. Theoretical analysis based on even–odd mode decomposition reveals that the shunt capacitor effectively compensates for the leakage inductance reactance of the transformer, thereby achieving broadband resistive loading for even-mode absorption and ensuring high isolation across a wide frequency range.

    "abstract": "Intelligent manufacturing systems progressively advance toward highly collaborative and distributed decision making. Federated learning (FL)-enabled intelligent manufacturing systems facilitate efficient data processing and intelligent decision making by deploying artificial intelligence models at the edge and integrating model aggregation mechanisms. However, anomalies occurring in the local devices on which the local models depend can propagate through the aggregation process, leading to model contamination and performance degradation, thereby compromising the task reliability of the entire system. To address this issue, this article proposes a reliability modeling approach for FL-enabled intelligent manufacturing systems (FL-IMSs). In the proposed model, we characterize the performance degradation process of the local model caused by terminal device failures and its impact on task reliability. This process includes the effect of data quality degradation triggered by device failures on model performance, as well as failure propagation caused by intermodel dependencies. Furthermore, to assess the impact of model performance variations on practical production tasks, a task-oriented reliability metric is introduced. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed modeling approach effectively captures local model performance degradation and task reliability in FL-IMSs under terminal device failure conditions."

Therefore, this paper focuses on spectrum allocation optimization for vehicle platoons in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). To minimize the Age of Information (AoI) between the platoon leader and the infrastructure while maximizing the data transmission probability within the platoon, a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed. This algorithm integrates random network distillation and gradient entropy minimization to jointly optimize communication pattern switching, channel selection, and power control. Considering the large state observation space caused by the time-varying channel conditions in IoV, a random network distillation module based on an intrinsic reward mechanism is introduced to enhance the state exploration capability of vehicle platoons. Furthermore, to strengthen coordination among platoon members, a gradient entropy minimization-based approach is employed to improve credit assignment, enabling platoons to accurately assess their contribution to global performance and dynamically adjust their strategies. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, demonstrating superior performance in reducing AoI and improving data transmission probability in platoon-based vehicular communications."

    "abstract": "Matching redundancy, which refers to fine-grained feature comparison between irrelevant image areas, is a prevalent limitation in current feature matching approaches. It leads to unnecessary and error-prone computations, ultimately diminishing matching accuracy. To reduce matching redundancy, we propose MESA and DMESA, both leveraging advanced image understanding of Segment Anything Model (SAM) to establish semantic area matches prior to point matching. These informative area matches, then, can undergo effective internal feature comparison, facilitating precise inside-area point matching. Specifically, MESA adopts a sparse matching framework, while DMESA applies a dense one. Both of them first obtain candidate areas from SAM results through a novel Area Graph (AG). In MESA, matching the candidates is formulated as a graph energy minimization and solved by graphical models derived from AG. In contrast, DMESA performs area matching by generating dense matching distributions on the entire image, aiming at enhancing efficiency. The distributions are produced from off-the-shelf patch matching, modeled as the Gaussian Mixture Model, and refined via the Expectation Maximization. With less repetitive computation, DMESA showcases an area matching speed improvement of nearly five times compared to MESA, while maintaining competitive accuracy. Our methods are extensively evaluated on four different tasks across six datasets, encompassing both indoor and outdoor scenes. The results suggest that our method achieves notable accuracy improvements for nine baselines of point matching in most cases. Furthermore, our methods exhibit promise generalization and improved robustness against image resolution. Code is available at github.com/Easonyesheng/A2PM-MESA."

    "abstract": "Previous studies on competency-based education (CBE) in Higher Education (HE) have primarily relied on small samples, short time frames, and self-perceived measures of competencies, leaving a gap in understanding how STEM students’ competencies evolve through direct evaluations. This study addresses the challenge of evaluating how students’ competencies evolve throughout CBE programs in HE. We conducted longitudinal analyses of competency evaluation data from a cohort of 4, 044 STEM students enrolled in CBE programs. The study examines the evolution of students’ observed competency ratios across six academic periods and analyzes variations according to four between-subject variables: sex, preparatory school background, geographic region, and knowledge area. Competency data were collected through institutional evaluation processes and transformed for longitudinal analysis. Statistical procedures, including repeated measures ANOVA, post-hoc tests, and linear mixed-effect models, were applied to identify significant changes in competency ratios across time and between groups. Results revealed statistically significant improvements in the observed competency ratios throughout the six academic periods, indicating consistent growth in students’ demonstrated competencies. However, differences across some demographic and institutional factors highlight points where competency development progresses unevenly. These findings provide empirical evidence of how CBE models influence STEM students’ competency acquisition over time. They offer valuable insights for educators, curriculum designers, and policymakers seeking to strengthen CBE implementation. In particular, the study emphasizes the importance of continuous monitoring and targeted instructional support during specific academic stages to ensure that all students achieve the intended competencies by graduation."

Moreover, the total voltage during the OFF state of the converter operation is divided across two switches, allowing for higher DC input voltages or the use of components with lower voltage ratings. However, contrary to the literature, the voltage is not evenly shared between the series-connected switches on a SiC MOSFET-based two-switch flyback. This imbalance is heavily affected by the capacitive characteristics of the pulse transformer, which is often used to achieve floating gate drive. In this work, the effect is thoroughly analyzed using mathematical and simulation models, and the results are verified with a physical converter prototype. The interwinding capacitance of the pulse transformer was found to have a substantial effect on voltage sharing between MOSFETs."

To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel intrusion detection framework lever aging few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) capabilities to achieve robust detection of emerging threats with few samples. This approach pre-trains a backbone traffic classification model and employs few-shot training with prototypical networks. To further reduce catastrophic forgetting while improving both accuracy and system robustness, we incrementally fine-tune the classification model with supervised contrastive learning, and also realize rapid adaptation to new attacks. Evaluations on the intrusion detection datasets CIC-IDS2017 and USTC-TF2016 demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms base line models for emerging attacks detection with few attack samples while preserving effective recognition of known threats"

    "abstract": "This study investigates the origin of gate degradation in AlGaN/GaN HEMTs under high-temperature reverse bias (HTRB) conditions and proposes a buffer engineering strategy to mitigate this degradation. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis reveals the presence of a thin oxide layer between the gate and AlGaN contact. It is found that the holes generated through impact ionization (under high electric fields of HTRB operation), are directed toward the gate due to the intense local electric field under the gate and the field plate overhang, and are accumulated under this energetic barrier. Consequently, these trapped holes cause gate degradation and increased gate leakage. To address this issue, impact ionization, as the initial forcing mechanism of the degradation, is suppressed via thinning the channel GaN (C-GaN) layer. This improvement is attributed to the suppression of the local electric field near the gate region in thin C-GaN HEMTs. Additionally, the impact of C-GaN thinning on breakdown characteristics and RF performance is discussed. Overall, the findings provide insights into the root cause of gate degradation and offer a buffer engineering strategy to minimize gate degradation under deep off-state stress. This approach enhances the reliability of future high-power and high-frequency GaN HEMTs, contributing to their long-term performance in demanding applications."

    "abstract": "Multi-vehicle collaborative trajectory planning for autonomous vehicles has attracted significant attention, yet research aimed at reducing spatial collision probability remains limited. In open-pit mine unloading areas, with their complex environment, flexible tasks, and inertia-induced motion delays in dump trucks, traditional multi-vehicle planning methods based on spatiotemporal trajectories produce planned results that impose strict timing and tracking requirements. This increases the difficulty of controller execution and substantially preserves the risk of vehicle collisions. To address these challenges and fully exploit the open space of unloading areas, this paper innovatively proposes a spatial avoidance-based cooperative multi-vehicle path planning method to minimize collision risks in unstructured environments such as unloading areas. An improved hybrid A* algorithm is proposed, incorporating dynamic routing potential fields (DRP-Hybrid A*) to iteratively generate coarse solutions for the dispersion of multi-vehicle paths. Furthermore, a collision risk minimization multi-vehicle path optimization (CRM-MVPO) algorithm is proposed, which optimizes the path through smoothness and safety distance, minimizing discontinuities and collision risks. Simulation experiments are conducted under two categories, comprising three typical scenarios to validate the approach’s effectiveness: single-entry-single-exit and multiple-entry-multiple-exit multi-dump-point configurations. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively reduces the probability of path overlap and collision risks, enhancing the safety and flexibility of multi-vehicle cooperative operations, and providing a reliable and efficient solution for autonomous driving in complex mining areas."

    "abstract": "Borehole radar, due to its high resolution and extensive radial detection capability, has become an important geophysical tool for detecting complex subsurface fractures. The key to evaluating fracture detectability lies in accurate fracture modeling and numerical simulation. To overcome the limitations of conventional fracture modeling approaches, including geometric oversimplification, inadequate representation of aperture and fracture surface correlation, and incomplete characterization of roughness, we propose a multi-factor three-dimensional (3D) rough fracture modeling method. This method integrates two-dimensional (2D) image reconstruction with the Weierstrass-Mandelbrot (W-M) fractal function, which enables a comprehensive description of fracture geometry, surface roughness, aperture, and correlation between the surfaces of a fracture. Based on the developed models, full-wave electromagnetic simulations of borehole radar are conducted using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method, and the effects of fracture attitudes on radar responses are systematically investigated. The simulation results indicate that variations in dip angle and dip direction significantly influence the characteristics of the borehole radar signals. Fracture surface roughness is also found to introduce perturbations in echo details. Furthermore, the radar migration imaging results are more conducive to the evaluation of fracture attitude, as systematic simulation analysis demonstrates a high morphological consistency between the radar migration imaging results and the geometric projection of the fracture onto the Borehole-Fracture Coupling Plane (BFCP). This is further confirmed by the centroid offset distance and the Intersection over Union (IoU). In addition, the “dip direction ambiguity” in omnidirectional borehole radar detection is revealed, where fractures symmetric about the BFCP generate highly similar radar responses, thereby increasing the difficulty of interpretation. The presented fracture modeling method and observed response patterns from fractures support the accurate detection of complex fractures using borehole radar."

    "abstract": "Single-beam synthetic aperture radar (SAR) Doppler frequency observations have been widely used for retrieving ocean surface radial current velocities. However, the Doppler frequency contains multiple components, among which the systematic shift caused by electronic pointing error (EPE) is difficult to accurately model and remove. This issue is particularly prominent in open-ocean regions without land echo references, where it can significantly affect the accuracy of current retrieval. To address this problem, this study proposes a Bayesian framework–based method for radial current velocity retrieval, which innovatively incorporates the systematic Doppler shift <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">b</i> caused by EPE as a key parameter into the state vector, enabling its joint estimation with the ocean surface radial current velocity. Empirical analysis of 1,800 SAR sub-swath images demonstrates high consistency between the estimated Doppler shift <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">b</i> and land-derived true values, with a standard deviation (STD) of 6.45 Hz and a correlation coefficient (R) exceeding 93%. This validates the method’s capability for accurate EPE estimation in remote ocean regions. Performance comparisons against HF radar observations and drifting buoy measurements confirm that the proposed Bayesian retrieval method significantly outperforms conventional direct approaches: it reduces radial current velocity STD by 0.23 m/s and improves R by 35.60%. Additionally, it effectively corrects systematic biases in the ocean model background field, lowering the STD of the retrieved radial velocity relative to the model by 13.33%. Even in complicated dynamic contexts, the approach retains great accuracy and physical consistency, as demonstrated by case studies in unique regions. In conclusion, the suggested Bayesian retrieval method significantly improves the precision, resilience, and usefulness of radial current velocity retrieval while successfully resolving the technical difficulty of EPE correction in SAR data over open oceans."

    "abstract": "In fields of fault diagnosis, incipient fault features concealed in the vibration signal gathered from the electro-mechanical equipment are difficult to extract under noise interference. Fault features enhancement and adaptive signal decomposition are effective ways to realize the identification of incipient fault. However, the traditional classical bistable stochastic resonance (CBSR) method has the drawbacks of output saturation and limited resonant efficiency. The variational mode decomposition (VMD) algorithm also has the issue of optimal selection of parameters. In this paper, a novel scheme based on multi-stable stochastic resonance (MSSR) and improved VMD (IVMD) is proposed for the diagnosis of incipient fault. Firstly, the stochastic resonance model is upgraded to a second-order equation to improve the filtering efficiency. Potential function applies a multi-stable structure to promote the motion of Brownian particles between wells. Then, a new comprehensive index called Synthetic Kurtosis is designed to achieve parameters optimization of the VMD algorithm. Finally, characteristic frequencies of the incipient fault can be identified sufficiently by envelope analysis of the decomposed components. Both results of simulated and actual signal experiments indicate that the proposed MSSR-IVMD scheme has superior signal enhancement capability and fault diagnosis effectiveness."

    "abstract": "This study focuses on the problem of human-in-the-loop relative pose control for manned spacecraft rendezvous and docking missions under output constraints and actuator saturation. The time-varying constraints for relative pose outputs are formulated by some linear inequalities such that the safe docking corridor of spacecraft relative position could be described easily, while the logarithm coordinate transformation is employed to ensure the bounded property of system outputs in the defined regions, then the state space of systems could be explicitly divided into the safe, dangerous and hysteresis subsets under the corresponding triggered constraints in human-in-the-loop control systems. In spite of kinematical couplings between the translational and rotational motions, the relative position and relative attitude controllers are still designed separately so that the number of triggered constraints is decreased to facilitate the machine controller design. Specifically, the anti-windup compensator-based adaptive nonlinear control method is proposed to design the sate-feedback-based machine controllers to tackle the actuator saturation and modeling uncertainties. The human control inputs are arbitrary without mathematical design, and human-machine control authority is transferred based on a smoothly output-constraints-related sharing function. Ultimately uniformly bounded convergence of system states is analyzed based on the Lyapunov stability theory, and simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed control approach."

    "abstract": "Photoplethysmography is a widely used noninvasive technique for cardiovascular assessment. Recent advancements in wearable technology have enabled continuous photoplethysmogram (PPG) monitoring, yet measurement accuracy remains highly dependent on various conditions, including the measurement site, light wavelength, and physical activity state. While previous studies have investigated these factors independently and mostly through linear analysis, a comprehensive analysis integrating nonlinear dynamics properties investigation to assess their effects has been lacking. This study employs nonlinear analysis to systematically evaluate PPG signal characteristics under different measurement conditions, including two measurement locations at the finger, green, red, and near-infrared wavelengths, and three motion status levels. Specifically, phase space reconstruction and the largest Lyapunov exponent, recurrence plot, and recurrence quantification analysis were applied to analyze signal dynamics. Clustering analysis was further conducted to classify signals based on motion conditions. The results indicate that the distal phalanx is the most suitable measurement site for PPG data, and green light provides the most stable signal for distinguishing between different motion states. These findings contribute to optimizing PPG measurement protocols for improved accuracy and reliability in wearable health monitoring applications."

    "abstract": "Accurate classification of rare and undesirable events is crucial to maximizing the safety and efficiency of the oil and gas industry. While deep learning techniques have shown promising results in this domain, they often struggle when training data is scarce, a common issue with rare events. Domain ontologies can formally represent domain knowledge about these events. In this work, we hypothesize that it is possible to use domain knowledge represented in ontologies to improve the performance of neural networks when data is limited. Based on that, we propose a novel method by integrating domain knowledge from an ontology with deep learning through a hybrid loss function. Our hybrid loss function combines crossentropy with cosine distance between the ontological embeddings of the predicted and true classes to enforce semantic accuracy. Experiments conducted on the 3W Dataset, which includes nine rare anomalous events, demonstrate that our approach can improve classification accuracy compared to standard methods on smaller datasets."

    "abstract": "Access to high-quality data remains a critical bottleneck in the development of artificial intelligence. One promising solution is the use of synthetic tabular data to augment existing datasets. However, generating and evaluating such data is challenging, given the existence of mixed data types, complex distributions, and intricate feature interdependencies. This paper introduces the Tabular Synthetic Data Score (TSDS), a robust, bounded, and interpretable framework for evaluating synthetic tabular data across three core components: fidelity (distributional similarity), association (preservation of feature relationships), and authenticity (novelty of synthetic samples). TSDS is datatype agnostic, using tailored methods for both categorical and continuous variables. Alongside a comprehensive overall score, it also enables component-wise analysis, providing detailed insights into the specific strengths and weaknesses of synthetic datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that TSDS effectively identifies common quality issues in state-of-the-art generative models, such as mode collapse, noise contamination, and memorization, while offering more discriminative and reliable diagnostics than existing evaluation frameworks. Moreover, the metric proves to be a practical tool for assessing the quality of synthetic data produced by commonly used generative models in applied settings."

This work is particularly valuable for researchers in renewable energy forecasting, atmospheric science, and computer vision, as well as for applications in grid management and climate monitoring. In the context of photovoltaics, accurate cloud type classification supports nowcasting in microgrids, enabling more reliable shortterm predictions of solar power generation from photovoltaic plants. The images are pre-processed to remove the geometrical distortion introduced by the fisheye lenses of the cameras and then fed to an EfficientNet-based model; two possible ways of combining the two types of images are explored, combining the feature vectors at two different steps. The performances of the three approaches are then compared. The results show that the models trained on visible plus infrared images, on average, are performing better than those trained on the infrared-only and visible-only ones."

Electromagnetic coupling with live circuits results in induced voltages and currents on the de-energized cables. These may present a significant safety hazard to maintenance personnel if not properly identified and mitigated. In this paper we model a double circuit cable tunnel using ATP-EMTP to compute the induced voltages and currents in a de-energised circuit due to steady state operation of the adjacent live circuit. The cable length is 18 km, jointed at approximately 1km intervals. The simulations are performed considering the different load and fault conditions, including nominal load, 10% imbalance load, 3-phase faults, single-phase faults and phase-phase faults. Two different earthing scenarios of the de-energised cable circuit are considered. Results show that induced voltages and currents in the de-energized circuit depend greatly on the earthing configuration of cable sheaths and conductors. The designed model of the tunnel cable system and the study can be used as a reference document to identify the safe working methods for maintenance on tunnel power cables."

    "abstract": "Underwater Wireless Optical Communication (UWOC) systems are increasingly recognized for their potential to provide high-bandwidth data transfer in marine environments. However, the efficiency and reliability of these systems are significantly influenced by the attenuation of optical signals as they propagate through seawater. Experiment presents a comparative analysis for underwater optical signals, examining a line-of-sight (LoS) scenario across different sea waters using advanced numerical simulations. The focus is on understanding how environmental factors, such as salinity, temperature, turbidity, and biological content, affect the attenuation of optical signals at varying wavelengths in coastal, open ocean, and estuarine waters. Experiment is conducted to model light propagation in both clear and turbid waters, assessing the impact of scattering and absorption mechanisms in LoS conditions. Fulvic acid, like other dissolved organic materials, plays a significant role in the attenuation of light in water, particularly in the ultraviolet (UV) and blue light regions of the spectrum. The attenuation of light due to fulvic acid and other Dissolved Organic Matter is driven by both absorption and scattering mechanisms. The process is carried out by keeping optical Wireless channel length at 100 meters and keeping Differential Phase Shift Keying (DPSK) modulation on the transmitter side for better efficiency and bit error rate. Results reveal significant differences in attenuation behavior, with line-of-sight conditions showing greater sensitivity to scattering from suspended particles and dissolved organic matter, while line-of-sight transmission is more influenced by absorption due to water composition. Results show bit error rate for pure sea water is <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$7.17 \\times 10^{-4}$</tex>, clear ocean water <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$7.76 \\times 10^{-4}$</tex>, coastal water <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$7.84 \\times 10^{-4}$</tex>, turbid harbor water-I <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$8.95 \\times 10^{-4}$</tex>, turbid harbor water-II <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$9.73 \\times 10^{-4}$</tex>.

This System provides valuable insights into the challenges and potential of UWOC in real-world underwater environments, highlighting the importance of considering LoS conditions for optimizing system design and performance in varying marine settings.

This study explores the integration of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology as a novel approach to enhance resource management in 5G/B5G networks. The motivation behind this research lies in overcoming persistent challenges such as spectrum congestion, high latency, and inefficient load balancing, which impede the performance of traditional resource allocation methods. To achieve this, RFID tags were embedded in critical network components, including user devices, base stations, and Internet of Things (IoT) nodes, enabling the collection of real-time data on device status, location, and resource utilization. RFID readers strategically placed across the network continuously captured this data, which was processed by a centralized controller using a custom-designed optimization algorithm. This algorithm dynamically managed key network resources, including spectrum allocation, load balancing, and energy consumption, ensuring efficient operation under varying network conditions. Simulations were conducted to evaluate the performance of the RFID-based model against traditional 4G dynamic resource allocation techniques. The results demonstrated substantial improvements in key performance metrics. The proposed system achieved a 25 % increase in spectrum utilization, a 30 % reduction in average latency, a 15 % boost in network throughput, and a 20 % decrease in overall energy consumption. These gains highlight the effectiveness of the RFID-based optimization model in meeting the stringent performance requirements of 5 G networks, particularly in high-density deployments. This study provides a scalable, cost-effective solution for optimizing resource management in 5G/B5G and lays the groundwork for future advancements in 6G networks. By leveraging real-time data and intelligent resource allocation, the proposed model addresses critical challenges in modern communication systems, ensuring enhanced network efficiency, reliability, and sustainability."

This study proposes a BERT-GRU framework that integrates the BERT pretrained model with a multi-scale convolutional and bidirectional gated recurrent network for antimicrobial peptide (AMP) identification. Experimental results demonstrate that BERT-GRU significantly outperforms existing models in AMP recognition, achieving leading performance across evaluation metrics including accuracy, F1-score, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), and Area Under the Curve (AUC).

    "abstract": "In the design of electromagnetic equipment such as transformers and sensors, magnetic air gap is a key factor affecting equipment efficiency, stability, thermal management, response speed, and electromagnetic compatibility. It has an important impact on magnetic flux distribution, energy loss, and overall equipment efficiency. In order to accurately analyze and optimize the impact of magnetic air gaps, it is usually necessary to establish an accurate magnetic air gap model. The partial element equivalent circuit (PEEC) method converts electromagnetic field problems into equivalent circuit models, avoiding discretization of the inactive domain (e.g., the air), especially suitable for scenarios with small air gap sizes. This article summarizes and compares three main methods for modeling magnetic air gaps. The first method discretizes the entire region and accurately captures the distribution of magnetic fields in complex geometric structures, which is a common practice in the finite element method (FEM). The second method uses the static magnetic volume integration method (VIM) for the thin air gap model [5]–[7], treating the air gap as a surface area with a given thickness, avoiding the integration difficulties of not gridding the air gap or gridding the air gap into a volume area. The third method, based on the unique boundary processing advantages of PEEC [8], converts the electromagnetic field of the air gap into an equivalent circuit form, simplifying the calculation process. Following a comprehensive comparison of the advantages, disadvantages, and applicability of the three methods, this article presents recommendations for selecting the most appropriate method for different application scenarios. These recommendations provide valuable theoretical and practical guidance for the engineering solution of magnetic air gap modeling problems."

More specialized LLMs, tailored to healthcare contexts, are an alternative solution, although their integration into resourceconstrained environments is often problematic due to their dimensions. In this work, we present MedESM, a lightweight 1B parameter medical LLM specifically fine-tuned for structured summarization of clinical notes across twelve clinically relevant categories. Within our knowledge, MedESM is the only model at the 1B parameter scale capable of performing this task. Trained on over 40,000 real and synthetic clinical notes from the MIMIC-IV-NOTE and Asclepius datasets, MedESM leverages targeted instruction-based summarization and careful prompt design to ensure stable performance on long and complex inputs.

While Projection to Latent Structures (PLS) remains a popular technique, it struggles to model complex non-linear relationships, especially in multivariate systems with high-dimensional correlation structures. This challenge is further compounded by simultaneous interactions across multiple scales, where local processing fails to capture crossgroup dependencies. Additionally, static feature weighting limits adaptability to contextual variations, as it ignores sample-specific relevance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method that enhances predictive performance through novel architectural innovations. Our architecture introduces an adaptive kernel-based attention mechanism that processes distinct feature groups separately before integration, enabling capture of local patterns while preserving global relationships. Experimental results show substantial improvements in performance metrics, compared to the state-of-the-art methods across diverse datasets."

    "abstract": "Resource optimization is a central objective in most branches of engineering. Reducing production costs and obtaining more efficient and smaller products that consume less material and are increasingly profitable. This work presents the development of a methodology that seeks the optimization of the elementary characteristics of the design of voltage transformers. Evolutionary algorithms are utilized within an integrated computational system, wherein the fitness function is employed in the theoretical model to ascertain ratio correction factor and angle errors. From the transformer equivalent circuit model and the BH magnetization curve, the ratio correction factor and phase angle errors are obtained. Subsequently, a genetic algorithm is developed in MATLAB, including elitism, diversity preservation and adaptive exploration, to optimize critical design variables such as effective core area, winding configuration, conductor gauges and number of turns. The objective function seeks to minimize the square of the ratio correction factor and angular displacement under no-load conditions. An error parallelogram visualization has been implemented to tack his evolution. The results show that the algorithm can identify optimized configurations that significantly reduce measurement errors, while ensuring manufacturability and adherence to standard design practices."

    "abstract": "This work investigates recent advances in implementing secure communication and computing services using quantum technologies, namely Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) systems. The approach is centered around the concept of oblivious keys, a fundamental cryptographic primitive where a transmitter knows a complete key while the receiver knows only half, with the transmitter being unaware of which half the receiver possesses [1]. We demonstrate that oblivious keys can be derived from the raw key material of standard discrete-variable (DV-QKD) and continuous-variable (CV-QKD) systems [2]–[5]. We also presented a hybrid framework that uses QKD with post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) algorithms, creating a dual-layer security model to bolster defenses against the threat of quantum computers. The practical applications of this framework are illustrated through its implementation in two critical domains: genomic medicine, where robust safeguards are essential for protecting sensitive genetic data, and the defense sector, which can profit from secure collaboration with minimal information disclosure."

This includes genotypic data, SNP analyses, and antibiotic resistance profiles. T he heritability of resistance traits and their genetic correlation was estimated by creating a Genetic Relatedness Matrix and using machine learning. The model had an accuracy of 85.68% and was trained on 2,200 samples. Nonresistant strains were predicted correctly 87% of the time, and resistant strains were predicted correctly 82% of the time.

The results indicate a high correlation between resistance to both drugs, which suggests common genetic factors. Fifteen highfrequency k -mers were identified w ithin t he r poB a nd katG genes, which are known to be associated with Rifampicin and Isoniazid resistance, respectively. Potential errors in sequencing and sample size limitations may impact these estimates. Despite these challenges, this research highlights the nature of antibiotic resistance, reinforcing the importance of genomic surveillance in handling multidrug-resistant TB. Understanding these genetic relationships can aid in early detection and predictive modeling, which would help in the creation of more effective treatment strategies."

Motivated by this interest, we investigate hybrid problems that combine constraints from both aspects. In this context, we consider two approaches: one purely qualitative and one explicitly representing membership. We propose SAT-based encodings for solving these problems. First we encode qualitative constraints on relations between sets and their cardinalities. Afterwards, we deal with richer constraints on set elements and with numerical constraints on both cardinalities and integer variables, assuming a fixed domain. In this setting, we identify a domain size bound for the version with explicit membership, beyond which increasing the domain cannot affect satisfiability. We evaluate the proposed encodings on real-world B language specifications. The proposed approaches allow the validation of proofs not yet decided by several existing approaches, and so could be used in addition to the others in order to automate the validation of even more proofs."

Secondary data came from scientific databases and relevant statistical portals. The results show that employees prefer practical and interactive forms of training, such as simulations, workshops, and penetration tests, while traditional methods, such as documents and conferences, are seen as less effective. Based on the findings, recommendations were formulated for an effective setting of organizational learning and development that combines practical experience with a motivating and entertaining approach.

Evaluated on WESAD and PAMAP2 datasets, the framework achieves 92.1% accuracy on unseen classessurpassing supervised baselines-while maintaining low-latency inference suitable for embedded deployment. The results demonstrate strong generalization, semantic interpretability, and computational efficiency, highlighting the framework’s potential for scalable, real-time health monitoring. Limitations related to manual prototype definition and signal variability are discussed, with future directions including automatic attribute generation and continual adaptation."

    "abstract": "5G slicing technology enables the creation of multiple virtualized, isolated networks (slices) over a shared physical infrastructure, extending across the entire 5G network, from the RAN (Radio Access Network) to DU/CU (Distributed Unit/Centralized Unit). It supports three main slice types: Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC), and Massive Machine Type Communications (mMTC). Each slice has specific resource allocations and Quality of Service (QoS) characteristics, such as resource type, priority level, packet delay budget, packet error rate, and Quality Class Identifier (QCI). Deploying custom network slices in Open RAN allows for dynamic RAN resource adjustment to meet the demands of different slices. This Open RAN architecture enables more flexibility and fine-grained control, which can be challenging for traditional ISPs to achieve. Multimedia applications on mobile devices consume significant network resources, often utilizing the eMBB slice in 5G, which is designed for high data rates and enhanced connectivity. eMBB supports scenarios like 4K/8K Ultra HD video streaming, Virtual Reality (VR), and Augmented Reality (AR). However, the similarity among these application traffic patterns makes fine-grained traffic monitoring and management challenging. To address this issue, this paper proposes using machine learning algorithms to analyze traffic characteristics and enable accurate, fine-grained classification of video network traffic."

An optical recirculating frequency shift loop (OFSL) is utilized to expand the spectral bandwidth of the input signal transmitted to the device under test (DUT). Coherent mixing process of the DUT's response signal with the incident signal enables the accurate extraction of the DUT's frequency response. Subsequently, the location information of defects, which usually manifested as impedance discontinuity within the DUT, can be extracted from this frequency response under inverse Fourier transform. Simulations of electronic and photonic systems are used to analyze the performance of the proposed concept. The simulation results are in well agreement with the Advanced Design system (ADS) simulation, demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed system in determining PCB defects."

This approach significantly improves the generation of valid and realistic molecules, reducing the frequency of structural artifacts and enhancing optimization performance.

Current approaches suffer from protocol isolation, limited contextual understanding, and inherent time delays that enable successful cyberattacks. This paper presents a revolutionary multi-dimensional cybersecurity framework that integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with cross-protocol behavioral analysis to model complex relationships between network entities. Our approach combines semi-supervised graph-based learning with real-time feature extraction across HTTP, DNS, SMTP, and network flow protocols, enabling high-accuracy detection with minimal labeled data requirements. Experimental evaluation demonstrates unprecedented 98.2% detection accuracy with 96.8% F1-score while maintaining sub-$\\mathbf{5 0 m s}$ response latency at $\\mathbf{5 0, 0 0 0}$ assessments per second. Most significantly, we achieve proactive threat detection capability, identifying malicious IPs an average of 18.7 hours before conventional blocklist appearance. This early warning capability transforms cyber defense from reactive to anticipatory, providing critical response time for implementing protective measures and representing a paradigm shift toward intelligent, anticipatory cybersecurity."

This research proposes a decentralized approach based on Agent Modeling and an auction-based mechanism to solve the PDPTW. In this model, each courier independently determines its own trajectory, and can keep it as a private information. The main objective is to minimize the number of vehicles used, while each vehicle seeks to reduce its travel distance and serve as many requests as possible. Finally, the results of this approach are compared with those presented in the existing literature, with empirical evidence of the impact of flexibility on fleet size and travel distance compared to centralized methods."

This paper presents an energy-aware control framework that combines active responses with passive compliance for safety-critical robotic manipulation. Specifically, Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are employed for active collision avoidance with detected obstacles, which are then integrated with fallback safety actions to resolve potential violation of CBF constraints. Complementing this active safety paradigm, a passive safety paradigm is implemented to mitigate post-collision impacts by monitoring energy variance and limiting power exchanges. Furthermore, an energy tank is incorporated to enforce passivity of the robot, which is crucial to address potential instability issues in variable impedance control. To make the tank adaptive to varying energy requirements arising from dynamic environments and unpredictable events, we propose a novel, task-agnostic tank recharging condition without compromising the system's passivity guarantee. The effectiveness of the proposed control framework is validated through experiments on a KUKA iiwa 14 robot."

This paper explores a Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) assisted integrated wireless sensing and power transfer (IWSPT) system in traffic scenarios with channel estimation errors and obstacles. Specifically, a transmitter deployed within transportation infrastructure optimizes the beamforming vector and RIS phase shifts cooperatively. The objective is to maximize the energy received by multiple energy harvesting devices (EHDs) under the constraint of beampattern thresholds for sensing in multiple directions. The coupled optimization variables in the proposed problem yield a non-convex result, so we propose a semi-infinite relaxation-based method for solving this optimization problem. We then introduce a low-complexity optimization algorithm to address the high computational complexity of the semi-infinite relaxation approach. The proposed algorithm significantly reduces the computational burden by leveraging Taylor expansion and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. Simulation results validate the effectiveness and robustness of the algorithm, highlighting its practical applicability in intelligent transportation systems."

    "abstract": "Recent research has shown that the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) is an effective way to manage traffic flow and mitigate congestion, which regulates bidirectional transfer flows at regional boundaries via perimeter control. In practice, perimeter control may fail to achieve desired control targets due to adverse conditions such as inclement weather or accidents, which may result in loss of actuator effectiveness faults. To address this challenge, this paper proposes two adaptive fault-tolerant perimeter control schemes to handle both time-invariant and time-varying actuator faults. To cope with time-invariant actuator faults, a data-driven fault-tolerant perimeter control approach is presented, which employs adaptive dynamic programming to approximate the solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. For dealing with time-varying faults, an adaptive fault-tolerant perimeter controller is designed by linearizing the MFD function and ensuring tracking of a given reference model. Theoretical analysis proves that the tracking error converges to zero asymptotically. Finally, simulation studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes in improving traffic management under actuator fault conditions."

    "abstract": "The increasing integration of converters brings instability challenges to DC power electronic systems (PESs). Instability detection based on data-driven analysis provides a promising noninvasive solution for “black-box” DC PESs, enabling reliable indirectly from DC bus voltage signals without requiring internal system information. However, data-driven instability detection approaches still face two major challenges: limited adaptability to oscillation frequency variations and the scarcity of labeled instability data. To solve these challenges, a contrastive learning with deep embedded clustering framework (CoDeepCL)-based instability detection approach is proposed for DC PESs by this paper. Specifically, CoDeepCL employs temporal-noise augmented contrastive learning with a convolutional neural network with long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) to capture oscillations’ common characteristic and learn discriminative difference between oscillation and non-oscillation features, enabling oscillation-adaptive function. In addition, intrinsic unstable-voltage feature guided contrastive learning with deep embedded clustering is integrated to achieve more accurate label-free instability detection. As a result, the proposed CoDeepCL can detect instability reliably even under varying oscillation conditions without requiring any labeled data. Experiments verified the proposed approach achieves accurately instability detection across diverse working conditions in DC PES."

In addition, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) is considered to estimate the rotor flux and load torque, improving the robustness of the system and decreasing complexity by avoiding multiple estimators. The DM-based DSPC technique is validated by simulation and experimental results under different operating conditions. This article also demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed technique by establishing a comparison with a conventional DSPC technique that uses WFs and the same EKF observer. Our results confirm that the DM-based DSPC scheme improves the control performance and robustness of the system, being a promising alternative for high-performance drive applications."

This article proposes a modified multimode offboard charging system that supports charging for micromobility vehicles (E-scooters and E-rickshaws) and wireless passenger EVs by reusing existing offboard converter hardware originally developed for wireless charging at the domestic level. The architecture utilizes a shared offboard front-end converter and high frequency inverter as a common power interface for both charging channels, enabling compact design and high-power density. The architecture supports multiple modes such as grid to vehicle (G2V), vehicle to grid (V2G), vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), and simultaneous dual channel charging, enhancing the overall operational versatility. To mitigate electromagnetic interference (EMI) and enhance efficiency, soft switching of the converters is essential. Therefore, zero voltage switching (ZVS) conditions are formulated for all modes of operation, from full load to light load. Finally, a laboratory prototype for proposed system capable of 2.8 kW wireless and 0.8 kW conductive charging has been developed. Experimental results validate various operating modes, ensuring ZVS for all switches in every mode. Both channels achieve a maximum dc–dc efficiency of 94% at their respective full load conditions."

While recent methods have achieved promising results by enhancing cross-modal fusion between vision and language, a key challenge remains: significant variation in object scales within a single RS image. Large-scale objects often dominate the representation space, leading to smaller ones being underrepresented or overlooked. To better understand and validate this issue, we analyze typical failure cases and then collect a challenging evaluation set, RSVG-MS, which specifically reflects multi-scale discrepancies. Motivated by these insights, we propose ASF-UE, an Adaptive Scale Fusion framework guided by Uncertainty Estimation. ASF-UE introduces a Scale-Sensitive Attention (SSA) module to extract scale-aware visual features across encoder layers under textual guidance. Additionally, a lightweight T-block is designed for spatial alignment, and a spatial uncertainty estimation (SUE) mechanism is integrated to adaptively score and fuse multi-scale features. Extensive experiments on two standard benchmarks, OPT-RSVG and DIOR-RSVG, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. More importantly, ASF-UE achieves significant improvements on the challenging RSVG-MS dataset, highlighting its strength in handling scale variation in remote sensing visual grounding."

The analysis covers two automotive use cases—a Battery Management System and a Wiper Controller—evaluated across safety, maintainability, and traceability metrics. Results demonstrate that standards-compliant manual coding achieved 92.4% ASIL-B coverage with only 3 MISRA violations and 63.6% smaller memory footprint (28.7KB vs 78.9KB) compared to model-based approaches, while maintaining competitive fault detection rates (89.2% vs 95.8%).

SVE-AASR was evaluated in several naturalistic movement scenarios, including walking, running, and jumping, where it consistently outperformed conventional Adaptive Artifact Subspace Reconstruction (AASR). Notably, during high-intensity movements, SVE-AASR achieved statistically significant improvements (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{p}&lt;0.05$</tex>) in artifact suppression while preserving critical neural components. Additionally, benchmark dataset tests demonstrated superior noise removal and signal retention, further validating its robustness for real-world applications. By enhancing EEG signal quality in dynamic environments, SVE-AASR expands the applicability of mobile EEG-based neurotechnologies, enabling more reliable BCI performance in wearable systems, mobile brain/body imaging (MoBI), neurorehabilitation, and real-time cognitive monitoring."

However, practically achieved spatial and temporal end-user quality of service and experience from this 5G network has not been studied. This paper presents a spatiotemporal and user-centric assessment of quality of service and quality of experience for 5G enhanced mobile broadband service in Addis Ababa using objective and subjective methods. Measurement tools including a crowdsourcing mobile application (Ookla SpeedTest), a network management system (Huawei iMaster performance reporting system), and a drive test tool (probe handset unit) were applied alongside subjective surveys. The results reveal that, despite the significant disparity in its coverage, Addis Ababa’s 5G network performs above global and ITU IMT-2020 benchmarks for both download and upload throughput, with notable variances based on device type and spatiotemporal factors.

    "abstract": "Optical switching offers significant potential for scalable and energy-efficient data center networks (DCNs) by enabling dynamic reconfiguration of high-bandwidth paths. However, fast and reliable optical link reconfiguration is fundamentally limited by synchronization delays introduced at both the physical layers and data link layers. Specifically, link switching disrupts clock and data recovery (CDR), equalization, and Physical Coding Sublayer (PCS) block synchronization at the receiver, while also delaying data link layer reinitialization due to prolonged uncertainty in link status. Excessive link recovery latency leads to packet loss, increased data packet transmission time, and degraded network utilization, especially under fine-grained switching intervals in DCNs. To decrease the link recovery time in optical-switched DCNs, we propose a co-optimized optical link recovery framework that integrates transmitter clock dynamic adjustment, protection sequence insertion, and a lightweight Ethernet-optical packet adapter. These mechanisms collectively reduce the uncertainty of link recovery time during switching, and accelerate fast protocol locking at the receiver. We implement the full system on FPGA hardware with a SOA-based optical switch and experimentally demonstrate nanosecond link recovery under aggressive switching conditions. The proposed mechanism reduces the optical link recovery time from 2.736 μs to 440.32 ns and maintains a packet loss rate as low as 4.24E-10 with a time-slot length of 256 μs, whereas conventional designs require more than 1 ms to reach comparable performance. This enables low-error operation under microsecond-scale switching intervals, facilitating dynamic and low-latency optical interconnects in practical data center environments."

    "abstract": "Collaborating in a purposive group, whether face-to-face or virtually, involves continuously expressing emotions and interpreting those of other group members. As such, understanding group affect is essential to comprehending how groups interact and succeed in collaborative efforts. In this study, we move beyond individual-level affect and investigate group-level affect—a collective phenomenon that reflects the shared mood or emotions among group members at a particular moment. As the first in the literature, we gather annotations for group-level affective expressions in purposive group interactions using a fine-grained temporal approach (15 second windows) that also captures the inherent dynamics of this collective construct. To this end, we extensively train annotators and develop an annotation procedure specifically tuned to capture the entire scope of the group interaction from one interaction moment to the next. In addition, we model the ebb and flow of group affect by accounting for the underlying convergence (driven by emotional contagion) and divergence (resulting from emotional reactivity) of affective expressions among group members. To capture these interpersonal dynamics, we employ two approaches: (i) extracting synchrony-based handcrafted features from both audio and visual modalities, and (ii) introducing a novel, data-driven graph neural network to model interpersonal dynamics among group members. Our results highlight the advantages of the graph network over the handcrafted features in modeling group affect, while also emphasizing the importance of temporal modeling and incorporating multimodal cues. Additionally, our analysis of affective convergence and divergence reveals that groups tend to diverge in their social signals during neutral collective affect, while exhibiting convergence during more emotionally intense moments. These insights are drawn from comparative results across both modeling techniques."

To address this practical problem, this article constructs a novel architecture and proposes a real-time algorithm for coordinated decision making for train timetable rescheduling and trajectory control (CDM-TTRTC). The simulation and application experiments show that compared to the noncoordinated method using manual experience, the proposed CDM-TTRTC algorithm can reduce the total train delay by 17.18% and total energy consumption by 5.82%. In addition, it can generate a train timetable and multitrain trajectory within 3.49 s, providing dispatchers and drivers with more reasonable and efficient decision support."

We derive analytical expressions for the outage probabilities experienced by the TUs considering co-channel interference (CCI), residual hardware impairments (RHI) at the transceivers and imperfect successive interference cancellation conditions. To provide more insights on the outage performance, we obtain expressions for the asymptotic outage probabilities of the TUs in the high transmit power region. Next, we derive analytical expressions for the optimal power allocation factors (OPAFs) at both the satellite and the selected terrestrial relay that independently minimize the system outage probability. Further, we determine the jointly optimal power allocation factors (JOPAFs) that minimize the system outage probability. We also evaluate the sensitivity of the OPAFs against various system related parameters. We provide extensive analytical and simulations results to show that the proposed OPAFs significantly improve the system throughput and reduce both the system outage probability as well as the outage probabilities experienced by the TUs compared to equal/random power allocation schemes."

The goal of these enhancements is to increase embedded devices' speed and performance, which is essential for satisfying soft real-time requirements. This study assesses how well these improvements work with the Embedded Linux operating system. Because embedded systems are required to function under tight or moderate real-time constraints, the operating systems on embedded devices must minimize latency. Some applications require the smooth execution of multiple concurrent processes at the same time. This objective may be mostly accomplished effectively by making sure that memory management is done well."

    "abstract": "In today's digital era, interpreting human emotions from online content has become vital in sectors like marketing, customer support, healthcare, and social media analytics. This paper presents a robust multimodal sentiment analysis framework that combines textual and visual data to gain deeper emotional understanding. The approach employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to grasp contextual and sequential patterns in text, while EfficientNet, a cutting-edge convolutional neural network, is used to extract high-level features from images, including facial expressions and relevant visual cues. By merging the outputs from both modalities, the model accurately classifies emotions into five categories: very positive, positive, neutral, negative, and very negative. This dual-modality setup addresses the shortcomings of single-source sentiment analysis-such as the vagueness in text or the lack of depth in standalone images. Experimental results reveal that this integrated model delivers significantly higher accuracy and precision compared to traditional unimodal systems. Designed with real-time applications in mind, the system is well-suited for scenarios like monitoring social media trends, analyzing customer opinions, and improving virtual assistant interactions. The model's performance has been thoroughly validated using standard multimodal datasets, ensuring its adaptability and reliability. Ultimately, this research highlights the effectiveness of deep learning-based multimodal systems in decoding complex human emotions across a wide range of real-world applications."

Although current rPPG methods have achieved remarkable performance through extensive data training, they often ignore the transmission cost and privacy concerns of rPPG data. Federated learning (FL) pro vides a promising solution to these issues. However, effective federated training remains challenging due to the cross-domain heterogeneity that arises when using multi source rPPG data. To address these challenges, we characterize the heterogeneity of multi-source rPPG data from both the input and output domain perspectives. Motivated by this analysis, we introduce pseudo-labeling techniques and propose a novel FL framework, FedGRC. Specifically, we incorporate automatic gradient regularization calibration to mitigate the impact of input domain discrepancies on model performance. Furthermore, we leverage pseudo labels generated by handcrafted rPPG methods to align the output domain and reduce label inconsistencies across datasets. Our approach is validated across six publicly available datasets, demonstrating significant advantages over other approaches and effectively addressing the challenges of privacy protection and heterogeneity of multisource data."

    "abstract": "ML now works with an unmatched range of computational scales, from microcontrollers with models that are only a few kilobytes big to cloud infrastructures with Large Language Models (LLMs) that have trillions of parameters. These extremes show how AI has made progress in different ways: Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) is great for green apps that don’t have a lot of resources because it focuses on real-time, ultra-low-power inference on edge devices. LLMs, on the other hand, are the best at understanding, reasoning, and generating language, but they often use a lot of energy and hurt the environment. This research provides a comprehensive analysis of TinyML and LLMs, highlighting their importance in the context of green and sustainable technology. We offer a systematic taxonomy that evaluates both paradigms based on critical factors such as model size, latency, energy consumption, memory footprint, training methodologies, privacy considerations, and deployment architecture. There are talks about how to use TinyML in smart agriculture, IoT, and wearable health monitoring, and how to use LLMs in cloud-based text generation, code synthesis, and decision support. We carefully consider the pros and cons of centralization and decentralization, scalability and sustainability, and performance and efficiency. Finally, we talk about what might happen in the future, like quantized TinyLLMs, federated learning for privacy-aware sustainability, and hybrid edge-cloud systems where TinyML acts as a green intelligence filter for LLM backends. The purpose of this poll is to get people to share their ideas on how to make AI systems that are both helpful and good for the environment."

While studies have examined the intersection of artificial intelligence and different domains, there is limited research focusing on understanding trends of AI for digital accessibility. This study aims to examine and identify domain areas, themes, and the interconnectivity of AI in accessibility by analyzing 1,479 papers. Using a structured topic modeling approach, the study analyzes emerging themes and topics. A network analysis method with the Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm was also used to understand the interaction and interconnectedness of these topics. The findings revealed 23 relevant topics and their corresponding keywords in the field of AI for digital accessibility, organized into four network communities and the connections between them. The findings highlight an imbalance in research priorities, indicating that current work heavily addresses sensory disabilities (particularly visual impairment), while critical areas such as AI for cognitive disabilities and the ethical challenges of AI in accessibility receive considerably less attention. The human-centered topic cluster were shown to be central to the research network."

    "abstract": "The field of hadronic physics is poised for significant advancements, driven by upcoming experimental programs at Jefferson Lab's 12 GeV facility and the future Electron-Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory. These experiments will produce vast amounts of data, necessitating sophisticated analytical methods to bridge experimental observations and the underlying theoretical frameworks of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). This paper introduces a generative AI-based surrogate modeling framework to address the computational and analytical challenges of traditional theory-driven approaches in event-level analysis. Specifically, we evaluate and compare the effectiveness of generative AI models, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs), as surrogates for event generation. By replacing complex quantum correlation function (QCF) models with generative AI-based surrogates, our proposed framework enables efficient generation of synthetic events directly from QCF parameters. Moreover, this approach facilitates simulation-based parameter inference by learning the mappings between QCF parameters and observables, bypassing the gradient calculation challenges when directly incorporating the QCF model into solving the QCD inverse problems. Through a proof-of-concept QCF study, we demonstrate the capability of generative AI-based surrogates as an important tool to accurately replicate theoretical QCF models, which can be easily incorporated into simulation-based inference to reconstruct QCF parameters from observables."

    "abstract": "We investigated the adaptation and performance of Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) with Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures for self-supervised representation learning on one-dimensional (1D) ultrasound signals. Although MAEs have demonstrated significant success in computer vision and other domains, their use for 1D signal analysis, especially for raw ultrasound data, remains largely unexplored. Ultrasound signals are vital in industrial applications such as nondestructive testing (NDT) and structural health monitoring (SHM), where labeled data are often scarce and signal processing is highly task-specific. We propose an approach that leverages MAE to pre-train on unlabeled synthetic ultrasound signals, enabling the model to learn robust representations that enhance performance in downstream tasks, such as time-of-flight (ToF) classification. This study systematically investigated the impact of model size, patch size, and masking ratio on pre-training efficiency and downstream accuracy. Our results show that pre-trained models significantly outperform models trained from scratch and strong convolutional neural network (CNN) baselines optimized for the downstream task. Additionally, pre-training on synthetic data demonstrates superior transferability to real-world measured signals compared with training solely on limited real datasets. This study underscores the potential of MAEs for advancing ultrasound signal analysis through scalable, self-supervised learning."

    "abstract": "Expensive optimization problems (EOPs) present significant challenges for traditional evolutionary optimization due to their limited evaluation calls. Although surrogate-assisted search (SAS) has become a popular paradigm for addressing EOPs, it still suffers from the cold-start issue. In response to this challenge, knowledge transfer has been gaining popularity for its ability to leverage search experience from potentially related instances, ultimately facilitating head-start optimization for more efficient decision-making. However, the curse of negative transfer persists when applying knowledge transfer to EOPs, primarily due to the inherent limitations of existing methods in assessing knowledge transferability. On the one hand, a priori transferability assessment criteria are intrinsically inaccurate due to their imprecise understandings. On the other hand, a posteriori methods often necessitate sufficient observations to make correct inferences, rendering them inefficient when applied to EOPs. Considering the above, this paper introduces a Bayesian competitive knowledge transfer (BCKT) method developed to improve multi-task SAS (MSAS) when addressing multiple EOPs simultaneously. Specifically, the transferability of knowledge is estimated from a Bayesian perspective that accommodates both prior beliefs and empirical evidence, enabling accurate competition between inner-task and inter-task solutions, ultimately leading to the adaptive use of promising solutions while effectively suppressing inferior ones. The effectiveness of our method in boosting various SAS algorithms for both multi-task and many-task problems is empirically validated, complemented by comparative studies that demonstrate its superiority over peer algorithms and its applicability to real-world scenarios.

    "abstract": "Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are essential for various consumer Internet of Things (IoT) applications such as Industry 4.0, intelligent transportation systems, and home automation. In these consumer IoT systems, different types of sensors are embedded within the IoT devices, which form a WSN for data collection. Sensor nodes in consumer-focused smart environments are vulnerable to faults due to harsh conditions such as extreme temperatures, high humidity, corrosion, and intense radiation. Faulty nodes reduce the functionality and lifetime of the consumer IoT network. It also significantly increases data routing delays. Existing state-of-the-art fault detection approaches consume a lot of energy to identify faulty sensor nodes within the network. This leads to premature network failure. Existing approaches also suffer from low detection accuracy and high data routing delay due to the unavailability of proper data routing paths. To address these issues, this paper proposes an intelligent fault detection and data collection mechanism for consumer IoT-enabled WSNs. It effectively diagnoses faulty nodes within the network and improves the overall network performance. A Mobile Sink (MS)-based optimal data collection scheme is proposed to collect data in the faulty network. It reduces data routing delay and prevents premature death of the network. Furthermore, an MS-based hard fault detection mechanism is proposed to reduce energy consumption and improve the network lifetime. A hyper-parameter tuning-based soft fault detection mechanism is also proposed to identify software faults within the deployed sensor nodes. It significantly increases the Fault Detection Accuracy (FDA). Extensive simulations and testbed results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. The simulation and testbed results are evaluated against state-of-the-art algorithms based on True Positive Rate (TPR), Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), F1-Score, FDA, network lifetime, data collection delay, and data collection rate."

    "abstract": "CubeSat, a class of nanosatellites, have gained considerable interest as cost-effective alternatives to traditional satellites for space missions. Their affordability and the ability to utilize commercially available components make them attractive for various applications. CubeSat can establish communication links both in orbit and with ground stations for missions targeting destinations such as the Moon, Mars, asteroids, and other planetary bodies, where high data rates are essential. Achieving these high data rates requires antennas with high gain to counteract significant free-space path loss. However, the compact size and weight constraints of CubeSat pose challenges in designing antennas that meet mission requirements. This paper presents a single-layer, high-gain, circularly polarized (CP) foldable reflectarray (FRA) designed specifically for 3U CubeSat applications. The reflectarray comprises 400 unit cells, each featuring copper circular patches with four quasi-spiral phase delay lines printed on a 3.15 mm Rogers RT5880 substrate. The proposed unit cell offers low loss, complete 360° phase coverage, and supports both right-hand and left-hand circular polarization, ensuring the entire FRA is circularly polarized. The proposed FRA consists of three panels, each measuring <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$30 \\text{cm} \\times 10 \\text{cm}$</tex>, with a circularly polarized helical antenna serving as the feed. The FRA is designed and simulated using CST Studio Suite to operate at 10 GHz. The simulation results demonstrate a peak gain of 27.71 dBic, along with <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$28.5 \\% 3-\\text{dB}$</tex> gain bandwidth and 30% axial ratio bandwidth. These performance characteristics significantly reduce polarization mismatch, enhancing the reliability and consistency of communication links crucial for CubeSat operations."

    "abstract": "Accurately forecasting the length of an employee's absence following workplace injuries remains a critical yet ongoing challenge. Such incidents place a significant strain on businesses through potential costs such as lost wages and productivity. Organizations may lack reliable tools to predict and prioritize the injury-related absences with the most lost workdays. This study leverages two machine learning models, CatBoost and a decision tree, to predict the number of days from injury to return-to-work date using a comprehensive dataset of workers' compensation claims that consists of employee demographics and injury-related features, such as injury severity, nature, and cause. Instead of regression performance alone, we focus on the models' ability to prioritize cases at risk of extended injury leave. We evaluate this using a rank-ordering framework to examine how well each model identifies cases with the longest absence durations. Our rank-based evaluation shows that both models are able to flag a substantial portion of high-risk cases. This paper proposes a novel predictive framework to support return-to-work planning and resource management. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to predict absence length after a workplace injury and assess regression model performance using ranking analysis in occupational health and safety."

    "abstract": "Identity management in 4G networks is traditionally based on centralized architectures, which are vulnerable to fraud, identity theft, and privacy breaches. Centralization also limits users’ ability to control their personal data. This paper explores an alternative approach by integrating blockchain technology and the Self-Sovereign Identity model to enable decentralized and secure identity management within a 4 G environment. The prototype network relies on srsRAN and ZeroMQ Virtual Radio, combined with a blockchain infrastructure built using Ganache and Truffle. Authentication is handled through a User Self-Sovereign Identity application, allowing each user to manage their credentials via smart contracts. An experimental platform was developed to evaluate the system’s feasibility and performance. Results show that this approach enhances security, promotes user autonomy, and improves network resilience against threats. By eliminating the need for a central authority, the solution ensures the integrity, traceability, and efficiency of authentication processes, while mitigating the risk of unauthorized access. This work contributes to rethinking digital identity management in mobile networks through the use of decentralized and reliable technologies."

    "abstract": "The synthesis of metamaterials using the inverse design approach has revolutionized the field of metamaterials. It allows for efficient exploration of the vast design space and has the potential to accelerate the development of metamaterials for various applications. Machine learning methodologies within the inverse design framework present a viable strategy for metamaterial synthesis. One option in the machine-learning realm involves modeling the relationship between metamaterial layouts and performance parameters as complex nonlinear functions, which can be well approximated with deep generative models. However, deep generative models require enormous computational resources, careful hyperparameter tuning, and extensive training episodes for optimal performance. In addition, the residual training errors inhibit specific metamaterial reconstructions. Relying on the vast amount of data within a specified design space, this study transforms metamaterial synthesis into a retrieval process using a recommender system that outperforms deep generative models without enormous computations, meticulous hyperparameter optimization, and prolonged training sessions. The recommendation system, which uses a modified item-based filtering algorithm, operates on the premise that the metamaterial whose performance parameters most accurately correspond to a given query serves as a reliable approximation. This approach paves the way for a faster and more efficient metamaterial synthesis. The validity of this idea is further substantiated by the significant enhancements in reconstruction quality seen in experiments conducted on the corpus of stealth metamaterial designs, demonstrating the recommender system's ability to capture intricate low-level details. Compared to deep generative models, the algorithm significantly reduces computational time due to the absence of training while maintaining superior reconstruction accuracy, as there are no residual training errors."

Our system uses Natural Language Processing (NLP), which includes cosine metrics to measure similarity and WordNet to expand synonyms, to increase the accuracy of this comparison. Our system additionally integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance comprehension of the content. Additionally, it does not ignore visual information; to guarantee that answers are graded fairly, diagrams are examined using YOLO-based object detection.Altogether, this smart approach speeds up grading, reduces bias, and gives students more meaningful feedback."

Combining routine biochemical panels with CBC presents a set of test-value pairs that varies from patient to patient, or, in common settings, a table with missing values. Here we formulate a tabular modeling problem as a set translation problem where the source set comprises pairs of GPT-like label column embedding and its corresponding value while the target set consists of the same type embeddings only. The proposed approach can effectively deal with missing values without implicitly estimating them and bridges the world of LLM with the tabular domain.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in analytical methodologies have greatly enhanced our understanding of metasurfaces, particularly in the visible and infrared regimes, through multipole-resonance-coupling-based design. However, in the terahertz (THz) and microwave regimes, metasurface design still relies heavily on trial-and- error approaches, emphasizing the need for systematic, physics-driven strategies. In this work, we employ multipole analysis to investigate the transmission and reflection properties of metasurfaces supporting dipole toroidal resonances. The proposed metasurface is based on a Tai-Chi-inspired unit cell geometry, designed to support toroidal dipole resonances while exhibiting polarization dependence due to its intrinsic chirality. The unit cells are modeled using copper, which behaves as a perfect electric conductor (PEC) in the microwave regime. By optimizing the unit cell's geometric parameters, we amplify the toroidal response, achieving enhanced control over the electromagnetic behavior of the metasurface. To validate our approach, we analyze a recently reported experimental structure, demonstrating excellent qualitative agreement with existing results. This qualitative agreement arises because substrate-associated boundary conditions cannot be fully captured in the multipole expansion method. To address this limitation, we incorporate an effective medium approach to account for substrate effects on the system's electromagnetic properties. Our methodology uniquely enables the decomposition of transmission and reflection spectra into individual multipole contributions, providing deep insights into the electromagnetic behavior of the metasurface. Specifically, we use a Cartesian multipole expansion to quantify the contributions of each electric toroidal moment and electric dipole moment to the spectra. This analysis identifies the role of each multipole in the observed resonances, offering a robust framework for tailoring metasurface properties. Additionally, we present calculations of linear dichroism and its decomposition into distinct multipole components, which are critical for developing polarization-dependent devices that control transmission and reflection properties. Finally, comparative calculations using volumetric and surface approaches highlight skin-depth effects in both the microwave and THz regimes, elucidating their impact on the observed electromagnetic features."

We validate the approach through multi-season simulations using real-world datasets from FAO, NASA POWER, and OpenET, evaluating performance across water savings, prediction accuracy, and irrigation efficiency. Results show that the proposed system reduces water use by over 20 % compared to traditional methods while maintaining yield potential and operating within the constraints of embedded hardware. This work demonstrates the feasibility of deploying interpretable, data-driven irrigation control at the field level, offering a scalable solution for sustainable agriculture."

    "abstract": "The agri-food sector is a cornerstone of the global economy, connecting agricultural production to food consumption through a complex system of processes and stakeholders. This sector encompasses every stage of the food journey, from cultivation and harvesting to processing, packaging, transportation, distribution, trade, purchase, preparation, consumption, and disposal. The agri-food sector involves every stage of the food supply chain. It is primarily composed of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which form the backbone of the industry. The environmental challenges posed by the agri-food sector extend beyond GHG emissions and climate change. The goal of this paper is to design a questionnaire that is focused to survey the opinions of SME managers related to the role of LCA tools to foster ecoinnovations in the agri-food sector and to investigate the opinions of managers of SMEs from five ES countries."

Analyzes have been performed for two different cases: non-noisy signal parameters estimation and noisy signal (for 25db signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) level) parameters estimation. Non-noisy results compared with Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFO) in the literature.

The antenna is a laminated planar waveguide consisting of two metal structures mounted on the top and bottom of a dielectric substrate with an array of metallic vias embedded in the substrate to emulate the vertical walls of a traditional waveguide. A dielectric slab identical to that of the horn and acting as a lens is used at the horn opening to increase the gain. Printed transitions are etched on that slab for matching purposes and to improve the antenna's bandwidth. Circular polarization is obtained by etching a dipole after the transition elements, whereby one arm of the dipole is on the top layer while the other is on the bottom layer. The simulated results are displayed as obtained. They show that the antenna is a multiband antenna with wideband and circular polarization characteristics. The antenna is of high gain and has a high degree of polarization purity. These characteristics make it a good candidate for the 6th generation of mobile communication systems (6 G)."

There is a pressing need for intelligent, adaptive solutions that ensure timely EV charging while minimising infrastructure costs and grid stress. To address this challenge, we propose to integrate Mobile Charging as a Service (MCaaS) with Machine Learning (ML). We develop asimulation environment modelling 50 EVs operating within an urban area, where GEECharge Mobile Charging Units (MCU) are dynamically dispatched to charge EVs with low-battery charge events. We use a Variational Quantum Neural Network (VQNN) and a LSTM to predict EVs likely to have low-battery charge events. Our VQNN model achieves an accuracy of 88%, outperforming the LSTM baseline at 84%. The VQNN demonstrates a superior performance in detecting critical low-battery charge events, achieving a recall of 50% compared to 0% for the LSTM. MCaaS successfully prevents 81.8% of potential vehicle strandings, with 0 actual strandings recorded on highways during the simulation. The integration of VQNN enhances the proactive nature of MCaaS, thus transforming reactive charging into preventive maintenance. MCaaS has the potential to supply EVs with charge wherever they are and help eliminate the cost of constructing an FCP that requires extensive electrical infrastructure and grid connection, enhancing the green transition and promoting sustainability."

    "abstract": "Segmenting targets with ambiguous features in medical images poses a persistent challenge for quantitative analysis. This is particularly true for stool segmentation in abdominal X-rays—vital for the Stool Volume Score (SVS) in constipation management—where conventional single-channel deep learning methods often struggle. This study investigates if incorporating expert-annotated intestinal gas masks as an explicit, additional input channel to a U-Net model enhances stool segmentation accuracy and SVS reliability. An ablation study compared a dual-channel U-Net (X-ray + gas mask) against an identical single-channel baseline (X-ray only), using the same architectures and training protocols. Performance was assessed using the Dice coefficient, Precision, Recall, and SVS analysis (Pearson correlation, Bland-Altman agreement). The dual-channel model showed an improved Dice coefficient (0.726 vs. 0.710) and Recall (0.706 vs. 0.675) compared to the single-channel baseline, while Precision was slightly higher for the baseline (0.748 vs. 0.747). Crucially, the enhanced segmentation by the dual-channel model yielded a stronger correlation between predicted and ground-truth SVS (Pearson r=0.852 vs. 0.818) and excellent SVS agreement (Bland-Altman bias: 0.01, limits of agreement: -0.06 to 0.07). Explicit gas mask guidance thus improves overall stool segmentation, primarily by achieving a more comprehensive capture of stool regions, which in turn enables more reliable SVS quantification. This dual-channel strategy offers a promising approach for objective fecal load assessment in clinical practice."

    "abstract": "A novel two-element MIMO antenna for vehicular communication operating at 5.9 GHz is proposed. The antenna is designed on a FR4 epoxy substrate, having a height of 1.6 mm and a dielectric permittivity of 4.4 using ANSYS Electronics Desktop 2024. The design process begins with a circular patch antenna fed by a quarter-wave transformer. Performance at the operating frequency is significantly enhanced by integrating overlapping circular patches. Each antenna element achieves resonance at 5.91 GHz with a reflection coefficient of 30.5 dB, providing a bandwidth of 682 MHz and a gain of 5.2 dB. To ensure effective MIMO performance, the inter-element distance is optimised to enhance isolation between the antennas. The resulting two-element MIMO antenna exhibits an isolation greater than -24.2 dB which minimises mutual coupling and ensures reliable performance in vehicular communication environments. This design approach, combining the circular patch geometry, and inter-element spacing, provides a compact, high-performance solution suitable for modern vehicular communication applications. The proposed MIMO antenna not only meets the bandwidth and isolation requirements but also achieves enhanced gain, making it a promising candidate for 5.9 GHz vehicular communication systems."

This design introduces a dynamic adjustment circuit that can monitor real-time changes in load current and dynamically adjust the internal parameters of LDO based on the current change rate, effectively improving the conversion rate and significantly enhancing the transient response performance of LDO. The experimental results show that compared with traditional LDO, the proposed LDO significantly reduces the overshoot and undershoot of the output voltage and shortens the recovery time when the load current suddenly changes. It achieves efficient voltage regulation while maintaining low power consumption, providing a feasible solution for high-performance power management systems."

With the rapid expansion of electric vehicle infrastructure, securing these IoTbased charging stations against cyber threats has become critical. Centralized Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) raise privacy concerns due to sensitive network and user data, making FL a promising alternative. However, current FL-based IDS evaluations overlook practical challenges such as system heterogeneity and non-IID data. To address these challenges, we conducted experiments to evaluate the performance of federated learning for anomaly detection in EV charging stations under system and data heterogeneity. We used FedAvg and FedAvgM, widely studied optimization approaches, to analyze their effectiveness in anomaly detection. Under IID settings, FedAvg achieves superior performance to centralized models using the same neural network. However, performance degrades with non-IID data and system heterogeneity. FedAvgM consistently outperforms FedAvg in heterogeneous settings, showing better convergence and higher anomaly detection accuracy. Our results demonstrate that FL can handle heterogeneity in IoT-based EVCS without significant performance loss, with FedAvgM as a promising solution for robust, privacy-preserving EVCS security."

Although commonly used attribution methods from explainable AI attempt to address this issue, they typically rely on associational rather than causal relationships. In this study, within the context of time series classification, we introduce a novel model-agnostic attribution method to assess the causal effect of concepts i.e., predefined segments within a time series, on classification outcomes. Our approach compares these causal attributions with closely related associational attributions, both theoretically and empirically. To estimate counterfactual outcomes, we use state-of-the-art diffusion models backed by state space models. We demonstrate the insights gained by our approach for a diverse set of qualitatively different time series classification tasks. Although causal and associational attributions might often share some similarities, in all cases they differ in important details, underscoring the risks associated with drawing causal conclusions from associational data alone. We believe that the proposed approach is also widely applicable in other domains to shed some light on the limits of associational attributions."

By using artificial intelligence methods, the system achieves optimal resource utilization because it finds all cases where several job assignments lead to unnecessary duplicate work. The scheduling system makes work plans that give employees equal work opportunities while following depot requirements. The schedule needs to keep driver shifts under 12 hours with resting breaks every 40 minutes plus restricts both driver and crew to only 8-hour time periods according to our regular schedule rules.

This work investigates the impacts of biaxial strain, point defects, and point doping in modifying the optoelectronic characteristics of 2D SiC for high-performance lighting applications. We examine the modification of the band structure of 2D SiC using first-principles calculations by adding point doping, point defects, and biaxial strain engineering, which facilitates bandgap tuning, allows for spectrum tunability, and improves light emission efficiency. Our findings indicate that biaxial strain engineering, point doping, and point defects may markedly enhance the electrical, and optical characteristics of the 2D SiC, providing a novel approach for the development of highperformance, energy-efficient lighting systems. Through point doping in 2D SiC, the material used in the active layer of our proposed single quantum-based LED, we exhibit substantial improvements in light emission efficiency and spectrum tunability, which facilitates the emission of red, green, and blue wavelengths from the LED. Moreover, by the integration of these wavelengths, we proposed the production of single quantum-based white light LEDs. The development of tunable LEDs with high efficiency over the visible spectrum is essential for display technologies and advanced lighting solutions. Our research indicates that 2D SiC provides advanced lighting technology, such as environmentally friendly photonic systems, flexible displays, and efficient LEDs.

    "abstract": "The growing integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into urban distribution networks has introduced challenges such as voltage quality degradation and insufficient line transmission capacity due to increased charging loads. The current assessment of the hosting capacity of distribution networks is usually based on probabilistic power flow calculations. Due to the large amount of computation, it is difficult to effectively guarantee real-time performance in practical applications. This paper proposes a data-driven and full-process application method for rapidly assessing EV hosting capacity of distribution networks under large-scale EV penetration. A fully connected neural network model is developed to rapidly forecast short-term charging loads, capturing the spatiotemporal two-dimensional uncertainty of EV behavior. This model is combined with data-driven power flow calculations and a comprehensive evaluation framework to construct an efficient hosting capacity assessment tool. A case study on the IEEE 69-node system demonstrates that the proposed data-driven model achieves high accuracy with an average prediction error after inverse normalization of below 0.5. Furthermore, it significantly reduces computation time to 7.02 seconds for 1000 samples, while the traditional evaluation methods based on probabilistic power flow calculation take 135.46 seconds. This approach provides effective operational insights for distribution network operators, enabling real-time and accurate EV hosting capacity assessment of distribution networks."

    "abstract": "In this article, we present our approach to teaching mathematics at the bachelor’s level of study in Computer science programs. The content and form of teaching are inspired by the method of genetic constructivism, which is known at lower levels of schools as \"Teaching oriented to building schemes\" or also the \"Hejny’s method\". The fundamental emphasis in teaching is based on the work of students and on changing attitudes towards mathematics as a supportive and useful course for computer science. In addition to teaching methods and experiences with them, the article also includes examples of tasks that students solve, and we document how problem-solving connects both subjects. A significant task today is the use of technology for the development of broader understanding of logical thinking of students, but also to cope with the impact and interference caused by artificial intelligence in teaching."

    "abstract": "Optical fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors have attracted huge industry interest due to their high sensitivity, small size, and immunity to electromagnetic interference. Additionally, these sensors can withstand high temperatures and are suitable for integration into different constructions and materials. FBG manufacturing costs have also been reduced significantly. However, the relatively high costs of FBG sensor interrogator units have an impact on the applicability of these sensors. In this research, we propose a relatively simple, experimental optical filter-based FBG interrogator. The key components are microcontroller and optical transceiver. We test the impact of optical transceiver's sensitivity on mechanical strain measurements with two different range transceivers. Industry-standard spectrometer-type FBG interrogator is used as a reference. Results show that higher receiver sensitivity increases the measurement range and reduces noisiness. However, even a short-range optical transceiver has the potential for continuous monitoring applications."

    "abstract": "A novel wave energy conversion (WEC) system is presented in this work, which continues the main objective of a previous study. The proposed configuration comprises two floating bodies linked through a pivoting hinge: the active body, named buoy, oscillates under the action of the incoming waves and transfer the wave induced oscillations to a PTO (Power take-off) device through the hinge axis. The PTO device is installed on a different floating body, named platform, which is intend to be as stable as possible and is linked to the seabed through a tension leg mooring system. The PTO system is equipped with a mechanical motion rectifier (MMR), aimed to transform the alternating rotational motion induced by the waves into a one-way rotational motion suitable to actuate a standard rotation electric generator. This article presents a description of the model developed to simulate the PTO system behavior, presenting some results related to the search of the optimal values of the main PTO device parameters. The developed model will also be used in a planned test campaign on a dry test bench for the emulation of the PTO response, with the aim to validate the numerical model itself and to fine tune system parameters."

This project not only aims to enhance spatial cognition but also to unlock new avenues for aesthetic and art education. The system is an operational assistive platform that integrates image description, voice-based human-computer interaction, and 3D tactile model generation. It transforms personal photographs and digital art into printable tactile models through a unique, voice-guided, end-to-end workflow, thereby enhancing user autonomy and enabling creative expression. User feedback strongly endorses the system's core features, including its intuitive voice interaction, quality audio descriptions, and flexible multilingual interface. Surveys further confirm its superior performance in tactile design, specifically regarding line thickness, comfort, and size. Beyond its functional benefits, initial findings suggest the system successfully facilitates the tactile appreciation of visual art, allowing users to perceive composition, texture, and form in a new way. Future work will refine model-generation algorithms to better preserve artistic detail and broaden application scenarios to more comprehensively support aesthetic and art education for people with visual impairments."

    "abstract": "In today's rapidly growing world of electric vehicles, people riding in them are more prone to fatalities due to delayed emergency response, and they are also misused, especially in remote areas. Current systems handle alcohol detection, accident alerts, and geofencing separately. This instance shows how important it is to have a combined solution. The proposed research paper presents an integrated safety system that combines real-time accident detection, alcoholbased ignition control, and geofencing features to bridge this gap. An MQ3 alcohol sensor in the developed prototype can identify alcohol in the driver's breath: the SW420 crash sensor and ADXL345 accelerometer work in tandem to detect collisions. The ESP32 microcontroller is used to process the sensor data. The Neo-7M Global Positioning System (GPS) module is used for location tracking, while the SIM900A Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) contacts a predefined emergency contact in any emergency case. The Neo-7M GPS module logs vehicle data onto an SD card. Most of the current methods in this area only deal with alcohol detection or accident detection. The proposed system combines several safety features into a single platform, which solves several problems related to road safety."

The control law is derived for the quarter car model. The proposed TTSSMC method estimates the effects of spring and damper coefficients which are uncertain and nonlinear along with load variation and unknown road disturbances. In this research, the controller uses only the states of sprung mass rather than the states of sprung as well as unsprung mass. This reduces the need for measurement of unsprung mass states. The controller stability is proved with the Lyapunov candidate function. The proposed method is validated on three different types of road surfaces."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "This paper proposes a method for wireless power transfer in oilfield downhole environments, capable of penetrating oil pipes, using magnetic resonance coupling-based wireless power transfer technology. Due to the confined space limitations and the skin effect of electromagnetic waves in downhole environments, the system employs extremely low-frequency electromagnetic waves for power transmission, allowing sensors outside the metal pipe to receive energy more effectively. The system is divided into two parts: the power transmission section inside the pipe and the power reception section outside the pipe. The transmission section mainly consists of a full-bridge inverter, a compensation network, and a Transmitting coil, while the reception section includes a Receiving coil, a compensation network, a rectifier and filter circuit, and a load. At extremely low frequencies, electromagnetic waves can effectively penetrate the metal pipe walls, and the equivalent series resistance of the coils is significantly reduced, which enhances system power output. The system uses a large number of compensation capacitors for parameter matching to address the issue of insufficient inductance in the resonant network. This enables the system to operate in a resonant state, thereby improving energy transfer efficiency, increasing transmission distance, and reducing the power demand on the transmission side. Test results show that when the system connects a 10Ω load (simulating a sensor load) on the reception side outside the pipe, provides a 48 V DC input to the transmission side inside the pipe, and generates an electromagnetic field using a Transmitting coil at an extremely low frequency of 25 Hz from the inverter's output AC voltage, the voltage across the load is approximately 4 V. This corresponds to a power output of about 1.6 W, which is sufficient to meet the operational requirements of sensors."

In this paper, a two-stage optimization technique is presented to reduce computational complexity and memory complexity in the processing of graphical data. The first step, Init-Update Time Optimization, splits graphical components into static (rendered only at screen initialization) and dynamic (periodically updated), minimizing repeated rendering. The second step, Low-Color Buffered Sprites Memory Optimization, uses a local memory buffer for the dynamic portions of the screen in which all rendering operations, including erasing, are performed. The resulting image is transferred to the display all at once, eliminating flickering and increasing frame rate. The method also recommends reducing the color bit depth for buffering sprites to further save memory. As a result, the rendering efficiency of the graphical user interface is significantly improved in a microprocessor environment, which is particularly suitable for simpler and moderately complex applications with limited resources."

The challenge of polysemy- where a single word can carry multiple meanings depending on the context, continues to hinder progress in areas such as machine translation, sentiment analysis and questionanswering. Despite it being a necessity to gain further advancement in these applications, minimal research has been conducted on how different models approach this problem. Finding the best fit for the polysemy involves taking into account the computational and practical qualifications of the models as well. In this paper, we implemented five models –BERT, RoBERTa, AutoSense, Sense2Vec and ELMo to gauge their performance and determine the best-suited model. Our results demonstrate that context-aware models like BERT and RoBERTa outperform static-embedding-based models like AutoSense and Sense2Vec. This research not only fills a critical void in the literature but also sets the stage for future innovations in semantic understanding, making polysemy detection a central focus for advancing NLP."

Industries were categorized according to their emission patterns using the K-Means and DBSCAN clustering algorithms; DBSCAN performed better (Silhouette Score = 0.857191). By incorporating these models into the MIS, supply chain emissions may be optimized via data-driven, real-time decision-making. Although these findings are impressive, incorporating feature engineering and other clustering approaches could further enhance the framework.

    "abstract": "Today, electricity is used in two different ways: using direct current or alternating current. On the one hand, Direct Current, DC, is the type of electrical energy in which the voltage remains constant. This electrical voltage or potential difference is the work per unit charge that an electric field needs to exert to move a charged particle between two points. Whereas, on the other hand, Alternating Current, AC, as its name indicates, the charges will not move from point A to point B, but will oscillate from one to another, causing the potential difference to vary. Normally, the alternating current used is the sinusoidal form as it is the most optimized, as is the case for most of the electricity transport in the electrical network. In this article, the transformation from DC to AC is studied by means of one of the most useful devices in the field of Power Electronics, the inverter. Nowadays, these devices are constantly used both on a small and large scale. Some of the most useful applications will be presented together with the different types of inverters that have been designed. Through a theoretical study and simulations, the different inverters will be analyzed and a series of efficiency/complexity conclusions will be drawn."

To address the underactuation issue of the original system, a coordinate transformation is employed. An adaptive law is utilized to estimate the upper bound of unknown complex disturbances. Subsequently, a prescribed-time tracking control scheme is designed, ensuring that the tracking errors converge to the predetermined precision within the predefined settling time. Rigorous theoretical analysis confirms that all signals in the closed-loop system remain bounded. Compared to existing research, the proposed control scheme achieves faster convergence speed and better tracking accuracy. The validity of the designed control strategy is verified through simulation studies."

This paper introduces a hybrid framework that combines geostatistical analysis with a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for optimizing the allocation of integrated soil sensors in terms of number and location. To this end, a wireless sensor node (WSN) was developed and deployed at 144 points for data collection. The WSN comprised a seven-in-one sensor that measured soil temperature, moisture, electrical conductivity (EC), pH, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). The data were collected in a regular grid of $25 \\times 25 \\mathrm{~m}$, covering a total area of $350 \\times 200 \\mathrm{~m}, 7$ ha of cassava field. For data analysis, ordinary kriging was used to model the spatial variability, and GA for sensor placement optimization. Variogram analysis revealed strong spatial dependence for most parameters, with nugget-to-sill ratios of less than $25 \\%$ and coverage radius extending up to 139 m. Leave-oneout cross-validation yielded RMSE values ranging from 0.13 to 70.03 and $\\mathrm{R}^{2}$ values of up to 0.66. Moran’s I analysis ($\\mathrm{p} \\lt 0.05$) confirmed significant spatial autocorrelation. The optimization indicated that 3 to 5 strategically placed sensors could effectively monitor the field, with each sensor covering approximately 2.3 hectares of the field. The proposed method provides a scalable, data-driven approach for efficient soil monitoring and precision agriculture using IoT."

These omissions, in turn, impede their capacity to properly assist users-particularly competitive examination aspirants and job seekers-to enhance their reasoning, articulation, and counterarguments skills. This paper presents a Context-Aware Personalized AI Debater to tackle these problems by employing Natural Language Processing (NLP), Generative AI, and live knowledge retrieval. The system monitors users' history, debate trends, and individual preferences to come up with custom arguments and counterarguments. Web scraping is utilized to make the content fact-oriented and current. Complementing both text and voice interaction, the debater learns to fit individual users, increasing engagement and making debates more interactive. A feedback loop offers personalized feedback on strengths and weaknesses, and debate transcripts can be downloaded for review. This work shows the feasibility of using AI to develop intelligent, adaptive learning tools. The system presented is efficient in educational, professional, and policy-oriented environments. Future developments consist of multimodal support, state-of-the-art speech recognition, and collaborative debate schemes."

    "abstract": "Acoustic leaky wave antennas (ALWAs) are passive, dispersive waveguides capable of achieving frequency-dependent directional radiation scanning. Traditional ALWAs rely on periodic side tubes and elastic membranes in waveguides, but they commonly encounter challenges such as complex assembly, difficulties in membrane tension control, low efficiency, significant side lobe radiation. In this work, we propose a design of ALWA incorporating a phononic crystal featuring double-zero refractive index, which is resulted from the accidental degeneracy of monopole and dipole modes near Brillouin zone center. The antenna possesses a constant leakage factor for length-independent radiation and matches the Bloch impedance of air. With proper aperture geometry design, the leaky mode of the antenna unit achieves finite and comparable quality factors, resulting in a leaky wave antenna with up to 95% radiation efficiency and high directivity. Moreover, an acoustic source replaces port excitation to enable the symmetric and asymmetric control of dualbeam radiation. At the same time, this ALWA can be extended into 2D space. The proposed antenna structure has promising applications in acoustic navigation and imaging requiring low-power operation, as well as in high-precision acoustic source localization."

    "abstract": "As the diabetes mellitus is increasing day by day, a replacement for the conventional standard painful finger pricking technique is necessary. One of the main challenges for the accurate and precise non-invasive glucose monitoring is modeling the propagation effects when waves interact with the human tissues. As per literature, the infrared signals have the capability to detect glucose molecules more effectively than other signals in the electromagnetic spectrum. In this work, a phantom of the finger is created in ‘COMSOL — Multiphysics Simulator’ and the light tissue interactions in different spectroscopic ranges like near infrared (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$700-2500 \\text{nm}$</tex>) and mid infrared (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$2500-25,000 \\text{nm}$</tex>) are analyzed. The modeling of the finger is carried out by defining the different layers of finger which are stratum corneum, epidermis, papillary dermis, upper blood net dermis, reticular dermis, deep blood net dermis, fat, muscle and bone. The material properties like thickness, absorption coefficient, scattering coefficient and refractive index for each layer are analyzed separately. In both the mid-infrared and near-infrared ranges, the most glucose absorption was obviously noted in the upper blood net dermis. The second highest glucose absorption was observed in the deep blood net dermis followed by the papillary dermis. Interestingly, the stratum corneum had the largest scattering in the near-infrared and mid-infrared spectral ranges, followed by the papillary dermis. After completing the single layer analysis, the finger phantom as a whole, combining all the individual layers are analyzed. The results of absorption spectra and reflection spectra for both near infrared and mid infrared for the finger phantom are reported. Based on the modeling and results, it can be inferred that mid-infrared may exhibit the highest absorption."

    "abstract": "Dynamic metasurface antennas and holographic surfaces have opened new frontiers in fields of next generation reconfigurable wireless communications, meta-sensing, computational imaging, and computational optics. A critical component of these advanced systems lies in the engineering of meta-elements that efficiently manipulate electromagnetic waves. This paper presents the design of a complementary electric inductive-capacitive (CELC) meta-element based aperture to address limitations in traditional metasurfaces and phased array antennas, which often suffer from restricted phase modulation, significant power consumption, and limited control over beam steering and beam synthesis. Our design leverages an innovative integration of CELC meta-elements, optimizing the tunability and dynamic response of the metasurface antenna. The CELC meta-element can be readily integrated with either a PIN diode (for digital beamforming) or a varactor diode (for continuous beam tuning). Consequently, we demonstrate a metasurface capable of dynamic wavefront control, with both spatially and temporally tunable capabilities. This architecture outperforms traditional setups in terms of power consumption and response time, enabling agile beam steering, beam synthesis, and adaptive holography with minimal power requirements. Furthermore, we validated the CELC meta-element through both full-wave simulations and mmWave experimental setups, illustrating its effectiveness in achieving desired phase profiles and amplitude modulations for fixed-frequency beam steering at 60 GHz, as well as multibeam generation from a single aperture through a software-controlled paradigm. The design is scalable in frequency and can be utilized at lower frequency as well as for optical holograms at high frequency bands following similar design methodology. The proposed CELC meta-element marks a substantial advancement for dynamic metasurfaces, particularly for applications in next-generation metasurface antennas and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) enabled software wireless paradigm. This work provides a practical pathway to high-performance, energy-efficient solutions in next-generation wireless communication, sensing and imaging, advancing the scope and impact of dynamic metasurface technology for rapidly evolving high-frequency 6G wireless applications."

Such limitations make them illsuited for Test-Driven Development (TDD). To overcome these challenges, we present an approach that combines text and methods for test case generation. Using prompt engineering techniques, we evaluate two LLMs: Meta-LLaMA-3-8B (base) and Mistral-7B-Instruct on a dataset of $\\mathbf{1 3 6, 0 6 0}$ entries, resulting in the generation of 7,606- unit test cases from opensource projects to assess whether instruction tuning or an increase in parameter count has a greater impact on test case generation quality.

In contrast, classical machine learning (ML) typically requires data to be located on-premises for training, whereas FL leverages numerous user devices to train a shared global model without the need to share private data. Current robotic manipulation tasks are constrained by the individual capabilities and speed of robots due to limited low-latency computing resources. Consequently, the concept of cloud robotics has emerged, allowing robotic applications to harness the flexibility and reliability of computing resources, effectively alleviating their computational demands across the cloud-edge continuum. Undoubtedly, within this distributed computing context, as exemplified in cloud robotic manipulation scenarios, FL offers manifold advantages while also presenting several challenges and opportunities. In this paper, we present fundamental concepts of FL and their connection to cloud robotic manipulation. Additionally, we envision the opportunities and challenges associated with realizing efficient and reliable cloud robotic manipulation at scale through FL, where researchers adapt to design and verify FL models in either centralized or decentralized settings."

    "abstract": "This study explores the capability of investigating the surgical margins between healthy and cancerous regions in cancer cells-laden 3D hydrogel scaffold using a non-invasive, highresolution, label-free, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) system. The SDOCT system (GAN611C1, Ganymede, Thorlabs) utilizes a superluminescent light emitting diode (SLED) source of center wavelength 930 nm, full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of 102 nm, axial resolution of 3.8 µm (in tissue), lateral resolution of 8 µm (obtained using the objective lens, LSM03 BB, Thorlabs Inc., NJ, with a working distance of 25 mm), operating at a speed of 248,000 A-scans/s. The maximum imaging depth of this system is ~ 2.2 mm in tissue. The primary cancer cells tend to metastasize and invade other parts of the tissues, vasculature, and organs from their region of origin. This leads to the formation of new metastatic tumors, resulting in the increased mortality rates of people suffering from cancer. Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent types of cancer, having the highest incidence and mortality rates in females. MDA-MB-231 cell lines used in this study are highly invasive breast cancer cells. The potential of different hydrogel bioinks, such as gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), was analyzed by optical characterization. To overcome the confounding scattering effects of photo-initiators present in GelMA, CMC-based biocompatible hydrogels were prepared using the acyl-hydrazone reaction without the need for photo-initiators, toxic chemical crosslinkers or UV light. MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured and embedded in 3D CMC-based hydrogel scaffolds in this study. A mold was fabricated using a fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printer. To construct the 3D hydrogel scaffolds, a fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printer was used to fabricate a mold with a ~ 5 mm diameter slot, enabling better insertion and removal of the hydrogel. The mold was filled with 10 µl of MDA-MB231 cells suspended in an oxidized CMC and CMC di-hydrazide solutions, which then crosslinked to form the hydrogel. The developed 3D hydrogel sample was imaged using the SD-OCT system before and after the excision of the cell-laden hydrogel with a clear delineation. This approach not only has the potential for high-resolution label-free structural and volumetric imaging but can be further extended towards the dynamic analysis of cancer cells embedded in 3D hydrogels to formulate the optical and mechanical relationship based on the activity of the cancer cells in various bio-inks of different tunable stiffnesses to study the disease progression."

    "abstract": "In the context of the digital transformation of education, learners' motivation not only retains its key role in the educational process but also gains even greater importance. Several psychological theories discuss this topic, but the ones that seem to correspond most with the educational process, mutually build on each other, and deeply study the problems of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, as well as their derived attitudes towards learning, are the developments of Ryan, Deci, and Holzcamp, supplemented by the taxonomy proposed by Malone and Lepper. Gamification is undoubtedly an approach that provokes motivation and engagement, and games of the “Escape Room” and “Mystery Room” type, in which players must autonomously, without guidance from the tutor, solve puzzles, competing with other participants, have the potential to fuel intrinsic motivation, and, as a consequence, expansive learning. This work explores the utility of these game genres from the perspective of the aforementioned psychological theories. It discusses the concept and design of a serious game that combines concepts of the game genres mentioned above and some typical board game mechanics, and covers practical digital skills related to arithmetic fundamentals of the computer and the processor's structure and functioning."

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases are the second leading cause of death in Japan, underscoring the need for improved prevention and treatment. Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is a surgical procedure to remove plaque that has accumulated in the intima of the carotid artery, and is expected to reduce the risk of stroke. However, the long-term prognosis and complications after CEA surgery are not fully understood. In this study, we investigate pathological factors associated with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score, based on features extracted from pathological images of plaques removed by CEA and clinical data.We extract features from pathological images using an autoencoder (AE) and analyze them with Lasso regression to investigate their association with the mRS score. The obtained R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> score was 0.8427, suggesting that the features obtained by AE retained sufficient information related to the mRS score. It should be noted that this analysis was conducted on the training set; therefore, its generalization performance needs to be evaluated in the future. We also visualized the regions associated with the mRS score in pathological images using the trained regression model."

    "abstract": "The increasing global share of variable renewable energy (VRE) in power systems has intensified the need for advanced scenario generation methods that can capture both the stochastic behavior of each source and their spatial-temporal interdependencies. This paper presents a copula-based framework for generating monthly correlated scenarios of hydro, wind, and solar resources in the Brazilian power system, with a particular focus on sensitivity analyses. The core contribution lies in evaluating the robustness of this framework to changes in the central variable used in the C-vine structure—specifically, the role of hydrological inflows from different Energy Equivalent Reservoirs (EERs) and variations in scenario horizon lengths. Results demonstrate that the proposed method preserves key statistical properties and dependency structures even under significantly different conditioning inputs, providing strong evidence of its adaptability. While applied to the Brazilian context, the methodology can be extended to other electricity markets with historical records of hydropower inflows. This capability is particularly valuable for long-term operation planning, energy market analysis, and hybrid renewable integration under uncertainty."

    "abstract": "Conventional neural text-to-speech (TTS) systems frequently employ recurrent neural network (RNN)-based encoders, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) or Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), to extract speaker embeddings from reference speech. While effective, these sequential models inherently limit parallel computation and exhibit challenges in capturing long-range dependencies. In this paper, we present a novel speaker encoder architecture grounded in the Transformer model. By leveraging the self-attention mechanism, the proposed design enables improved modeling of temporal dependencies across speech sequences, resulting in more robust and generalizable speaker representations. The Transformer-based speaker encoder is trained using a speaker verification objective, specifically utilizing the Generalized End-to-End (GE2E) loss function. These embeddings are integrated within a Tacotron 2-based synthesis framework to support zero-shot speaker adaptation. Performance evaluations, benchmarked against an LSTM-based baseline, demonstrate significant improvements across multiple indicators, including speaker similarity, equal error rate (EER), model complexity, and inference latency. This architectural refinement not only enhances synthesis quality and system efficiency but also simplifies the end-to-end pipeline by eliminating recurrent components. Additionally, the Transformer's capability for parallelized computation significantly accelerates both training and inference. The experimental outcomes confirm the potential of attention-based architectures in speaker encoding, especially in data-constrained and zero-shot learning environments. This work establishes the Transformer-based approach as a viable and efficient alternative to conventional RNN models in modern TTS systems."

The spoken utterances by dementia patients are processed using the OpenSMILE toolkit to extract 88 acoustic features, a combination of low-level descriptors, and statistical functions. The extracted features are input into six ML algorithms for healthy and dementia classification. These combinations of features and algorithms are evaluated using the Alzheimer's Dementia Recognition through Spontaneous Speech Only 2021 dataset, comprising utterances from <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{4 9}$</tex> healthy and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{8 5}$</tex> dementia subjects. Comparative analysis showed that all algorithms performed well, with accuracies above 74 %. The gradient boosting model achieved the highest detection with 88.89% accuracy and 93.02% F1-score, followed by the random forest. The investigation of the gradient boosting model showed that loudness, alpha ratio, shimmer, and mel-frequency cepstral coefficients are the most important for automatic dementia classification."

    "abstract": "This paper examines the induced electromagnetic effects on T-pylon transmission line caused by circuit coupling in a newly implemented 400 kV double-circuit power network in the United Kingdom. This system comprises interconnected segments of T-pylons, lattice towers, and underground cables. The study further evaluates the effectiveness of Drain Earth Shorting Scheme (DrESS) conductors in mitigating these effects by analyzing induced currents on earth wires, phase-to-ground induced voltages, and tower footing currents. The induced effects in the hybrid power network are investigated using ATP-EMTP assuming the pi-transmission line model, considering a soil resistivity of 100 Ω.m, and tower footing resistance of 3 Ω. The results indicate that induced currents on the ground wires of the energized side are consistently higher due to strong magnetic coupling. However, after the installation of DrESS conductors, a significant reduction is observed in the ground wire current on the non-energized side. Regarding induced voltages, a V-shaped distribution is identified along the T-pylon line, with peak magnitudes occurring at the endpoints. The application of DrESS significantly reduces the peak induced voltages while altering the overall voltage profile. Additionally, tower footing currents exhibit a U-shaped distribution, with peak values near transition points between T-pylons and lattice towers, as well as at underground cable junctions. The highest current is recorded at the final T-pylon, while the lowest values appear at segment midpoints. The installation of DrESS conductors effectively reduces tower footing currents at the initial T-pylons. These findings demonstrate that DrESS installation significantly mitigates induced voltages and currents on the non-energized circuit, enhancing safety for maintenance personnel working on T-pylons."

The proposed system integrates a rotating inclined belt lined with hydrophobic and oleophilic polypropylene tabs, which enhance selective hydrocarbon adhesion while minimizing water intake. Collected oil is mechanically scraped and transferred to an onboard containment tray. Under theoretical conditions -belt speed of 25 RPM and an oil film thickness of 0.5 mm - the estimated recovery rate reaches up to 380 liters per hour, while field tests showed practical recovery rates of around 250 liters per hour, outperforming traditional drum skimmers. The system’s low - speed operation increases adhesion efficiency by extending contact time between oil and belt surface. Future integrations with an intelligent teleoperation module, PID speed control, remote monitoring, and an HMI panel aims to enable real-time parameter adjustments according to changing environmental conditions. The prototype demonstrates a scalable, energy - efficient, and environmentally responsible solution for oil spill mitigation in coastal and shallow waters. The results contribute to the development of smart, remotely operated systems for marine environmental protection."

    "abstract": "The growing demand for housing has increased the need for intelligent systems in building planning to improve underlying processes and reduce the workload of professionals. A central aspect of creating such systems is the detection of symbols in building plans, which is essential for creating a bill of materials (BOM). This necessitates symbol data that reflects the wide variety of symbols used in practice. However, public datasets are not available, which led to an increased focus on methods for generating synthetic data. To address these issues, this study presents a novel dataset comprising 2,000 distinct ELectrical INstallation symbols from Architectural plans (ELINA), which is provided for research. Based on ELINA, we present an end-to-end system capable of detecting unknown symbols at the pixel-level by learning general representations of symbols with synthetic data. Our system reaches a mean Average Precision (mAP) (0.50-0.95) score of 0.454 for instance segmentation and a score of 0.959 for bounding box detection, cross-validated in a study using 400 unseen test symbols. We further present and analyze a feature clustering method to differentiate detected symbols, enabling the creation of BOMs. In contrast to other work, our method does not require a separate training process. A key finding is that using a supplementary feature extractor enables a two- to threefold improvement in clustering performance, reaching Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) scores up to 0.63."

However, the complex design process is a significant obstacle to its development. At present, the design of light guides is still in the stage of trial and error, mainly focusing on adjusting the design parameters of light-guiding microstructure. Based on this, this article combines deep learning algorithm with the design. On the basis of the existing dataset, establish the dataset through extensive experiments. The dataset includes six structural parameters and one performance parameter that determine the optical properties of light-guiding microstructure. Select the GAN algorithm, build a seven input seven output GAN model, and record its output data. Verify the output of the algorithm using design software CATIA and simulation software SPEOS. The results show that the optical performance of the optical microstructure designed using output parameters is excellent, proving that the combination of deep learning and light-guiding microstructure design can improve the efficiency and intelligence of the design."

Both co-propagation and counterpropagation pumping at 980 nm and 1480 nm wavelengths are analyzed to identify optimal configurations that maximize amplification efficiency while minimizing noise. The findings provide critical insights into designing high-performance REDFAs for WDM networks, supporting stable and highquality signal transmission. This research contributes to the development of scalable, high-capacity optical networks capable of meeting the increasing demand for data-intensive applications. An experimental model is tested in different conditions using an up to 8-channel non-return-to-zero (NRZ) modulated 100 GHz spaced transmission system. The gain curve of the designed REDFA is characterized by a WDM system operating in C-band. Results demonstrate that carefully designed REDFAs not only enhance WDM system performance by increasing signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) but also maintain signal fidelity across high-capacity channels. The study's findings underscore the potential of REDFAs as scalable and reliable solutions for WDM networks, offering practical insights into achieving high amplification efficiency in demanding high-speed environments. This work lays the groundwork for advanced amplifier designs in optical communications, providing a roadmap for implementing robust amplification solutions in high-capacity, long-distance optical systems."

However, plant diseases are one of the most pressing concerns for farmers, particularly in the Wolaita Zone, resulting in a reduction in crop production levels and the feasibility of their treatment. To mitigate this problem, previous studies have conducted research on plant disease classification. However, there is a lack of studies conducted to classify plant diseases and provide treatment recommendations. Thus, the proposed study employed a design science research design with both qualitative and quantitative approaches. To achieve our objective and fill the research gap, we developed a lightweight multilabel classification model for crop disease detection and treatment recommendation using transfer learning with pretrained convolutional neural networks, including YOLOv8, VGGNet, DenseNet201, and MobileNetV2 integrated with an attention mechanism that extracts features used for model training. A combined 12,490 images dataset was prepared from healthy and infected enset, tomato, and pepper leaves, as well as the CSV file containing the disease types and their treatment recommendations. Experiments for the proposed models are carried out, and the results of the DenseNet201 algorithm fused with the Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) attention mechanism resulted in a Hamming Loss of 0.0197, Validation Accuracy of 0.992, and mAP of 0.9554 over the entire class.

    "abstract": "As we move towards 6 G communications systems, the increasing number of connected devices is exacerbating spectrum scarcity. Cognitive radio (CR), based on spectrum sensing (SS), can dynamically identify and exploit underutilized frequency bands to optimize their use. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for improving the performance of spectrum sensing, addressing the key challenges of model accuracy and robustness. In this context, identifying primary users and allowing secondary users access to unoccupied bands is essential for more efficient and equitable spectrum management. Although traditional approaches, such as energy detection and cyclostationary detection, have been widely studied, they have limitations in highly noisy environments. This work examines and compares three detection models-support vector machines (SVM), multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), as well as one classical method, the energy detector. Performance assessment is conducted using the probability of detection, the probability of false alarm, the total error rate, and the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve across various signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels. The results show that the CNN model offers slightly better performance than the other models."

This antenna is used for anti-UAV radar system, and should meet the requirements such as high gain and low sidelobe level. A rectangular patch antenna is adopted as the array unit. The antenna unit is fed by microstrip line, which inserts into the patch at the middle of the wide edge of the patch. Series feed network and coaxial feed are combined to realize a low loss feed network and to achieve nonuniform excitation. Through the feed network, all patch antenna units are excited in phase but with different amplitude of Taylor distribution to achieve a low sidelobe level. Finally, the antenna array and network are combined together, and a <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$8 \\times 16$</tex> microstrip antenna array is realized. The antenna operates between 16.8 GHz and 17.2 GHz. Simulation results show that high efficiency and low sidelobe level is achieved.

    "abstract": "Use of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for data analysis has gained popularity in recent years. This research aims to develop a robust, AI-assisted open-source framework for mapping and analyzing structured financial data, powered by RAG and fine-tuned transformer models. The system eliminates the need for manually pulling data, running queries, summarizing, and visualizing primary financial metrics such as revenue, net income, return on investment (ROI), and shareholder equity. Using Sentence Transformer Models (STM) and Facebook AI Similarity Search (FAISS), each financial record is encoded into dense vectors for semantic retrieval. When a user asks a natural language question, the system pulls up related records and creates summaries with a Meta AI, Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers (BART) model. The proposed solution is designed as a modular architecture combining data ingestion, preprocessing, embedding, RAG-based querying, BART summarization, and interactive visualization components (via Plotly and Streamlit). A prototype was developed based on Jupyter Notebook and tested over real financial data acquired from Fintags Pty Limited. It solves problems such as manual data management, inconsistent data and the lag in decision making with a scalable, precise, and easy-to-use tool. It allows business and financial analysts to get contextually relevant insights from large datasets without needing to know how to code. Experimental results show significant gains in analytical efficiency, model interpretability, and business decision support conventional financial analysis techniques. The proposed system demonstrates how AI-powered semantic summarization can replace conventional manual workflows in financial analysis, improving speed, accessibility, and decision-making quality."

While similar studies have been widely conducted in the past, few have considered the significant impact of road gradients on carbon dioxide emissions. This study was validated in San Francisco, a city with a diverse elevation distribution and well-developed road networks. The effect of elevation changes was incorporated into the results by converting them into equivalent distances using a correction formula. Driving routes were determined using candidate route extraction based on Dijkstra’s algorithm and a quantum annealing simulator. The validation results showed that this method could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by up to 27% compared to previous methods. Furthermore, when the effects of traffic congestion were included in the carbon dioxide emissions, it was confirmed that the carbon dioxide emissions were minimized when the number of candidate routes extracted by Dijkstra’s algorithm was set to 20. This result indicates that the conditions of Dijkstra’s algorithm are also an important factor. For future work, efforts will focus on improving practicality by optimizing the cost functions and other computation conditions in quantum annealing, as well as expanding the computational model to account for factors such as vehicle weight."

Portable low-power consumers are powered by batteries, accumulators or other primary sources of electrical energy. To power more powerful consumers, which in most cases are stationary, energy from the standard AC network is used, usually converted using electronic converters. The conversion is necessary because different consumers have requirements for different types and values of the supply voltage. In most cases, they require a constant voltage with certain parameters. The paper proposes a system for switching between different energy sources according to the energy regulations of the country to ensure an uninterrupted power supply. The successful operation of the control devices and the achievement of fuel and energy savings are demonstrated. This proves that modern hybrid systems can be successfully used in the telecommunications as well as other manufacturing sectors for lower the carbon footprint."

This paper presents the application of an in-house developed probabilistic generation stacking tool to conduct a national-level short-term resource adequacy assessment for India for the fiscal year 2025-26. This analysis was carried out as part of the ShortTerm National Resource Adequacy Plan (ST-NRAP). Using a scenario-based Monte Carlo approach, 1,000 stochastic simulations were performed to capture uncertainties in demand, wind, solar generation, and outages of conventional generating units. The stacking tool evaluates system adequacy using two key reliability metrics: Loss of Load Probability (LOLP) and Normalized Energy Not Served (NENS). A major innovation in this study is the dynamic modeling of storage systems. Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) and Pumped Storage Plants (PSPs) are simulated to charge during surplus generation periods and discharge automatically during shortages, thereby reflecting real-time system flexibility. The results reveal a heightened risk of supply shortfall during non-solar hours, especially from April to September 2025. In the best-case scenario, LOLP and NENS were estimated at $4.8 \\%$ and $0.12 \\%$, respectively, while the median scenario showed values of $12.1 \\%$ and $0.37 \\%$. This study highlights the critical role of scenario-based probabilistic tools for early identification of supply shortfall risks and emphasizes the importance of flexible resources, strategic outage planning, and integrated storage operation to ensure grid reliability in a highVRE environment."

Typically, machine learning models require large amounts of data, which are costly and time-consuming in collecting and labeling data. Thus, data aggregation is a challenging part of artificial intelligence. Most open-source simulators focus on autonomous driving, which limits their applicability for other use-cases. This work provides a new approach for an alternative simulator that is highly flexible, usable in any domain and, therefore, solves the problem described before. This simulator is based on the Isaac Sim framework and uses a new method to filter the bounding boxes using a clustering algorithm. A study on object detection for pallets and containers within a warehouse environment for autonomous robots shows that synthetic data is challenging realworld data by outperforming the baseline model by +7.24 in Average Precision utilizing the PointPillar architecture. Further, fine-tuning the weights with a small set of real-world data significantly improves the model, increasing its Average Precision by +24.79 relative to the baseline."

    "abstract": "In recent years, the big data era has provided consumer financial institutions with multi-source personal data, creating a vast pool of credit information. How to effectively utilize and integrate these resources for comprehensive personal credit risk prediction is a key challenge. Credit risk prediction is usually an imbalanced classification task, with default samples far fewer than normal repayment ones, posing challenges for traditional machine learning methods. In this paper, a novel data augmentation method called SC-CTGAN, which combines spectral clustering with conditional tabular generative adversarial network (CTGAN), is proposed to augment the original data with a sufficient number of synthetic default transactions. This integration successfully tackles the issue of an uneven distribution of minority-class samples that often arises when oversampling is performed using CTGAN. Then we propose a credit risk prediction approach grounded in an adaptive weighted ensemble learning model, aiming to enhance the model's generalization capability. By integrating the strengths of diverse learning algorithms, this method effectively leverages the underlying patterns within the data to improve prediction accuracy. The results of the experiment indicate that our proposed ensemble model based on SC-CTGAN outperforms other state-of-the-art machine learning models in AUC score."

In this work, we explore the application of RAG to ontologies to support ontology engineers and users in querying structured knowledge. To demonstrate the generalizability of our approach, we evaluate RAG on three ontologies from the domains of video games, IoT infrastructure, and rhetorical figures. Two of the ontologies are in English, while one is in German. Our study compares chunking strategies, chunk sizes, and the use of rerankers. We observe that advanced chunking techniques offer limited performance gains due to the inherently modular structure of ontologies. Additionally, we compare RAG on ontological document structure with the same information in a continuous format and reveal that the performance of RAG is not negatively affected by the ontological document structure. An advantage of using ontologies is that they can be evaluated against their competency questions that are typically developed alongside and define the intended use. With the Ragas evaluation framework, we achieve promising results across domains and languages. To address challenges regarding verbose LLM outputs that decrease performance, we propose a new metric Answer Average Match (AAM), which is specifically designed for the evaluation of RAG on ontologies. Our findings highlight the viability of ontology-aware RAG and offer practical insights for its optimization and evaluation."

    "abstract": "The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) heavily depends on the quality of their training data, while their capabilities are primarily evaluated through taskspecific test datasets. This evaluation approach makes the quality of test datasets a critical factor in ensuring LLM reliability. Even high-accuracy LLMs may exhibit weak generalizability and insufficient robustness when they are evaluated using flawed test sets with insufficient sample sizes or limited diversity. In traditional software testing, mutation testing is a well-established technique for assessing test suite effectiveness by measuring the ability to detect artificially injected faults. However, fundamental differences exist between traditional software and Transformerbased LLMs, preventing the direct application of classical mutation testing techniques. To address this, we propose LLMMutation, a dedicated test dataset quality evaluation method for LLMs, which applies multi-level mutation operators to introduce perturbations into the model. Experimental results demonstrate that models perturbed by different mutation operators exhibit significant accuracy degradation, which validate LLMMutation's effectiveness in fault injection. In addition, different test datasets exhibit distinct mutation score distributions under LLMMutation perturbations, which is positively correlated with the quality of the datasets. This confirms that the mutation score can effectively distinguish the quality of datasets used for the same task."

We introduce optimizations for stitching order and patch matching to improve alignment robustness and computational efficiency. The proposed methods are benchmarked on two microscopy datasets, including one with ground-truth labels, using both traditional and learned similarity metrics.

Since, IEEE 1547 DG connectivity standards state that the DG must be shut down if islanding is detected within two seconds. This paper offers a novel method for image pattern recognition for islanding identification using a deep learning (DL) classification algorithm. The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) classification algorithm is used in the proposed method. To identify both non-islanding and islanding events, images are used to extract the histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) characteristics. The time series signal obtained from the point of common coupling (PCC) is used to create the scalogram images. HOG features are extracted from the images and then used as feature vector inputs for LSTM classifier training and testing. The rate of change of voltage parameter is used to create scalogram images. The LSTM classifier's effectiveness is assessed through k-fold cross-validations. The classification findings indicates that islanding detection utilising a LSTM classifier and HOG feature for image pattern recognition obtained outstanding performance with 98.62% accuracy and a detection time of 109 milliseconds."

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of Remaining Useful Life (RUL) in aero-engines is vital for predictive maintenance, improved operational reliability, and reduced lifecycle costs. While deep learning approaches have demonstrated strong potential in this area, most existing methods focus primarily on model architecture design and treat input features uniformly, often neglecting the influence of data preprocessing. In this work, we propose a novel preprocessing pipeline that enhances RUL prediction by improving data quality and temporal representation before model training. Our approach leverages complete temporal sequences and generates RUL estimates at each timestep, enabling the model to capture finegrained degradation dynamics and deliver continuous prognostic insights throughout the engine's operational life. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed pipeline, we conduct experiments on the NASA C-MAPSS dataset. Comparative evaluations against a suite of state-of-the-art neural models including CNN, RNN, LSTM, DCNN, TCN, BiGRUTSAM, AGCNN, and ATCN, demonstrate that our approach consistently achieves superior accuracy and robustness in aeroengine RUL prediction. These results highlight the critical role of preprocessing in maximizing the effectiveness of neural prognostic models."

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on improving the effectiveness of the standard 2-layer MLP projection head featured in the SimCLR framework through the use of pretrained autoencoder embeddings. Given a contrastive learning task with a largely unlabeled image classification dataset, we first train a shallow autoencoder architecture and extract its compressed representations contained in the encoder's embedding layer. After freezing the weights within this pretrained layer, we use it as a drop-in replacement for the input layer of SimCLR's default projector. Additionally, we also apply further architectural changes to the projector by decreasing its width and changing its activation function. The different projection heads are then used to contrastively train and evaluate a feature extractor following the SimCLR protocol. Our experiments indicate that using a pretrained autoencoder embedding in the projector can not only increase classification accuracy by up to 2.9 % or 1.7 % on average, but can also significantly decrease the dimensionality of the projection space. Our results also suggest, that using the sigmoid and tanh activation functions within the projector can outperform ReLU in terms of peak and average classification accuracy. All experiments involving our pretrained projectors are conducted with frozen embeddings, since our test results indicate an advantage compared to using their non-frozen counterparts."

The main goal of agricultural robots is to increase efficiency, reduce costs, and be environmentally friendly, while reducing dependence on human labor. The critical angle of lateral stability is a very important parameter for agricultural robots because it determines the maximum slope of the terrain at which the robot can operate safely without tipping over sideways. It defines the boundary between stable and unstable operation of the robot and is key to its safety, reliability and efficiency. This angle of stability is important because it gives the robot safety against damage in case of rollover, efficiency of work by planning the maximum slopes of the terrain to be overcome, allows for better coping with a variety of conditions, it depends on the parameters of the structure, allows for autonomous operation based on predetermined critical angles. Through regression analysis, experimental transverse stability data is turned into an equation or model through which we can predict and improve the stability of the robot. In this article, a regression analysis of the factors influencing the transverse stability of agricultural robots is made.

    "abstract": "Task execution in multiagent settings often calls for the formation of coalitions, since agents may possess complementary skills and/or resources that have to be pulled together for a task. Naturally, the formation process and its efficiency is affected by strategic agent choices, as well as by the uncertainty inherent in practically all real-world settings; thus, in principle it can be facilitated by reinforcement learning (RL). The practicality of employing RL for each individual to learn aspects of the coalition formation problem in large open settings is questionable, however, due to the scarcity of interactions among specific agents and also due to privacy concerns. As such, we propose a novel framework that effectively intertwines sequential decision making during coalition formation under uncertainty with deep RL (DRL) techniques designed to fit the needs of such challenging environments and overcome the aforementioned issues. This is facilitated by the assumption of capability-related agent types; and by allowing the joint RL training of agents in ways that do not jeopardize their privacy. We put forward two DRL algorithms that guarantee privacy preservation by design, as is also verified by a theoretical proof that we provide. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, and its potential for transfer learning, as already trained models can be successfully employed in environments with different reward functions. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first approach to allow autonomous agents to employ deep RL for sequentially optimal decisions in large open coalitional task allocation settings, while addressing uncertainty and privacy concerns."

    "abstract": "Two highly sensitive amperometric immunosensors for alpha-fetoprotein antigen (AFPAg) detection were fabricated through electrode modification strategies. Typically, during AFPAg detection, electron transfer is mediated by substances such as ferrocene or gold. However, in the case of the prepared zinc oxide electrodes, direct electron transfer was observed between the electrode surface and horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Specifically, by modifying a zinc electrode, pre-heated to 500°C, with AFP antibody (AFPAb) and ferrocene via chitosan, we developed two types of amperometric immunosensors for AFPAg quantification. Under optimized conditions, cyclic voltammetry revealed specific responses of the immunosensors to AFP within two distinct concentration ranges: 1.56 to 12.5 ng/mL and 25.0 to 100.0 ng/mL. The limits of detection were determined to be 0.02 ng/mL and 0.05ng/mL, respectively, at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3. The results demonstrated that electrodes modified with chitosan and AFPAb exhibited high sensitivity, indicating effective immobilization of AFPAb on the electrode surface and facilitating direct electron transfer between the electrode and HRP. Furthermore, when the electrode was additionally modified with ferrocene, a good sensitivity was achieved, suggesting that ferrocene also participated in electron transfer and contributed to signal amplification. We conducted a comprehensive investigation into the factors influencing the performance of the proposed immunosensors. The developed immunosensors exhibited excellent specificity, good reproducibility, repeatability, and long-term stability, making them promising candidates for clinical AFPAg detection."

    "abstract": "The high-temperature superconducting (HTS) flux pump is a charging device that can achieve contactless excitation and provide stable current compensation for superconducting magnets without increasing the refrigeration burden of the system. Compared with the traditional excitation method through current leads, the HTS flux pump has the advantages of high safety performance, high excitation efficiency, and high stability, making it an effective solution for the stable operation of super conducting magnets. Among them, the transformer-rectifier HTS flux pump based on dynamic resistance has the advantages of low loss and low system complexity, and thus holds greater application potential. This paper provides a detailed analysis of the working principle of the transformer-rectifier HTS flux pump based on dynamic resistance, focusing on its core component, the superconducting bridge. Then, a finite element simulation model of the superconducting bridge is established and a formula for the dynamic resistance of the superconducting bridge is obtained. In order to verify the accuracy of the model, a measurement system for the dynamic resistance of a single superconducting tape under a composite magnetic field is also constructed. Subsequently, a circuit model of the transformer-rectifier HTS flux pump is built in MATLAB Simulink and the output characteristics of the flux pump are analyzed. The results indicate that the excitation speed of the load magnet and the final saturation current are mainly affected by the amplitude, frequency, phase difference of the composite magnetic field, and the magnitude of the charging current, but are independent of the frequency of the charging current. The thesis proposes specific methods to optimize the output characteristics of the flux pump by adjusting the amplitude, frequency, and phase difference of the applied magnetic field. For example, the study shows that the output efficiency of the flux pump peaks with a 60° phase lead of the parallel field component over the perpendicular field, which provides theoretical support for optimizing the performance of the flux pump."

The controller utilized an optical flow sensor to detect object slippage events, which triggered increases in the desired gripping force within a closed-loop force control system. We first validated the slip-prevention functionality on a bench test platform. Subsequently, the controller was integrated into a simple shared control framework to demonstrate its feasibility in enhancing the grasping function for prosthesis users. In this shared control framework, myoelectric position control (i.e., user control) was employed when the hand was not engaged in a grasp, while the intelligent autonomous grip force control was activated during contact with an object. The feasibility of the shared control was tested with human participants performing tasks involving the grasping, transferring, and releasing of various objects while using and wearing the prosthetic hand. Additionally, we compared the shared control to a myoelectric-only controller (without the autonomous grip force control) in the object manipulation task combined with a secondary cognitive task. The results demonstrated that the proposed automatic grip force controller effectively prevented slips and improved grasping stability under various perturbations. Compared to myoelectric-only control, the shared control reduced the user’s cognitive effort required for object manipulation and lead to increased task success. While our designed slip-prevention grip force controller shows significant potential to assist the prosthesis users in improving grasping functionality, further exploration of other shared control paradigms is necessary to maximize user performance and acceptance in the future."

However, in existing works, when PMUTs work at a high-order resonance mode, their weak amplitude of flexural vibration and sound pressure cancellation from opposite membrane motions result in low sensitivity. Here, we demonstrate a novel PMUT with double-turn slots at the edge of the membrane, transforming the fully-clamped membrane into a suspended structure, thus modifying the mode shape. When the PMUT operates in the second-order mode, the structure alleviates sound pressure cancellation, and enables large vibration amplitude, thus enhancing both sensitivity and frequency. AlN-based PMUT prototypes are fabricated on a 4-inch wafer with CMOS compatible processes for validation. Compared to fully-clamped PMUTs operating in the fundamental resonance mode, the central displacements of the two devices with different slot angles are increased by 153% and 84%, their frequencies are improved by 59% and 189%, respectively, and the round-trip sensitivity is enhanced by 5.47 dB.

A prototype antenna with central angle of α = 300° is designed, fabricated, and measured to validate the design approach. On the one hand, it is demonstrated that prototype antenna exhibits a single null scanning range from ϕ = 266° to 84°, which nearly covers half of the horizontal plane, within an available band ranging from 2.23 to 2.91GHz for null depth smaller than -10dB.

Our Spatio-Temporal Graph Attention Network (ST-GAT) fuses multimodal sensor data with HD map topology, explicitly quantifying both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties through deep ensembles. The framework compares real-time observations against predicted nominal behavior using three residual types (Raw, KL Divergence, CUSUM), achieving 93.7% fault detection accuracy with 1.13ms processing time across Camera, IMU, and LiDAR faults. Principal component analysis reduces the 540-dimensional residual space to 8 components while preserving 95% variance, enabling Random Forest classification with 200 trees. Feature importance analysis reveals Traffic Light Status Flag (29.7%) and CUSUM residuals as most discriminative, validating our hypothesis that sensor faults manifest as persistent accumulated deviations.

Leveraging existing detection coverage and SDC characteristics, we propose optimized SDC mitigation strategies that balance availability and reliability. These optimization strategies strive to achieve Shannon’s like bounds on the overhead required for reliable (meaning SDC mitigation) compute channels. While error-correcting codes effectively address transient faults in memory, storage, and high-speed links, residual SDC risks persist. We advocate for algorithm-based error detection (ABED) to bridge this gap and stress the need for ongoing ABED research to adapt to evolving compute patterns. Low-level fault simulation for SDC assessment in long-running jobs is impractical; instead, near-real-time evaluation is essential. Although our approach partially addresses systematic faults, robust design verification and manufacturing tests remain critical for comprehensive fault management. This work highlights the urgency of scalable, efficient SDC detection in large-scale systems."

    "abstract": "The core challenge of Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) lies in continuously learning new categories with extremely few samples without forgetting old knowledge. However, the performance of general FSCIL solutions is often limited when directly applied to the remote sensing domain. This limitation stems from two unique challenges of remote sensing images, namely complex and explicit spatial structural relationships and significant intra-class heterogeneity. Most existing methods fail to adequately model these characteristics. To address this issue, this paper proposes an efficient framework designed specifically for remote sensing scenarios, called TerraSAP. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, the framework systematically addresses the unique problems of remote sensing FSCIL through two core designs. First, to overcome the limitation of lacking spatial priors, we propose a Spatially-Aware Prompt Module. It explicitly injects the inherent spatial topological structure priors of remote sensing images into deep features through deterministic position encoding and attention mechanisms. Second, to overcome the learning difficulties caused by complex visual characteristics, we design a synergistic mechanism for new-class learning and knowledge retention. This mechanism includes two core parts. First, it enhances the learning efficiency for sparse new classes through an NCAC-based prototype initialization strategy. Second, it achieves a fine balance between retaining old knowledge and learning new knowledge with an innovative Dual-Path Exponential Moving Average (EMA) mechanism. Experimental results show that TerraSAP achieves an average accuracy of 84.52% on the NWPU-RESISC45 dataset, with a significant improvement in new-class learning ability. It also achieves efficient parameter utilization with a 47.10% reduction in total parameters, a 93.20% reduction in trainable parameters, and a 27.80% increase in inference speed."

    "abstract": "This manuscript investigates the use of different multi-loop voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) structures to mitigate single event effects (SEE). The first approach is a three-stage fully differential cross-coupled ring oscillator, designed with current regulation biasing to enhance supply noise rejection. The second is a fully differential current-mode logic (CML) multi-path ring oscillator with coarse/fine control. Both structures were fabricated in 28-nm FDSOI technology. The cross-coupled ring VCO exhibits enhanced performance when using the high-current configuration, showing a phase noise of -80.1 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset from the center frequency of 1.49 GHz and a figure of merit (FoM) of 140. Moreover, the CML multi-path VCO stands out as a high-performance structure with -93.4 dBc/Hz phase noise measured at 1 MHz offset from the 1.42 GHz carrier frequency and a FoM of 151. Single event effects (SEE) and total ionizing dose (TID) responses were evaluated using a 105 MeV proton beam and <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">60</sup>Co radiation, respectively. Experimental results demonstrated significant single event transient (SET) mitigation with both solutions, with the CML multi-path VCO exhibiting superior radiation tolerance with a maximum single event frequency transient (SEFT) of 4.2% and a maximum recovery time of 1.3 ns. Both designs showed high TID tolerance up to 300 krads."

    "abstract": "Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) is one of the leading causes of visual impairment globally. While blood tests are common approaches in developed countries, socioeconomic and public perspectives render this a challenge in developing countries. In Africa and Southeast Asia, the alarming rise of preventable childhood blindness and delayed growth rates has been classified as an \"epidemic\". With the proliferation of machine learning in clinical support systems and the relative availability of electronic health records, there is a potential promise of early detection to curb ocular complication progression. In this work, the aim is to observe the feasibility of detecting Vitamin A deficiency in children by utilizing existing records using machine learning techniques instead of requiring retinol serum tests. For this purpose, a heterogeneous tabular dataset consisting of 18,423 unique patient records across 25 features belonging to the non-invasive ocular symptomatology and ophthalmological diagnoses was acquired from a children’s hospital in Maradi, Nigeria. Extensive empirical comparisons between traditional machine learning and deep learning methods are provided with their corresponding interpretability through attributions and shapley values. The achieved results indicate that in the case of sparse datasets, after rectification for class imbalances using SMOTE-NC, Random Forest, Light Gradient Boosting Model achieved the highest balanced scores of accuracy: 86.0%, sensitivity: 81.8%, specificity: 86.4% and F1-score: 72.7% respectively. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is one of the first studies exploring the utility of routine eye examination records to screen for Vitamin A deficient individuals in a school-aged population. We conclude that machine learning can aid in identifying possible candidates for prioritized testing, dietary supplementation and treatment."

    "abstract": "To address the complexities of spatial non-stationary (SnS) effects and spherical wave propagation in near-field channel estimation (CE) for extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems, this paper proposes an SnS-aware CE framework based on adaptive subarray partitioning. We first investigate spherical wave propagation and various SnS characteristics and construct an SnS near-field channel model for XL-MIMO systems. Due to the limitations of uniform subarray patterns in capturing SnS, we analyze the adverse effects of the non-ideal array segmentation (over- and under-segmentation) on CE accuracy. To counter these issues, we develop a dynamic hybrid beamforming-assisted power-based subarray segmentation paradigm (DHBF-PSSP), which integrates power measurements with a dynamic hybrid beamforming structure to enable joint subarray partitioning and decoupling. A power-adaptive subarray segmentation (PASS) algorithm leverages the statistical properties of power profiles, while subarray decoupling is achieved via a subarray segmentation-based sampling method (SS-SM) under radio frequency (RF) chain constraints. For subarray CE, we propose a subarray segmentation-based assorted block sparse Bayesian learning algorithm under the multiple measurement vectors framework (SS-ABSBL-MMV). This algorithm exploits angular-domain block sparsity under a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebook and inter-subcarrier structured sparsity. Simulation results confirm that the proposed framework outperforms existing methods in CE performance."

    "abstract": "Magnetic microrobotic swarms are increasingly studied for their potential in precise motion control under complex and uncertain environments. One of the core challenges in swarm-level control lies in achieving accurate trajectory tracking in the presence of time-varying dynamic parameters, such as fluid resistance. To address such problem, we incorporate error integration into the swarms control framework and derive a kinematic model through model transformation. Based on this model, a Lyapunov-based adaptive robust control strategy is developed to ensure closed-loop stability and compensate for environmental uncertainties. The proposed controller dynamically adapts to unknown environmental variations, and rigorous theoretical analysis establishes the asymptotic stability of the system. A series of experiments are conducted on an electromagnetic actuation platform using silicone oil environments with different viscosities (5 cSt, 10 cSt, and 15 cSt) as well as under a rapidly varying viscosity generated by syringe pump to validate the method. Experimental results confirm that the proposed strategy enables the microrobotic swarm to achieve stable and precise trajectory tracking under varying resistance conditions, demonstrating its robustness and adaptability."

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement in information technology, embedded systems have become integral to a wide range of critical applications. These systems often require continuous operation and cannot tolerate the downtime associated with traditional software updates, which typically necessitate a system reboot. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel hotpatching technique called Flexible Linked EXecution (FLEX) designed specifically for real-time embedded environments. FLEX enables seamless, dynamic firmware updates by redirecting all function calls and global variable accesses through a compile time generated Control Flow Table (CFT). In contrast to existing hotpatching approaches that depend on specialized hardware or impose strict limits on the number of patches and their size, FLEX is entirely hardware independent and supports scalable patching capacity bounded only by available flash memory and RAM. FLEX offers several unique features, including a relaxed consistency state synchronization mechanism to allow for gradual migration of program state, resolving all symbols at compile time into CFT indirections, applying updates via a double-buffered pointer swap to a new CFT, and a XIP compatible process that guarantees only a short, bounded pause time regardless of patch complexity. Experimental results show that FLEX maintains system stability and performance with an average execution overhead of about 11% and a predictable increase in flash memory usage of roughly 17%. These findings suggest that FLEX offers a robust and flexible solution for dynamically updating the software of embedded systems to ensure high availability and security without sacrificing performance."

    "abstract": "Emotion and intent joint understanding in multimodal conversations (MC-EIU) aims to model the semantic dependencies among multimodal conversations while inferring emotion and intent information. Despite making progress, existing methods overlook the differential contributions of modalities and rely on single-round interactions for emotion and intent recognition, resulting in suboptimal model understanding performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose MEIPro, a novel progressive interaction and adaptive weight fusion based multimodal joint understanding of emotion and intent framework. We first design a hierarchical denoising module to effectively remove noise and redundant information from multimodal data. Then, we propose an adaptive weight fusion mechanism that dynamically fuses multimodal features by taking the true classification probabilities of each modality as their respective contributions, thus enhancing the fusion process. Additionally, we present a progressive dual task interaction module to capture the deep seated interactions between emotion and intent through a step-by-step multi-round iteration. Experiments on the benchmark MC-EIU bilingual dataset demonstrate that our MEI-Pro framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both emotion and intent tasks. Specifically, on the English dataset, the F1-scores of the multimodal emotion and intent understanding tasks have increased by 6.12% and 7.25% respectively."

Traditionally, disease detection in mango leaves relies on manual inspections by experts in different mango farms in the province of Guimaras, which is time-consuming, laborintensive, and prone to human error. Three machine learning and classification algorithms, namely Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and the Otsu algorithm, were used to compare the effectiveness in classifying mango diseases. The comparative analysis found that among the three classification algorithms, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model achieved the highest accuracy (90%), F1score (90 %), recall (90 %), and precision (90 %). It was followed by the SVM with an accuracy of 85.80 %, F1-score of 85.70 %, recall of 85.80 %, and precision of 85.90 %, and the Otsu algorithm with an accuracy of 59.90 %, F1-score of 59.50 %, recall of 59.90 %, and precision of 60 %. The results of the study will serve as a basis for developing a prediction system to detect mango diseases using leaf samples."

We apply the Partial-Multivariate Transformer (PMformer) to forecast daily returns for BTCUSDT and ETHUSDT, benchmarking it against eleven classical and deep learning models. Our empirical results yield two primary contributions. First, we demonstrate that the partial-multivariate strategy achieves significant statistical accuracy, effectively balancing informative signals with noise. Second, we experiment and discuss an observable disconnect between this statistical performance and practical trading utility; lower prediction error did not consistently translate to higher financial returns in simulations. This finding challenges the reliance on traditional error metrics and highlights the need to develop evaluation criteria more aligned with realworld financial objectives."

    "abstract": "In recent years, implicit neural representation of 3D scenes has evolved significantly and has been rapidly extended to multiple application scenarios. However, using this type of approach for highly dynamic urban scenes remains a challenging problem. Typical images of objects captured by cameras on board autonomous vehicles from one trajectory contains limited number of views, leading unsatisfactory reconstruction quality. To address this problem, we propose a novel hybrid network structure that decomposes the urban scene into a static background and multiple dynamic objects. The background model outputs a signed distance field with its accuracy enhanced by surface constraints. To deal with the issues of insufficient camera view we use a pre-training strategy to leverage shape and appearance prior to the object model from external datasets. We design an autoencoder architecture to encode a category of objects and employ an attention-based fusion module to better extract features from multiple object images. Furthermore, we introduce a “symmetric completion” approach to leverage the inherent symmetry property of normal cars. During experiments with data from Carla Platform, we find that our model can reconstruct scenes with high-fidelity, generate novel-view successfully and edit 3D scene freely."

To address this issue, this paper proposes a lightweight hybrid compressed convolutional neural network model based on improved multi-stage channel pruning and quantization-aware training (QAT). For the problem of sleep apnea detection on the Apnea-ECG dataset, the proposed method reduces model parameters by 24% while maintaining the same level of detection accuracy as the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method. This enhancement improves the balance between accuracy and hardware resources, providing a more efficient solution for deploying convolutional neural networks for sleep apnea detection on wearable devices."

The goal of this article is to analyze some preconditions for the successful inheritance of family companies from one generation to another on the basis of two factors: the positive intra-family attitude towards the inheritance of family businesses and the existence of national regulatory frameworks to regulate the inheritance. The objectives are: (1) to present basic legal documents from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Poland, Romania and Uzbekistan regulating the inheritance of family businesses, and (2) to present a comparative study on student responses from these countries as regards their intentions of having joint businesses with their relatives. The data has been collected by each co-author for the related country within the international academic network of INTERGEN in 2021 and 2023. The target groups were students and alumni from universities in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Poland, Romania and Uzbekistan; the number of respondents is 2496."

    "abstract": "Accurate water demand forecasting is crucial for sustainable resource management. State-of-the-art prediction methods building on machine- and deep learning perform well in capturing complex consumption patterns in time series data and provide accurate predictions. However, a major challenge for fresh water suppliers that has remained widely unaddressed so long, is how to transfer prediction models of different geographic regions to another area for which there is no specific knowledge or data available. We call this concept spatial transferability. Based on a real-world data set of ten regions in North-East Italy, we propose and compare different approaches to enable spatial transferability of prediction models. Our approaches build on the one hand on the aggregation of the available data sets, i.e. the combination of the different training inputs, and on the other hand on ensemble techniques, i.e. the combination of the different models' outputs. The underlying basic model types range from rather simple linear models to more complex ones, like long short term memory. Results show that by applying our proposed techniques, the induced transfer error can be kept below one percent on average."

    "abstract": "Clinical guidelines represent the “best” clinical procedures to manage patients affected by a specific disease, and are widely used to promote evidence-based medicine to standardize, improve and optimize clinical practice. In the Artificial Intelligence literature, many approaches to computerized clinical guidelines (CIGs) have been devised to provide physicians with decision support in the application of clinical guidelines to patients. Temporal constraints between actions (e.g., the duration of actions, the delay between them) are an essential part of many clinical guidelines, and a lot of attention has been devoted to their representation in CIGs systems. On the other hand, only few CIG systems have faced the related temporal reasoning issues, and none of them has faced them in a “realworld” context in which multiple instantiations of CIGs, on different patients, must be considered (e.g., to schedule the activities in a ward of an hospital). In this paper, we overcome such a limitation, proposing a temporal support (representation + reasoning) to deal with multiple CIG instantiations, which may be temporally related (e.g., to support the scheduling of shared resources). We take Asbru, one of the most widely used approaches in the CIG literature, as reference CIG formalism."

Therefore, this study aimed to design, simulate and implement a cocoa pod cracking machine with counter-rotating rollers and concave blades at an appropriate inclination angle, in order to reduce mechanical damage and improve the efficiency of bean extraction. To achieve this goal, structural and dynamic simulations were performed at ANSYS to evaluate the behavior of the blades at different angles. The angle that performed best was 60° because it produced the lowest maximum stress, reaching a safety factor of 4.2 in the dynamic simulation. Subsequently, experiments were carried out varying the size of the cocoa pod, the speed of the roller and the storage time. From these experiments, an average bean damage of 0.577% and an extraction efficiency of more than 96% was achieved. In addition, the overall test processed 192.2 kg of cobs, resulting in minimal grain damage of 0.333% and extraction efficiency of 96.71%. Therefore, our design proved to be efficient, low-impact, scalable, and suitable for industrial applications, with potential future improvements focused on fruit size sorting for further optimization"

This finding suggests that the use of digital technology in financial literacy training is effective in increasing acceptance and confidence in personal financial management. The discussion of the research results strengthens previous findings that digital financial literacy can improve financial management behavior, especially among vulnerable populations. The practical implications of this study are the importance of integrating digital technology into financial literacy programs to expand access and effectiveness of training. This study also underlines the need to develop application-based programs that are adaptive to the specific needs of migrant workers.

The preprocessed dataset is then split into training and testing sets to develop a reliable predictive model. A hybrid DL architecture combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and an attention mechanism is utilized to extract spatial-temporal features and focus on critical input parameters, thereby improving forecasting accuracy. Furthermore, model optimization is carried out using the Chimp Optimization Algorithm (ChOA), which efficiently tunes models hyperparameter by simulating intelligent search behavior.

    "abstract": "Online condition monitoring of medium-voltage cables is effectively performed through partial discharge (PD) detection. High-frequency current transformers (HFCT’s) have proven particularly suitable for this purpose. A previous study introduced a novel sensor concept using a flux concentrator, which enables highly sensitive PD measurements even when the sensor is positioned around a current-carrying medium-voltage cable, without driving the core into magnetic saturation. This flux concentrator combines the sensitivity of conventional HFCT’s with the high dynamic range of sensors such as Rogowski coils. This publication presents a theoretical study of the winding characteristics and core design aspects of inductive sensors. The winding characteristics are discussed based on modelling the parasitic elements in an equivalent circuit diagram. The analysis of the core is based on finite element method (FEM) simulations, focusing on a systematic variation of parameters that are difficult to adjust experimentally. The results obtained from the study provide a comparative evaluation of the flux concentrator design and traditional HFCT designs that feature either non-existent or small air gaps. The aim of this work is to highlight specific design considerations and optimization strategies for inductive sensors used in PD measurement applications within medium-voltage systems."

Stage 1 employs an enhanced Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) to produce a well-spread Pareto front of photovoltaic, battery-storage and hydrogen configurations under hourly dispatch. The resulting frontier spans €0.85–1.25 million NPC and 68–85 g CO<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf> kWh<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">⁻¹</sup> for a Mediterranean island case study (Formentera, Spain). Stage 2 ranks the nondominated solutions with the Square-Shape Slope Index (SSSI), a posteriori method that converts stakeholder cost-versuscarbon preferences into weights without rerunning the optimization. Using a carbon-aware weight, SSSI recommends a compromise design that raises NPC by only 4 % while lowering emissions by 5 % relative to the cost-optimal case. The workflow therefore delivers an intuitive, transparent and replicable benchmark for community-scale microgrid planning where economic and environmental priorities must be balanced explicitly."

    "abstract": "The distribution of irrigation water in the soil, in clay soil, is an important aspect for the effective irrigation of agricultural crops. Clay soils have particularities that must be considered in irrigation management, as these soils have a high-water retention capacity, but also slow drainage. When irrigation is carried out unevenly or too quickly, clay soil can absorb water only in their upper layers, which leads to excessive moisture accumulation. This can cause reduced water absorption in the root zone of plants and lead to moisture deficit for plants in deeper layers. In the present study, an experimental study was conducted to evaluate the moisture distribution process under the surface of irrigation wings under drip irrigation and perpendicular irrigation 24 hours after irrigation, using both soil and irrigation system parameters. The experiments were conducted on leached Cinnamon soil at an emitter flow rate of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$2 \\mathrm{l} / \\mathrm{h}$</tex> at four depths of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$0,0.20,0.40$</tex> and 0.60 m, where the active root system is located.

Methodologically, the study combines literature review, case study analysis, and comparative perspectives between fossil-based and renewable BRI projects. Beyond synthesizing existing evidence, the paper provides a novel comparative framework linking energy technology choices with geopolitical strategies and highlights digitalization and AI integration as emerging drivers of the Green BRI. Results indicate a growing portfolio of solar, wind, hydro, and nuclear projects, though challenges remain in financing, host-country readiness, and environmental governance. The paper concludes with policy recommendations for enhancing the “Green BRI” and aligning it with global climate goals."

A voltage sag of approximately 6% during thruster engagement caused a 23% reduction in illuminance and pronounced flicker, with 18-20% modulation depth and a Flicker Index of about 0.19. The corresponding chromaticity shift (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\Delta u^{\\prime} v^{\\prime} \\approx 0.0048$</tex>) was near the CIE just noticeable difference threshold, indicating borderline perceptibility for many observers. Although the voltage and frequency deviations remained within classification and IEC/IEEE limits, the lighting fluctuations were clearly visible to the crew. These findings demonstrate that transient power disturbances from large propulsion loads can produce perceptible flicker and colour instability, underscoring the need for flicker-resistant shipboard lighting and improved transient mitigation strategies."

In this paper, based on the study of cerebral impedance, we propose a blood perfusion calculation method based on the area of cerebral blood flow impedance to quantitatively characterize the blood perfusion in different brain regions, and analyze the changes of blood perfusion in bilateral frontal-parietal lobe brain regions under different brain functional activity states. The results showed that the blood perfusion in the frontal lobe was significantly larger than that in the parietal lobe, the blood perfusion in the left frontal lobe was larger than that in the right frontal lobe, and the recovery of blood perfusion in the frontal lobe was slower than that in the parietal lobe. The results show that the method proposed in this paper can realize the effective quantification of blood perfusion in different brain regions and reflect the differences in blood perfusion under different brain functional activity states, and is sensitive to the changes in blood perfusion in different populations and under different brain functional states. It realizes the assessment of brain blood supply status and correlation analysis with brain functional activity characteristics."

    "abstract": "Dual-energy material decomposition enables differentiation of soft tissue and bone in X-ray imaging; however, conventional methods require two sequential exposures, increasing radiation dose, acquisition time, and the risk of misregistration. This study presents a single-exposure material decomposition method using a cadmium telluride (CdTe)-based photon-counting detector (PCD) integrated with digital tomosynthesis (DTS). The proposed framework consists of three key steps: 1) simultaneous acquisition of low- and high-energy projections with dual thresholds (25 and 65 keV), 2) calibration-based decomposition using a PMMA–Al wedge phantom, and 3) projection-domain material separation followed by DTS reconstruction. Validation through both simulation and experimental studies demonstrated accurate separation of soft-tissue and bone components, high projection-level decomposition precision (RMSE: 0.052 for PMMA; 0.012 for Al), and improved perceptual image quality (SSIM: 0.979 and 0.974; PSNR: 37.6 and 38.6 dB). Compared with conventional energy-integrating detector (EID)-based dual-energy methods, the proposed PCD-based approach achieved superior structural preservation, contrast uniformity, and image interpretability. Beyond chest imaging, this single-exposure PCD framework is also applicable to non-medical X-ray applications, such as industrial nondestructive testing, security screening, and material characterization."

    "abstract": "CI/CD pipelines have become an integral part of today's software development processes, where they help in rapid integration and deployment of code changes. Despite that, they are associated with long execution times, flaky tests and high resource consumption which lead them to become less efficient. Even with state of the art AI driven optimizations, developers frequently need to rerun pipelines to diagnose and correct problems, which results in time being wasted while waiting for pipeline execution to finish and unnecessary resource consumptions. These inefficiencies slow down the development cycle and increase the cost of infrastructure, making CI/CD less effective at scale. This paper introduces the AI Twin Pipeline, a predictive system that simulates CI/CD execution outcomes before running the actual pipeline. By analyzing past pipeline executions and applying predictive modeling, it identifies potential failure points, offers corrective insights to address detected issues, and estimates the execution time of the actual CI/CD pipeline. Developers can debug and resolve issues upfront, reducing unnecessary pipeline runs and improving development efficiency. Unlike existing AI-optimized CI/CD solutions that focus on optimizations after the pipeline is triggered, the AI Twin Pipeline proactively identifies failures before triggering CI/CD thus, minimizing redundant submissions and optimizing resource utilization. This novel approach empowers developers with faster feedback, ensuring more reliable code submissions while significantly improving CI/CD pipeline performance."

This research proposes a new approach i.e. an Optimal SVM-BAT Algorithm which offers a revolutionary method of stock market prediction using real-time stock market data from Yahoo Finance (YFinance). The Bat Algorithm is used to optimize the hyper parameters and the power of SVM for regression to achieve an objective to forecast stock values for the upcoming 365 days. SVM is a powerful Machine Learning method, used to simulate how past stock data, including volume, high, low, opening, and closing prices relates to future price changes. The Bat Algorithm, a bio-inspired optimization method, is used to fine-tune the SVM model's hyper parameters, enhancing prediction accuracy. The model's performance is evaluated by predicting stock prices for a one-year horizon (365 days). The results are visualized using time-series graphs to compare predicted vs. actual values. This hybrid method showcases the potential of combining Machine Learning techniques with optimization algorithms for time-series forecasting, providing a powerful tool for investors and traders in anticipating stock market trends and making informed decisions."

    "abstract": "Modern power distribution systems face significant challenges, including voltage violations and active power losses, due to the high penetration of renewable energy sources (RESs). Conventional voltage regulation devices are slow and constrained by operational limitations while existing Volt/VAR Control (VVC) techniques for reactive power compensation primarily rely on model-based optimization approaches. In contrast, model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods, such as Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), can adapt to changing grid conditions. However, DDPG suffers from Q-value overestimation and unstable learning issues, leading to suboptimal control policies. To address these challenges, a Multi-Agent Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MA-TD3) technique is proposed in this paper to optimize the setpoints of modern voltage control devices. By leveraging twin critics with delayed policy updates, MA-TD3 enhances learning stability and mitigates overestimation bias. The distribution network is partitioned into sub-areas, with each sub-area formulated as a Markov game and solved cooperatively using MA-TD3. The proposed approach is validated on a modified IEEE 33-bus system, demonstrating superior performance over existing DRL methods in minimizing voltage violations and active power losses."

    "abstract": "In the healthcare sector, federated learning (FL) presents a promising framework for building collaborative machine learning models without the need to exchange sensitive patient data. Despite its potential, conventional aggregation methods like Federated Averaging (FedAvg) often fall short when dealing with data disparities across participating institutions. This study proposes a modified aggregation algorithm, Weighted Initial Federated Averaging (WIFA), designed to overcome these limitations. WIFA introduces a weighting approach that considers both the similarity of local models to the global model and the relative size of each institution's dataset. This method ensures more balanced contributions during aggregation, even in the presence of data imbalance and diversity. The approach is evaluated using dental radiographic datasets to assess its performance in detecting various oral health conditions. Results indicate that WIFA outperforms standard FedAvg by producing models with improved generalization, accuracy, and resilience to non-uniform data distributions. Furthermore, WIFA adheres to privacy standards, making it suitable for real-world applications in medical diagnostics. WIFA advances the applicability of decentralized machine learning in clinical and research settings."

A total of 10 participants responded to lane deviation events throughout three sessions of driving in a driving simulator, which are regular driving, fatigue driving brought on by extended cognitive demands and post-rest driving conducted after finishing both the fatigue driving session and a controlled Power Nap. Lane deviation events were simulated by controlled steering wheel perturbation. Subjects' reaction time to lane deviation events were used as an indicator of fatigue level. We minimized sleep inertia by monitoring sleep stages and ensuring naps stayed in non-deep sleep phases using an EEG-based Powernap mobile application.

    "abstract": "This paper presents an optimal formation adaptive control methodology for a class of heterogeneous, heterodimensional second-order nonlinear multi-agent systems (MASs). Firstly, each agent, despite having nonidentical dimensions, is modeled using a second-order dynamic with its position and velocity. A novel concept of a similar combination for heterogeneous MASs with different dimensions is defined. This defines similarity vectors or matrices between the leader and followers, derived from the structural similarities within the system. Through a predefined mapping transformation based on these similarity vectors or matrices, the followers' states can be transformed to align with the leader's dimension, enabling coherent control design. Secondly, the conventional fuzzy logic system (FLS) is enhanced by incorporating a non-zero adaptive parameter, improving its approximation flexibility. The unknown nonlinear continuous functions in the system dynamics are expressed as a combination of homogeneous functions, each of which is approximated using the proposed modified FLS structure. This approach allows the approximation accuracies of the FLSs to be adjusted in real time via the designed adaptive laws, significantly enhancing the controller's performance in the presence of uncertainties. Finally, the simulation example demonstrates that the agents achieve the desired time-varying formation under the influence of the developed optimal adaptive control scheme, even in the presence of nonidentical dimensions."

    "abstract": "a wireless sensor network (WSN) is a network of several interconnected sensor nodes designed to monitor environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, and pressure. However, one of their most critical challenges is energy limitation. Since sensor nodes are often deployed in inaccessible environments and typically operate on limited battery power, recharging or replacing them is not feasible. To overcome this challenge, we propose a hybrid Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Cat-Salp Swarm (CSSA) algorithm, referred to as GAC-SSA for energy-efficient clustering and multi-hop routing approach in WSN. In this approach, we used GA for clustering, while CSSA is used for efficient multi-hop routing. Through the use of GA’s strong global exploration proficiency in conjunction with the effective local exploitation potential of the CSSA, the proposed approach reduces energy consumption and enhances network lifetime more effectively. Simulation outcomes conducted in MATLAB demonstrate that our proposed method GAC-SSA significantly outperforms existing techniques, including independent GECR and a hybrid methods such as LEACH-GA, LEACH-CSSA, and GA-PSO. In particular, our approach achieves longer network lifetime, lower energy consumption, higher residual energy, and improved throughput, making it a promising solution for energy-constrained WSNs."

    "abstract": "This paper presents an approach for predicting the near-field electromagnetic (EM) scattering of complex targets coated with anisotropic media, utilizing the physical optics (PO) method. In this method, the PO near-field integral representation is derived by using the Green's function for localized expansions, which allows for a more efficient and accurate representation of the scattering problem. The Green's function formulation is critical in solving the EM field interactions at the surface of the target, where the anisotropic coating significantly alters the behavior of the incident and scattered waves. To calculate the reflection coefficient of the anisotropic media-coated targets, the spectral domain approach is employed, in combination with boundary conditions, along with the PO near-field integral representation. This hybrid method enables an effective analysis of the near-field EM scattering phenomena for targets covered with anisotropic coatings. The use of spectral domain techniques allows for the decomposition of the scattered field into manageable components, simplifying the complex interactions between the incident field and the anisotropic material. Compared to traditional numerical methods, the results show that the proposed approach is both computationally efficient and accurate, reducing the computational resources and time required for the analysis. Furthermore, the proposed method can easily be extended to analyze electrically large and complex objects, especially in scenarios involving anisotropic coatings. This makes the approach particularly valuable for real-world applications in areas such as radar cross-section (RCS) analysis, where complex target geometries and material properties need to be considered. Overall, the method provides a reliable and scalable solution for near-field EM scattering analysis in complex coated structures."

    "abstract": "In Senegal, rice cultivation plays a key role in food self-sufficiency and rural development. However, several obstacles stand in their way: pests, four-legged animals and, above all, harmful birds (quelea quelea). These birds are responsible for colossal yield losses. Farmers use archaic methods to deter them, which are often ineffective or costly, and do not provide constant protection. Faced with this endemic problem, an innovative technological solution is proposed, combining the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence and Edge computing. The system is based on a network of microphones capable of capturing sound anywhere in the rice paddy, and above all, continuously. Bird songs can be specifically identified thanks to real-time analysis of the recorded sounds made possible by on-board AI models. This solution allows for very low latency and fast, autonomous detection without requiring a constant internet connection. The system assists in bird deterrence by quickly and accurately identifying their presence. This intelligent system helps to reduce crop losses, sustainably improve agricultural productivity and enhance precision farming."

Our paper introduces a modular hardware solution for SPE performance evaluation utilizing Microcontrollers (MCU) and the flexPTP MCU Precision Time Protocol (PTP) implementation. We investigate the standard 100BASE-TX Ethernet and compare it to the automotive 100BASE-T1, 10BASE-T1S, and the long-range industrial 10BASE-T1L Ethernet with a PI and a Kalman filter servo algorithm. Our investigation shows that 100BASE-T1 offers significantly better accuracy and precision than the others; 100BASE-TX follows it in performance, and the 10BASE-T1L and 10BASE-T1 offer the worst timing performance."

The MPSO algorithm is an enhanced version of the standard particle swarm optimization (SPSO) technique, designed to improve performance by incorporating stagnation and aggressive mutation strategies, supplementing in avoiding premature convergence and amplifying the exploitation. In this method, a mathematical framework is established to guide the parameter optimization process. An objective function, based on the sum of squared errors (SSE) between the experimental and estimated voltage values, is constructed to facilitate optimal parameter estimation. The MPSO algorithm is then employed to determine the parameters for Nedstack PS6 fuel cell stack. The results are compared with several well-known optimization algorithms from the literature and the standard PSO. The comparative analysis demonstrates that the proposed MPSO algorithm outperforms others in terms of accuracy, search efficiency, and convergence speed.

First, the dynamic motion of the two-link robot is simulated using a differential equation. Next, the control design methodology is presented, beginning with the integration of a radial basis function neural network to approximate the lumped dynamic functions of the system. A stability analysis is then carried out using a proposed barrier Lyapunov function. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed control approach."

    "abstract": "The permanent magnet synchronous motor is widely used in industrial control, transportation, medical equipment, etc. due to its high power density, high efficiency, and small size. In the vector control of the three-phase permanent magnet synchronous motor, the traditional PI control has fixed parameters and cannot be adjusted in real-time in dynamic systems, which may cause large overshoots and slower response speed, etc. Fuzzy PI control can effectively improve the disadvantages of traditional PI control, such as poor anti-interference ability. However, the initial control parameters and fuzzy control rules of fuzzy PI control are too dependent on experience, so this paper proposes a fuzzy PI controller optimized by an improved genetic algorithm. The simulation was carried out using MATLAB/Simulink software, and the images of speed regulation, electromagnetic torque, and three-phase current were compared and analyzed before and after optimization. Finally, it was found that the fuzzy PI controller optimized by the improved genetic algorithm has good simulation effects compared to the traditional PI controller, which meets the requirements of high control precision, fast response speed, small overshoot, and strong anti-interference ability for the three-phase permanent magnet synchronous motor."

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have gained traction in offline RL owing to their multi-modal inference and generalisation. To improve time efficiency for broader RL settings, consistency models (CMs) have been adopted as one-step policies. However, most CM-based policies include the vanilla consistency loss in the actor objective and weight all replay transitions equally, which can silently induce distribution drift by updating on historical out-of-distribution (OOD) data. We propose MAW-CT, a masked advantage-weighted consistency training method that preserves the stabilising role of consistency while suppressing OOD updates. Inspired by group relative policy optimisation (GRPO) and leveraging the batch-sampling capability of CMs, MAW-CT assigns relative advantage-based weights by comparing peer actions within a batch and applies a reconstruction-ratio mask to filter drifted replay actions. On three standard MuJoCo locomotion tasks (Hopper-v3, HalfCheetah-v3, Humanoid-v3), MAW-CT consistently outperforms TD3 and CM-TD3; it is competitive with Diffusion-TD3 while exhibiting lower training variance and reduced computational requirements. These results indicate improved sample efficiency and robustness for CM-based online RL."

Firstly, perform a state transformation using the system property of differential flatness, and transform the motion planning problem between the initial point and the target point in the state space into a curve interpolation of the differential flatness output with relevant boundary conditions satisfied. Then, a polynomial interpolation approach is adopted to derive the optimization problem for minimum-time motion planning, which is solved based on the bisection method and particle swarm optimization algorithm to obtain the minimum-time motion trajectory. On that basis, the system’s dynamic characteristics and non-minimum phase property are thoroughly analyzed to design an effective trajectory tracking controller for tracking the reference optimal trajectory, thus the fast swing-up control of the inertia wheel pendulum system can be achieved. Finally, the proposed method is verified with simulation test and compared with a direct swing-up controller without motion planning. The test results demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of the proposed method, and the swing-up time under related system constraints can be decreased significantly."

First, an iterative one-sided search (IOSS) is developed to jointly optimize the configuration for each subarray, achieving rapid convergence. To further reduce training overhead, we also introduce a hierarchical angle-position search (HAPS), which offers performance comparable to IOSS with even lower complexity. Numerical results demonstrate that MSAs achieve gains of 39% over traditional fixed subarrays (FSAs) with exhaustive search. Our proposed IOSS algorithm secures a 42% gain, while HAPS achieves a comparable gain of 33%. These findings highlight the significant potential of MSAs."

Extensive experimental results on both public and private datasets demonstrate that PLPO-KF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art point-based and point-line-based VIO systems.

This research proposes a novel advanced fusion-based deep learning framework that integrates multimodal hand tremor data specifically, kinematic signals from accelerometers and gyroscopes, spiral drawing images, and video-based hand motion recordings to enhance robust and generalizable PD diagnosis with significant potential for early-stage detection. Specialized neural subnetworks are employed to analyze each modality: stacked LSTM layers for temporal sensor data, 2D CNNs for spatial characteristics from spiral drawings, and 3D CNNs for spatio-temporal video evaluation. The extracted feature representations are unified in a cohesive architecture and trained end-to-end using a Hybrid GRU-LSTNet model enhanced with a Bottleneck Attention Module (BAM). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms both unimodal deep learning approaches and traditional machine learning benchmarks, accomplishing an accuracy of 94.0%, precision of 93.8%, recall of 94.2%, and F1-score of 94.0%.

    "abstract": "Achieving reliable fault diagnosis of aero-engine gas path systems under dynamic operating conditions remains a critical challenge due to domain shifts across varying working states. To address this issue, we propose a Robust Continual Domain Adaptation Framework (RCDAF) that enables stable knowledge retention and adaptive transfer across a sequence of target domains. The framework initially leverages joint cross entropy and supervised contrastive loss to enhance intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. A memory buffer is then built to preserve logits, labels, and raw inputs from the source domain, facilitating the replay of knowledge. To mitigate feature distribution shifts during continual adaptation, we introduce a Controllable Batch Normalization (CBN) mechanism. Furthermore, a restraining past loss and dual-knowledge distillation loss are proposed to constrain representation drift while maintaining output consistency and discriminative capability. To address feature uncertainty, conditional entropy minimization is applied, and a pseudo-supervised contrastive (PSC) loss is designed to enable robust class-wise alignment, especially under label imbalance and pseudo-label noise. Lastly, a dynamic buffer update strategy ensures the continual evolution of stored knowledge. Comprehensive experiments on multi-domain aero-engine datasets validate the robustness and adaptability of RCDAF in complex, non-stationary diagnostic scenarios."

To address this, a 2-D precisely controllable SAR smart jamming method based on dual-template joint modulation (PC-DTJM) is proposed in this paper. By introducing a dual-template joint modulation mechanism, the PC-DTJM method enables the precise control of jamming amplitude, quantity, position, and coverage, delivering versatile jamming effects. This method can generate both barrage jamming and deceptive jamming effects. Specifically, the method utilizes prior information about the ROIs to predefine an amplitude modulation template and a coverage modulation template. Through the definition of range-position modulation factors and azimuth-position modulation factors, precise control over jamming positions is achieved. Furthermore, an amplitude modulation factor is defined based on the amplitude modulation template, enabling high controllability of jamming amplitude and quantity. Finally, a 2-D coverage factor is defined based on the coverage modulation template, allowing flexible control over the jamming coverage area. Additionally, the characteristics of the jamming, including amplitude, quantity, position, and coverage, are analyzed in detail. The impact of system parameter errors on jamming performance is also investigated, confirming the robustness and stability of the PC-DTJM method. Extensive simulations and comparative experiments validate that the proposed method achieves precise control over jamming amplitude, quantity, position, and coverage, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of the PC-DTJM method."

    "abstract": "The integration of overlay technology with Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer (SWIPT) presents a promising solution to enhance and extend space-air-ground communications for next-generation wireless networks. This article explores an overlay-based Space-Air-Ground Integrated Network (SAGIN) architecture, encompassing a ground-to-satellite (G2S) network and an aerial network constrained by both energy and spectrum. Through this integration, overlay technology enables efficient spectrum utilization by allowing the aerial network to opportunistically access licensed spectrum without interfering with G2S operations. The aerial transmitter (ATx) leverages SWIPT-based battery-assisted non-linear energy harvesting, where it collects energy from incoming signals from the ground node and utilizes the harvested energy to relay signals to the satellite and the aerial receiver (ARx). By addressing the relevant stochastic positioning of the ground nodes, ARx, and satellite, we evaluate the performance of both the G2S and air-to-air (A2A) networks. Our analysis incorporates Shadowed-Rician fading for the satellite link, Nakagami-m fading for the ground link, and Rician fading for the aerial link. We derive analytical expressions for the outage probability and throughput, offering insights into key design parameters that promote energy-efficient and spectrum-efficient network configurations. Finally, Monte Carlo simulations verify the theoretical findings and lay practical guidelines for the development of future SAGINs."

This paper presents the creation of a miniaturised soft tissue stiffness sensor with dimensions that make it suitable for palpation in minimally invasive surgery. We introduce the stiffness sensor design and experimentally test its force sensing, elasticity measurement, and dynamic palpation performance. The sensor can measure normal forces with an adjustable range. Angled forces were measured with their magnitude and angles, θY and θX, root-mean-square errors (RMSE) of 8.37%, 6.68%, and 13.92% of their respective ranges. Furthermore, samples with an elasticity between 4.20 kPa and 177.62 kPa, which were not in the training set, were measured with an RMSE of 7.79% of the tested range. During palpation, the boundary between the 13.4 kPa elastomer and the 2 mm embedded 29.3 kPa elastomer was located with a signal-noise ratio (SNR) of 77.04:1 and a mean offset of 0.706 mm. This investigation provides new insights into sensing devices capable of fitting trocars while measuring tissue elasticity and force during minimally invasive procedures."

    "abstract": "Open spina bifida (OSB), a congenital anomaly caused by incomplete spinal column closure, leads to progressive nerve damage. While multi-port minimally invasive procedures are being optimized clinically, single-port access (SPA) surgery presents a promising, less invasive alternative. Beyond reducing scarring, SPA may also decrease the risk of iatrogenic preterm premature rupture of membranes and enhance maternal recovery, as suggested by outcomes in other minimally invasive interventions. However, technical challenges persist in SPA implementations, particularly in instrument miniaturization and control precision. To facilitate this approach, a macro-micro multi-arm robotic system is under development. The system features an 11-mm-diameter insertion port to deploy four instrument arms. The arm design incorporates a hybrid backbone structure. A macro proximal section of concentric tubes provides stable deployment, while a micro distal flexible segment enables the dexterous manipulation. This paper presents dedicated modeling and control strategies to address actuator and transmission nonlinearities arising from stringent miniaturization requirements. A hybrid framework combining joint-level feedback with deep-learning-based feedforward compensation mitigates limitations imposed by pneumatic artificial muscles and tendon transmissions. The system is validated through trajectory-following experiments, each conducted over 10 trials. Preliminary results show an average root-mean-squared error of 0.28 mm, an average maximum absolute error of 0.85 mm, and an average standard deviation of 0.18 mm across both trajectories. These results demonstrate consistent sub-millimeter precision, satisfying the requirement for OSB repair. The feasibility of the system was then verified through a phantom study."

    "abstract": "Dynamic low altitude networks offer significant potential for efficient and reliable data transport via unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) relays which usually operate with pre-determined trajectories. However, it is challenging to optimize the data routing and resource allocation due to the time-varying topology and the need to control interference with terrestrial systems. Traditional schemes rely on time-expanded graphs with uniform and fine time subdivisions, making them impractical for interference-aware applications. This paper develops a dynamic space-time graph model with a cross-layer optimization framework that converts a joint routing and predictive resource allocation problem into a joint bottleneck path planning and resource allocation problem. We develop explicit deterministic bounds to handle the channel uncertainty and prove a monotonicity property in the problem structure that enables us to efficiently reach the globally optimal solution to the predictive resource allocation subproblem. Then, this approach is extended to multi-commodity transmission tasks through time-frequency allocation, and a bisection search algorithm is developed to find the optimum solution by leveraging the monotonicity of the feasible set family. Simulations verify that the single commodity algorithm approaches global optimality with more than 30 dB performance gain over the classical graph-based methods for delay-sensitive and large data transportation. At the same time, the multi-commodity method achieves 100X improvements in dense service scenarios and enables an additional 20 dB performance gain by data segmenting."

In large-scale deployments where user demand exceeds system capacity, effective user admission control (UAC) is essential to select users while meeting quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. The UAC problem in CF-mMIMO is inherently challenging, involving both discrete user selection and continuous power allocation variables. To address this challenge, we propose a Graphormer-enhanced Monte Carlo Tree Search (GE-MCTS) framework that integrates a Graphormer-based neural network (NN) with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). This framework leverages the Graphormer’s capability to model the graph-structured AP–user topology and MCTS’s planning proficiency to efficiently explore the vast decision space. Furthermore, to accommodate users initially unadmitted due to system constraints, we introduce a complementary AP deployment problem. By adapting the GE-MCTS framework, we optimize the placement of additional APs to achieve full user admission with the minimal number of new APs required. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. For UAC, with low computational complexity, GE-MCTS consistently admits 26.3–41.7% more users compared to baseline methods across various network scales. For AP deployment, our framework requires 45–73% fewer additional APs to achieve full user admission, highlighting its efficiency and scalability."

    "abstract": "High-voltage solid-state nanosecond pulse generators are gaining attraction for industrial applications that require fast, high-frequency, repetitive, and fully controllable pulses. However, the limited voltage rating of individual solid-state switches remains a key challenge. For ultrafast switching, series-connecting metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) address this but can introduce complexity in gate driving, voltage sharing, cost, size, losses, and switching speed. To address these challenges, this article presents a compact, ultrafast-switching, gate-boosted, series-connected MOSFET topology for use in high-voltage nanosecond pulsed applications. A novel gate-drive approach is proposed, where only the first MOSFET is driven directly, and the rest are triggered via capacitive coupling, enhanced with a gate-boosting technique for faster switching. This improves pulse rise time and reduces switching losses. To enhance the performance of the proposed topology, three versions of the gate-boosted driver and high-voltage switch layout were comparatively evaluated. Based on this comparison, a compact layout was optimized for the high-voltage switch and its gate-boosted driver, achieving the fastest rise times with improved output pulse quality. Simulation and experimental results verify the effectiveness of the optimized layout and gate-driving approach, enabling ultrafast and reliable operation for pulse durations of 20 ns and higher. At 10 kV and a load current of 45.5 A, rise times of 2.8 ns (3.57 kV/ns) for voltage and 2.5 ns for current were achieved, demonstrating excellent ultrafast switching performance. Furthermore, by introducing a two-stage gate-boosting method for high-current applications, current rise rates of up to 60.3 kA/<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mu $</tex-math> </inline-formula>s at 187 A were obtained."

AIME–PSO achieved validity and plausibility of 1.000 for both the Sangiovese and Synthetic-2 datasets, with moderate distances (0.601 for Sangiovese and 0.389 for Synthetic-2). In Synthetic-1, strong variable dependencies reduced validity (0.675).

This paper investigates the coexistence of aerial uplink (UL) and ground downlink (DL) communications in dynamic Time-Division Duplexing (D-TDD) systems, where UL transmissions from aerial users introduce severe interference to the DL transmissions of TN users. To address the issue of user-to-user interference (UL-DL) in A2G system, this work proposes a novel Codebook-Based Interference Mitigation (CBIM) framework that incorporates a sliding codebook approach for radio frame configuration (RFC) selection and a dynamic subframe swapping mechanism to resolve subframe misalignments and reduce interference. By optimizing subframe arrangements, the framework effectively minimizes interference while improving resource utilization. Simulation results demonstrate the framework’s effectiveness, achieving a 20.37% reduction in interference and a 28.21% increase in throughput, establishing CBIM as a robust and efficient solution for the future TN-NTN integration in next-generation communication systems."

Additionally, group conformity introduces popularity bias, causing systems to over-recommend frequent POIs while overlooking long-tail interests. To address these issues, we propose DCDST, a novel framework that combines dual-channel disentangled contrastive learning with adaptive spatio-temporal encoding. Specifically, we introduce a spatio-temporal bias-aware self-attention mechanism that dynamically models contextual dependencies within user trajectories. Simultaneously, a dual-channel contrastive learning module generates adversarial views through group-level augmentation and individual-specific perturbation. A conformity-aware loss function is employed to disentangle shared group behaviors from personalized preferences, enabling better long-tail interest modeling and mitigating popularity bias. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that DCDST consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and recommendation diversity.

    "abstract": "With the rapid growth of the internet and digital economy, fraudulent activities have grown more sophisticated, leading to substantial social and financial costs. Graph-based fraud detection provides an effective framework by modeling entities as nodes and interactions as edges. However, the prevalent heterophily (target nodes exhibit distinct labels from neighbors) and heterogeneity (multi-typed nodes/edges) in fraud graphs cause traditional graph neural networks to lose critical anomaly signals during message passing. Existing methods handle heterophily and heterogeneity in isolation: heterophily mitigation relies on static grouping strategies, while heterogeneity handling predominantly adopts adaptive weighting mechanisms. Yet neither systematically models their synergistic effects, limiting hierarchical pattern capturing capabilities. This paper proposes HHGFD, a synergistic framework integrating reinforcement learning-driven dynamic grouping with hierarchical attention aggregation. We formulate grouping decisions as a Markov process through reinforcement learning, optimizing grouping boundaries via real-time feedback. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical attention aggregation framework: node-level self-attention learns cross-type feature importance weights to emphasize fraud-relevant attributes, while relation-level attention dynamically allocates semantic weights for heterogeneous edges. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method."

    "abstract": "Accurate traffic sign recognition (TSR) is critical for autonomous vehicles, especially in diverse driving environments. While datasets such as the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) have been extensively studied, limited attention has been paid to specific regional challenges, especially in Malaysia. This study explores traffic sign recognition in Malaysia using a composite-scale convolutional neural network (EfficientNet). The Malaysian Traffic Sign (MTS) dataset contains signs with cultural uniqueness, language, and design differences, which are underexplored compared to global datasets. EfficientNet-B5 was selected for its balance between accuracy and efficiency. Enhancements including image resizing, architecture depth expansion, and data augmentation were applied. Results show that EfficientNet-B5 achieves significant improvements, especially on the MTS dataset, demonstrating the potential for scalable, real-time TSR for autonomous driving systems in Malaysia."

    "abstract": "Low operational efficiency, high maintenance costs, and limited availability of real-time information represent persistent challenges in industrial sectors that have not yet adopted process digitalization. In response to this issue, the present study aims to design and implement a technological system focused on the digitalization of an industrial process to automatically determine the Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) indicator. The developed architecture integrates elements of industrial automation and Industry 4.0 technologies. Siemens LOGO! and Mitsubishi FX5U programmable logic controllers (PLCs) were used to capture process variables, along with a Lowcost IoT Gateway and Node-RED for data extraction from the PLCs. Additionally, InfluxDB and Grafana were used for realtime data storage and visualization of performance indicators. The system was validated through the implementation of the IIoT architecture, which operated with a virtual production line representing the dosing and weighing process, where $\\mathbf{2, 9 3 2}$ products were generated. The key performance indicators (KPIs) obtained included $\\mathbf{8 9. 4 \\%}$ Availability, $\\mathbf{9 7. 7 \\%}$ Performance, $\\mathbf{1 0 0 \\%}$ Quality, and an OEE of 87.4%. These results demonstrate the system’s capability to acquire and process reliable real-time information, reduce downtime, optimize resource usage, and improve decision-making accuracy. The proposed solution contributes significantly to the digital transformation of the industrial sector, promoting more efficient, sustainable, and datadriven production environments."

This study explores the application of Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks (KAN) in the domain of renewable energy prediction. KAN, inspired by the Kolmogorov–Arnold representation theorem, replace traditional linear weights in multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) with spline functions, enhancing model interpretability. Unlike conventional black-box models, KAN offer significant explanatory capabilities. We conducted experiments using real-world wind and photovoltaic power output data from Shandong Province, China. The results demonstrate that KAN outperform benchmark models, including MLPs and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, in most scenarios, while also providing superior interpretability. These findings suggest that KAN hold substantial potential for practical applications in renewable energy forecasting."

Machine learning methods provide new opportunities for precipitation prediction. However, due to complex factors, forecasting extreme precipitation in the basin remains a formidable challenge. In this paper, based on the extensive feature engineering, an ensemble learning framework is proposed for forecasting extreme precipitation in basins. In particular, a meta-learned method based on stacked generalization is adopted for ensemble forecasting by constructing a two-layer prediction model and feeding the prediction results of the basic classifiers (layer 0 models) into a layer 1 model. The results of forecast experiments on Dongjiang river basin show that our method is more effective then traditional time series methods, single machine learning models, and even deep learning time series model."

    "abstract": "Planar RFIDs have found diverse object detection and tracking applications in various fields from object detection to life detection. The RFID system consists of a reader as the transmitter and several tags as receivers. The reader will be continuously sending the interrogating pulses and the tags will respond to the signals from the reader by backscattering the inputted wave. The distance of retransmission will depend on the properties of the resonator like, the depth of scattering parameters and the Quality factor of the RFID resonators. In certain cases duplication of the resonators could double the transmission range compromising the increased size of the tag. The operation of planar RFID tags is closely related to the resonant frequency of the resonators within the tag. Resonance occurs when the electrical length of the antenna is an integer multiple of the wavelength associated with the operating frequency. The electric field characteristics of the tag has a direct impact on the read range of the RFID tag. By optimizing the design of the tag and based on the wavelength of the tag, the read range could be improved. Passive RFID tags working on backscattering principles do not have an internal power source and they utilize the energy from the electromagnetic field generated from the reader to power up and communicate. The sensing capability of these sensors is due to the high electric field when excited at the resonant frequency and is one of the important parameters that determines the range of the passive RFID tag. The electric field analysis of a printed planar 4 bit RFID tag for sensing application is discussed in the paper. The tags are excited at the respective resonant frequencies and the field variation of the excited resonator is identified. The resonators are capable of generating high electric fields thus are capable of long range communication depending upon the reader."

    "abstract": "The rising trend of Internet of Things (IoT) devices requires the creation of sustainable means for their power supply. One of the most viable means of addressing this is the radio frequency (RF) energy harvesting process, whereby ambient electromagnetic waves are captured and harnessed into usable direct current (DC) electricity. The method has great prospects for powering small, self-sustaining sensors and identification systems. However, conventional RF harvesters face several constraining impediments. The devices often exhibit efficiencies at very low levels of power (less than $-\\mathbf{3 5 ~ d B m}$) and are prone to leakage currents for multi-stage rectifiers, besides facing significant losses from adaptive control circuitries. Such drawbacks can substantially degrade the total power conversion efficiency (PCE). The review herein presents an extensive analysis of possible means for mitigating these drawbacks through the concurrent design of the impedance matching circuitries and the rectifiers. The review considers several approaches, including low-power reflectionmatched matching circuitries, sensitive Dickson-type rectifiers, novel cross-coupled differential driver designs, and hybrid system topologies. Using analytical discourse, the paper presents pertinent insight for the design of new-generation RF energy harvesters with the possibility of achieving high levels of sensitivity and efficiency. The improvements are of particular importance for far-field IoT and bio-medical applications, whereby devices are usually expected to operate on only several microwatts of power."

This paper proposes an enhanced droop control strategy for LCL-type grid-forming inverters, incorporating a novel power angle compensation controller to dynamically regulate power angle dynamics. The proposed a power angle compensation controller (PACC) significantly improves post-fault recovery speed and transient stability by real-time adjustment of the inverter output voltage phase angle. The PACC adjusts the inverter output voltage phase angle in real time. It quickly balances the power angle difference with synchronous generators and effectively suppresses oscillations. Simulation results show the strategy significantly shortens recovery times for power angle difference, frequency, and power. It also reduces rotor speed deviations. The approach provides an efficient and robust solution for power systems with high power electronics penetration. It enhances grid resilience."

It has attracted great attention due to its potential for real applications, such as sensing, bioimaging and light trapping. For acoustic waves, Helmholtz resonator, coiling-up space, and hyperbolic structure are among the structures for superscattering. However, these designs are typically static in scale and shape, limiting the frequency range over which superscattering can occur and reducing flexibility for practical applications. In this work, we report a novel design of reconfigurable structure in two dimensions, which can dynamically tune the frequency of superscattering. This superscatter comprises a circular core located at the center of a larger shell with a layer of air separating them. The core and the shell have different refractive indices. We show both analytically and numerically that such structure leads to superscattering and the frequency occurs at frequencies that are sensitive to the geometry of the inner core, offering a flexible and responsive approach to superscattering design principles."

This methodology has been developed based on an original method for the hydraulic calculation of pipelines using criterial equations that are generally valid for different flow regimes of fluids in pipes. A key advantage of the proposed methodology for determining <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$L_{e}$</tex> is that it eliminates the need for iterative methods to calculate friction losses. Its application requires only the geometric parameters of the pipeline sections (diameter, length, and equivalent roughness), as well as the coefficients of local resistances included in them. This makes the methodology universally applicable to all fully developed turbulent flow regimes of fluids in piping systems. The derived relationships can be used to solve a wide range of practical problems, such as determining the operating regimes of pumping and fan systems for fluid transportation, performing energy analyses of characteristic flow-rate control methods for such systems, optimizing pipeline networks, and others. In studies of the energy efficiency of such systems, the impact of variations in the hydraulic resistances of individual branches of the pipeline network on the overall resistance characteristic of the system can be evaluated relatively easily and with sufficient accuracy by means of the equivalent length parameter."

Our analysis reveals that simplified attack sequences often achieve results comparable to the complete AutoAttack sequence while requiring significantly fewer computational resources. Furthermore, our findings show that EoT generally provides modest improvements in attack success rate, while the benefits of random initialization may vary depending on the model architecture. By identifying which among the AutoAttack components has the most significant influence on the robustness evaluation, our work offers practical recommendations for designing efficient evaluation frameworks that balance thoroughness with computational cost considerations."

These propagators are evaluated in either of the wave number k space or frequency f space. The simplicity of this method allows us not only intuitive insights into dispersion properties but also easy coding avoiding involved mathematical and programming techniques.

Using a realistic distribution network with photovoltaic and wind-based DERs, a surrogate model is trained on OPF solutions optimized for loss minimization and evaluated across a range of penetration levels, from 5% to 60% of peak load. The results reveal that while the surrogate achieves high feasibility (>96%) at low penetration levels (5-30%), performance deteriorates at higher levels, reaching approximately 88% at 60% penetration. Constraint violations are strongly tied to DER characteristics: voltage magnitude violations occur at buses hosting large-capacity DERs, while apparent power violations are concentrated at small DER units with tight inverter margins. These findings highlight the sensitivity of OPF surrogate models to DER-induced operational constraints and underscore the challenges of deploying them reliably in high-penetration distribution networks."

In this work, we numerically investigate the energy exchange between surfaces and surrounding obstacles. We evaluate the thermal behavior of directionally selective materials and discuss the cases of isotropic and anisotropic emissivity under varying view factors and temperature conditions. We also consider the particular use case of an urban environment where a thermal emitter can be surrounded by buildings. Isotropic materials, with their uniform emissivity, exhibit the highest cooling power under low view factor conditions. However, as the view factor increases, anisotropic materials, particularly those with near-zenith high emissivity, outperform isotropic materials. Metamaterials with near-horizon high emissivity show strong targeted heating properties. Additionally, we find that materials with strongly selective emissivity, characterized by a single peak in their DE profile, behave similarly to low-emissivity materials in terms of cooling performance. These results highlight that angle-selective materials can enhance cooling efficiency by leveraging directional thermal emission, with potential application for energy savings in building cooling systems and urban heat island mitigation."

    "abstract": "Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are central to the utility of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, but their performance is critically dependent on the design of the parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) ansatz. Manual design of these circuits is a complex, non-trivial task requiring significant expertise. To address this, Quantum Architecture Search (QAS) has emerged to automate the discovery of optimal circuit structures. However, many QAS methods incur substantial computational costs by requiring full training of candidate circuits. In this paper, we introduce QAS via iterative elimination, a novel framework that efficiently identifies high-performing circuits. Our method begins with a large, randomly generated population of circuits and iteratively prunes this set based on a composite score that evaluates both immediate performance and trainability. We introduce a dynamic weighting scheme that initially prioritizes trainability to avoid barren plateaus and gradually shifts focus to performance as the search progresses. We validate our approach on Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) tasks for the 6-qubit Transverse Field Ising Model and the 5-qubit Heisenberg model. Experimental results show that our method, particularly with the dynamic weighting, discovers circuits that are competitive with those found by state-of-the-art training-free QAS methods, demonstrating a powerful balance between search efficiency and solution quality."

    "abstract": "In the food industry, accurately determining the stiff peak phase in egg whites is crucial for products such as meringues and soufflés. Currently, this point is identified by subjective methods such as visual assessment (beater “peak” test) or tactile assessment (inverted bowl test) [1], [2]. These approaches present low reproducibility between operators and slow down production lines. Although instrumental alternatives such as rheometry or spectroscopy exist [3], [4], their high cost and complexity make them unfeasible for large-scale industrial applications. This study presents an objective and economical method to detect the stiff peak by monitoring the electric current in a mixer at constant voltage. The central hypothesis is that changes in the mechanical strength of the foam during beating are directly reflected in variations in energy consumption [3]. The experiments showed a characteristic pattern in the current-time curve. First, a rapid increase from 0.000 A to 0.011 A, corresponding to the low viscosity of the liquid egg white. Then, progressively increasing up to 0.036 A, marking the stiff peak where the foam reaches its maximum structural strength [4], [5]. Our analysis of 15 independent tests showed that the electrical method correctly identified the stiff peak point in $\\mathbf{8 6. 6 \\%}$ of cases $\\boldsymbol{(} \\boldsymbol{\\pm} \\mathbf{2. 1 \\%}$ error, $87 \\%$ confidence interval) when compared to the assessment of three certified experts. The current showed a standard deviation of 0.004 A at the point of maximum resistance $(0.038 \\pm 0.004 \\mathrm{~A})$, confirming the reproducibility of the method."

    "abstract": "Accurate disease grading (assessing lesion severity) and localization (pinpointing lesions) in CT images are critical for clinical diagnosis. While vision-language models typically require pixel-level annotations, medical CT annotation is timeconsuming, labor-intensive, and inconsistent due to differences in experience and annotation styles among experts. Consequently, most datasets provide only image-level category labels, posing significant challenges for current vision-language models under weak supervision, such as difficulty in accurately identifying ambiguous lesion features, susceptibility to confirmation bias, and the risk of error accumulation during training. To address these challenges, we propose CoWeT, a dual-branch collaborative weakly supervised text-guided visual-language model for disease grading and localization. Our model employs a dual-branch collaborative learning strategy, introducing mutual supervision between branches to refine features collaboratively and mitigate confirmation bias, alongside a novel Text Prompt Box (TPB) module that leverages pathology reports as textual prompts to intelligently filter pseudo-labels for robust lesion localization and grading under weak supervision. Evaluations on RTDP and LND datasets show that CoWeT outperforms state-of-the-art methods on accuracy and average precision."

    "abstract": "Image-text retrieval (ITR) is a pivotal task in cross-modal research. However, existing methods often suffer from a fundamental yet overlooked challenge: redundancy. This issue manifests as both semantic redundancy within unimodal representations and relationship redundancy in cross-modal alignments. This not only inflates computational costs but also degrades retrieval accuracy by masking salient features and reinforcing spurious correlations. In this work, we are the first to explicitly analyze and address the ITR problem from a redundancy perspective by proposing the iMage-text rEtrieval rEdundancy miTigation (MEET) framework. MEET employs a cascaded, two-stage process to systematically mitigate both forms of redundancy. First, for Semantic Redundancy Mitigation, it repurposes deep hashing and quantization as synergistic tools, producing compact yet highly discriminative representations. Second, for Relationship Redundancy Mitigation, it progressively refines the cross-modal alignment space by filtering misleading negative samples and adaptively reweighting informative pairs. The structural integration of these modules under a unified optimization objective provides a clear and interpretable pathway to retrieval. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that MEET consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods, validating its effectiveness and generalizability."

    "abstract": "The CLIP visual feature-based image captioning models have developed rapidly and achieved remarkable results. However, existing models still struggle to produce descriptive and discriminative captions because they insufficiently exploit fine-grained visual cues and fail to model complex vision–language alignment. To address these limitations, we propose a Ranking Diffusion Transformer (RDT), which integrates a Ranking Visual Encoder (RVE) and a Ranking Loss (RL) for fine-grained image captioning. The RVE introduces a novel ranking attention mechanism that effectively mines diverse and discriminative visual information from CLIP features. Meanwhile, the RL leverages the ranking of generated caption quality as a global semantic supervisory signal, thereby enhancing the diffusion process and strengthening vision–language semantic alignment. We show that by collaborating RVE and RL via the novel RDT—and by gradually adding and removing noise in the diffusion process—more discriminative visual features are learned and precisely aligned with the language features. Experimental results on popular benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed RDT surpasses existing state-of-the-art image captioning models in the literature.

    "abstract": "Machine learning algorithms demonstrate strong efficacy in detecting interference signals in indoor pseudolite systems. Nonetheless, their dependence on multiple signal parameters limits practical applicability, as some devices may lack the capability to acquire all required parameters. To address this issue, this study proposes a self-adaptive decomposition and dimensionality reduction (SDDR) scheme that relies solely on the carrier-to-noise ratio (C/N<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub>) parameter. The proposed scheme consists of two modules. In the first module, a dung beetle optimization (DBO) algorithm improved in population diversity and exploration capability is integrated with variational mode decomposition (VMD) to adaptively extract C/N<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub> signal features and construct a multidimensional dataset. In the second module, a principal component analysis strategy (PCA) based on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is introduced to assess the intrinsic dimensionality of the multidimensional dataset and dimensionality reduction, thereby suppressing redundant components and enhancing model generalization. Validation on two pseudolite datasets demonstrates that C/N<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub> signals processed by the SDDR method are more suitable for machine learning-based detection. Specifically, the average detection accuracy of support vector machines and long short-term memory networks improves by 8.4% and 6.1% on the entire dataset, while their average detection accuracy for line-of-sight (LOS) signals increases by 13.0% and 13.2%, respectively."

    "abstract": "Most small objects are missed when object detection algorithms are transferred from natural images to remote sensing images. Constructing multi-scale features has been proven to be an effective approach for detecting small objects. However, existing methods for multi-scale features have two limitations: insufficient discriminative capability and sparse semantic-spatial information, which fail to fully leverage the potential of multi-scale features. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Multiscale Feature Reconstruction Network (MRN), which introduces three novel modules during feature extraction, fusion, and enhancement: the Composite Multi-scale Feature Extraction Module (CEM), Interlayer Feature Joint Module (IJM), and Spatial-Semantic Information Cross Module (SSM). First, CEM utilizes a multi-branch structure to aggregate scale information. Dilated convolution and asymmetric convolution are extensively used in the branches, which expand the receptive field and capture information of rectangular instances, respectively. Second, the IJM leverages a gating mechanism to achieve pixel-level feature enhancement for feature maps at different hierarchical depths. Finally, the SSM alleviates high-level semantic feature information imbalance through dual-branch information interaction. Furthermore, to utilize the limited computational resources, we propose a lightweight version called MRN_Lite. We evaluate MRN and MRN_Lite on three existing public datasets: AI-TOD, VEDAI, and VisDrone2019. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. In comparison experiments, both versions of the model outperform the state of the art (SOTA). And MRN_Lite has less than 50% of the FLOPs and parameters of MRN, which has comparable performance to the original version."

    "abstract": "A real-time traffic sign identification and recognition system that combines deep learning with edge computing technology is presented in this study. The system leverages a custom-trained YOLOv8n model, achieving 90% accuracy on a traffic sign dataset collected from the Pune region, including classes such as 'speed_limit', 'traffic_signal', 'stop_sign', and 'cross_walk'. By deploying the model on edge devices, the system ensures low-latency processing, making it suitable for real-world scenarios like in-vehicle assistance and smart traffic monitoring. The recognized traffic signs are further analyzed in comparison with real-time speed data to generate actionable outputs, such as alerts or logs, enhancing driver awareness and promoting road safety. This approach not only aids in accident prevention and detection of harsh driving behaviour but also opens pathways for broader applications in Smart City initiatives, ADAS support systems, and intelligent fleet management. The study demonstrates that integrating computer vision and edge AI can significantly improve traffic flow, safety, and urban mobility infrastructure."

    "abstract": "There has been notable increase in wanting to know the consumer's opinions on specific aspects of products and services, particularly by customer-focused industries. Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis assists in uncovering detailed feedback by associating sentiments with attributes, instead of treating the entire text as an isolated opinion. Most ABSA systems in use have been designed for English or other singlelanguage contexts, however there is a growing need for tools that handle opinions expressed in multiple languages. This work addresses that gap by developing a machine learning-based ABSA system tailored for multilingual hotel reviews, specifically in English and Italian. The system uses transformer-based language models to identify aspects and assign corresponding sentiment values. To support this, a custom dataset was created by expanding the TripAdvisor Multilingual ABSA dataset (Trip-MAML) with public review data and synthetically generated samples that include informal expressions, emojis, and ambiguous language constructs. This made the compound dataset better reflect the real-world linguistic diversities being dealt with. Models- Multilingual BERT (mBERT) and XLMRoBERTa (XLM-R)- were trained and tested for sentiment and aspect classification. XLM-R demonstrated a stronger performance, achieving a F1-Score of 0.9319 compared to 0.5802 achieved by mBERT. These statistics suggest that XLM<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{R}$</tex> proved more effective at capturing nuanced sentiment patterns across languages.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the estimation of sparse channel state information (CSI) and the detection of active information in a massive machine-type communication (mMTC) system utilizing an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) base station (BS). Both rotary-wing and fixed-wing UAVs are considered in the context of large-scale connectivity. In the first scenario, the rotary-wing UAV is equipped with a small-scale multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. A single measurement vector approach is employed to estimate CSI across the time, frequency, and spatial domains, referred to as 3D-domain estimation. In the second scenario, the study focuses on angular-domain-based CSI estimation and active information detection for an mMTC system utilizing a fixed-wing UAV BS with massive MIMO. The multiple measurement vector Bayesian posteriori minimum mean square error method is implemented to enhance performance. To support these estimations, non-orthogonal discrete Fourier transform sequences are designed for the codebook matrix and transmitted via orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing sub-carriers. Additionally, during each iteration, channel parameter learning facilitates the transfer of extrinsic expectation and extrinsic variance, ensuring convergence to the final results. Numerical simulations demonstrate the proposed approach’s superior estimation and detection performance compared to existing methods, such as approximate message-passing algorithms and the orthogonal matching pursuit method, in terms of normalized mean square error, error detection probability, and bit error rate."

    "abstract": "Although often dismissed as trivial entertainment, internet memes have become a central feature of contemporary digital culture. Their capacity to condense complex ideas into humorous, ironic, or critical visual-textual forms positions them as powerful communicative artifacts. Yet within higher education research, and particularly at the doctoral level, memes remain underexplored. This study addresses that gap by examining how doctoral students in Mexico and Estonia engage with memes as tools for humor, social learning, and critical reflection. Drawing on mass communication theory, social learning theory, and critical thinking frameworks, the study investigates how global meme cultures are locally appropriated to negotiate academic pressures and identity formation. Methodologically, the research employed a qualitative design with semi-structured interviews to capture participants’ interpretations of memes in academic and personal contexts. This approach enabled the analysis of communicative intentions, socio-emotional functions, and cross-cultural differences in meme practices. Findings reveal both convergences and divergences. Across both contexts, memes functioned to elicit humor, foster peer connection, and stimulate reflection on academic struggles. In Mexico, they circulated as collective performances that built solidarity and voiced resistance, while in Estonia they operated more as reflective prompts that supported autonomy and self-regulation. These dynamics illustrate how memes extend the ecology of informal learning, democratizing participation and validating the emotional dimensions of doctoral education. The study demonstrates that memes are not trivial byproducts of digital culture but multifunctional tools that reshape communicative practices in higher education and enrich cross-cultural understandings of academic life, highlighting implications for digital pedagogy and doctoral supervision."

Using a survey of 125 SMEs and grounded in the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Institutional Theory, we examine factors influencing the intention to adopt AI-based tax systems. Results show that Perceived Usefulness is the strongest predictor of adoption, followed by Perceived Ease of Use and Trust in AI Systems. Interestingly, Institutional Pressure does not significantly influence behavioral intention, suggesting that regulatory mandates alone are insufficient. The findings highlight that for AI tax systems to be adopted, they must deliver visible benefits, be user-friendly, and foster trust. This research provides insights for policymakers and developers aiming to increase AI adoption in taxation by focusing on system functionality, ease of access, and data security factors that are especially crucial in resourceconstrained SME environments."

    "abstract": "This study explores the vibration characteristics of car seats and the human body using finite element (FE) modeling and numerical simulation to improve passenger comfort during vehicular motion. The finite element method (FEM) effectively handles the complexities of modeling human and seat parameters, accurately simulating biodynamic responses, such as stress distributions along the spine. With Matlab Simulink, a seven-degrees-of-freedom (7-DOF) model analyzes seat and human oscillations due to vertical displacements from vehicle-floor vibrations. Ansys Workbench software further enables detailed FE analysis, using Linear and Parabolic Tetra elements to capture dynamic responses of the car-seat-human system. Human vibration frequencies typically range from 3 to 30 Hz, with an absorption range extending to 80 Hz. Comfort levels are evaluated by root mean square (RMS) acceleration values, below $0.315 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$ (ISO 2631-1:1997 standards). The model uses a 3D mesh for the car, seat, and human body, and applies forces and boundary conditions based on ISO 8608 to simulate road-induced vibrations. Free vibration analysis explores 200 natural modes, revealing specific frequencies and bending patterns within the human body. Forced vibration analysis, using fast Fourier transforms (FFT), creates frequency-amplitude relationships across body parts, showing that higher seat cushion stiffness results in greater vibration amplitudes in regions like the head and torso. Simulation results align with ISO standards, demonstrating that optimized seat cushioning can improve comfort. Recommendations include using energy-absorbing materials in cushions to reduce vibration effects on the human body. These simulations provide a practical foundation for designing seating systems that enhance comfort and reduce health risks from prolonged vibration exposure."

The calculation of MLGF often involves Sommerfeld integrals, which are highly oscillatory and slowly attenuating. This affects computational efficiency of electromagnetic simulation. In this presentation, we propose a novel method leveraging deep complex networks (DCN) to accelerate the computation of MLGF. The method exploits the strengths of complex neural networks by jointly training the real and imaginary parts of MLGF, thereby improving the robustness. To further enhance the computational efficiency of RFIC simulation, the integral equation solver is accelerated by multi-level fast multipole algorithm (MLFMA). Compared to the direct calculation of Sommerfeld integrals and direct solvers, the proposed method significantly improves computational efficiency without compromising accuracy."

    "abstract": "The photovoltaic (PV) systems are one of the key renewable solutions for the green transition and currently many new capacities are being installed. The problem is that too many PV powers generate too much unneeded power during daytime in an unpredictable manner, which influences the prices on the electricity exchanges and lowers the PV plant value return. The Bulgarian energy mix for the years 2023 and 2024 is analyzed together with the changing trend of electricity prices and their dependence on the increasing PV energy share. The changing electricity prices are matched to the generated energy of an example 12.6 kW peak PV system and conclusions are drawn. The PV plant and energy shares have risen considerably in 2024, in comparison to 2023, and currently many new PV projects are being developed. The current free market energy prices are enough to cover the costs of the built PV plants, but they exclude the lacking energy storage costs, needed for stable power grids. With the rising PV share, the energy prices fall, especially when the PV systems produce the most, which makes them less competitive. The problems with the power grid stability and with the falling PV energy prices could be overcome with battery energy storage capacities, but their technologies are not developed enough, they cost much and are expected to make the PV plants uncompetitive. The investigated 12.6 kW peak PV system produced 0.8 % less energy in 2024 with 0.38 % lower value in comparison to 2023, calculated monthly."

    "abstract": "The impact of wartime subsistence support on the digestive system is an important research area, as the dietary environment and food supply under wartime conditions differ greatly from those in peacetime. During wartime, food security has a significant impact on the digestive system of soldiers. Insufficient nutrition, unsafe food, unhygienic eating environment, and psychological stress experienced by soldiers can all have adverse effects on the digestive system. This paper mainly analyzes the impact of wartime subsistence support on the digestive system from the aspects of possible malnutrition, digestive system diseases, soldiers carrying equipment and supplies for a long time, and increasing the burden on the digestive system. It explores how to reduce the risk of digestive system disorders and improve soldiers' combat effectiveness through reasonable subsistence support in wartime environments. This article suggests that in wartime subsistence support, attention should be paid to balanced nutrition to ensure that soldiers can obtain sufficient nutrients. At the same time, food preservation and handling should be strengthened to reduce the risk of food poisoning and intestinal infections. In addition, attention should be paid to the psychological state of soldiers, providing psychological counseling and support to alleviate the impact of psychological pressure on the digestive system."

Advanced digital tools, incorporating Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven multi-spectral imaging, support phytopathologists in improving early disease diagnostics through rapid, scalable, and non-destructive methods. This study evaluates a dual AI-based diagnostic framework combining multi-spectral image segmentation with molecular validation to detect B. cinerea during early, asymptomatic stages. A Deep Learning (DL) segmentation model, derived from U-Net++ integrating a lightweight MobileViTV2-1.25 encoder and an augmentation technique for minority classes, was deployed on a newly captured dataset of 80 detached cucumber leaves, obtained from B. cinerea infected as well as control plants. The leaves were imaged at five discrete wavelengths and also subjected to quantitative PCR (qPCR) to measure fungal biomass as a biological ground truth. The model classified leaf regions into healthy, invisible and visible classes. The capability of the approach to detect grey mould was assessed by comparing the DL segmentation outputs with qPCR-based quantification of fungal colonization. Results confirmed the ability of the model to detect infection in tissues where symptoms were either minimal or invisible to the naked eye, achieving an overall segmentation accuracy of 91.9% and a mean IoU of 0.816. This integration of AI-based tools with molecular qPCR benchmarking and confirmation offers a robust methodology that complements phytopathological diagnostics, enabling more informed, early intervention and supporting sustainable crop protection strategies."

    "abstract": "In this paper, possible definitions of polarisation orbital angular momentum are proposed. One orbital angular momentum is proportional to the azimuthal rate of change of the linear polarisation vector direction, and the second is proportional to the azimuthal rate of change of the degree of ellipticity of the polarisation ellipse. For example, the normalized polarisation orbital angular momentum is equal to the order of the cylindrical vector beam. Two most important characteristics of scalar optical vortices are the topological charge (TC) and the orbital angular momentum (OAM). These characteristics are well studied. However, there are known polarisation optical vortices with the polarisation state changing with the azimuthal angle. These vortices have polarisation singularity points, which are described by indices similar to the TC; however, polarisation OAM for polarisation vortices has not yet been investigated."

This study presents an indepth assessment of sludge treatment and biogas management at the Bacău WWTP, Romania, with emphasis on process performance, biogas quality, and potential for technological improvement. Results indicate a relatively stable methane concentration (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\sim 63 \\%$</tex>), consistent with proper fermentation, but lower than natural gas standards <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(\\sim 85 \\%)$</tex>, limiting its optimal use in cogeneration. Hydrogen sulfide concentrations presented variability, contributing to equipment corrosion, operational inefficiencies, and increased flaring. While the system demonstrates energy management and surplus generation, significant fractions of biogas are wasted through flaring, highlighting the need for advanced purification, compression, and storage technologies. Recommended measures include the application of activated carbon filters, wet scrubbers, airtight digesters, and tri-generation systems to improve energy recovery, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and ensure operational sustainability. Overall, the research show that modernization of sludge and biogas management systems at Bacău WWTP is critical for enhancing energy efficiency, reducing environmental impacts, and aligning with circular economy principles."

    "abstract": "Compositional data consist of components expressed as proportions of a whole and carry only relative information. In statistical and machine learning contexts, these data require specialized handling due to their constant-sum constraint and non-Euclidean geometry. A common approach is the application of log-ratio transformations-such as the centered log-ratio (CLR)-to project compositional vectors into Euclidean space. While using CLR for inputs is well established, applying this transformation to compositional outputs remains underexplored. This study evaluates the predictive impact of using CLR on target variables in supervised learning, with a geochemical dataset containing lithogeochemical targets and physical-log predictors. Three deep learning architectures are assessed: CNNBiLSTM, SAIDNN, and MHA-BiRNN, each trained on raw and CLR-transformed outputs. Results consistently show that models trained directly on raw compositions outperform their CLR-transformed counterparts. We identify two causes: (i) the inverse CLR transformation redistributes prediction errors across components, reducing local precision, and (ii) zeros in compositional data introduce artifacts when preprocessed for log-ratio transformations. Furthermore, the models demonstrate good generalization on blind tests, especially when trained on raw data. These findings suggest that modern deep learning models can effectively learn from compositional outputs in their native form, avoiding distortions from transformation pipelines."

The proposed pipeline employs the DeepSeek Transformer to automatically identify relevant aspect terms from input sentences using prompt-based generation. These extracted aspects are, then, embedded into reformulated sentence-aspect pairs and fed into a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Network to obtain fine-grained sentiment classification. Unlike the traditional pipelines that rely on manual annotations or fixed aspect lists, the introduced method dynamically adapts to diverse sentence structures and domains. The experimental results demonstrate that the system achieved F1-scores of 88.87%, 83.47% and 86.32% when applied on three benchmark datasets (Laptop, Restaurant and a merged corpus), respectively. They also show that better and more accurate aspect-aware sentiment classification can be provided by combining generative aspect extraction with contextual sequence modeling."

These protocols must address key challenges, including subscriber matching (SM), energy-efficient path (EEP) selection, and real-time transmission scheduling (TS) in a demand-driven environment. Additionally, irreversible energy losses, congestion, and variable DER availability increase the complexity of routing decisions. This paper reviews core design considerations for energy routing in the EI and introduces blockchain as a transformative enabler for secure, transparent, and autonomous peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading. Blockchain technology provides decentralized control, tamper-proof transaction records, and smart contract automation, improving trust, traceability, and real-time responsiveness.

    "abstract": "In both personal and professional contexts, filler words like “um,” “uh,” “like,” and “you know” frequently impair speech fluency, clarity, and perceived confidence. In order to improve speech fluency without sacrificing meaning, this paper suggests a novel, context-aware framework for real-time filler word detection and replacement. Three model architectures are evaluated. The first uses XGBoost to achieve an F1-score of 93.3% by combining prosodic features pitch, energy, and duration extracted using Librosa with word embeddings based on BERT. In order to capture long-range contextual dependencies, the second model introduces a custom Transformer-based model that integrates self-attention and BERT. Using a Random Forest classifier for disfluency prediction, the third model combines textual and acoustic features in a multimodal manner. According to experimental results, the accuracy of filler word detection is greatly increased by combining prosodic cues with deep contextual embeddings. For real-time applications like public speaking, virtual meetings, and interviews, this framework exhibits great promise. In order to provide real-time fluency assistance, future work will involve expanding multilingual support and implementing the system on wearable and mobile platforms."

This paper presents a novel and integrated IoT-based framework for cost-effective and energy-efficient cryptocurrency mining, specifically tailored for small-scale operations. Our approach uniquely combines a Raspberry Pi 4 with a DHT11 sensor for dynamic thermal management, creating an accessible and replicable system. By integrating real-time temperature and humidity monitoring with automated cooling and user alerts, precise thermal regulation is achieved, which is critical for maintaining hardware efficiency and extending its lifespan. The mining process involves solving complex cryptographic puzzles to validate and add transactions to the blockchain, a task that requires significant computational power and generates significant heat. This work helps both researchers and miners understand more cost-effective mining practices in a simpler and more accessible manner. Experimental results demonstrate that our setup maintains optimal operating temperatures and enhances the overall efficiency and reliability of the mining process. This makes it a budget-friendly and accessible framework, contributing to the development of a reliable IoT-based cryptomining setup for small-scale miners and newcomers to the field."

Survey data from 29 teachers—mostly with backgrounds in informatics and mathematics—revealed a growing interest in using ER as a tool to develop algorithmic thinking, problem-solving skills, and student engagement. Sixteen experienced teachers participated in follow-up interviews, identifying key challenges and implications related to teaching with educational robotics. Blended learning and the interdisciplinary integration of educational robotics into projects were also among the topics that teachers commented on. Teachers emphasized the need for structured training in ER pedagogy, practical resources aligned with national curricula, and more collaboration across schools. The findings suggest that while Slovak teachers demonstrate high motivation to implement ER and foster CT, sustainable adoption requires systemic changes in infrastructure, training, and policy to fully leverage its educational potential."

To address this, we propose the Detail-enhancement Dual-domain Fusion Network (D <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$^{2}$</tex-math></inline-formula> FNet).

Second, D <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$^{2}$</tex-math></inline-formula> FNet introduces a cascaded multimodal fusion framework, comprising the Dual-domain Fusion Block (DFB) and the Detail Enhancement Fusion Block (DEFB). Within the DFB, we employ the proposed Feature Interaction Fusion Block (FIFB) to perform initial multimodal feature alignment and fusion in both the spatial and frequency domains, enhancing the model's understanding of the macroscopic object structures. Recognizing the importance of local details for dense segmentation tasks, DEFB employs novel Variable Receptive Field Convolution (VRFC) modules to enhance the detail representation of both the initial fusion features and the DSM features. These detail-enhanced features are fed into the FIFB module to achieve further multimodal alignment and fusion. Extensive experiments on the ISPRS Potsdam and Vaihingen datasets demonstrate that our method achieves mIoU of 86.99% and 84.29%, respectively. It not only outperforms comparative approaches in segmentation performance but also reduces model parameters by 79.6% and computational cost by 85.6%, thereby validating the effectiveness of the proposed network."

In the current context of advanced lighting technologies, especially those using LED systems and digital dimming controllers, these systems are increasingly relied upon. However, the nonlinear characteristics of these technologies cause significant power quality disturbances, including harmonic distortion, poor power factor, and voltage fluctuations. The study evaluates power quality parameters in three operating modes - standby, dimming, and full power within a intelligent building. The study findings showed that the dimming mode posed the most significant challenge, which can be attributed to the increased total harmonic distortion. On the other hand, the full power mode showed increased efficiency and improve waveform quality. Based on these findings, mitigation techniques such as passive harmonic filtering are proposed to improve power quality. This work highlights the importance of monitoring and optimizing power quality in intelligent building environments to facilitate sustainable and reliable operation."

The IEEE802.4.15e Time Slotted Channel Hopping(TSCH) protocol is proposed for industrial applications to address the strict requirements, such as reliability and deterministic communication. Although TSCH offers reliable and deterministic communication for such environments, its lack of adaptability to dynamic environments and mobility of entities motivates to address these issues. To address these gaps, a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP)-based mobility-aware TSCH networks for IIoT (MTSCH) is introduced by employing an MILP model to optimize the strategic placement of static nodes at the boundary of the network deployment area and coverage area and mobility trajectories. The evaluation of the experiment’s results indicates that MTSCH achieves better results relative to the results of baseline approaches like TSCH and Forte across different performance metrics. MTSCH achieves an 84% connectivity, an improved coverage of 87%, and a jointime reduction by 1 s. It also scores the lowest delay of 91.1 s with consistence confidence interval. As per the results, MTSCH can be suggested for industrial use cases that employ mobile nodes in a TSCH network for IIoT."

To ensure smooth and goal-consistent motion, the final output blends the correction with the global path and prior movement. Experimental results on real 2D LiDAR maps demonstrate that the proposed method enhances safety margins, smooths trajectories, and improves robustness against unknown obstacles."

Building AI models for dental diagnostics requires diverse datasets, which are challenging to obtain due to high imaging costs and the need for patient privacy protection. To address this challenge, we propose a method for synthesizing panoramic X-ray images from CT images using an elliptical dental arch and a dynamic rotation center. The method also introduces slice extraction and tilt correction relative to the axial reference plane, which have not been considered in previous approaches. Experiments using CT images from 321 individuals showed that the proposed method achieved a mean Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.644, outperforming conventional techniques. These results suggest that our method can generate panoramic X-rays similar to actual images and support data augmentation in machine learning."

    "abstract": "One important polarization conversion mode in polarizers is the linear-to-circular (LTC) polarization conversion. Although extensive work has been conducted to enhance the functionality and performance of Reflective Electromagnetic Surfaces (RES) as polarizers, research on the performance of polarizers in finite array and conformal configurations remains relatively small. This paper presents a performance investigation and analysis of switchable LTC polarizers in finite array and conformal configurations. The polarizers are designed to operate at the center frequency of 6.775 GHz, converting a linearly polarized incident wave to a circularly polarized reflected wave in the Off-State condition, while disabling the polarizer functionality in the On-State condition. Studies on the flat surface configuration indicate that using finite arrays of either <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$3 \\times 3$</tex> elements or <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$6 \\times 6$</tex> elements has no compromise the functionality of switchable LTC polarizer in either the Off-State or On-State conditions. However, significant degradation occurs in the On-State condition, where the cross-polarization reflection coefficient value increases by 5 dB to 10 dB in both <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$3 \\times 3$</tex> elements and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$6 \\times 6$</tex> elements. For the conformal configuration, the analysis shows that the curvature radius significantly impacts the performance degradation of switchable LTC polarizer, particularly in the On-State conditions. While in the Off-State conditions, the performance degradation is more pronounced in the <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$6 \\times 6$</tex> elements compared to the <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$3 \\times 3$</tex> elements. Conversely, in the On-State condition, the <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$3 \\times 3$</tex> elements exhibit greater performance degradation. In addition, smaller curvature radius remarkably degrades the performance of switchable LTC polarizer in the Off-State conditions."

    "abstract": "Activity classification using wearable sensors has significant applications in healthcare, sports, rehabilitation, and smart prosthetics, the latter being the focus of this paper. Smart prosthetics have the potential to improve mobility and quality of life by dynamically adapting motor configurations and settings based on the user’s activity. We explore deep learning models for activity classification using time-series data from two 9axis Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) placed on the foot and the shank. We developed and compared three architectures to classify walking, ascending stairs, and descending stairs. The models are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long ShortTerm Memory Networks (LSTM), and Transformers. The dataset consists of labeled IMU readings from 10 human subjects, processed using different sliding-window techniques: fixed-size window predictions and averaged window predictions. The models were evaluated on the basis of their ability to accurately classify activities under realistic, outside-of-lab environments. Initial results indicate that CNNs and LSTMs excel in capturing sequential dependencies, making them well suited for real-time prosthetic adjustments. Our best-performing model achieved $100 \\%$ accuracy for walking, $86 \\%$ for stair descent, and $90 \\%$ for stair ascent, demonstrating strong potential for practical deployment. This research highlights the feasibility of integrating deep learning models with wearable sensors to enhance the adaptability of smart prosthetics, contributing to the field of assistive technologies and personalized mobility solutions."

    "abstract": "There are abundant multi-label data in Real-world scenarios, and practical applications frequently face challenges from out-of-distribution (OOD) data that deviate from the training distribution. To address this, we propose a multi-label OOD detection algorithm (Energy-Gap-YoLOOD) based on YoLOOD and energy functions. First, during model training, we propose an energy-based confidence gap expansion function specifically designed to amplify the separation between in-distribution (ID) and OOD characteristics in the feature space. Then for inference phase, we introduce a confidence enhancement mechanism that: selectively amplifies high-confidence predictions and adaptively suppresses low-confidence outputs. Finally, we experimentally validate the effectiveness and robustness of our method."

    "abstract": "Renewable energy sources are inherently unpredictable, necessitating the implementation of mechanisms to ensure voltage regulation within a power system. This highlights FACTS devices like STATCOM, which enhance system reliability. The objective of STATCOM research is to enhance and incorporate FACTS devices into power systems to prevent inadequate voltage stability, which can result in voltage collapse, outages, and potentially a complete system shutdown. This paper employs the SCOPUS database to do a systematic literature review on journals published over a five-year span from 2019 to 2024. Given the extensive nature of the SCOPUS database, it is imperative to design keywords pertaining to the topic and filter the research parameters to the field of Engineering, so as to omit other scientific disciplines and restrict the search exclusively to journals, while removing book chapters and conference reviews. The research repeatedly emphasizes the essential function of STATCOM and other FACTS devices in enhancing voltage regulation, alleviating dynamic voltage instabilities, and facilitating renewable energy integration under diverse grid settings. Notwithstanding significant advancements, there persists a compelling necessity for more rigorous, data-driven evaluations of historical grid performance in relation to temperature, load, and fault fluctuations, particularly correlating STATCOM efficacy with grid stability metrics across various circumstances. This research seeks to elucidate the integration of STATCOM in power systems, the technologies employed alongside STATCOM devices, and the significance of voltage regulation."

    "abstract": "Human emotions are conveyed not only through verbal elements but also through non-verbal cues such as facial expressions, posture, and tone of voice. Among these cues, micro-expressions serve as important indicators of genuine emotions, as they can appear unconsciously even when a person tries to suppress their feelings. This study investigates the effectiveness of deep learning models for estimating internal emotional states based on micro-expressions.The experiment was conducted by comparing five conditions: (1) facial region (full face vs. ROI), (2) number of input frames (apex frame vs. three-frame sequence), (3) presence or absence of fine-tuning using a facial expression dataset, (4) use of the Attention Branch Network (ABN), and (5) use of the ArcFace. The results showed that the use of ROIs and the implementation of ABN improved recognition accuracy, suggesting the importance of capturing local features and emphasizing attention regions in micro-expression recognition. In contrast, no significant improvement was observed from the number of input frames, fine-tuning, or the use of ArcFace. These findings indicate that the choice of input region and the use of attention mechanisms are key factors in enhancing the accuracy of emotion recognition based on micro-expressions."

The aim was to create a wearable assistive device that promotes independence and enhances the quality of life of people with visual impairments. The research was based on an initial prototype that was analyzed in terms of ergonomics, weight, design and technical solution. Based on the identified shortcomings, a comprehensive optimization of both hardware and mechanical components was implemented. The new prototype integrates all the electronic components directly into the frame of the glasses, thus achieving a uniform design and respecting the parameters commonly used in optics. At the same time, the weight of the device has been reduced by more than 30%. Testing of the prototype's electronics has confirmed the functionality of all the implemented components implemented as part of the optimization. Comparative testing of the design solutions of the original and the new prototype was carried out on a sample of eleven respondents. The testing showed improvements in handling, comfort and user friendliness in use. The device has also been extended to prepare for battery status monitoring, with software functionality to be added in the next phase of development. The work also highlights further opportunities for optimization in the areas of miniaturization, AI integration and the development of affordable and user-friendly aids for the blind."

The paper introduces the second iteration of our low-cost GMC to solve this problem, which is based on the Beaglebone Black (BBB) single-board computer (SBC). SBCs consist of system-on-a-chip (SoC) devices, which integrate application processor cores (mainly ARM Cortex-Ax cores), network interfaces, and embedded peripherals, such as timers, I2C bus controllers, etc. Our primary aim is to implement the GMC only with the available peripherals of the SoC, except for a reference oscillator and a GNSS receiver. Selection of the reference oscillator and the GNSS receiver is also driven by price constraints, as the solution does not want to compete with commercial devices. On the contrary, it wants to let researchers, educators, and even students rebuild the device at low cost and start the experimentation with time synchronization-related concepts. The solution comprises a simple prototype CAPE (extension board for the Beaglebone platform) and software components. The paper presents the requirements, design decisions, improvements in hardware and software, and closes with an initial performance evaluation."

    "abstract": "Advances in object detection have significantly improved modern surveillance systems, yet the identification of potential threat objects still depends heavily on manual interpretation. This reliance limits real-time responsiveness—especially in crowded public spaces—and poses risks to public safety. To address this challenge, we propose BRA-YOLOv8, an enhanced YOLOv8-based architecture. BRA-YOLOv8 incorporates a Receptive Field Convolution (RFConv) module with multi-scale receptive fields in the backbone, an Average Pooling Transposed Convolution (APTC) mechanism during upsampling for improved spatial reconstruction, and cross-scale connections with weighted feature fusion via Bi-directional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN) to enhance small-object detection. A modified bounding box regression loss accelerates convergence. A self-built firearm detection dataset is developed for training and evaluation, and the trained model is converted to OpenVINO format for efficient deployment on Intel hardware. On the FiDaSS test dataset, baseline YOLOv8 achieves AP@0.5 scores of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\text{5 7. 7 8 \\%}$</tex> (FiDaSS) and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\text{5 8. 3 3 \\%}$</tex> (self-built dataset). BRA-YOLOv8 achieves 64.79 % AP@ 0.5 on the self-built dataset, yielding improvements of 12.13 % and 11.07 % over the baseline. These results demonstrate BRA-YOLOv8's superior accuracy while maintaining practical deployability for real-time weapon detection in surveillance scenarios."

    "abstract": "Wireless power transfer (WPT) has gained growing significance for supplying energy to contemporary electronic gadgets and electric vehicles, making accurate prediction of magnetic field distribution essential during the design phase. Conventional techniques for estimating the magnetic field in WPT systems often suffer from slow processing times, limited precision, and inefficiencies in the modeling process. With the rapid progress in Artificial Intelligence (AI), its capability to conduct swift, precise computations and optimize complex variables has emerged as a promising solution to enhance WPT design. This paper introduces a novel method for forecasting the magnetic field distribution in WPT systems by leveraging machine learning (ML). A customized U-Net model was used to learn from coil input parameters and produce spatial magnetic field distribution maps as outputs. These maps are crucial for determining safe design parameters that meet magnetic field safety standards. Experimental findings show that the proposed approach delivers highly efficient predictions, requiring on average only 4.1 milliseconds for computation and achieving a normalized prediction error of 0.0028. This marks a notable advancement compared to traditional simulation software such as COMSOL, which takes about 21.5 seconds for equivalent calculations."

Clean energy and more important is the question which energy is clean, and which ways are given to use the new energy form: - (CLEAN ENERGY), and the wayes in this direction. Many research will try to be focused on now and future to find the best way to use this kind of energy. In our studies, we research two types and clean energy, both of this energy forms, and how to find suitable ways to use them securely and reliably so. In this paper, we start firstly tests and the facts about CNTUBS as well as different CNTs simulations and their borders, then secondly we will try to put some light on the quantum fields theory and how we can use that simply. With hydrogen NANO tube technology nature give us again apportions to use clean energy, in this case profound studies and simulation is needed for NANO tube as storage for hydrogen as clean energy cells. Basic theoretical studies and simulations results ware shown in PIERS24 in Chengdu, China, that shows the possible use of SWCNT, DWCNT, examples for hydrogen storage cells. Studies show the possibility for producing the SWCNTs, tests shown the successful possibility for our aim [5]. In our new studies, we test producing NANOTUBS with other materials for hydrogen storage. Testing and comparing the differences between NANOTUBS need long studies and profound results. The EU H2020 project FASTWATER aims to move shipping towards a clean and renewable fuel: methanol. Methanol, as non-shooting fuel burning at low temperatures, enables an immediate reduction in pollutant emissions (short term), and offers a pathway to a climate-neutral synthetic fuel produced from renewables (long term) [2], [4]."

This paper presents the design, implementation, and preliminary evaluation of an intelligent beehive monitoring system that leverages Internet of Things (IoT) architectures, sensor technologies, and predictive modeling. Key metrics such as temperature, humidity, weight, CO<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf>, and audio signals inside the hive are continuously measured using an Arduino-based platform. The system is powered by solar energy, ensuring autonomous operation in remote conditions, while data are transmitted via GSM to a central database for real-time analysis. The problem addressed is the lack of efficient, continuous, and non-invasive monitoring systems that provide beekeepers with actionable insights without frequent manual inspections, which often disturb colonies and risk harming bee health. Our proposed solution is a modular, scalable, solarpowered IoT-based monitoring system integrated with real-time database and predictive algorithms. Preliminary results indicate that the proposed system helps reduce manual intrusions, thereby minimizing stress on bees and improving colony vitality. Predictive modeling includes supervised learning techniques such as Random Forests for classification of hive states, time-series forecasting models like ARIMA or LSTM networks for predicting temperature and weight trends, and anomaly detection methods such as Isolation Forests for early identification of abnormal behavior including Varroa mite infestations. Compared to existing strategies, this approach offers improved scalability for managing multiple hives, reduced beekeeper workload, and enhanced early anomaly detection capabilities. The integrated web dashboard triggers alerts and suggests interventions, pointing to a sustainable framework for data-driven, non-invasive hive management."

    "abstract": "Family businesses have an important socioeconomic significance for the development of agricultural companies. In a number of families, there is successful interaction between their members, while other family businesses fail due to the reluctance of the next generation to join them. The aim of this article is to examine some elements of the construction of the intra-family business environment. The main tasks are: (1) to examine the family constitution as a tool for establishing intergenerational relationships; (2) to present examples of family businesses from Bulgaria, Iran and Russia; (3) to present an international comparison based on data from the international academic network INTERGEN, collected in the period of 2021-2024, with respect to the intentions of students from those three countries to interact with their relatives. The number of respondents is 1949, which were approached during classes or by Messenger. Our assumption is that students would be interested in the family constitution if they are willing to establish business relationships with their relatives. A key finding is that the family constitution might also be a proper preliminary test about the real intentions of the family members, and it may settle their sustainable business relations in advance. The results from this article could be used for further academic research about sustainable management of intergenerational family businesses."

    "abstract": "In most time-dependent real world phenomena, the distribution of data changes through time. This effect poses challenges to the training of time series Machine Learning models and their prediction results. Algorithms that address this problem, train the machine learning model on a subsequence of the input time series containing recent samples of the distribution, in order to capture the latest state of the distribution. However, estimating the optimal size for the training subsequence is not straightforward. State-of-the-art methods use change point detection algorithms to detect the change points of the distribution and set the most recent change point as the start of the training subsequence. In this paper, we show that this approach is not optimal. Instead, we present an algorithm that retrieves the training subsequence which minimizes the prediction error of the machine learning model. We evaluate our algorithm on two synthetic and four real-world datasets and show that it significantly increases the accuracy of the models."

    "abstract": "Group discussions are common in both private and professional meetings. In such discussions, participants often aim to prioritize options, such as activities or features, based on the group's collective preferences. However, aligning individual preferences within a group can be challenging and may result in dissatisfaction. Group recommender systems address this by aggregating diverse and potentially conflicting preferences. This paper investigates the use of large language models (LLMs) for prioritization in meeting-based group recommendations. We show that LLMs can extract individual preferences from meeting transcripts and generate group-level recommendations without requiring additional manual input. Our user study confirms the feasibility and effectiveness of this approach, highlighting the potential of LLMs to enhance group recommendation workflows within AI-driven decision support systems."

    "abstract": "As embedded processors become increasingly complex, their susceptibility to operational faults, including voltage fluctuations and instruction corruption, poses a significant threat to system reliability. This paper presents a Finite State Machine (FSM)-based Built-In Self-Test (BIST) framework for 32-bit RISC-V processors, capable of autonomously detecting and classifying voltage and opcode faults. Voltage faults are emulated by injecting controlled glitches into the system clock using a randomized Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR)-based mechanism, while opcode corruption is induced by randomly flipping bits in instruction opcodes during pipeline execution. A Moore-model FSM orchestrates test sequencing, fault injection, detection, and system recovery in six operational states. The architecture is implemented in Verilog, synthesized in Xilinx Vivado, and deployed on a Nexys 4 DDR Artix-7 FPGA. Experimental evaluation shows a detection accuracy of 94% for voltage fluctuations and 95.3 % for opcode faults, with minimal hardware overhead-utilization. Compared to traditional BIST schemes, the proposed method enables fine-grained, on-chip fault diagnosis without external instrumentation, making it highly suitable for low-power and safety-critical SoC applications. This work demonstrates that FSM-based BIST not only improves fault detection coverage but also enhances test automation, scalability, and system dependability in modern VLSI environments."

Our experimental results demonstrate that query expansion significantly enhances retrieval performance, particularly for shorter queries and those containing acronyms. The study shows that while expanded queries retrieve more relevant documents, the effectiveness varies with query length and type. We find that shorter queries benefit more from expansion techniques, whereas longer queries show comparable performance with or without expansion.

    "abstract": "The Kannada Vachana literature of 12th-century was composed in nadugannada and had significant philosophical and spiritual insights. However, due to linguistic evolution and changing interpretative traditions, connecting these texts with present-day Kannada language philosophical understanding poses a challenge. In this work, we present a machine learning-based framework to classify Vachanas based on multiple modern interpretations provided by Kannada scholars. We curated a unique dataset comprising 237 Vachanas, each associated with six different scholarly interpretations, amounting to a total of 1422 interpretation samples. Each Vachana is treated as a class, and the interpretations serve as data for training. We used four techniques for transforming the interpretations into vector form: two supervised (Term Class Relevance and Term Frequency–Relevance Frequency), one unsupervised (TF-IDF), and one transformer-based embedding model (Kannada-SBERT). These were evaluated across four classifiers: SVM (with linear, polynomial, and RBF kernels), KNN, Naïve Bayes, and Random Forest. For evaluating classification performance, we used precision, recall, and F-measures. The results show that the combination of Term Class Relevance with SVM (RBF), KNN, and Random Forest achieves superior performance, with F-measures above 0.96. The findings suggest that supervised term weighting measures outperform general-purpose term-weighting measure and transformer-based embeddings for this classification task. This study bridges traditional Kannada philosophical literature with modern machine learning, offering a path to make Vachanas more accessible and interpretable to contemporary audiences."

    "abstract": "The task of ground-based radar monitoring of single small-sized objects of space debris (SD) about 1 cm or less in length, even in low Earth orbits, is extremely difficult due to the requirements of high energy and radar resolution. However, the appearance of small-sized objects is associated with the destruction of larger fractions of SD and therefore, as a rule, these are not single objects. Therefore, it is proposed to consider monitoring of not a single small SD element, but a “swarm” of such small-sized objects. In this case, as a first approximation, we can limit ourselves to determining the values of parameters that characterize the structure of the cloud of small-sized SD objects on average. We use a multi-point model of an extended group target with random statistically independent partial reflectors that fill a certain area of space with small-sized objects randomly distributed throughout the volume of the SD cloud. In the radial direction, the distribution of small-sized fractions of SD corresponds to the Gaussian distribution relative to a certain average value of orbit height. In the longitudinal direction, the distribution of SD elements is equally probable. It is proposed to estimate the average size of a debris cloud from the variance of the altitude (radial) spread of small-sized debris elements, which is determined by the two-frequency cross-correlation function of radar echo signals reflected from a swarm of small-sized fractions of debris. It is shown that with a high angular resolution of a ground-based radar antenna operating in the beam-park mode of vertical sounding, the necessary sensitivity to the radial extent of the cloud of small-sized fractions of SD is achieved [1]. An analysis of the potential accuracy of estimating the radial spread of small elements of a space debris cloud was performed."

Computer-aided diagnosis based on machine learning has become an accessible and suitable tool. However, the majority of traditional models focus on binary classification and utilize multi-step architectures, which are intricate and heavily reliant on human experts. This paper presents deep architectures that eliminate the need for handcrafted feature generation and significantly improve the process for accurate diagnosis. We design and train several enhanced convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based on transfer learning (TL) using smaller datasets to analyze neuroimaging scans and classify them into different AD stages. These CNNs are tested on the ADNI and OASIS benchmark datasets and found to outperform the best TL methods with regard to accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score and area under the ROC curve. The results show that NASNetLarge achieves finest performance, outperforming comparative models such as NASNet-Mobile, Inception-ResNetV2, and InceptionV3."

This paper investigates optimal charging strategies for Battery Electric Heavy Goods Vehicles (BEHGVs) at depots to minimize peak grid loads, transformer overloading, and line congestion, while ensuring vehicles meet operational schedules. Using real-world technical specifications of Scania electric trucks categorized by Gross Train Weight (GTW) and battery capacity, three operational range scenarios (baseline, extended, and long-haul) were modeled for fleet sizes of 25, 50, and 100 vehicles. A simulation framework was developed to optimize the number and rating of chargers, resulting in optimal vehicle-to-charger ratios and depot load profiles. Results demonstrate that managed charging strategies significantly reduce peak load demand compared to unmanaged charging, with a notable improvement in infrastructure utilization (achieving optimal 2.5:1 vehicle-to-charger ratio). The study concludes that strategic scheduling and charger sizing can balance grid constraints, infrastructure costs, and fleet availability, ensuring sustainable large-scale deployment of BEHGVs."

    "abstract": "The accurate prediction of gas mixture concentrations plays a vital role in the development of intelligent electronic nose. However, in most previous studies, time-series data from sensor arrays were randomly shuffled before being split into training and testing sets, leading to data leakage. This practice limits the ability of the model to generalize and accurately estimate the concentrations of unknown gas samples. To address this challenge, we propose a novel hybrid Autoencoder– Deep long short-term memory (LSTM) model that leverages image transformation of multi-sensor data to extract deep features while simultaneously reducing noise and dimensionality using an Autoencoder. These extracted features are then fed into a nonlinear regression Deep LSTM model to accurately estimate the concentration of each gas component within the mixture. Experimental results on both public and private gas mixture datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches in both accuracy and generalization. Specifically, under five-fold cross-validation, our model achieved a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 23 and R-Square (R²) scores of 0.97 for CO, RMSE of 1 and R² of 0.96 for C₂H<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">4</sub>.

Recent advances in quantum hardware have introduced midcircuit measurements and resets, enabling the reuse of measured qubits and thus reducing the qubit requirements for executing quantum algorithms. In this work, we present a systematic study of dynamic quantum circuit compilation, a process that transforms static quantum circuits into their dynamic equivalents with fewer qubits through qubit reuse. We establish the first graph-based framework for optimizing qubit-reuse compilation. In particular, we characterize the task of finding the optimal compilation strategy for maximizing qubit reuse using binary integer programming and provide efficient heuristic algorithms for devising general compilation strategies. We conduct a thorough analysis of quantum circuits with practical relevance and offer their optimal qubit-reuse compilation strategies. We also perform a comparative analysis against state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating the superior performance of our methods in both structured and random quantum circuits. Our framework lays a rigorous foundation for understanding dynamic quantum circuit compilation via qubit reuse, holding significant promise for the practical implementation of large-scale quantum algorithms on quantum computers with limited resources."

    "abstract": "This study investigates the impact of extreme heat on corporate social responsibility (CSR) performance. Drawing on firm-level panel data of Chinese A-share listed firms from 2010 to 2019, we employ a two-way fixed-effects model to empirically test our hypotheses, complemented by robustness checks using alternative extreme heat definitions, extended samples with multiple CSR measures, and instrumental-variable (IV) estimation to ensure the rigor of our results. The analysis yields four key findings. First, extreme heat significantly reduces overall CSR performance, with the impact concentrated in environmental, employee, and supply-chain responsibilities, whereas shareholder and social-contribution dimensions remain largely unaffected. Second, the reduction in CSR is more pronounced among state-owned enterprises (SOEs) than non-SOEs, likely reflecting their broader social obligations that divert resources away from CSR under climate stress. Third, the mediation analysis indicates that this reduction is driven primarily by extreme heat's adverse effect on financial performance, which forces firms to reallocate resources toward short-term survival rather than CSR. Finally, organizational slack and stronger environmental regulation mitigate the negative impact of extreme heat, while green innovation alleviates these effects only when pursued through sustained, long-term efforts, highlighting the importance of cumulative investment in innovation-driven resilience. These findings contribute to the understanding of how persistent climate shocks reshape corporate responsibility strategies and provide actionable insights for policymakers and firms to balance financial pressures with sustainability goals."

    "abstract": "Accurate non-invasive temperature monitoring during liver tumor hyperthermia remains a significant clinical challenge. This study evaluates the use of electrical impedance tomography (EIT) for quantitative temperature mapping in hepatic thermal therapy by incorporating tissue-specific electrophysiological properties. Based on prior characterization of temperature-dependent electrical conductivity (30–90°C, 1 Hz–1 MHz) in murine hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) models, computational simulations were developed to demonstrate EIT reconstructed value-temperature correlations. In vivo validation was conducted using orthotopic HCC mice subjected to infrared laser heating (n=6) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) (n=4), with thermal changes monitored via a custom 16-electrode EIT system operating at 10 kHz. A novel 3D-printed scaffold ensured stable electrode placement on the abdominal surface. Region-of-interest analysis defined tumor, heat affected liver, and distal liver zones. Results revealed strong linear correlations (R²=0.88– 0.93, p<0.0001) between EIT-reconstructed values and thermocouple measured temperatures through tissue-specific temperature-dependent impedance functions. EIT accurately localized thermal lesions and visualized the spatiotemporal evolution of temperature during ablation, with quantification errors of ≤2.8°C (tumor tissue), ≤3.6°C (heated liver tissue), and ≤4.5°C (distal liver tissue), as histologically confirmed. We believe that the technology holds significant potential for improving treatment efficacy in HCC hyperthermia protocols through non-invasive temperature quantification."

    "abstract": "Symbiotic radio (SR) is a promising technology designed to meet the increasing demand for spectrum-efficient communication. However, the small size of backscatter devices (BDs), which are typically equipped with a single antenna, poses challenges in achieving sufficient diversity or spatial multiplexing, thereby hindering the advancement of SR. To address this issue, we introduce fluid antennas (FAs) into SR, enabling devices to dynamically adjust their positions to create a favorable wireless environment and overcome spatial constraints, thereby achieving significant diversity gains. In this paper, we investigate the uplink performance of FA-assisted SR (FA-SR). First, we propose a novel collaborative cancellation channel estimation scheme based on least squares regression (CC-LSR) for scenarios with imperfect channel state information (CSI). We then derive tight lower bound expressions for the channel capacity under both perfect and imperfect CSI cases and formulate the corresponding weighted sum channel capacity (WSCC) optimization problems. The positions of the FAs and the combining vectors are jointly optimized to maximize the lower bound of the WSCC. To solve these problems, we develop joint optimization methods for both perfect and imperfect CSI scenarios using chaotic sequence-based adaptive particle swarm optimization (CSA-PSO). Nevertheless, the high computational complexity of joint optimization poses challenges for practical implementation. To this end, we propose a progressive optimization framework (POF) tailored to both perfect and imperfect CSI scenarios, in which the original problem is divided into three subproblems that are progressively solved to find locally optimal solutions. Numerical results demonstrate that POF significantly reduces computational complexity with minimal performance loss compared to joint optimization methods, particularly under imperfect CSI conditions."

This paper introduces a dynamically tunable optical vortex based on elliptical gold nano-antenna arrays, enabling real-time control over the focal point position of optical vortex. By allowing wavelength-dependent precise adjustments of focal point positions over a range of several micrometers, our method significantly enhances particle manipulation capabilities, compared with traditional static plasmonic tweezers. We demonstrate the generation of far-field optical vortices, achieving effective trapping of nanoparticles with a dynami cally tunable trapping distance up to around 14.7μm from the metasurface, well beyond the near-field limit in conventional plasmonic tweezers. This advancement addresses limitations associated with conventional plasmonic manipulation, such as detrimental thermal effects and confinement to the near-field region. Besides representing a significant progression in nanoparticle manipulation techniques, this innovative platform opens new avenues for applications in optical micro-robotics and advanced material structuring, propelling the field forward and inviting further exploration of tunable optical forces."

We investigate the potential mismatch between familiar visual encodings and tactile perception in an exploratory study into the strategies employed by BLV people to measure com mon graphical primitives converted to tactile representations. First, we replicate the Cleveland and McGill study on graphical perception using swell form printing with eleven BLV subjects. Then, we present results from a group interview in which we describe the strategies used by our subjects to read four common chart types. While our results suggest that familiar encodings based on visual perception studies can be useful in tactile graphics, our subjects also expressed a desire to use encodings designed explicitly for BLV people. Based on this study, we identify gaps between the perceptual expectations of common charts and the perceptual tools available in tactile perception. Then, we present a set of guidelines for the design of tactile graphics that accounts for these gaps.

This paper proposes a spectral filtering technique designed to enhance weak target detection in radar imagery by exploiting the non-dispersive motion model of marine targets in the spectral (k–ω) domain. Assuming uniform motion, the proposed filter effectively suppresses clutter while preserving target signals. The method is specifically implemented for a 24 GHz Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave Multiple-Input Multiple-Output radar system, which enables rapid scene illumination and high temporal resolution without mechanical antenna rotation. The filtering performance of the proposed strategy is validated through both numerical simulations and experimental radar data. Results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly improves detection capabilities under low signal-to-clutter ratio conditions, as confirmed by quantitative metrics and CFAR-based detection analysis."

    "abstract": "Cognitive Frailty (CF), characterized by the co-occurrence of Physical Frailty (PF) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), is increasingly recognized as a critical predictor of adverse health outcomes in aging populations. Despite its clinical significance, early identification of CF remains challenging due to heterogeneous diagnostic criteria and reliance on resource-intensive assessments. This systematic review synthesizes current evidence on sensor-based digital biomarkers for CF detection across eight databases following PRISMA 2020 guidelines. A combined qualitative and quantitative synthesis is conducted based on 20 eligible studies. Key findings reveal that Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) are the most frequently utilized sensors (n = 6 studies), primarily capturing gait and motor function parameters under various functional tasks. Among digital biomarkers, gait features, particularly Stride Length under single-task conditions and Velocity under dual-task or single-task conditions, show significant associations with CF. Body composition metrics, particularly Appendicular Skeletal Muscle Mass Index (ASM), and physical activity parameters, such as Moderate-to-Vigorous-intensity Physical Activity (MVPA), show consistent negative associations with CF, while cardiovascular indices like Cardio-Ankle Vascular Index (CAVI) reveal positive correlations. Eighteen studies develop a total of 23 CF-related models, of which only four focus on predictive classification. These four studies report ten distinct models, with AUCs ranging from 0.696 to 0.911 and accuracy from 0.480 to 0.863. A quantitative synthesis of six models from three studies yields pooled estimates of sensitivity at 0.81 (95% CI: 0.55-0.94) and specificity at 0.80 (95% CI: 0.49-0.95), suggesting moderate-to-good discriminative performance despite notable heterogeneity in diagnostic definitions, sample sizes, sensor types, and modeling approaches. These results systematically map the evolving landscape of digital biomarkers for CF, emphasizing the need for standardized sensor protocols and rigorous validation to advance clinical translation."

This paper focuses on the challenge of joint active terminal detection and channel estimation in multi-user Internet of Things (IoT) access systems based on multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-OTFS. To tackle the sparse reconstruction problem associated with channel estimation, we introduce a novel approach by mapping the conventional proximal gadient descent algorithm (PGDA) into a deep learning-based network, termed PGDA-Net, leveraging deep unfolding theory. In PGDA-Net, the iterative steps of PGDA are unfolded into structured network layers, with each layer representing a single iteration. PGDA-Net not only preserves the theoretical interpretability of the original algorithm, but also exploits the powerful feature learning capabilities of neural networks to efficiently acquire channel state information. Experimental results demonstrate that PGDA-Net outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) channel estimation methods, achieving superior performance in joint active terminal detection and channel estimation for MIMO-OTFS systems, while maintaining low pilot overhead."

    "abstract": "Gravity compensation has been widely employed in lower limb exoskeletons to reduce leg load and alleviate muscle fatigue. Passive compensation approaches offer inherent safety and lightweight advantages; however, existing designs are often constrained by the bulk and complexity of spring-based mechanisms, which compromises the compactness and reliability of the exoskeleton. To address these limitations, a gravity compensation mechanism is developed for a wearable passive bilateral lower limb exoskeleton, featuring a compact, simple, and robust design. A unilateral compensation concept based on a synthetic centroid mapping method is first introduced and then extended to a bilateral configuration through a differential structure. Combined with an adaptive constant-force mechanism, the resulting system maintains structural simplicity and spatial efficiency, making it suitable for wearable applications with limited integration space. An exoskeleton prototype is constructed based on the proposed mechanism, and its performance is evaluated through experiments. The results demonstrate that the proposed system effectively compensates for leg weight during walking while maintaining a lightweight, low-complexity, and structurally robust design."

    "abstract": "Recently, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating external, up-to-date, or domain-specific information through retrieval mechanisms. In their implementation, RAG systems usually rely on vector embedding to identify relevant context from an underlying knowledge base, and have gained widespread adoption across tasks such as question answering and summarization due to their superior performance. Surprisingly, the interplay between embedding quality and RAG performance has not received much attention so far, even though it is commonly perceived as the key factor for influencing retrieval accuracy and the trustworthiness of the generated answer. To fill in this gap, in this paper, we systematically investigate the impact of embedding quality on the overall performance of RAG-based applications. Through a comprehensive performance evaluation of 12 embeddings over two datasets (i.e., a public dataset SQuAD and a private Telecom dataset), we reveal quite different retrieval accuracy levels for these embeddings, while following the same trend on both datasets. For the public dataset SQuAD, there is a strong positive correlation between retrieval accuracy and RAG performance, while this relationship is not as strong in the private Telecom dataset. Our findings highlight that embedding quality is a fundamental yet tricky determinant of RAG systems’ ability to generate trustworthy responses and it should be examined deeply on a case-by-case basis. We open source our full implementation at: https://github.com/Yuejun-GUO/RAG-exp."

The question arises: do large language models (LLMs), which have achieved technological breakthroughs in natural language generation, possess decision-making abilities as humans? The present article lets a series of LLMs do cognitive psychology experiments to explore this hypothesis. More specifically, we first identified a choice problem set and then conducted experiments following the certainty equivalent (CE) paradigm. We find that much of LLMs’ behaviors are consistent with humans: the fourfold pattern of risk attitudes can also be observed across the most LLMs subjects. Particularly, LLMs are risk-seeking and risk-averse for gains with low and high probabilities, LLMs are risk-averse and risk-seeking for losses with low and high probabilities. Furthermore, LLMs subjects exhibit greater rationality in losses than in gains, and less rationality during gains compared to losses. The exponential values of the value function and weighting function, fitted based on the data from LLMs subjects, satisfy the requirements of cumulative prospect theory (CPT). Taken together, these results will further enhance the theoretical foundations to understand the LLMs decision-making capabilities and provide novel tools from cognitive psychology for improving the interpretability of LLMs."

The goal of the future sixth-generation (6G) networks is to implement the internet-of-everything, where the number of URLLC users is expected to reach the order of millions. Intelligent reflective surfaces (IRS) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technologies can enhance the performance of URLLC communications by adjusting wireless channels and allowing multiple users in the same resource block, respectively. In this paper, to manage massive users in IRS-aided NOMA URLLC networks, the resource assignment strategy (including sub-channel allocation, transmitting power selection, and the phases of IRS units) is optimized using a proposed multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)-based algorithm, while meeting the reliability and latency demands of URLLC services. In addition, transfer learning is introduced to reduce learning overheads and enhance the probability of successful access. Our simulation results indicate that the proposed MARL-based approach significantly outperforms baseline methods in terms of the successful access probability for scenarios with massive users."

    "abstract": "Cued Speech (CS) is a visual coding system, which combines lip-reading with several specific hand codings to help hearing-impaired people to communicate effectively. Generating CS videos from audio speech and text can significantly improve accessibility and communication for individuals with hearing impairments. However, existing video generation methods pri marily concentrate on general gestures, such as human walking, and hence are not directly suitable for generating CS videos. Moreover, current approaches struggle to produce realistic, fine grained, personalized videos adhering to specific CS coding rules. To address these challenges, firstly, we propose a Gloss-based Diffusion Pose Generation Model (GlossDiff), where the gloss is a novel CS motion parsing prompt to integrate additional linguistic rules knowledge into the CS pose generation model. The glosses are automatically generated descriptive texts based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to establish a direct and delicate semantic connection between CS gestures and spoken language. Secondly, a Pose-Refined Video Diffusion Model (PRV-DM) is proposed to leverage the generated pose sequences to produce fine-grained and personalized CS videos. Specifically, to address the critical challenges of pose scale mismatches with personalized references, ambiguous lip shape, and hand deformations in generated videos, we introduce a Multi-faceted Pose-Refined Module (MFPR) that contains pose alignment, lip enhancement and hand refinement stages. Furthermore, we record and publish the largest Mandarin Chinese CS dataset (named MCCS-2024), containing seven Chinese CS cuers. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, making it the first diffusion model based approach for generating fine grained and personalized CS videos.

To address this gap, the study aims to identify the optimal team compositions by investigating the match data from the Valorant Champions Tour between 2021 and 2024. It was observed that the teams lack data driven strategies which adapt to agent role changes, map dynamics and meta changes. The study uses quantitative strategies to analyse role distributions and real game performance of Duelists, Controllers, Initiators and Sentinels combinations. The results show that teams that used Duelists with Controllers, Sentinels and Initiators won more often than teams that used only Duelists in 2024. This demonstrates that competitive teams are changing their priorities. The study shows that effective agent roles depend on the map. Duelists are better on Bind and Controllers perform better on Ascent. The findings indicate that Controllers and Initiators were the most popular choices in 2024. The research adds to the knowledge about rolebased success and changing team dynamics in competitive Valorant and it also fills a gap in data driven esports research on strategy and team composition."

Because FIVRs are customized for specific chips, even identical inductor structures require adjustments based on the fabrication process and insertion method. The proposed algorithm evaluates the feasibility of inductor structures by considering their actual geometric constraints and then applies additional constraints to ensure that they remain within a user-defined inductance range. Using data from the structure identification process, the algorithm explores and optimizes structures that exceed the user-defined targets using Bayesian optimization (BO) to derive optimal results. After training, the algorithm can successfully identify inductor structures that meet target specifications and comply with relevant package design rules. Results verified through optimization examples of 5 nH and 2 nH inductors showed that in the 5 nH case, the DC resistance per unit volume decreased by 43.2% and the volume decreased by 24.5% under the same volume conditions. The proposed algorithm is versatile and can be applied to a wide range of inductor structures and designs. It efficiently identifies configurations that meet specific inductance targets. Moreover, the user-defined constraints can be adapted to various processes and insertion methods, enabling the algorithm to adjust to new targets effectively"

    "abstract": "Robotic tool usage still falls short in fine-grained task execution, specifically, learning how to select tools and determine configurations, achieving task compatibility, and enhancing subsequent manipulation remains challenging. Thus, this paper proposes a Graph Attention Grasp (GATGrasp) concept, which is dedicated to establishing a task-aware affordance grasping framework. It integrates a Visual-Language Model (VLM) for tool localization and segmentation across diverse scenes, while employing the GraspNet component to generate 6D candidates. The approach is then devoted to leveraging multimodal semantic and geometric features, learning the spatial relationships between objects and task attributes to address affordance grasp detection. Furthermore, we have also constructed a semantic knowledge graph to encode the mappings of affordance grasping, enabling the designed Graph Attention Network (GAT) to generalize tool usage reasoning for novel tasks under the guidance of semantic information. Evaluations on the TaskGrasp dataset demonstrate that GATGrasp outperforms the established baselines and state-of-the-art methods, while experiments conducted on a real robot further verify the effectiveness of our method in performing taskaware affordance grasps on novel tools."

    "abstract": "Bolt loosening is a significant concern in structural health monitoring (SHM), and the nonlinear wave modulation (NWM) technique shows promise for its detection. However, temperature variations affect piezoelectric sensors, complicating detection. This study examines thermal stress effects on NWM-based damage detection by simulating a beam with boundary loosening under thermal stress. A temperature compensation method was developed to mitigate these effects. A multibolt structure was also analyzed using a hybrid deep learning model combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Dezert-Smarandache Theory (DSmT) for multisensor data fusion. Results show that thermal stress significantly reduces classification accuracy. At 60 °C, the Damage Index dropped to zero, and CNN classification accuracy fell from 87.5% (at 25 °C) to 27.08%. Applying the compensation algorithm restored CNN accuracy to 87.27%. Statistical tests confirmed the compensated results at 60 °C were comparable to those at 25 °C. The DSmT-based fusion model achieved 98.92% accuracy on average, and even at 60 °C, maintained 98.80% accuracy with compensation for a multibolted plate. It combines the probabilistic outputs of multiple CNNs using the PCR6 rule, which redistributes conflicting evidence to improve decision reliability. This fusion strategy effectively handles uncertainty across sensors and significantly enhances classification robustness under temperature variations. In conclusion, thermal stress adversely impacts SHM damage detection, but the proposed compensation method effectively restores performance. Moreover, integrating multisensor fusion with DSmT greatly enhances accuracy, offering a robust solution for SHM in varying thermal environments."

    "abstract": "Feature selection for classification aims to find an optimal subset of original features through minimizing featurefeature redundancy and maximizing feature-class relevance. After estimating redundancy matrix and relevance vector, constructing a constrained optimization problem has become one of the main-stream approaches recently. However, existing methods either involve some tunable parameters or utilize a complicated optimization procedure. In this paper, we propose a parameterfree quadratic programming feature selection model which minimizes redundancy and fixes relevance, where the former is formulated as a minimum of quadratic term associated with redundancy matrix and the latter as a linear equality constraint with relevance vector, plus a non-negative limit. Further, we apply a first-order Frank-Wolfe optimization method with a sub-linear convergence rate to solve our model, where at each iteration there exist an analytical solution for linear programming problem, an analytical step size and three recursive formulae for objective function, solution vector and gradient vector, which dramatically speeds up our optimization procedure. Our solution technique has an empirical time complexity of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$O\\left(D^{2}\\right)$</tex>, where <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$D$</tex> is the number of features. When Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) is to estimate redundancy matrix and relevance vector, our comprehensive experiments on four extremely highdimensional biological data sets show that the proposed method is superior to seven existing main-stream techniques, including mRMR, InfFS, FoANOCCO, FoHSIC, QPFS, HSICLasso and GRM."

This method dynamically selects data that substantially contribute to classification performance based on feedback from machine learning algorithms, thereby constructing optimized microstates templates. In experiments classifying Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and healthy individuals, the iteratively generated microstates templates using this strategy improved classification accuracy from an initial 74.2% to 86.4%. The results demonstrate that the wrapper-based template extraction method effectively reduces the impact of high noise and non-representative data, significantly enhancing the classification performance of EEG microstates templates and providing a new technical approach for EEG microstates analysis and related applications."

    "abstract": "With the advent of autonomous intelligent systems, such as humanoid robots, environmental perception should require rapid and accurate real-time 3D scene interpretation. LiDAR sensors are core and accurate distance measuring components, but it is complicated to process the unstructured, sparse, and unevenly distributed nature of LiDAR point cloud data while meeting the real-time object classification needs. To address the limitations of current 3D LiDAR-based panoptic segmentation methods, we propose a MambaPan3D design. It is a hybrid architecture that integrates Mamba and Transformer models for efficient and accurate 3D point cloud understanding. Our framework solves two key challenges: 1) geometric ambiguity caused by sparse and irregular LiDAR point cloud distributions, and 2) inefficient long-range dependency modeling in largescale scenes. Specifically, CartPolar-KAN embedding, a novel positional encoding strategy, is introduced to interpret between Cartesian and polar coordinates by adding a Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) with learnable B-spline basis functions. The module dynamically fuses multi-coordinate features to overcome the limitations of fixed Bird's-Eye View (BEV) quantization. Additionally, our Mamba-Transformer Decoder combines the global attention capabilities of the Transformer and the linear computational efficiency of the Mamba state-space model to achieve real-time inference while maintaining the global receptive field. Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI dataset demonstrated state-of-the-art performance. The panoptic quality (PQ) could reach 63.3 % in complex urban scenes, i.e., 1.3 % higher than the current optimal baseline method. The proposed framework provides a powerful solution for real-time situational awareness in autonomous driving systems, balancing accuracy, efficiency, and scalability. Our MambaPan3D model offers a robust solution for real-time situational awareness in autonomous systems through balancing accuracy, efficiency, and scalability."

    "abstract": "In project-oriented collaborative learning scenarios, learners are expected to work with heterogeneous group members and make contributions based on their individual skill sets. However, when learners have low expectations about the impact of their skill-based contributions on group outcomes, their motivation tends to decrease, which contributes to common issues in collaborative groups, such as social loafing and freeriding. To solve the problem, this paper introduces a motivation evolution model of learners considering the redundancy of learners' skills within their groups. Based on this model, we define the Collaborative Learning Grouping Problem with Skill Redundancy-Aware Motivation Evolution (CLGP-SR), an NPhard combinatorial problem characterised by a highly structured search space. Given the skill coverage constraints and monotonicity of marginal utility with respect to learner assignments, we propose a backtracking algorithm to exhaustively explore the solution space for small-scale instances with constraint-based and bounding-based pruning strategies. For large-scale instances where exact methods become intractable, we further design a heuristic algorithm in which learners iteratively select suitable groups based on overlap penalty fitness scores. Experimental results on a real-world learner dataset demonstrate that the proposed methods efficiently find optimal solutions for smallscale scenarios and achieve a trade-off between grouping quality and runtime in large-scale scenarios."

In this paper, we compare different types of ViTs (pure, hierarchical, and hybrid) against traditional CNN models across various tasks, including object recognition, detection, and medical image classification. We conduct thorough tests on standard datasets like ImageNet for image classification and COCO for object detection. Additionally, we apply these models to medical imaging using the ChestX-ray14 dataset. We find that hybrid and hierarchical transformers, especially Swin and CvT, offer a strong balance between accuracy and computational resources. Furthermore, by experimenting with data augmentation techniques on medical images, we discover significant performance improvements, particularly with the Swin Transformer model. Overall, our results indicate that Vision Transformers are competitive and, in many cases, outperform traditional CNNs, especially in scenarios requiring the understanding of global visual contexts like medical imaging."

MetaSHAP operates over a vast benchmark of over 09 millions evaluated machine learning pipelines, allowing it to produce interpretable importance scores and actionable tuning insights that reveal how much each hyperparameter matters, how it interacts with others and in which value ranges its influence is concentrated. For a given algorithm and dataset, MetaSHAP learns a surrogate performance model from historical configurations, computes hyperparameters interactions using SHAP-based analysis, and derives interpretable tuning ranges from the most influential hyperparameters. This allows practitioners not only to prioritize which hyperparameters to tune, but also to understand their directionality and interactions. We empirically validate MetaSHAP on a diverse benchmark of 164 classification datasets and 14 classifiers, demonstrating that it produces reliable importance rankings and competitive performance when used to guide Bayesian optimization."

    "abstract": "Prompt learning has demonstrated remarkable performance in tuning Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for various downstream tasks. Recent studies have shown the effectiveness of prompt distillation in transferring distribution knowledge between VLM teachers and students. However, existing prompt knowledge distillation methods are limited in diversity, focusing solely on positive probabilities. In this paper, we propose a dual prompt distillation (DPD) method, which teaches the student from both positive and negative aspects. Specifically, during the first phase of teacher training, the positive and negative prompts are both optimized by constructing complementary probability distribution signals.

The paper examines the features of the stages in the automated ontological description of corporate knowledge and analyzes possible ways to implement this process. As a result of the analysis, the author comes to the conclusion that the main advantages of a uniform structured presentation of corporate knowledge can be realized only if they fully cover the company’s information environment. This can be achieved by developing a specialized Semantic Resource Manager information environment that allows employees of the enterprise, within the framework of a unified user interface, to carry out actions on ontological design and practical use of ontological descriptions at their workplaces.

    "abstract": "In today's data-saturated world, safeguarding information is crucial for enabling fast and secure digital communication. Unauthorized parties must be kept from accessing sensitive data, while ensuring it reaches the intended recipient with preserved confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and availability. Recent advances use DNA's molecular computing traits for cryptography and steganography, utilizing DNA strands as covert carriers. This paper proposes a hybrid scheme combining cryptography and steganography through a residue number system (RNS) and DNA-based encoding. First, plaintext is converted into residues using the moduli set <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\{2n -, 2 n, 2 n+1\\}$</tex>. These residues are then translated into a DNA sequence. To conceal the encrypted DNA, two distinct, randomly-generated reference DNA sequences serve as steganographic masks. The result is a dual-form ciphertextencrypted residues and encoded DNA - that requires less computational overhead and remains inconspicuous to potential attackers. This hybrid scheme has been implemented in Microsoft Excel and will be integrated into the educational process for bachelor students in the Telecommunication Security course during the seventh semester at the University of Ruse."

This study demonstrates a practical approach for optimized sizing of PV-hybrid installations used for powering irrigation systems. It provides practical guidelines for determining the approximate power of the PV modules, the inverter, and the battery storage. Next, simulations have been performed in the PVSyst ver. 8 software to demonstrate the operability of these guidelines. The obtained results showed that the available peak PV power should be oversized by at least 80 % if the consumer operates 5 hours per day. Furthermore, the battery storage should be oversized depending on the required autonomy of the system. Future studies should concentrate on further optimization of PV-hybrid systems in the agricultural sector by integrating different agricultural processes. This would allow utilizing the available PV power in all seasons and would increase the rate at which the investment is returned."

    "abstract": "Drug design is conventionally constrained by the limited chemical diversity present in existing databases. Deep learning-based molecular generation models, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Transformers, show great promise for both de novo and scaffold-based drug design. However, these widely adopted architectures face challenges in fully leveraging their encoding space due to the loss of key molecular features during pooling. Furthermore, modeling long-range dependencies is difficult because of inherent limitations in absolute positional encoding. Here, we present GenPTA, a model that enhances both de novo and scaffold-based molecular generation through an attention refinement mechanism, adaptive positional encoding, and an innovative Memory-cat module. The attention refinement mechanism dynamically extracts the most critical molecular features, improving latent variable expressiveness and ensuring generated molecules possess the desired properties. Meanwhile, the adaptive positional encoding captures complex spatial relationships and global features. Additionally, the Memory-cat module enables spatial sampling near the encoding space of a given molecule, further diversifying generated structures and optimizing design efficiency. Experimental results show that GenPTA achieves the lowest Fréchet ChemNet Distance (FCD) values of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$0.0631 \\pm$</tex> 0.0461 and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$0.4799 \\pm 0.0023$</tex> on classic and scaffold-based reference sets, respectively, indicating strong alignment with reference distributions. It also attains the highest Nearest Neighbor Similarity (SNN) scores of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$0.6278 \\pm 0.0323$</tex> and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$0.5891 \\pm 0.0007$</tex>, reflecting high chemical plausibility. Comparison of GenPTA-generated molecules with the native ligand of Cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1) reveals additional interactions that stabilize the molecular-protein binding, demonstrating the model's potential to enhance affinity. GenPTA's performance in de novo and scaffold-based generation provides an efficient approach for hit discovery and lead optimization, accelerating drug development."

    "abstract": "Prior SFT-based LLM-as-a-Judge suffers from a distributional mismatch between GPT-4 and the smaller opensource language models (SLMs), often leading to overfitting. On-policy methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), attempt to address this limitation by training models using their own outputs. However, conventional GRPO typically rely on randomly sampled data, often selecting negative samples with low model-assigned probabilities-samples that provide weak gradient signals and thus limit learning efficacy. To overcome this, we first establish a theoretical connection by proving that GRPO is equivalent to the margin ranking loss commonly used in metric learning. Building on this, we introduce the first approach to optimize GRPO through hard negative mining, a well-established technique in metric learning. We define hard negatives within the context of LLM-as-a-Judge and propose a simple yet effective strategy for identifying them. We evaluate our method on three out-of-domain datasets and one in-domain dataset. Compared to SFT-based methods, our approach demonstrates superior scalability, which is becoming increasingly important for training on modern, largescale datasets. Specifically, while SFT-based methods struggle to improve performance when scaling from 10 % to 100 % of the training data, our method exhibits consistent improvements across this range. This suggests that current SFT methods may not be well-suited for training generative judges. Furthermore, empirical results show that our approach consistently outperforms larger open-source baselines."

    "abstract": "Information propagation prediction in social networks remains challenging due to the complex interactions between community structures. Existing models typically overlook multi-peaked cascade patterns that emerge from community-specific dynamics, especially during critical early propagation stages. To address these limitations, we propose ComSFI (Community-aware Susceptible-Forwarding-Immune), a dynamic prediction framework that captures both intra- and inter-community information diffusion. ComSFI makes three key contributions: (1) community-specific diffusion modeling through individualized SFI modules, (2) cross-community propagation modeling with a learnable threshold mechanism that identifies cascade initiation timing, and (3) integration of user interest profiles to estimate propagation willingness across community boundaries. Experiments on Weibo, Douban, and Memetracker datasets demonstrate that ComSFI outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 3%-12% in cascade size prediction and temporal pattern accuracy, with particular effectiveness in early-stage rumor propagation prediction—a critical application for timely intervention. Our results establish ComSFI as a versatile framework for analyzing and predicting complex information diffusion patterns in real-world networks."

    "abstract": "Volunteering is a vital pillar of critical infrastructures (CIs) and sustainable development goals (SDGs), fostering, e.g, civil protection or rescue/health/social services. Whether supporting CIs or SDGs, skill-based volunteering is key. Standardized knowledge about skills viable or necessary for certain volunteering opportunities is beneficial in the pre-engagement phase to enable effective skill use as well as in the post-engagement phase to leverage skill gain. It is unclear, however, in how far existing skill classification approaches - currently solely focusing on job postings on the labor market - can handle the nuanced, taskdriven, and prose-like descriptions of predominantly soft skills typical in volunteering opportunities. This paper addresses this gap by presenting a comparison of existing skill classification approaches, initially developed for labor market job postings, in the context of volunteering opportunities. Based on that, we propose using cache- and retrieval-augmented generation techniques for soft skill classification in volunteering, avoiding the high costs of LLM fine-tuning common in current methods. The effectiveness of these lightweight techniques is evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively using a novel soft skill dataset with expert-labeled volunteering opportunities from a global volunteering platform."

    "abstract": "This paper presents the three-arm series capacitor buck converter (SCBC) employing the digital voltage feedback control scheme to mitigate current mismatch among three arms, while achieving low overshoot and fast recovery in output voltage regulation. Conventional control strategies often suffer from an imbalance in the current of the inductor when the duty cycle exceeds 50%. To address this issue, a novel control method is proposed in which one arm operates at a fixed 50% duty cycle, while the other two arms dynamically adjust their duty cycles proportionally to maintain overall current balance among three arms. A digital state-space based voltage feedback controller is implemented to regulate the output voltage. A 36 V–to–10 V, 40 W three-arm SCBC prototype is developed, delivering over 3 A of total output current, achieving less than 8% current mismatch. The experimental results demonstrate a maximum efficiency of 90.2% at a switching frequency of 200 kHz. For a 0.5 A load step, the system exhibits a settling time of approximately 5 msec, with undershoot and overshoot limited to 405 mV and 337 mV, respectively."

The advantages of the fuzzy logic MPPT controller include high accuracy and a fast response speed, particularly when weather conditions change continuously. A PI controller and a bidirectional DC/DC converter are designed to maintain a constant voltage on the DC bus. To prevent overcharging of the battery, a fuzzy logic supervisor is designed.

The method consists of two parts: spectral acquisition and light color calculation. The cosine corrector is used to collect the radiant light within the 180° stereo angle, and the radiant intensity of each sub-fiber is sequentially collected at 5 ms intervals. By calibrating with a standard light source, the XYZ tri-stimulus values and luminous flux of the LEDs are calculated, and the color coordinates and lumen values are determined in the CIE color space. The color coordinate error is less than 0.005 when compared with a high-precision integrating sphere system, confirming the high accuracy and feasibility of the method. This method significantly reduces the equipment size and improves the collection efficiency, providing a new idea for LED light color collection."

    "abstract": "Neuromorphic accelerators, whether asynchronous meshes or globally-asynchronous, locally synchronous (GALS) fabrics, usually devote die area to barrier synchronizers, finely tuned clock trees, and metastability filters to keep spikes in lock-step. How much of that circuitry is truly indispensable? We quantify the intrinsic jitter tolerance of spiking neural networks (SNNs) and show how to push this tolerance further. We introduce a clock offset injector, a single GPU tensor op that time-shifts each core’s spikes by an arbitrary delay, and allows any PyTorch SNN to be stress-tested or hardened without code changes. Vision (N-MNIST) and audio (Spiking Heidelberg Digits) models, trained with and without our proposed offset-aware augmentation, are evaluated across nine skew levels (0-50% of the sample window) and up to eight cores. Baseline N-MNIST stays within ±1 percentage points (pp) until skew reaches 18 ms (6.1%). By accounting for temporally misaligned spikes during training time, we extend survival to 46 ms. Timing-critical SHD collapses beyond 23 ms (9%) but regains 6-9 pp after augmentation. These numbers map out safe envelopes for clock simplification: vision-only workloads can tolerate ≈ 3 ms per hop, while mixed vision-audio workloads must hold skew below 2 ms, or depend on timing-offset aware training. This ultimately shows how to enable lower-effort clocking and using software-level mitigation when needed."

In isolated systems, the most basic configuration often relies on photovoltaic panels and batteries, but this setup faces limitations, especially for long-term or seasonal storage needs. To overcome this, the proposed system incorporates hydrogen storage through a proton exchange membrane electrolyzer, allowing excess solar energy to be converted into storable hydrogen for later use. A comprehensive energy management strategy is developed to coordinate the interactions between the photovoltaic source, the electrolyzer, battery storage, and auxiliary components. The system prioritizes hydrogen production when solar energy is available, while the battery compensates during solar deficits. To protect battery longevity, operation of the electrolyzer is suspended during low state-of-charge conditions until the charge recovers to a predefined limit. Simulation results under various operating scenarios demonstrate the system’s ability to operate autonomously off-grid, maintain energy balance, ensure reliability, and maximize the use of renewable resources."

Activities such as mobile phone use, eating, or talking to passengers significantly impair reaction times and increase accident risk. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown promise in detecting driver distraction from images, existing solutions face key challenges: high computational demands, difficulty in deployment on resource-limited edge devices, inter-class similarity between visually similar behaviors, and data leakage from improper dataset splits.This paper proposes a novel ensemble CNN architecture combining MobileNetV2, ResNet50, and a modified VGG-16, designed to balance efficiency, accuracy, and robustness for real-time edge deployment. The approach integrates techniques to reduce inter-class confusion and applies a driver-exclusive data split to eliminate leakage and improve generalization. Using the StateFarm Distracted Driver Detection dataset, the proposed method achieved high accuracy, strong generalization to unseen drivers, and low computational overhead, demonstrating its suitability for real-world, in-vehicle distraction detection systems."

    "abstract": "This study addresses the challenge of developing a robust $\\mathbf{5}$-class classifier for wildfire risk prediction using a small ($\\mathbf{n} \\boldsymbol{=} \\mathbf{5 7 1}$) and highly imbalanced dataset from north-central Morocco. We present an AI and Internet of Things (AIoT) framework that integrates satellite remote sensing data (IoT) with machine learning (AI) to enhance regional resilience. Through a comparative analysis of two modeling pipelines a Systematic Evaluation Pipeline and a Heuristic Tuning Pipeline we identify a hybrid methodology as the optimal approach. The primary finding is that model performance was fundamentally constrained by the initial feature set; an Enriched Dataset incorporating physically relevant predictors (Soil Moisture, NDWI, and binned Wind Direction) was the single most critical factor in achieving a high-performance model. The final hybrid model, combining a simple, default XGBoost architecture with manually refined class weights, achieved a Macro F1 score of 0.6143. This work contributes a reproducible, generalizable framework for tackling high-complexity, low-sample classification tasks, with direct applications to environmental monitoring and the achievement of UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 11, 13, and 15."

Image preprocessing techniques and the Hough transform-assisted grayscale distribution method are employed to achieve automated localization of multiple target signal regions. The localization accuracy reaches 99.80 %, with an average deviation of 8.735 pixels. A conversion model is developed to translate signal intensity into representative pixel values, and concentration curve fitting is used to quantify the concentrations of target substances, including tumor biomarkers. The system fully integrates into a smartphone application, enabling efficient data processing and visualized output. A cost-effective and portable solution is thereby provided for Point-of-care testing."

    "abstract": "The device performance is improved by introducing a P-type well based on a multilevel trench structure. Although the traditional multi-level trench JBS diode can moderately enhance the breakdown voltage, it has certain drawbacks. For instance, the electric field concentration at the trench edge restricts the breakdown voltage improvement., and there is room for optimization in the forward conduction characteristics. By introducing the P-Well structure at the bottom of the multi-level trench, the electric field concentration effect is effectively alleviated, and the breakdown voltage and forward conduction characteristics of the device are significantly improved. Experimental findings demonstrate that incorporating a P -well has enhanced the breakdown voltage, increasing it from 1326 V to 1967 V. The breakdown voltage is increased by about 640 V."

    "abstract": "Ensemble learning enhances predictive performance and uncertainty estimation by combining outputs from multiple models. However, standard deep ensemble methods often lead to redundancy due to a lack of model specialisation. This thesis proposes Stacked Negative Correlation Learning (SNCL), a novel framework that combines negative correlation learning with stacked generalisation in a concurrent training scheme. SNCL promotes diversity by encouraging ensemble members to specialise in distinguishing between different class subsets, leading to better generalisation and reduced in-domain uncertainty. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, using a consistent CNN architecture differing only in the final layer's output (10 vs. 100 classes), validate SNCL's superiority. The architecture includes three convolutional blocks with ReLU, dropout, and maxpooling layers, followed by fully connected layers. SNCL outperforms traditional methods in classification accuracy, calibration, and out-of-distribution detection, making it a promising solution for scalable, efficient ensemble learning in high-dimensional and safety-critical applications."

Off-chain forecasting and optimization generate dispatch plans; on-chain contracts provide transparent settlement, constraint enforcement (SoC, cycle limits), and profit sharing. The concept targets low transaction latency (minutes) and negligible onchain overhead relative to arbitrage margin. We outline a simulation framework using historical price series, storage models with degradation costs, and compare three governance modes: centralized operator, permissioned blockchain (PBFT/PoA), and public L2 rollup.

In this paper, a system to monitor vital health metrics like heart rate, ECG, temperature, blood pressure, and blood glucose is presented that uses the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense microcontroller. By combining BLE or Wi-Fi connectivity to transmit real-time data to a mobile application, along with ML algorithms for pattern recognition, the system provides the foundation for identifying health risks. SMS, email, or in-app notifications are sent to both healthcare providers and caregivers to enable timely responses. The system’s cloud architecture is integrated as a safe place to store data and also provides access to data from the other side of the globe for healthcare professionals. The reduction of latency in data processing during emergency responses is critical. It lets IoT, real-time analytics, and predictive models form the basis of decision-making, reducing emergency response time and enhancing healthcare outcomes. Predictive analytics allows for more proactive rather than purely reactive health management."

    "abstract": "The rapid expansion of personalized healthcare has positioned wearable electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring systems as a pivotal solution for continuous cardiac assessment. However, achieving real-time signal classification under strict power and resource constraints remains a core challenge for edge-based deployment. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) offer excellent feature extraction capabilities, their intensive computational and memory demands impede efficient implementation on lightweight hardware platforms. To overcome these limitations, we propose a hybrid hardware accelerator integrating a binarized ReActNet backbone for low-overhead feature extraction with an XGBoost decision tree classifier that provides interpretable and hardware-efficient inference. The ReActNet module leverages binary convolution operations to reduce arithmetic complexity, while the XGBoost component replaces dense layers, enhancing model transparency and reducing logic resource usage. To further streamline deployment, we introduce a generative hardware synthesis methodology based on large language models (LLMs), enabling automatic translation of trained XGBoost models into synthesizable VHDL code from their JSON representation. This LLM-assisted workflow significantly reduces development time, eliminates manual RTL coding, and promotes modular, reusable classifier generation adaptable to evolving clinical models. The proposed system is evaluated through RTL-level simulation and synthesis targeting low-power, resource-constrained FPGA platforms, demonstrating its architectural feasibility for real-time ECG classification at the edge. These findings highlight a unified and scalable framework that fuses binary neural networks, interpretable classifiers, and generative AI techniques to accelerate hardware-software co-design and broaden the deployment of edge AI in wearable health applications."

This fact opens up a possibility of generating SPPs by organizing their “direct” excitation near the metal surface, for example, due to stimulated cyclotron emission from electron beams. This can be a way for realization of THz gyrotrons based on selective excitation of SPPs at high cyclotron harmonics inside special open cavities. In this work, a possible scheme of a plasmonic gyrotron is proposed, the simplest theory of electronic cyclotron excitation of a SPP wave in an open cavity is described, and estimates for the starting currents of possible plasmonic gyrotrons are given."

    "abstract": "MANETs have no fixed structure and their network topology changes often, finding the best way to send data is very challenging. The mobile nodes mobility patterns have an impact on routing protocol performance in the mobile networks. This work compares Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) and Destination-Sequenced Distance Vector (DSDV) to understand how well they function in different situations where nodes move. Making use of MATLAB, the simulation helps model and analyze all aspects of the communication protocols. Three particular types of movement models are analyzed: the Random Waypoint Model, the Gauss-Markov Model and the Random Direction Model. They mirror everyday examples of movement and support an analysis of how mobility shapes protocol performance. The main factors to assess how responsive and reliable a protocol is are its Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) and Throughput. The results of the simulations show that protocol performance varies a lot depending on the kind of mobility model used. DSR handles dynamism better than DSDV, but DSDV performs steadier as the nodes move less within a network. Such insights guide the choice of routing strategy for different MANET applications. The study helps increase understanding of mobility-aware protocol design and selection, leading to better and more dependable mobile wireless communication network."

Frequency dependences of the real <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(\\varepsilon^{\\prime})$</tex> and imaginary <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(\\varepsilon^{\\prime \\prime})$</tex> parts of the permittivity were obtained, and materials with the highest absorption capacity were determined."

    "abstract": "As power systems experience higher integration of distributed generation units, it becomes essential to model the network in detail across all voltage levels. Consequently, detailed simulation models are required not only for the transmission network but also for the medium voltage and low voltage distribution network (DN) sub-grids. Additionally, the growing complexity of modern power systems often necessitates integrated co-simulation across multiple platforms, automating analysis and input updates to examine a wide range of scenarios without manual intervention. In this context, this paper implements a Python - DIgSILENT PowerFactory co-simulation on an integrated DN model. Results from two indicative case studies—harmonic load flow analysis and dynamic equivalence modeling—are presented. The detailed DN model, developed in DIgSILENT PowerFactory, along with the Python source code used for handling key functionalities in the co-simulation, has been made publicly accessible."

    "abstract": "Transformation optics (TO) provide a powerful tool to design invisibility cloaks, which can render objects invisible. However, the inhomogeneous and anisotropic constitutive parameters derived from coordinate transformation are difficult to realize. Hence, the invisibility cloaks realized so far are often implemented in a reduced manner at the expense of degrading the cloaking performance. For example, the realized cloaks can only operate under single polarization, hindering the physical implementation of invisibility cloaks. Here, based on Fabry-Pérot (FP) resonance, we propose a general design strategy to realize an omnidirectionally matched and polarization-independent anisotropic metamaterial. Such metamaterial, constructed by perfect electric conductor (PEC) and natural materials, has an anisotropic spatially permittivity tensor. By employing appropriate transformations and combinations of such anisotropic material, we design an omnidirectional cloak with polarization constraints being totally lifted. The numerical simulation results validate that the designed invisibility cloak exhibits excellent invisible performance for unpolarized waves under arbitrary incidence angles. The design strategy paves the way to realize other unpolarized TO devices."

By interlacing the open stubs of a pair of PLTL and inserting U-shaped metal structures with opposite opening directions in sequence, this design can increase the mutual capacitance between microstrip lines and slightly increase the self-inductance. Simulation tests were conducted on microstrip lines with different spacings, and the comparison results show that the far-end crosstalk of the microstrip lines is greatly suppressed in the <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$1-20 \\text{GHz}$</tex> range, while the near-end crosstalk is increased to a certain extent. The conclusion is applicable to the routing between devices on conventional PCBs. The overall structure does not involve the design of vias and substrate materials, and has the advantages of low processing difficulty and cost compared with common ground guard lines and film structures."

Artefacts such as background noise and reverberation can negatively affect students' attention, memory, and comprehension. With the growth of distance learning and immersive technologies such as virtual and augmented reality, the importance of high-quality audio becomes even more critical. A possible way to address acoustic interference is through denoising and speech separation. A central component in addressing reverberations is room impulse response. It contains information about sound reflections and material properties making it an essential asset in classroom design, speech transmission improvement, and immersive simulations. This paper reviews applications and research works in various educational contexts, from acoustic treatment of classrooms to speech quality in distance learning and usage in diverse virtual reality simulations. Furthermore, this work reviews different methods for obtaining RIR, ranging from classical measurement techniques to modern machine learning approaches. Finally, the paper outlines opportunities for integrating acoustic modelling into educational practices to improve their effectiveness, quality, and accessibility."

Simulation shows that the proposed scheme reliably detects total and partial LOF conditions. Comparison of the proposed LOF scheme with other promising LOF protection methods, as well as with the conventional offset mho protection relay, shows that the proposed scheme detects LOF failures faster than the other methods, whereas it does not maloperate for external system faults."

    "abstract": "Deep models have demonstrated outstanding performance in time series prediction. However, due to the existence of some observational characteristics in real-world application scenarios, focusing only on the target variables (the named autogenous variables) is usually insufficient to ensure the accuracy of the prediction. It is worth noting that a system is often recorded by multiple variables, among which allogenous variables could offer important external information for autogenous variables. Therefore, unlike the mature multivariate or univariate prediction paradigms that treat all variables at the same extent or ignore allogenous information, we are going to focuses on a more detailed setting: time series prediction with allogenous variables, which allogenous variables is the main focus. We propose a novel method, Tsmixing, which enables the standard Transformer to coordinate autogenous and allogenous information through ingeniously designed embedding layers, while simultaneously applying fragment-level self-attention and variable-level cross-attention mechanisms. Furthermore, by learning global autogenous markers, this method effectively Bridges the implicit causal information of allogenous sequences to autogenous time segments."

The influence of the inverter parameters and system configuration on the performance of PV systems are studied through simulation with System Advisory Model (SAM). Many different PV system configurations are created and their results compared. The main conclusions are that the main selection criteria of an inverter are the reliability, the required functionalities, depending on the requirements of the project, the price, and secondary the efficiency. Generally, the PV string maximum DC voltages at standard testing conditions (STC) must be either close to the upper inverter maximum power point taking (MPPT) voltage limit or higher, if it supports certain level of oversizing. More precisely, the optimal design of a PV system requires the maximum power point voltage of each PV string at STC to be equal or higher than the recommended nominal MPPT voltage of the selected inverter, if such value is presented by the producer."

    "abstract": "Many real-world applications rely on land surface temperature (LST) data at high spatiotemporal resolution. In complex urban areas, LST exhibits significant variations, fluctuating dramatically within and across city blocks. Landsat provides high spatial resolution data at 100 meters but is limited by long revisit time, with cloud cover further disrupting data collection. Here, we propose DELAG, a deep ensemble learning method that integrates annual temperature cycles and Gaussian processes, to reconstruct Landsat LST in complex urban areas. Leveraging the cross-track characteristics and dual-satellite operation of Landsat since 2021, we further enhance data availability to 4 scenes every 16 days. We select New York City, London and Hong Kong from three different continents as study areas. Experiments show that DELAG successfully reconstructed LST in the three cities under clear-sky (RMSE = 0.73-0.96 K) and heavily-cloudy (RMSE = 0.84-1.62 K) situations, superior to existing methods. Additionally, DELAG can quantify uncertainty that enhances LST reconstruction reliability. We further tested the reconstructed LST to estimate near-surface air temperature, achieving results (RMSE = 1.48-2.11 K) comparable to those derived from clear-sky LST (RMSE = 1.63-2.02 K). The results demonstrate the successful reconstruction through DELAG and highlight the broader applications of LST reconstruction for estimating accurate air temperature. Our study thus provides a novel and practical method for Landsat LST reconstruction, particularly suited for complex urban areas within Landsat cross-track areas, taking one step toward addressing complex climate events at high spatiotemporal resolution. Code and data will be available at skrisliu.com/delag."

The frequency diversity inherent in TDI is leveraged to improve the bit error rate (BER) of NOMA by mitigating the detrimental effects of channel frequency selectivity. The instantaneous signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the proposed system is derived and used to evaluate the BER using minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) equalization semi-analytically with spatial diversity over frequency-selective fading channels for an arbitrary number of users. Moreover, a tight analytic lower-bound (LB) is derived to enable efficient BER evaluation. The obtained analytical results, corroborated by Monte Carlo simulation, demonstrate that TDI can provide significant BER improvement to NOMA by resolving the performance degradation caused by severe fading and multi-user interference. The synergy of receiver spatial diversity and TDI enabled the low-complexity zero-forcing (ZF) equalizer to offer BER that is comparable to MMSE, which is drastically different from the single-input single-output (SISO) case."

This paper explores a high-performance Bloch surface wave sensor based on an optimized one-dimensional photonic crystal structure for ultra-sensitive refractive index detection. The sensor architecture consists of a periodic stack of TiO₂ and SiO₂ layers with a TiO₂ cap layer, designed using the transfer matrix method to operate in aqueous environments. Through numerical simulations and theoretical analyses, we systematically engineer the photonic bandgap structure to achieve enhanced field localization and low transmission loss. A Kretschmann-Raether prism coupling setup with precision angular control is employed to experimentally validate the device's exceptional performance. The narrow resonance feature (FWHM = 0.036°) and high quality factor (Q > 1480) confirm excellent sensing capabilities, demonstrating high sensing sensitivity and an intensity-based detection resolution of 4.51 × 10⁻⁷ RIU.

While the individual impact of user cache sizes or file popularity has been investigated independently, their joint impact on coded caching remains unclear.

    "abstract": "Time series Semi-Supervised Classification (SSC) aims to improve model performance by utilizing abundant unlabeled data in scenarios where labeled samples are limited. Previous approaches mainly focus on exploiting temporal dependencies within the time domain for SSC. However, these temporal dependencies are susceptible to sampling noise and may not effectively capture the global periodicity of features across categories. To this end, we propose a time series SSC framework called CompleMatch, leveraging the complementary information from both temporal and frequency representations for unlabeled data learning. CompleMatch simultaneously trains two deep neural networks based on time-domain and frequency-domain views, with pseudo-labels generated via label propagation in the representation space guiding the training of the opposing view's classifier. In this co-training paradigm, we incorporate a constraint term to harness the complementary nature of temporal-frequency representations, thereby enhancing the model's robustness under limited labeled data. In addition, we design a temporal-frequency contrastive learning module that integrates supervised and self-supervised signals to enhance pseudo-label quality by learning more discriminative representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CompleMatch surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, analyses of model behavior (i.e., ablation studies and visualization) underscore the effectiveness of our proposed approach."

    "abstract": "The use of the traditional implementation of finite control set model predictive control (FCS-MPC) in power converters often results in high switching frequencies, leading to increased losses and reduced efficiency. Unlike conventional modulation techniques, such as pulse width modulation, the switching behavior of FCS-MPC is highly variable, complicating loss estimation. This study proposes a method that uses losses, estimated through simulation, to tune the weighting factor of a switching reduction term in the cost function to obtain a response with reduced losses and acceptable total harmonic distortion (THD). The proposed approach considers both conduction and switching losses and takes into account the predicted temperature of the power switch while estimating the losses. This approach improves efficiency by directly addressing the challenge of nontrivial switching patterns, offering a more effective solution for FCS-MPC implementation in two-level three-phase inverters. Simulation results in a 22 kW inverter model show that it is possible to reduce the switching losses by more than 30% while still keeping the THD below 5%."

To enhance practical applicability, uncertainties and stochastic disturbances are also considered. Based on the IT-2 Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy Model (T-SFM), the nonlinear rolling motion under uncertainties can be captured in a more complete manner. Corresponding to the T-SFM, an Interval Type-2 (IT-2) fuzzy controller is developed to drive the fin stabilizers for the control of ship rolling motion. Then, the closed-loop T-SFM is reformulated into a reduced fuzzy rule form. Moreover, the covariance matrices and corresponding variance constraints are further constructed from an energy-based perspective for each subsystem of the closed-loop T-SFM. By integrating the IT-2 fuzzy control method, covariance control theory, and Lyapunov theory, stability criteria are established through the use of an upper bound matrix, which also allows the stability conditions to be transformed into Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs). Finally, the simulation results of the nonlinear ship rolling motion control using fin stabilizers are presented to verify the performance of the IT-2 fuzzy covariance control under uncertainties and stochastic disturbances."

    "abstract": "This paper concentrates on image enhancement in underwater environments, which is important for tasks like surveillance, navigation, and exploration of marine wildlife. Underwater images usually suffer from light scattering, color distortion, and uneven illumination, which hinders visual assessment. Although several enhancement techniques have been developed, but there is still no comprehensive assessment done in various real-life lighting scenarios. This research work fills that gap by applying and evaluating a hybrid enhancement model to images taken from an aquarium with a bright lighting effect and an open well lit with natural sunlight, capturing low, bright, and mixed lighting conditions. The model includes the CLAHE method and the CNN-based model. The former is well known for enhancing the local contrast, while the latter is dedicated to improving the image clarity and detailing the various structures within the image. Evaluation of performance was carried out using peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). Findings indicate that while boosting contrast, CLAHE's speed and efficiency outperform its complex degradation handling capabilities. The other method, which employs a CNN model, consistently offers better visuals in addition to higher PSNR under various brightness conditions."

    "abstract": "The automation sector has improved accuracy, speed, and scalability, fundamentally changing production processes. The automation of cutting, milling, and engraving processes has been made possible in large part by Computer Numerical Control (CNC) devices. However, because of their prohibitive cost, enormous size, and limited accessibility for small users like hobbyists, small businesses, and educational institutions, traditional CNC machines typically pose significant challenges. This paper introduces a solution in the form of an affordable-priced and portable CNC machine to overcome these challenges. The suggested CNC system combines cost-effectiveness with performance, with a minimalist approach that enables easy assembly and operation. With cost-effective materials such as stepper motors, the RAMPS 1.4 control board, and a light frame, the machine is optimized for economical production with performance standards intact. It is the perfect tool for small-scale manufacture, prototyping, and instructional applications because of its simplicity of use and tiny size. By successfully bridging the gap between individual makers' creative requirements and industrial-grade automation, the system allows users to access CNC technology without significant financial or space barriers. This innovation aims to democratize access to contemporary manufacturing technologies by offering a scalable solution that makes automated fabrication capabilities more accessible to a wider range of individuals. This will encourage creativity and innovation across a wide range of applications, from small scale manufacturing to hobbyist projects."

Recent years have seen the rise of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to build translation systems. This project focuses on developing Speechto-Indian-Sign-Language Translation system using NLP techniques. The simple easygui system shows a pop-up window to the user to select the language in which the user wants to speak: Hindi or English. It then uses a speech-to-text conversion library to convert the speech into text as input to the program. After that text is tokenized, lemmatized and stop word removed through various steps of NLP to ensure better accuracy of system etc. The extracted form is then used to find a folder with Indian Sign Language gestures in MP4 format. The program shows the gesture for each word in the text. When a word is not present in the folder you break it down into letters and represent them using Indian Sign Language alphabet. The objective of this system is to create an effective tool for the speech-impaired community to communicate with greater ease in such environments where speech is the only method of communication. The combination of NLP techniques with Indian Sign Language gestures improve both the accuracy and efficiency of the system. Through the easygui, the system interacts with the user through a friendly interface. Audio files are transcribed using the Google Speech-to-Text API and the text is then matched to the appropriate audio file. Finally, it looks for matching mp4 file of the transcribed text in a lo of mp4 files, and the rest of the image files for the words not in the ISL dataset. This work sheds light on the potential of speech recognition tasks, and also serves as a practical guide for the implementation of speech recognition technology across multiple fields."

    "abstract": "A key requirement resulting from the increased adoption of Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIOT) networks is the improvement of anomaly detection systems against cyber threats. The traditional centralized model suffers from several limitations such as scalability issues, high latency, privacy concerns, and low adaptability to evolving threats. It is hard to generalize the accurate anomaly detection in all the industry domains for which the existing deep learning has been produced because they have been designed or trained with respect to individual industries. Moreover, these algorithms are either time-consuming or consume higher latency to be used at the edge in real-time. To solve these challenges, this study proposes a Hybrid Federated Contrastive Graph Transformer Framework, which integrates multiple advanced deep learning and machine learning models designed for scalable, real-time, and privacy-preserving anomaly detection in IIoT environments. The Federated Contrastive Graph Transformer Network (Fed-CGTN) yields privacy-preserving anomaly detection due to federated learning, graph transformers, and contrastive learning, consuming 62% less bandwidth while maintaining 98.2% accuracy. To enable low-power real-time execution, the proposed framework incorporates Spiking Temporal Graph Neural Networks (S-TGNN) into the framework, which results in a 74 % reduction in energy consumption and latency of less than 5 ms. The domain-generalization of the DA-MMGAN improves cross-domain generalization through synthetic anomaly generation and increases the <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\text{F 1}$</tex>-score by <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\text{1 4. 3 \\%}$</tex>. The Meta-Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Cyber Threat Detection (Meta-RL-ACTD) continuously updates threat-detection strategies to dynamically adapt to emerging threats. It achieved a 92.7 % detection probability for zero-day attacks with a 63 % reduction in retraining frequency sets. Finally, the Hierarchical Hybrid Deep Learning Model (HHDL) integrates CNN, LSTM, and the Autoencoder to complement each other into a comprehensive multi-layered threat classification. The integrated scheme provides scalability, energy-efficiency, privacy-preservation, cross-domain adaptiveness, and real-time adaptive cybersecurity in IIoT networks. The proposed framework will bring significant contributions to the enhancement of IIoT security by providing robust anomaly detection and more optimized computational and communication efficiency."

The precoding in PAC codes has demonstrated an effective reduction in the number of minimum weight codewords (a.k.a error coefficient) of polar codes. This reduction potentially improves the error correction performance significantly. From a codeword formation perspective, this reduction has limitations. Capitalizing on the understanding of the decomposition of minimum-weight codewords, this paper proposes a new coding scheme called reverse PAC (RPAC) codes that can effectively reduce minimum-weight codewords more than in PAC codes. Additionally, we propose a look-ahead list decoding for the RPAC codes, which maintains the same order of complexity as list decoding in PAC codes. Numerical results demonstrate that RPAC codes achieve significant improvements in block error rate over polar and PAC codes, especially in high-rate short-code scenarios where existing schemes are less effective."

    "abstract": "Distributed radar networks (DRNs) can improve target detection by fusing the spatially diverse echoes from multiple receiving stations. However, this potential is limited by the communication burden and the spatial correlation of echoes. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a flexible hierarchical collaborative scheme for moving target detection in DRNs. The proposed scheme supports operating in coherent, noncoherent, and hybrid modes, providing a configurable trade-off between detection performance and communication demand. In particular, the hybrid mode provides an intermediate collaboration strategy between coherent and noncoherent modes. The collaboration design problem is generally non-convex due to the orthogonality constraint. Therefore, a stacked-product Riemannian conjugate gradient algorithm is developed to configure the collaboration matrix, allowing efficient fusion of radar echoes. Additionally, a multi-constraint k-medoids clustering-based topology design is proposed to organize radar nodes into effective cooperative groups based on echo correlation and communication cost. Analytical detection thresholds are derived for each detection mode to ensure a prescribed false-alarm rate under correlated observations. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of all three detection modes, showing up to 55% lower communication overhead compared to the non-collaborative fusion."

We construct an explicit quadratic Lyapunov function and demonstrate that it must be diagonal in physical coordinates, revealing that certain quadratic Lyapunov functions effective in non-viscous cases become inadequate when viscosity is introduced.

    "abstract": "Quantization and chroma downsampling are two primary operations that introduce distortions in the JPEG compression. However, most existing blind methods treat artifacts removal as a direct mapping from compressed images to clean ones. They fail to explicitly model the underlying degradation process or design targeted compensation mechanisms. As a result, these methods can only partially remove compression artifacts and struggle to generalize to diverse or unseen degradation scenarios. In this work, we present a novel perspective that formulates artifacts removal as an approximate inversion of the lossy steps in JPEG. Based on this view, we propose an Inverse JPEG Compression Network (IJCN), which aims to progressively compensate for quantization errors and color distortions. Specifically, we first design a Learnable Offset Guidance Module (LOGM) to approximate inverse quantization by modeling both intra-block and inter-block coefficient correlations for predicting rounding offsets. In addition, we propose a Quantization Table Guidance Module (QTGM) that leverages the quantization tables to guide the reconstruction network in mitigating color distortions. By modeling compensation mechanisms under the guidance of quantization tables, IJCN effectively eliminates artifacts across varying compression levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IJCN outperforms existing methods in both quantitative metrics and visual quality."

    "abstract": "Efficient keyframe extraction is critical for effective video summarization and retrieval, yet capturing the complete richness of video content remains challenging. In this work, we present keyframe extraction and yeilding summaries (KEYS), a novel tri-modal framework that effectively integrates perceptual cues from color features in the CIELAB space, deep structural embeddings derived from ResNet-50, and semantic context from frame-level captions generated by Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct. By fusing these diverse modalities using principal component analysis, KEYS constructs robust multi-modal embeddings that enable adaptive segmentation of video content via HDBSCAN clustering. A subsequent refinement stage incorporating quality assessment and duplicate filtering ensures that the final keyframe set is both concise and semantically rich. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets TVSum20 and SumMe demonstrate that KEYS achieves state-of-the-art performance, substantially outperforming traditional unimodal and previous multi-modal methods. These results underscore KEYS's ability to capture nuanced visual and semantic information, thereby setting a new benchmark for video content understanding in large-scale retrieval scenarios."

    "abstract": "This study presents an innovative technical solution for restoring longitudinal connectivity at small dams, funded by a National Research Grant (GnaC ARUST 2024-UTCB-21). The work addresses a critical gap in hydrotechnical design by proposing a hybrid fish passage that can operate under a variable ecological flow regime, as mandated by H.G.148/2020. This solution integrates a bypass system to guide fish around the dam, thereby ensuring the mobility and upstream migration of ichthyofauna. The design's primary objective is to maintain current velocities compatible with target species (trout, grayling, chub, etc.) across high, medium, and low hydrological regimes. This ensures the passage remains functional despite fluctuating reservoir levels, offering a comprehensive and efficient solution for modern ecological flow management. The research study resulted in the development of a hybrid fish passage structure, which ensures optimal parameters for longitudinal connectivity by integrating sequentially, a technical fish pass, a fish bypass tunnel, and an open fish bypass channel. The technical fish pass is equipped with side valves that can be individually opened to allow water inflow at various reservoir levels, a feature that directly addresses a major limitation of traditional fish passes."

This work focuses on determining the equivalent line parameters, such as propagation constants, attenuation constants, and propagation mode dispersion, which are crucial for characterizing line performance across various operational frequencies.

    "abstract": "Efficient and accurate mapping of flooded areas is of great significance for emergency response and flood risk assessment. Satellite-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) provides a data source for flood mapping with all-weather and day-and-night capabilities, as well as high spatial resolution and relatively high temporal resolution. This study addresses the challenges in accurate flood mapping by considering both local and global information, as well as maintaining low computational complexity in flood analysis from SAR imagery. To achieve these goals, we propose a deep learning model named CMFS-UNet, a CNN-based encoder-decoder architecture for extracting local image features, along with a Mamba-based encoder for integrating global information for flood mapping in dual-polarization Sentinel-1 SAR imagery. This model introduces two improvements: (1) a Vision Mamba module is integrated into the third layer of the encoder in a lightweight UNet with three skip connections, specifically designed to extract global features; and (2) residual connections are added to all convolutional layers to further enhance detail extraction, improve feature interaction, and facilitate the fusion of global and local information. The proposed CMFS-UNet is applied to a nationwide dataset of bitemporal and dual-polarization SAR imagery collected from 2015 to 2024 in Bangladesh. Experimental results indicate that the CMFS-UNet outperforms the existing and competitive models, including UNet, ResUNet, and TransUNet. Specifically, CMFS-UNet achieves the highest mIoU(79.41%), Accuracy (92.07%), and F1 score (81.23%) in different testing datasets, demonstrating its superior capability for feature extraction and information fusion while maintaining lower computational complexity, as evidenced by the 49.19 billion floating point operations (49.19 GFLOPs) required for a single batch of images during inference with one forward propagation. The proposed model thus provides an efficient and effective solution for flood detection using SAR imagery."

Participants were randomly assigned to either a dynamic version of the Realistic Evaluation and Appraisal of Cognitive sTress (REACT-D), featuring a realistic video-based evaluating committee, or a static version (REACT-S) with noninteractive facial images. During the interview preparation phase, behavioral performance (Stress regulation and Stress resistance scores), response times, EEG activity, and autonomic indices were recorded. The REACT-S group showed higher stress regulation scores, likely due to the reduced temporal and sensory complexity of the static condition. EEG analyses revealed decreased lowfrequency (delta, theta, alpha) activity and increased gamma power in the REACT-D group, indicating greater cognitive and attentional demands. Additionally, skin conductance response (SCR) was significantly higher in the REACT-D group, reflecting increased emotional engagement. These findings suggest that the degree of sensorimotor realism in digital social evaluation contexts differentially influences cognitive load, autonomic arousal, and regulatory efficiency."

    "abstract": "Accurately predicting electromagnetic scattering from extensive ground profiles plays a crucial role in remote sensing applications; however, the associated computational cost of the inherent numerical techniques may become prohibitive. For computing the scattering from one-dimensional random rough surfaces, we developed distinct parallel implementations of the MoM-based solver targeted to different heterogeneous architectures, including (shared-memory) multicore CPUs and manycore GPUs, and (distributed memory) multinode architectures. For solving dense linear systems of equations in parallel with LU factorization on diverse heterogeneous architectures, we adopt state-of-the-art mathematical libraries developed in academia for numerical computation (such as PLASMA, MAGMA, and ScaLAPACK). The three selected libraries can somehow be considered parallel counterparts of the popular Linear Algebra PACKage (LAPACK) library. Representative case studies are explored, and inherent numerical results obtained by using the implemented solvers for diverse computing architectures are illustrated. The parallel performances achievable with the developed prototype solutions are also experimentally assessed and comparatively discussed, thus demonstrating inherent speedup and scalability. Therefore, the developed parallel prototypes enable the efficient use of the available degrees of parallelism to achieve faster solutions, explore scattering phenomena at higher resolutions, or simulate scattering from electrically large surfaces with greater fidelity. This investigation paves the way for the efficient computation of scattering from complex and layered structures in large-scale supercomputer simulations."

To achieve prior attitude estimation, the proposed system utilizes Particle Filtering (PF) instead of simple Kalman Filter (KF) or Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) or Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). The fused data has been acquired from three major sensors accelerometer, magnetometer, and gyroscope. This collected data is often prone to errors due to rugged and marshy land terrain and complex underwater conditions. Unfortunately, this harsh environment is a non-linear system for the amphibious robot and may cause eccentric data deviations due to various natural factors in the operating environment and other data deviations due to the robot’s circuit interferences, and mechanical vibrations within the robot itself. Hence, for detection and compensation Gaussian based linear system filtering algorithm such as KF or EKF or UKF is not effective. Moreover, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm a simulation experiment is conducted on test bench in both stable and active state, and attitude detection is performed."

The main problem is locating the landmarks in their accurate place then finding the measurements in skull to recognize gender, predict population type, and predict landmarks placement. Most current research use 2D Computed Tomography (CT) image to locate landmarks in their place and that lead to less accuracy to calculate the cranial measurements. The aim of this research is to build an electronic medical assistance for calculating the cranial measurements based on accurate 3D coordinates that relies on meshgrid model which converts 2D skull’s medical image into 3D version. Based on the calculated measurements, traditional classifiers such as Random Forest classifier, logistic regression, Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to model for automatically predict gender and population type from the skull’s medical image. Furthermore, the suggested model can be used to detect accurate landmarks for new images to enhance the recognition accuracy. In comparing to a state-of-the-art works for gender recognition, the suggested model achieving 99.62 % accuracy in its prediction in comparison to highest previous work which achieved 96 %."

To this end, the paper proposes an intelligent system based on an anticipatory architecture designed to support optimal decision-making and efficient operation of a nuclear microreactor deployed at a maritime port. The system integrates learning Gaussian processes for predictive modeling and fuzzy logic inference for decision-making. Evaluation results on a set of simulated scenarios demonstrate the potential of microreactors to serve as integral components of the port's energy infrastructure. Furthermore, comparisons with a constant power output approach highlights the superior performance of the proposed intelligent system."

Subjective measures were collected using the NASA-TLX, the User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ), and the Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM). Results showed that both collaborative conditions (HH and HR) significantly reduced perceived workload compared to the HA condition, with the cobot particularly effective in lowering mental demand and effort. The HR condition also led to higher ratings of attractiveness, stimulation, and originality, along with greater emotional engagement.

    "abstract": "Robotics, automation, and artificial intelligence are rapidly transforming the modern workforce, drawing increasing interest from students across disciplines. To prepare students for this evolving landscape, Mississippi State University has adopted a research-driven, project-based learning model that goes beyond traditional classroom instruction. This approach emphasizes active engagement through hands-on projects that cultivate industry-relevant technical skills. By introducing students to core Robot Operating System (ROS) libraries, the industry standard for developing autonomous systems, we provide them with the foundational tools needed to tackle real-world challenges. This paper presents key outcomes from two representative projects: a classroom interface initiative where student teams develop deployable control systems for autonomous platforms and a RC car-based project where students implement robust localization algorithms using LiDAR sensor data. These projects not only reinforce theoretical knowledge but also bridge the gap between academic learning and industrial practice, equipping students with the tools to thrive in a technology-driven future."

Experimental results showed that GBR achieved a power conversion efficiency of 95.7% under AM 1.5 irradiance (1000 W/m<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>), which was much higher than XGBoost of 73.5%.In addition, the accuracy of GBR was better than that of XGBoost (MAE = 0.18888) and presented higher robustness and more rapid convergence speed in the rapid fluctuation of irradiance. These results demonstrate the performance of GBR in real-time MPPT and the benefits of using ensemble learning strategies in intelligent solar energy harvesting."

    "abstract": "Recently, deep learning methods have achieved great success in the intelligent fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. Of these, one-dimensional deep convolutional neural networks (1D-DCNNs) often perform very well in analyzing vibration signals, especially when there is abundant data and balanced health conditions. However, in practical applications, there is limited data, making 1D-DCNN models either too deep, leading to overfitting, or too shallow to extract meaningful features. Additionally, fixed-size filters cannot allow the model to capture adaptively diverse and critical patterns. Furthermore, most of them have some flaws in mining rich multi-scale features and are prone to being affected by noise and redundancy. To this end, a novel multi-kernel size 1D-DCNN combined with a Convolutional Block Attention Module, called MKS-1D-DCNN-CBAM, for fault diagnosis in rotating machines is developed. The highlights of the contributions of this framework include: (1) MKS convolution blocks-adopt a broad range of temporal scales, featuring concurrently both small and large kernel sizes to enlarge the effective receptive field; (2) CBAM is conducted after each block to highlight the most informative features; and (3) integrated batch normalization and dropout for each block to improve training stability and convergence, and mitigate overfitting. The experimental verification using the Case Western Reserve University motor dataset proved that the presented framework performed better than the existing techniques. The respective diagnostic accuracies of 100%, 99.92%, 100%, and 100% have been achieved under various loads (0-3hp), respectively. These results reflect the reliability and robustness of the model, hence showing significant progress in this domain."

    "abstract": "For decades, enterprise information systems have been designed around separation into layers - data models are defined independently of business processes, and user interfaces are treated as an afterthought. Yet in business reality, these dimensions are inseparable: a business object is not a static collection of attributes, but an evolving entity whose identity, behavior, and representation form one holistic whole. This gap between how business understands reality and how IT models it has created what may be called the Great Divide of digital design. This paper explores Object-Centric Processes (OCP) as a paradigm that reunites data, processes, and forms into a single coherent model of business reality. By treating objects as both carriers of information and drivers of behavior, OCP provides a natural bridge between conceptual understanding and executable system design. We illustrate this approach through the Petriflow language, which captures the state, lifecycle, and interactions of business objects in an integrated, model-driven way."

ARGOS is being developed to address the current lack of integrated systems capable of indexing, interpreting, and retrieving large volumes of heterogeneous, georeferenced drone imagery in a traceable and intelligent manner. Building on a robust scientific and technical foundation, the proposed architecture includes a modular Data Management System (DMS), a metadata tagging and classification protocol, and a multi-agent AI validation layer interacting with non-proprietary large language models (LLMs). The system design prioritizes explainability, interoperability, and long-term scalability. Although still in the early development phase, ARGOS is structured to support future applications such as anomaly detection and environmental change tracking by combining structured data organization through its internal DMS, intelligent metadata tagging, explainable AI-based querying via external LLMs, and real-time multi-agent consistency checks. These components are designed to operate across diverse spatial and temporal datasets, enabling advanced analysis and transparent knowledge extraction in geophysical and environmental monitoring contexts."

The designed antenna consists of a modified patch radiator and a partial ground plane with a square notch. The modification in the patch radiator is done by etching multiple slots that tend to generate higher-order resonant modes, ultimately enhancing the bandwidth and gain of the antenna. The partial ground plane with a notch is used to achieve maximum impedance matching in the frequency band of interest. It is noted from the simulation results that the proposed planar antenna is able to resonate well from 25.37 to 29.91 GHz, while the gain of the antenna varies in the range of 2.7-4.6 dBi.

    "abstract": "The escalating integration of renewable energy systems has amplified the demand for advanced multilevel inverter (MLI) topologies capable of delivering enhanced performance with reduced electromagnetic interference and power losses. Conventional two-level and three-level inverters often suffer from inherent limitations such as high output current ripple, elevated voltage stress across semiconductor devices, and significant switching losses. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel seven-level switched-capacitor (SC) MLI topology, comprising eight power switches, two self-balancing switched capacitors, two inductors strategically placed to mitigate inrush and charging current spikes, and three unidirectional diodes facilitating triple voltage boosting capability without the need for magnetic elements or complex auxiliary balancing circuits. The proposed topology eliminates the requirement for isolated DC sources or bidirectional switches, thereby simplifying the control and enhancing modularity. The operational principle, switching strategy, and voltage boosting mechanism are analytically described. Simulation studies are conducted in MAT-LAB/Simulink environments to evaluate the inverter’s steady-state and dynamic performance under varying load conditions. The simulation results demonstrate its suitability for medium-power renewable energy applications such as photovoltaic and wind energy conversion systems."

    "abstract": "Long Reach Optical Access Networks (LROANs) are emerging as a promising solution to meet the growing demand for high-capacity, cost-effective, and energy-efficient broadband services. However, the extension of optical reach beyond conventional limits introduces challenges such as signal attenuation, nonlinear impairments, and amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) noise. To overcome these challenges, this paper explores an advanced approach that enhances the performance of LROANs by utilizing Hybrid Optical Amplifiers (HOAs), which combine the benefits of different amplification technologies to optimize signal quality over extended distances. Among the commonly used optical amplifiers, the Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifier (EDFA) stands out for its high gain and low noise figure (NF); however, its operational bandwidth is restricted (e.g., C/L-band), limiting its applicability in wavelength-diverse systems. Raman Fiber Amplifiers (RFAs) offer a broader amplification spectrum, making them an attractive solution for enhancing signal quality and extending transmission reach across a broader range of wavelengths - a compelling solution for long-haul optical networks. The proposed HOA solution leverages the complementary gain characteristics of both EDFA and RFA to achieve superior performance across a wide range of wavelengths. An experimental model of HOA is tested in different conditions using a 4-channel non-return-to-zero (NRZ) modulated wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) transmission system where bit-errorrate (BER) quality below <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$1 \\times 10^{-9}$</tex> is used as a threshold. A comprehensive performance evaluation is conducted through numerical mathematical simulations analyzing key parameters such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), bit error rate (BER), and optical power budget. The results demonstrate that the hybrid HOA amplification scheme enhances transmission reach and improves overall system reliability compared to single-amplifier configurations. This work highlights the potential of hybrid amplification techniques in optimizing next-generation optical access networks, ensuring efficient and scalable broadband connectivity."

The results show significant upward trends in absolute imbalance volumes, which are strongly correlated with VRE expansion. Hourly imbalance patterns intensified, particularly during VRE-driven midday peaks. While total monthly activated automatic frequency restoration reserve energy trends were weak, transmission system operator interventions became significantly more frequent, with reduced system stability and increased intra-imbalance settlement period volatility. Economically, dispatch price volatility increased significantly and asymmetrically: upward volatility rose dramatically, correlating almost perfectly with annual VRE growth, while downward volatility increased moderately. The results confirm that VRE expansion heightens the operational and economic burden on the imbalance market, increasing deviation magnitudes, intervention frequency, and price volatility. This underscores the critical need for enhanced forecasting, diverse system flexibility and generation mix, adaptive market mechanisms, and more dynamic operational strategies to manage high-VRE systems effectively."

    "abstract": "LD directly-pumped solid-state lasers offer some obvious advantages, including simple operation, compact size, and streamlined structure. These characteristics are particularly beneficial for the applications of a solid-state laser in the <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$3 \\sim 5 \\mu ~\\mathrm{m}$</tex> wavelength region. However, when compared to conventional near-infrared LD-pumped solid-state lasers, LD directly-pumped mid-infrared (MIR) solid-state lasers exhibit a much larger quantum defect, resulting in terrible heat generation. Consequently, the outputted laser power is constrained by thermal effects during the high-power pumping and they are susceptible to thermal damage of the laser crystal. To address these challenges, some important improvements are presented in this paper from following two aspects: 1) Expeimental evaluation has been undertaken by using the short crystal length and the high pump pulse width of tranditional Ho:BYF media; 2) Verification results of destructive experiments have been obtained by utilizing the new-developed Ho:BYLF crystals as an alternative to the trandional Ho:BYF crystals. It has been demonstrated that the single-pulse energy as high as 48.8 mJ has been achieved for Ho:BYF crystals with the length reduced to 2 mm under the conditions of the repetition rate of 2 Hz and the pulse width of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$600 \\mu ~\\mathrm{s}$</tex>, respectively. It has been believed that our result should be the highest output energy of mid-infrared solid-state lasers directly-pumped by LDs in the world until now. Additionally, our experiments also confirmed that Ho:BYLF crystals exhibit the superior resistance to thermal damage by comparing to Ho:BYF crystals while maintaining similar laser output performance and spectral characteristics. These findings should provide some valuable insights for further increasing the output power of LD directly-pumped mid-infrared solid-state lasers."

Our work focuses on making a comprehensive dataset and finetuning OpenAI’s Whisper models to improve transcription accuracy on the Nepali language, which can be scaled to other low-resourced languages as well. We leverage publicly available and self-recorded datasets with diverse accents, dialects, and speaking styles, enriched through augmentation. Fine-tuning Whisper models on our dataset reduces WER across all model sizes, thanks to variations in the speaker’s age, gender, sentiment, acoustic environment, dialect, and denser audio segments (15-30 seconds) compatible with Whisper’s input. Our approach outperforms Whisper’s baseline models trained on Fleur’s dataset, with our custom dataset being closer to real-world audio recordings. This highlights the importance of dataset quality, variation, and augmentation for ASR in underrepresented languages."

    "abstract": "A functional minimization problem with respect to the refractive index is posed. The functional to be minimized compares the solution to the forward problem with measured electromagnetic field data at the receivers. The forward problem is solved using the split-step Fourier method for the parabolic wave equation. This method is represented as a computational graph. By applying the automatic differentiation method to the computational graph, the gradient of the objective functional with respect to the refractive index can be efficiently computed. This gradient is used to find the optimal solution. The refractive index is represented as a multilayer perceptron. The proposed method is implemented in Python 3 using the JAX automatic differentiation framework. Unlike the variational adjoint approach, proposed method computes the gradient directly from the numerical scheme code, eliminating the need for a separate solution of the adjoint equation. Numerical experiments were conducted for typical refractive index profiles and irregular terrain. It was shown that the proposed method can be used for real-time tracking of variations in the tropospheric refractive index."

It uses a three-level design that gradually guides students from memory management (type encoding and low-level memory operations) through memory arrangements (sequential, hierarchical, and networked, without considering data types) to abstract data types (arrays, lists, priority queues, and tables). A course structured in this way allows knowledge to be built up progressively in logically complete units. In addition, the three-level design of the data structures library supports the correct use of object-oriented programming and its advanced techniques (such as working with templates or multiple inheritance). Since courses on data structures are typically subsequent to courses focused on programming, using the proposed design shows good practice of how techniques learned before can be properly adapted when designing robust libraries."

    "abstract": "In this paper, a low-profile, ultra-wideband tightly coupled dipole antenna array (TCDA) is presented, which utilizes an artificial magnetic conductor (AMC) with a magnetic medium. Unlike conventional TCDAs, the AMC structure is positioned beneath the dipole antennas, replacing the traditional ground plane. This novel configuration enables the proposed array to maintain ultra-wideband characteristics and excellent radiation performance, while achieving a low-profile. The array consists of tightly coupled dipoles and Marchand baluns, which serves as an impedance transformer. This balun effectively transforms the impedance from 100Ω to 50Ω over a broad frequency range, with the impedance transformation line folded within the balun to minimize the height of the array. This design enables the feeding network to operate efficiently across a wide bandwidth with high conversion efficiency. The antenna array is capable of wide-angle scanning, with a frequency range from 1.38 GHz to 3.97 GHz, and supports <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\pm 60^{\\circ}$</tex> scanning in the <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$E$</tex>-plane and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\pm 45^{\\circ}$</tex> scanning in the <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$H$</tex>-plane. Experimental results demonstrate that the array achieves stable performance with a Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR) of less than 3 across the entire operational frequency band. Additionally, the array exhibits good directionality and low back lobes in both the <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$E$</tex>-plane and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$H$</tex>-plane scans, maintaining a stable beam pattern throughout. The excellent low-profile performance of the designed antenna makes it particularly well-suited for conformal integration, which is ideal for applications on airborne and missile platforms, where space constraints are critical. The proposed TCDA antenna combines compactness with wideband and high-efficiency characteristics, offering a promising solution for modern communication systems."

    "abstract": "Understanding pediatric brain maturation is essential for detecting neurodevelopmental disorders. However, quantitative spatiotemporal analysis remains limited in clinical practice, particularly using computed tomography (CT). This study proposes a perturbation-based deep learning framework that estimates brain age from pediatric CT scans while revealing region-wise contributions across developmental stages. A 3D ResNet architecture is trained on pediatric CT images to perform age regression and to enable region-wise interpretability through perturbation analysis. Anatomically guided perturbation analysis is conducted, consisting of lobe-wise masking to evaluate major regions. The proposed method was validated using head CT data from 201 pediatric patients aged 0 to 47 months with five-fold cross-validation stratified by age. The model achieved high accuracy with an RMSE of 5.205 months, an MAE of 4.007 months, and a Pearson correlation coefficient (r) of 0.925. The analysis reveals a dynamic posterior to anterior shift, with occipital lobe dominance in early infancy, emerging parietal lobe contributions in mid-infancy, and increasing frontal and temporal lobe importance in later stages. To our knowledge, this is the first CT-based study to investigate perturbation-driven region-wise interpretability in pediatric brain age estimation. The proposed framework offers a clinically meaningful approach for early developmental assessment."

This shift introduces linguistic disparity challenges, such as software developers using the same natural language differently.

This disparity negatively impacts software debugging activities. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a standardized logging approach using a natural language processing model. The model uses a large corpus of well-structured log entries to suggest semantically similar log entries during log instrumentation. Our approach ensures that software debugging is done in a uniform and standardized natural language, which streamlines collaboration in software development teams.

    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) has achieved significant progress in hyperspectral target detection (HTD), yet several challenges remain. The limited prior information in HTD hinders effective network training, while the high dimensionality of hyperspectral image and the complex relationships between bands impose greater demands on the model's ability to capture spectral features and variations. To address these issues, this paper proposes a GATformer-Transformer based progressive triplet network (GTPTN) for HTD. First, a clustering-driven linear mixing sample construction strategy is proposed to generate high-quality background and target samples for model training. Subsequently, the spectra are segmented to construct an enhanced chain spectral graph (ECSG), and we introduce a local-global progressive learning network to thoroughly explore representative spectral information of targets. In addition, a novel strong separation-aggregation (SSA) loss is designed by combining batch hard positive mining (BHPM) loss with binary cross-entropy (BCE) loss, further enhance the network's target recognition ability. Finally, experiments on four public HTD datasets demonstrate that GTPTN achieves excellent detection accuracy and strong stability. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each proposed module."

By anticipating weather patterns, they can deploy early warning systems, formulate comprehensive response plans, and implement preventative measures, minimizing potential disruptions and protecting public safety. These points primarily motivate us to predict environmental parameters, recognizing their growing susceptibility to unsustainable development and environmental pollution, exacerbating natural calamities. Based on historical data, this study predicts six essential environmental parameters: <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">temperature, precipitation, cloud cover, wind speed, wind direction</i>, and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">dew point</i> for Jaipur and Kanpur, India. Cloud-based services enable scalability and computational efficiency in organising and transmitting environmental data, offering practical support for the implementation pipeline. Vanilla GANs are implemented to address data gaps by generating missing values within these parameters. The present work focuses on predicting six significant environmental parameters by utilising ARIMA, SARIMA, SES, DES, and TES models. The comparative analysis demonstrates the superior performance of the SARIMA model overall for most parameters, as measured by the nMAE and nMSE. For a single parameter, the nMAE and nMSE were (0.16, 0.04) before data generation and (0.10, 0.03) after data generation for a single city, respectively, in forecasting all specified environmental parameters."

    "abstract": "To enhance the performance of ultra-weak magnetic measurement equipment, an optimal design method for the internal and external hybrid coil (IEHC) by the improved target field method (TFM) is proposed. Firstly, an analytical model of the active-passive coupling between the magnetically shielded cylinder (MSC) and the magnetic field (MF) distribution of the IEHC is developed. Then, the established analytical model is combined with TFM to devise the coils inside and outside the MSC. Moreover, the design parameters are optimal with the differential squirrel search algorithm (DSSA). Simulations demonstrate that in large target regions, the maximum MF deviation of IEHC decreases from 38.89% (DC-IEHC) to 21.09%, representing a 45.77% improvement. In small target regions, the deviation drops from 38.89% to 3.56%, a reduction of 90.85%. Experimental validation confirms the effectiveness of the method, providing theoretical support for optimizing active magnetic compensation coils in ultra-weak magnetic measurement systems."

    "abstract": "Visual analytics (VA) is typically applied to complex data, thus requiring complex tools. While visual analytics empowers analysts in data analysis, analysts may get lost in the complexity occasionally. This highlights the need for intelligent assistance mechanisms. However, even the latest LLM-assisted VA systems only provide help when explicitly requested by the user, making them insufficiently intelligent to offer suggestions when analysts need them the most. We propose a ProactiveVA framework in which LLM-powered UI agent monitors user interactions and delivers context-aware assistance proactively. To design effective proactive assistance, we first conducted a formative study analyzing help-seeking behaviors in user interaction logs, identifying when users need proactive help, what assistance they require, and how the agent should intervene. Based on this analysis, we distilled key design requirements in terms of intent recognition, solution generation, interpretability and controllability. Guided by these requirements, we develop a three-stage UI agent pipeline including perception, reasoning, and acting. The agent autonomously perceives users' needs from VA interaction logs, providing tailored suggestions and intuitive guidance through interactive exploration of the system. We implemented the framework in two representative types of VA systems, demonstrating its generalizability, and evaluated the effectiveness through an algorithm evaluation, case and expert study and a user study. We also discuss current design trade-offs of proactive VA and areas for further exploration."

In this paper, we propose the Affective Image Filter (AIF) task, which aims to reflect visually-abstract emotions from text into visually-concrete images, thereby creating emotionally compelling results. We first introduce the AIF dataset and the formulation of the AIF models. Then, we present AIF-B as an initial attempt based on a multi-modal transformer architecture. After that, we propose AIF-D as an extension of AIF-B towards deeper emotional reflection, effectively leveraging generative priors from pre-trained large-scale diffusion models. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that AIF models achieve superior performance for both content consistency and emotional fidelity compared to state-of-the-art methods. Extensive user study experiments demonstrate that AIF models are significantly more effective at evoking specific emotions. Based on the presented results, we comprehensively discuss the value and potential of AIF models."

    "abstract": "Effective connectivity (EC) derived from resting-state Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs fMRI) has emerged as a critical tool for deepening our understanding of brain function in both health and dis ease. However, most studies estimate EC on an individual basis, treating it as a hidden parameter within the model and requiring retraining the model for each subject. They often overlook the valuable population-level information and limit their generalizability. Additionally, EC is typically obtained independently of downstream tasks, reducing its capacity to effectively capture task-specific variations. To address these limitations, we propose a flexible Task-Aware Effective Connectivity (TAEC) model, designed to construct individualized, task-aware, and nonlinear causal brain networks without requiring subject-specific retraining. In this framework, a Causal Discovery Module (CDM) is introduced to capture the implicit neural representation of the EC by a spatial-temporal attention mechanism, producing the estimation of an individual EC. Subsequently, we propose a Task-Aware Graph Neural Network (GNN) Predictor, which incorporates a task-aware penalty to enable end-to-end prediction, enhancing task performance and the identification of task-dependent EC patterns. Extensive experiments on twelve cognitive tasks from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its effectiveness in task-aware effective connectivity modeling. Furthermore, the framework discovers discriminative and task-specific EC patterns, which offer additional in-sights into cognitive functions."

    "abstract": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a crucial role in detecting structural and functional abnormalities in the brains of epilepsy patients. Automating this process using advanced AI/ML techniques can reduce the burden on experts, be a training resource, and make diagnosis accessible and affordable to a larger population. However, models developed using imaging data have not achieved acceptable accuracy levels. One reason for this is the limited number of data points available and artifacts in the data capture mechanism of the available datasets. There is a need to develop a generalized model that can take as input diverse images with multiple conditions, which predicts epilepsy and identifies the impacted brain regions. In this work, we present the design of deep-learning models capable of predicting epilepsy using 3D brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. Five deep learning models were developed to classify 3D MRI scans to identify specific brain regions involved in Hippocampal Sclerosis, Dysembryoplastic Neuroepithelial Tumors, Cavernomas, Focal Cortical Dysplasia, and other epileptic-related conditions. We find that our trained models predict epilepsy with over 91% accuracy on FLAIR images and nearly 100% accuracy on T1-weighted (T1-w) images. Our results show that deep learning architectures in 3D are highly effective in detecting epilepsy and identifying relevant pathological regions. These findings highlight not only the diagnostic accuracy of the models but also their potential utility in aiding clinical decision-making."

However, its assumption of an equal number of nodes and sources usually does not hold in outdoor applications. This letter proposes an extended NS-DGSC (ENS-DGSC) algorithm to tackle this issue. A correlation check module is introduced to handle scenarios where nodes outnumber or match sources. Furthermore, a temporal alignment module using two different strategies is designed to address time delays among nodes. Evaluations reveal that the proposed ENS-DGSC not only retains advantages of the NS-DGSC, but also provides superior enhancement performance with more nodes than sources."

To address this challenge, we propose a novel monocular SLAM-based framework for dynamic bronchial environment reconstruction tailored to robotic lung invasive surgery. Firstly, a pseudo-static processing method that builds map sequences at identical respiratory phases across cycles was built. Furthermore, we present a voxel model optimization technique using curvature-consistent graph interpolation to refine the bronchial lumen surface, eliminating pores and redundancies in the voxel map. Experiments conducted on real patient demonstrate that our method has good accuracy and robustness. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, our framework achieves superior reconstruction completeness, showing strong potential for clinical use in robotic bronchoscopy."

Due to their voltage source nature and limited overcurrent capability, they must be able to limit the overcurrent and successfully recover to the healthy mode while connecting to the grid. Current saturation algorithm is a promising approach; however, it has limited post fault stability. If it does not recover successfully, the inverter may oscillate or may not be able to recover the healthy mode control. This article proposes a simple supplementary control structure which avoids these modes. Simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed control structure."

The production process follows the principle of a factory, which assembles the final product by reusing already developed components and adding new components either by in house development or by acquiring external components (Component Based Development). The final system follows a three layer architecture (MVC: Model View Control) separating Data Base (Model) Management, User Interaction (View), and Programming (Control). Modern Micro Computers can be used to execute this “4GL-RAD-Tool” locally on user’s premises or in the field (powered by a battery) without the need of accessing facilities in a global network (cloud). The power of a low cost, energy saving Single Board Computer (SBC) is enough e.g. for developing and running business information systems using this tool. SBCs are frequently used in embedded Systems, which interact with sensors and actuators to control physical processes. Since SBCs can be equipped with large storage devices, there is no need in many cases to use programs in the cloud for the further on processing of big data. A realization of this 4GL-RAD Tool is based on an INFORMIX-4GL compatible system, which is available as an open source productivity tool. The System provides a menu driven IDE, which supports a standard System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) as linear or iterative model. The different phases of the SDLC are delivering various artifacts like User Requirement Documents, Code, and Software User Manuals, which can be enhanced by using Artificial Intelligence (AI). Restricting the system development to classes like Business Administration, Cultural Heritage, IoT-Computing to name a few, can support the development process by introducing “domain ontologies” in the “DevOps\"-Environment. The development of a Sensor Network provides a practical example in the field of Mechatronic Engineering."

This kind of FSS can be used as antenna radome of UHF and VHF embedded antenna to reduce the radar cross section of the cavity. Firstly, some theoretical design methods of FSS are briefly reviewed. As the proposed FSS is presented by cascading three layers of periodic arrays, optimization by full wave software is time consuming. Thus, the equivalent circuit method is utilized to design a low-pass filter for U/V band (0.1 MHz 0.4 MHz). The optimized circuit is cascaded with three band stop filter, and a wide stopband that covers S, C and X band is realized. Then, three hexagonal rings with different size are utilized to realize the FSS unit cell. The structure parameters of the unit cell are optimized to achieve the corresponding values of capacitors and conductors. The simulation results show that the passband insertion loss is less than 0.5 dB, and the stopband suppression is more than 15 dB. The stopband bandwidth of 15 dB is 8.23 GHz, corresponding to a relative bandwidth of 96.1%. The polarization stability of the FSS is also studied, and the frequency response curves of TE and TM polarized waves are almost the same for normal incidence. In terms of angular stability, the transmission curve is basically stable in the range of −45 to 45 degrees."

Deep learning has given boost to the study of plant pathology through images to achieve the highest automation, scalability, and accuracy in disease diagnosis. The present work offers an overview of some of the state-of-the-art deep learning methods-DenseNet201, DenseNet169, DenseNet121, MobileNetV2, MobileNet, NasNetLarge, and EfficientNet-B0. These methods are used for the detection and classification of plant diseases based on visual symptoms on leaf images. In this paper, we study transfer learning and fine tuning to train and validate these models on plant disease datasets that belong to the public domain, suPlant Village. Based on classification accuracy, model generalization, training and inference times, memory consumption, and ease of deployment under resource constraints, the evaluation was carried out. emphasis was placed on DenseNet's densely connected pathways, MobileNet's deepwise separable convolution, and NASNet's optimized searching method. This study reveals that certain model architectures may indeed be more suitable for deployment according to different constraints and needs. Thus, the results contributed to developing intelligent, accessible, scalable plant disease solutions, along with a data-driven approach toward agriculture."

Integrating house images allows models to evaluate visual appeal, architectural style, and property condition, including curb appeal, neighborhood aesthetics, and surrounding area demographics. Incorporating weather data enables analysis of both direct and indirect effects of weather on property values. The primary goal of including imagery data is to enhance prediction accuracy, while weather data serves to assess the impact of weather events on house prices. This research demonstrates that combining these diverse data sources, especially long-term weather data, enhances prediction accuracy. With different machine learning algorithms, this research has established that incorporation of weather data has led to increase the prediction power of house price models whether it is only textual or textual and imagery dataset. However, the improvement in prediction accuracy due to weather data varies depending on the region. These findings may be used for smart city initiatives, namely, urban planning, fair pricing and investment decisions."

The user interface provides a readable interface for input and output, while a powerful database stores user health profiles, dietary tendencies, nutrition facts, and interaction histories. GenAI is the central component that combines stored user information and real-time inputs to create individualized feedback, providing actionable information specific to an individual's needs. The system provides granular breakdowns of macronutrients and micronutrients, recommends changes, and monitors dietary habits over time. Its modular design provides unobstructed communication between modules, supporting scalability, smooth updates, and potential integration with other health systems in the future. In contrast to static calorie counter apps, Nutritionist GenAI learns through user engagement, sharpening its predictions and recommendations as it is used more. The adaptive learning cycle enables the system to provide expert-level advice at scale, turning nutritional management into a smart, responsive, and user-friendly experience.

This paper proposes an all-encompassing AI control system that integrates ideas from Deep Learning and Deep Reinforcement Learning for autonomous navigation of UAVs. Key improvements include external 3D maps and customized drone assets integrated into the AirSim simulator thereby creating a very realistic testing environment. We included an enemy tracking module which allows visual prediction, enabling the drone to detect, track, and evade dynamic threats. Also, a voice command interface allows human operators to take real-time control, thus enhancing interoperability and flexibility in missions. The navigation strategy comprises a dual hybrid ensemble model that integrates ResNet8-based a path planning algorithm and DQN-based an obstacle avoidance algorithm. Furthermore, ResNet8 and CNN are integrated for preliminary object detection tasks, whereby CNN assigns a confidence score to the object detection, and if this confidence is high, then a request is made to ResDQN, without reconfirmation by ResNet8. Such integrated approaches have assured stable flight performance in complex environments while ensuring efficiency as well as high performance. Experimental results have illustrated the robustness and applicability of our system for navigating through tightly cluttered indoor environments containing static and dynamic hazards. This work, therefore, pushes intelligent UAV applications in time-sensitive missions such as search-and-rescue, surveillance, and reconnaissance."

The most prevalent kind of skin cancer observed is “Melanoma”. This study suggests a deep learning-based method for detecting skin cancer by improving data quality through the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Data Augmentation. In this case, we are using DCGAN to create synthetic images, which increases model resilience, reduces overfitting, and is quick. The U-NET model, which guarantees the Rate of Interest of Lesion for localization, it then used to segment the pre-processed dataset. Using a Custom CNN and the Xception model, we conduct comparison analysis for classification in order to assess generalization and prediction accuracy. Furthermore, we use the XAI method known as Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to improve model transparency and trustworthiness by offering visual interpretability. When applied to 5000 images from the ISIC 2020 dataset, the suggested methodology produced good results on classification models, such as Custom CNN and Xception, with an accuracy of 98.43%, demonstrating the model's efficiency."

Previous signature verification technologies have been trained mainly on English-language documents and thus function with reduced capability in multilingual noisy real-world settings such as in India. Such a language/context mismatch may result in strong operational issues, such as higher false rejection rates and lower overall verification accuracy. These are to be addressed with an effective, modular deep learning-based multilingual signature verification system consisting of three autonomous but interconnected phases: detection, cleaning, and matching. At the detection phase, YOLOv5 is utilized for efficiently localizing signature areas in documents with various scripts, supported by signature form-specific anchor tuning and aspect ratio optimization adaptations. The cleaning step employs unsupervised K-Means clustering to separate foreground signature ink from background noise such as stamps, printed lines, and seals to provide cleaner input for matching. Lastly, the matching step employs a Siamese network with a VGG16 backbone to learn discriminative feature embeddings and compare them by cosine similarity, trained on contrastive loss to enhance intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. Easily accessible experimental evaluation of real-world legal and financial documents shows the efficacy of the system with a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 92.7."

First, we provide a novel theoretical analysis of its associated loss and show that a zero loss indeed induces identical persistence pairs (in high and low dimensions) for the 0-dimensional persistent homology (<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$PH^{0}$</tex-math></inline-formula>) of the Rips filtration. We also provide a counter example showing that this property no longer holds for a naive extension of TopoAE to <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$PH^{d}$</tex-math></inline-formula> for d <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\geq$</tex-math></inline-formula> 1.

This generalization is based on the notion of <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">cascade distortion</i>, a new penalty term favoring an isometric embedding of the 2-chains filling persistent 1-cycles, hence resulting in more faithful geometrical reconstructions of the 1-cycles in the plane. We further introduce a novel, fast algorithm for the exact computation of PH for Rips filtrations in the plane, yielding improved runtimes over previously documented topology-aware methods. Our method also achieves a better balance between the topological accuracy, as measured by the Wasserstein distance, and the visual preservation of the cycles in low dimensions.

Currently, multiple-choice question (MCQ) automatic assessment methods are being employed to solve these challenges. However, MCQs are deficient in cultivating critical thinking, advanced cognitive skills and skills of analytical problem-solving as compared to open-ended questions, which are currently administered manually. Furthermore, there is insufficient empirical evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness of automatic question generation for open-ended assessments. Consequently, using a quasi-experimental approach, this research examined the latent potential of machine (ChatGPT-4) in supporting the design of open-ended assessments. The study designed both machine- and human-generated exams, assessed students, graded their responses, and compared the two sets of assessments and scores using external examiner reviews and statistical analysis in the computer science domain. The findings indicated equivalence between machine- and human-generated assessments, particularly when practical prompt engineering, moderation, and human oversight are applied to machine-generated assessments that align with course content and learning outcomes. Therefore, the study concluded that a hybrid approach, combining Generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) and human expertise, offers a promising direction for developing credible and practical assessments."

By leveraging the optical polarization rotation induced by external magnetic fields, the proposed detector achieves higher measurement rates and improved sensitivity compared to conventional Hall effect-based gaussmeters [4]. Hall sensors often suffer from bandwidth limitations associated with intrinsic material properties and charge-carrier mobility, as well as a drop in sensitivity and an increase in noise during miniaturization. In contrast, the magneto-optical detector presented here provides accurate, high-speed magnetic field measurements in small volumes and is ideally suited for insertion into constrained spaces. We demonstrate measurement of dynamic magnetic fields generated by a solenoid energized through an RLC discharge circuit operating in an overdamped or critically damped regime. Our results show that this optical detection approach outperforms traditional methods in both temporal response and accuracy, thereby underscoring the advantages of magneto-optical sensing in a range of magnetic field measurement applications."

    "abstract": "In recent years, the increase of multimodal image data has offered a broader prospect for multimodal semantic segmentation. However, the data heterogeneity between different modalities make it difficult to leverage complementary information and create semantic understanding deviations, which limits the fusion quality and segmentation accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we propose a hybrid attention driven CNN-Mamba multimodal fusion network (HACMNet) for semantic segmentation. It aims to fully exploit the strengths of optical images in texture and semantic representation, along with the complementary structural and elevation information from the digital surface model (DSM). This enables the effective extraction and combination of global and local complementary information to achieve higher accuracy and robustness in semantic segmentation. Specifically, we propose a progressive cross-modal feature interaction mechanism (PCMFI) in the encoder. It integrates the fine-grained textures and semantic information of optical images with the structural boundaries and spatial information of DSM, thereby facilitating more precise cross-modal feature interaction. Secondly, we design an adaptive dual-stream Mamba cross-modal fusion module (ADMCF), which leverages a learnable variable mechanism to deeply represent global semantic and spatial structural information. This enhances deep semantic feature interaction and improves the ability of model to distinguish complex land cover categories. Together, these modules progressively refine cross-modal cues and strengthen semantic interactions, enabling more coherent and discriminative multimodal fusion. Finally, we introduce a global-local feature decoder to effectively integrate the global and local information from the fused multimodal features. It preserves the structural integrity of target objects while enhancing edge detail representation, thus enhancing segmentation results. Through rigorous testing on standard datasets like ISPRS Vaihingen and Potsdam, the proposed HACMNet demonstrates advantages over prevailing methods in multimodal remote sensing analysis, particularly on challenging object classes."

    "abstract": "The use of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) in Class 3 drones has gained significant interest for its ability to provide high-resolution images regardless of climate conditions or visibility. Integrating SAR control and data processing within the Xilinx Kria K26 System-On-Module (SOM) platform offers a compact, flexible, and efficient solution for embedded systems requiring highperformance processing and data storage. The K26 SOM demonstrates great potential for drone-borne SAR applications, thanks to its high processing power, low energy consumption, versatile I/O interface, and multiple storage options. However, its use in drone-based SAR systems remains under development and is primarily limited to specific niche applications. In this context, the K26 SOM efficiently handles SAR control and data processing tasks through its embedded Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), multiple ARM core processors, and support for high-speed interfaces. It manages radar pulses, calibration, synchronization, and communication with other subsystems. Using its flexible I/O, the K26 SOM can configure radar components (antenna, modulator, amplifier), GPS (Global Positioning System), and IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) via industry-standard protocols like Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) and I2C. This paper presents a high-level implementation of the K26 SOM for drone-borne SAR applications, together with an analysis of expected SAR throughput and performance metrics."

The complete dynamic model of a manipulator with DC motor actuators has been obtained by Euler-Lagrange technique. Several researchers have been proposed on a SCARA robot that utilizes sliding mode control techniques to address position control issues. However, it’s important to note that SMC can introduce a chattering effect when specific settings are chosen. In this work, STSMC techniques are used to reduce the chatter and particle swarm optimization (PSO) is employed to adjust the control settings. Dynamic performance and robustness characteristics of PSO-STSMC technique were compared with STSMC and PSO-SMC, to validate the effectiveness of suggested optimal controller. Decisively, this approach effectively mitigates chattering effects in control signal with a minimum tracking error (3.1 × 10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">−7</sup> rad for joint-1, 1.4 × 10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">−6</sup> rad for joint-2, 5.2 × 10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">−7</sup> rad for joint-3 and 4.4 × 10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">−7</sup> rad for joint-4).

    "abstract": "Advanced packaging technology does not only improve product performance but also decreases costs. Therefore, it is one of the most promising directions of the development of integrated circuit and system. During the design and optimization of advanced packaging, it is necessary to repeatedly evaluate the heat dissipation capability of the chip packaging. For this purpose, the model with chip thermal resistances becomes an effective tool for the heat dissipation evaluation. In order to extract the thermal resistances accurately, the multi-physics simulation involving fluid is usually performed, but incurs large computational time. In this work, we propose a fast approach for extracting the junction-to-ambient thermal resistance in advanced packaging. It considers a simplified computational model with only solid components, where the effects of fluid are reflected by the convective boundary condition. To ensure good accuracy, the convective coefficient is set through a curve fitting approach based on the results from a couple of multi-physics simulations, for considering the influence of ambient temperature and chip power consumption. With this simplified model, the chip resistances can be fast extracted by a finite element method (FEM) based solver. Experiments with different packaging styles show that the proposed method is about <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$10 \\times$</tex> faster than ANSYS Icepak, with little accuracy sacrifice.

    "abstract": "In label distribution learning, feature selection methods for dimensionality reduction play a crucial role. This paper proposes a label distribution feature selection algorithm based on Dempster-Shafer evidence theory. The method combines rough set approximation with evidential reasoning to enhance feature selection performance. Specifically, the direct correlation between features and labels is first quantified using an improved rough set positive region measure for dependency degree computation. Subsequently, a label correlation matrix is constructed to generate enhanced feature importance scores through a weighted fusion strategy. Building upon this foundation, an uncertainty parameter is introduced to transform the weighted scores into probabilistically interpretable basic probability assignments. An improved Dempster’s combination rule is designed to effectively aggregate cross-sample evidence. To quantify feature importance, belief and plausibility functions are further derived, ultimately forming a dual-dimensional evaluation metric that incorporates both credibility and likelihood measures. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other comparative algorithms on five datasets, effectively capturing feature-label correlations and demonstrating strong applicability in complex label distribution scenarios."

However, the practical implementation of this approach continues to face interoperability challenges, particularly when integrating intelligent electronic devices (IEDs) from multiple vendors. This paper presents findings from a lab-based digital substation environment that included ABB and Siemens devices, highlighting issues such as schema mismatches, Substation Configuration Language (SCL) file incompatibilities, and vendor tool limitations. A hybrid engineering methodology is proposed as a practical solution, combining top-down configuration using a central Substation Configuration Description (SCD) file with refinement of device-specific Instantiated IED Description (IID) files. Continuous validation using tools like Wireshark, StationScout, and IEDScout proved essential in verifying communication quality and time synchronisation. The study also emphasises the importance of workforce readiness, recommending structured training programs such as the postgraduate offering at Munster Technological University (MTU) to address skills gaps in IEC 61850-based system design. The paper concludes that achieving true interoperability requires more than adherence to the IEC 61850 standard—it demands coordinated engineering strategies, rigorous testing practices, and investment in human capital."

Conventional antireflective films often show a low transmission, which can be improved by incorporating bio-inspired periodic structures. Fractals, a self-similar geometry, are one of the most promising structural designs inspired by leaves of ferns. Due to its high branching and increase in surface area, fractal structure controls scattering of electromagnetic waves and minimizes losses. In this work, we realize a bio-inspired anti-reflective metasurface in microwave regime. The dielectric material glass is used as the fractal pattern on the top of the silicon substrate is designed. While the conventional antireflection films show transmission above 95%, the proposed design shows a maximum transmission and minimum reflection of about 99.9% and 0.1% respectively at 8.39 GHz for normal incident transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) polarizations. Thus, our proposed antireflective fractal metasurface is useful for concealment and energy storage applications at microwave frequencies."

However, PV technology continues to face a critical challenge; a decline in efficiency as operating temperatures rise above 25°C. This research aims to mitigate the impact of elevated temperatures on PV panels by investigating the phase change materials (PCMs) for temperature control of the PV panels and release their generated heat to PCMs as heat collection and temporary storage units. Consequently, the heat can be then transferred from the temporary storage point to a long-term heat storage in Zeolite materials through supply-air duct to enable forced convection heat transfer via moving air. Furthermore, this research also explores the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithms to harvest the maximum electrical power from the PV panels and then regulate this power to integrate with a DC microgrid of 48V by controlling power electronic converters at various environmental and operational conditions. The proposed demonstration offers a cheap and effective solution to regulate the PV’s temperature to achieve optimal performance and storing the excess heat for other domestic applications. It is also modular to accommodate different energy aspects as battery storage or fuel cells and allows for peer-to-peer selling of energies."

    "abstract": "In graph-based fraud detection, accurately distinguishing between normal and anomalous account nodes is crucial. Recent graph-based approaches have achieved remarkable progress, primarily by aggregating neighborhood information to learn node representations and enhance model discriminability. However, most existing methods employ a unified aggregation function to neighbors with different class labels, which weakens feature differences and allows anomalous node features to be obscured by normal ones, leading to representation contamination. Moreover, existing methods assign uniform confidence weights to all labeled nodes during training, without accounting for label quality differences caused by varying distances to the decision boundary, which weakens the robustness of model learning. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel method named Confidence-Aware Neighborhood Aggregation (CANA). CANA introduces a category-aware aggregation mechanism that performs separate aggregation operations for normal, anomalous, and unlabeled neighbors, thereby mitigating the issue of representation contamination. In addition, CANA incorporates a confidence-aware node-reweighted learning objective function, which dynamically adjusts the confidence weights of the labeled nodes based on a confidence metric computed through controlled perturbations in neighbors and prediction accuracy, thus improving the model's ability to leverage high quality labeled nodes and improving its learning capability and classification performance. Specifically, the function includes two optional perturbation strategies, namely Homo-Hetero Neighbor Perturbation (HHNP) and Robust Neighbor Perturbation (RNP). Extensive evaluations of four public benchmark datasets underscore the superiority of CANA over current state-of-the-art methods."

Analysis of the GEO dataset GSE147352 yielded 89 common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across normal brain tissues, lower-grade gliomas, and glioblastomas. Through Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and validation using multiple machine learning models including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and Decision Tree, 11 key genes were identified with high classification accuracy (SVM accuracy: 0.9655). WGCNA analysis revealed the black module as crucial, containing five hub genes: HOTAIRM1, SERPINE1, CD44, HOXC4, and SPOCD1. Functional annotation of the 971 genes in the black module highlighted significant enrichment in cell adhesion, hypoxia response, and extracellular matrix-related processes. KEGG pathway analysis further revealed enrichment in adhesion, junction, and proteoglycan-related pathways.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes ORB-ViT, a novel framework designed to address the limitation of Vision Transformers (ViTs), which often struggle to capture fine-grained local structures and small objects due to their reliance on uniform patches. ORB-ViT integrates ORB (Oriented FAST((Features from Accelerated Segment Test) and Rotated BRIEF(Binary Robust Independent Elemental Elements))-based local tokens with a cross-attention mechanism. Specifically, structurally salient keypoints are first detected from the input image, and local patches surrounding these keypoints are embedded into additional tokens. These tokens are then used as queries in a cross-attention fusion module, while the global patch embeddings of ViT serve as keys and values. This selective fusion injects edge and corner-centric inductive bias, enabling local tokens to capture only the most relevant global context. As a result, the model focuses more effectively on small objects and fine details while reducing background noise, with only marginal computational overhead. Experiments on CIFAR-10/100 and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate consistent improvements over the baseline ViT in accuracy, Micro- Average Precision (AP), Macro- Area Under Curve (AUC), and Silhouette Score. Attention diagnostics (mass distribution, boundary leakage, and keypoint alignment) and visualization further confirm improved interpretability. ORB-ViT extends ViT in a data-efficient manner, remaining robust under limited data, complex backgrounds, and geometric variations, while maintaining compatibility with diverse keypoint detectors."

    "abstract": "Conventional health monitoring technologies for elderly populations face significant adoption barriers including clinical appearance, usability challenges, and stigmatization. Garden Watch addresses these obstacles through an open-source framework that embeds monitoring capabilities within a decorative steel owl garden statue. By leveraging the therapeutic context of home gardening where elderly engage in planting, watering, and nurturing living plants, our system transforms health monitoring into an aesthetically pleasing experience. The ESP32-C3-based implementation uses privacy-preserving sensors to establish personalized behavioral baselines while the owl's mechanical features (nodding, audio, vibration) serve dual purposes by providing plant care reminders for watering schedules and seasonal plantings while performing unobtrusive wellness checks. Experimental results confirm the system's ability to detect meaningful behavioral changes while maintaining a non-clinical appearance. This zoomorphic approach integrates monitoring technology into garden environments where older adults find purpose and joy, aiming to preserve dignity and autonomy while providing health insights that may support independent living among elderly gardening enthusiasts."

While traditional reactive and preventive maintenance strategies offer some mitigation, they often fall short in addressing these issues effectively. This paper investigates a novel approach to fault detection using the Drunken Flower Pollination Algorithm (DFPA) combined with audio pattern analysis. By detecting subtle anomalies in sound signatures, the system proactively identifies potential failures, minimizing unplanned outages and optimizing maintenance schedules. For comparison, the DFPA is also tested using traditional vibration-based fault detection methods. The results demonstrate that while audio-based analysis is less conventional than vibration monitoring, it delivers competitively accurate results—offering a viable alternative for predictive maintenance."

It is observed the pure-polarization states are possible in the metamaterial irrespective of the inherent dielectric loss. This aspect is not possible with the conventional materials because in metamaterial, the effective optical properties are decided by the periodicity rather than the composition alone. In the proposed SCMM, we observe the collapse of optical activity and zero-ellipticity only at the extreme dielectric loss cases. Our work paves the way to synthesis an electromagnetic beam with pure polarization states which are essential for modern polarization-assisted metrology."

The proposed polarizer is designed using a simple structure comprising an array of inverted square patch deployed on a substrate layer. To enable LTC polarization conversion, a rectangular strip is placed diagonally in the middle of inverted square patch at a 45° orientation relative to the polarization of incoming wave. The substrate layer uses FR4-Epoxy providing mechanical support and influencing electromagnetic performance. To validate the proposed design, simulations are conducted on two types of structures, namely with and without 45° rectangular strip. The results for the structure with rectangular strip show that the magnitudes of co-polarization and cross-polarization transmission coefficients are nearly equal, with the difference of less than 3 dB across the frequency range of 770 MHz to 1060 MHz. Furthermore, the observed phase difference between the two parameters is approximately 90°, confirming the shape of circularly polarized transmitted waves. In contrast, the structure without rectangular strip yields a magnitude difference of nearly 50 dB between copolarization and cross-polarization transmission coefficients, indicating no polarization conversion."

    "abstract": "The importance of human activity recognition technology in sports training is becoming increasingly prominent. In the context of tennis, an accurate system for tennis activity recognition is essential for improving athletes’ training quality. However, the complexity of specific tennis movements often results in scarce, unevenly distributed samples, while the raw sensor data are further affected by noise and interference. When traditional models are directly applied to tennis activity recognition, their performance tends to be unreliable. To address these challenges, an innovative tennis activity recognition system, termed DKFG, is proposed, which integrates a dual-loop Kalman filtering (DKF) framework with a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), using a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) as the classifier. First, the DKF technique preprocesses raw data from wearable devices by filtering and smoothing the data stream, detrending, and dynamically segmenting samples to enhance data quality. Subsequently, a GAN designed explicitly for tennis data augmentation is used to expand the dataset, thereby improving classifier performance. Finally, the system employs a DCNN to perform tennis activity recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can efficiently recognize tennis actions. Moreover, DKFG achieves strong recognition performance and generalization across datasets."

However, narrowband interference signals pose a significant challenge, severely disrupting the normal operation of wireless communication equipment. A major obstacle in existing narrowband interference detection lies in enhancing robustness under complex channel propagation conditions and diverse, dynamically changing types of interference. In view of those challenges, we propose a robustness-enhanced narrowband interference detection method by utilizing unlabeled data. The proposed detection network incorporates soft-shrink technology to isolate irrelevant signal features while adaptively extracting and fusing original and time-frequency features. The proposed method leverages the distribution characteristics of interference frequency bands to enhance model robustness in varying channel propagation environments. Additionally, we design a pseudo-label-based model tuning process to exploit the potential of unlabeled data, further enhancing the model’s robustness. Comparative experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method against various baselines, as well as against configurations incorporating individual network modules."

    "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles are increasingly used across various applications, but their vulnerability to faults under complex operating conditions poses significant risks to safety and mission success. Fault diagnosis in UAVs is essential for ensuring reliable and safe operations. This paper proposes a novel framework for UAV fault diagnosis, integrating a Multi-Scale Residual Network (MSR) with an Ordered Quadruplet Loss (OQL). The MSR leverages multi-scale feature extraction to capture intricate fault patterns, while the OQL addresses the challenge of modeling fault severity progression within fault categories, thus improving fault classification and severity ordering. The framework is designed to handle both known and unknown fault states, using deep metric learning to structure the embedding space based on fault similarities. Through a series of experiments, including rotor faults simulated on a DJI Phantom 4 Pro+ V2.0 quadrotor, we demonstrate that the proposed model achieves high classification accuracy (100%) and robust fault severity ordering (99.6%). Additionally, it shows excellent generalization capability, performing well even with partially unseen fault states. This work enhances the diagnostic performance and practical applicability of UAV fault detection, offering a significant step forward in ensuring UAV safety and reliability in real-world conditions."

In this communication, a modified physics-guided generative adversarial network is developed to synthesize SFMA geometries for given pattern objectives. This synthesis framework offers higher efficiency and better synthesized patterns compared to traditional metaheuristic algorithms. Additionally, it does not require network pretraining. Moreover, new trapezoidal radiating elements acquiring ultra-low reflection over a wide tuning range of coupling coefficients are proposed to maintain the traveling-wave mode, which is essential for accurate pattern control. Unlike other designs, these elements do not require additional reflection-canceling structures, thereby simplifying the antenna structure and synthesis process. Measured results of prototypes with a cosecant-squared pattern and a low-sidelobe pattern show excellent agreement with their respective pattern objective across 79–81 GHz, which validate the effectiveness of the synthesis method and the proposed element."

However, passive components in the drive system can constrain the power density. Slotless machines enable high power density, but their low per-phase inductance imposes significant filtering challenges. This reduced inductance necessitates additional filtering between the inverter and motor, thereby offsetting the power density advantages of slotless designs. Additionally, the dc-link capacitor constitutes a substantial portion of the inverter's weight and volume. In this paper, the advantages of interleaved and multilevel topologies are discussed, and a partially interleaved hybrid active neutral point clamped (I-HANPC) converter is proposed to achieve reduced output filter sizes and enable a smaller dc-link capacitor. The design is demonstrated using a seven-level I-HANPC experimental hardware prototype at 10 kW, achieving a peak efficiency of 98.8%, an approximately 25% reduction in dc-link capacitor RMS current, and output total harmonic distortion well below 5%."

    "abstract": "Coherence factor (CF) methods play an important role in array signal processing as data-dependent weighting strategies for enhancing angular resolution and suppressing noise and sidelobes in direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation. This paper introduces the order pattern coherence factor (OPCF), a new CF formulation that exploits the temporal ordering of consecutive signal samples. Unlike existing CF variants based on amplitude, phase, sign, or spectral-domain representations, OPCF captures local temporal trends, providing more detailed temporal information than sign CF while maintaining low computational complexity. The proposed DAS+OPCF framework is evaluated against conventional CF, phase CF, sign CF, and generalized CF, using both simulated and real acoustic measurements. The results demonstrate that DAS+OPCF yields a substantial resolution improvement, reducing the average half-power beamwidth (HPBW) from 54 to 23 for narrowband signals and from 53 to 32 for wideband signals. The method achieves a probability of detection and probability of resolution (PoR) exceeding 90% for SNR values above 18 dB and -13 dB, respectively. Additional robustness analyses confirm the method’s stability under practical imperfections such as sound speed and sensor position errors. In terms of sidelobe suppression, the three-sample OPCF achieves an average integrated sidelobe level ratio (ISLR) of 3.32 dB for narrowband and 6.18 dB for wideband signals, outperforming other CF methods. These comprehensive quantitative results establish OPCF as a robust and computationally efficient coherence-based enhancement technique for high-precision DOA estimation in both narrowband and wideband acoustic environments."

Next, we develop the software architecture and its subordinate guidance, navigation, and control subsystems, and develop modular software programs. Then, we define the communication protocol between subsystems' processors and design the data transmission flow.

However, the rigid work schedules of ES drivers always hinder the optimization of battery swapping, leading to escalated charging costs.

To tackle this <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">paradox</i>, we studied battery swap stations in Chengdu.

However, its efficacy for seizure suppression requires further exploration. This study aims to address whether tFUS of white matter can suppress seizures non-invasively. Repeated injections of a 4-Aminopyridine (4-AP) cocktail into the right somatosensory cortex (S1) induced cortical seizures in male rats under anesthesia with recording of both EEG and intracranial signals. Approximately one hour of tFUS was applied to the corpus callosum (CC) using a 128-element random-array transducer with 20 ms pulse duration, 1 Hz pulse repetition frequency, 2% duty cycle, and ~127 kPa pressure. Another 2-3 hours were used to assess post-stimulation effects. Seizure duration, seizure count, percent time in seizure, and inter-seizure interval were compared to a sham control for quantifying efficacy. The absolute frequency power, asymmetry index (AI), and phase lag index (PLI) were calculated to analyze brain activity changes induced by tFUS. CC tFUS can significantly reduce percent time in seizure, seizure duration, and seizure count, as well as increase inter-seizure interval. These effects extended up to 2 hours post-stimulation. We also observed a decrease in absolute power of the beta band and changes in the brain network, as evidenced by a decrease in synchronization and an improvement in interhemispheric balance. Our study is the first to show that white matter tFUS can significantly suppress seizures with a lasting post stimulation effect, potentially providing a safer alternative for drug-resistant epilepsy patients."

    "abstract": "Utilizing a single vision sensor for learning from human demonstration (LfD) planning offers numerous benefits. However, the accurate identification of key task constraints for motion planning is a prevailing challenge, stemming from data unreliability. This research introduces a novel LfD planning framework that employs a human action recognition algorithm to extract task constraints from unreliable human skeleton data derived from single camera images, thereby enhancing motion planning. Initially, the method aims to obtain task constraints from the skeleton data using action labels associated with specific constraints, for instance, “pick upward while maintaining a consistent pose.” Subsequently, a robot motion is crafted to comply with the extracted constraints and is catalogued in the motion database as a path experience. For novel planning challenges, this path experience is tailored to new environments, serving as a reference for discerning a valid motion via the random modification of any inconsistent segments. Simulation results, focused on pick-and-place tasks, indicate that the introduced method surpasses the state-of-the-art approach by elevating the success rate and diminishing the computation time and path length by 8%, 20%, and 15%, respectively. Furthermore, superior performance was also observed in two real-world scenarios, including a task that requires more complex human actions, such as rotating the wrist. Although the execution time was slightly increased, the proposed method was shown to increase the success rate by 11% and 28% and reduce the average computation time by 14% and 29% for the two real-world scenarios."

    "abstract": "Remote sensing spatiotemporal fusion (STF) aims at fusing high temporal-resolution images with high spatial resolution images to obtain both high temporal and spatial resolution images. Temporal uncertainty remains a critical challenge, as existing methods rely on implicit temporal modeling and thus struggle to handle land-cover or phenological changes over long intervals, leading to texture errors or overly smooth transitions. To overcome this challenge, this paper presents a novel Land Cover Change Inpainting Network (LCCINet) for STF. The LCCINet consists of two core stages: the enhancing feature fusion stage and the feature reconstruction stage, which are designed to reconstruct the unchanged and changed regions, respectively. First, to distinguish unchanged and changed regions, we design a change detection module to compute the difference between the prediction and the reference time, generating a change mask. In the fusion stage, we propose a feature mask modulator (FMM) that leverages the mask to modulate the features of the high spatial-resolution image. Then the feature fusion encoder employs multi-scale convolutions and spatiotemporal attention to focus the model on fusing features from unchanged areas. Finally, in the reconstruction stage, the image coarse inpainting module (ICM) and image fine inpainting module (IFM) use the mask and rich contextual cues to reconstruct the features of changed regions from coarse to fine. Extensive experiments on three STF benchmarks (CIA, LGC, and E-SMILE) demonstrate that LCCINet consistently outperforms existing approaches, reducing MAE, RMSE, and SAM by 4–11%, and increasing SSIM by 0.003–0.008 over the strongest competing methods. These results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method in preserving spatial textures and spectral values."

Here, we introduce orbit torque (OT) derived from light metal Ti (effective orbit Hall angle ≈ 0.4) to drive ferromagnetic synapses and neurons with a biologically inspired continuously differentiable exponential linear unit (CeLu) activation function. We systematically characterize device variations, including cycle-to-cycle (CTC) and device-to-device (DTD) fluctuations, and reveal that Joule heating significantly contributes to CTC variability through finite element and micromagnetic simulations. Optimizing the neural network depth reduces error propagation induced by CTC variation. Moreover, the network exhibits higher tolerance to DTD variations compared to CTC variations. Our OT-driven all-spin ANN achieves a recognition accuracy of 90.1 ± 0.2% on the MNIST dataset under combined synaptic and neural CTC and DTD variations. This work provides a viable path towards low-power neuromorphic computing systems by leveraging OT's advantages of reduced thermal dissipation and stable switching characteristics."

A nonlinear autoregressive moving average (NARMA) function is designed at first to formulate the inherent consensus dynamics with respect to the consensus error and the control protocols. Then, a consensus performance-related iterative linear data model (CPiLDM) is constructed for equivalently reformulating the NARMA consensus system’s iterative dynamics in a data-driven framework. The CPiLDM does not rely on a model no matter through first-principle modeling or system identification methods. Next, a direct distributed iterative learning control (DirDILC) method is developed through an optimization technique subject to the CPiLDM. The convergence is proved directly for the virtual NARMA consensus system, without relying on the dynamics of the agent itself, and thus simplifies the analysis consequently. Since the presented DirDILC is purely data-driven without relying on an explicit model, it constitutes a significant step forward from the existing consensus control theory."

To address the limitations of flexible current arc suppression method based on proportional–integral–derivative (PID) control and linear active disturbance rejection control (LADRC)—which exhibit nonzero steady-state current-tracking error under high-resistance ground faults—as well as those of traditional flexible voltage arc suppression method—which become unreliable under low-resistance faults due to line-impedance voltage drop—a flexible fusion arc-suppression method based on sliding-mode control with an exponential reaching law (SMC-ERL) is developed. In this method, the device output current and the neutral-point voltage are regulated in parallel, simultaneously suppressing ground-fault current and voltage and mitigating the effects of fault resistance and line-impedance voltage drop. The SMC-ERL strategy enables fast and accurate tracking of the compensation-current reference. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated by simulation and experimental results."

However, their signals are susceptible to spoofing and deception, posing a potential threat to maritime security. Satellite constellation design enables the effective detection and localization of non-cooperative AIS signals by optimizing satellite orbits in targeted regions. Nevertheless, balancing positioning performance with deployment cost remains a central challenge in constellation design. This paper proposes an average positioning error (APE)-driven satellite constellation design scheme. First, a global AIS signal distribution model is constructed using real-world AIS data. The probabilities of different coverage multiplicities under dynamic network topologies are analyzed, and benchmark localization errors for various positioning regimes are established. Based on these insights, an analytical APE formula is derived to quantitatively evaluate the positioning performance of satellite constellations. Then, we model the constellation design as a multi-objective continuous optimization problem and propose a balanced adaptive constrained genetic algorithm (BACGA) to optimize the constellation configuration parameters. Simulation results show that under the minimum positioning error constraint, the proposed algorithm generates the optimal low-Earth orbit constellation configuration that meets accuracy requirements and achieves good coverage of key areas at low cost."

    "abstract": "The adoption of blockchain technology across financial, industrial, and IoT ecosystems has increased the demand for reliable and scalable consensus mechanisms. Traditional Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) offers strong consistency and finality but scales poorly due to high message complexity and communication overhead. To address this, we propose Reliable Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (rPBFT), a consensus mechanism that improves performance and fault tolerance in large-scale distributed systems. rPBFT evaluates node reliability through message exchanges during consensus and dynamically forms a committee based on reliability scores. This reduces communication load, improves scalability, and prevents performance degradation caused by faulty nodes while maintaining decentralization without representative election. Experiments evaluated rPBFT against PBFT and HotStuff. In fault-free environments, PBFT achieved better performance due to the absence of reliability computation overhead. Under faulty conditions, rPBFT outperformed PBFT and HotStuff, achieving 30%–40% lower latency, 50%–80% higher throughput, and a 33% improvement in consensus success rate. In fault-tolerance tests, rPBFT maintained stable throughput as the Byzantine ratio and network fault ratio increased, demonstrating resilience via a reliability-based recovery model. These results confirm that rPBFT enhances scalability and robustness while preserving the core properties of Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus, making it well-suited for large-scale blockchain and IoT environments."

    "abstract": "As cyber-attacks on networks become stealthier, monitoring techniques relying on low-rate packet sampling may prove insufficient to detect attacks. While various methods, such as truncating packets, flow-based sampling, and adaptive sampling rates, have been proposed to enhance detection rates and ease capability limitations, it remains challenging to perform sufficient sampling at line speed and high rates at a single sampling point due to limited CPU or bandwidth capacity and fluctuating network traffic. To address these challenges, we propose CoordSamp, a system that distributes the sampling workload across multiple sampling points and coordinates their actions to avoid duplicate sampling of the same packet. This design enables scalable, resource-aware monitoring—particularly suited for dynamic, agentless cloud-based environments—relying solely on network-level deployment that can be dynamically assigned and adjusted by the provider. We develop a coordinated sampling algorithm on multiple P4-programmable switches and show that the algorithm ensures coordination among multiple sampling points for each flow, preventing duplicate samples, with negligible network overhead and real-time configurability. At its core, CoordSamp separates <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">offline placement</i>—the budgeted selection of sampling points—from <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">online allocation</i>—the capacity-aware assignment of sampling tasks—allowing practical deployment in hybrid networks that combine programmable and legacy switches. We formulate sampling point placement as budgeted maximum multi-coverage problems, solving them optimally in pseudo-polynomial time. Our system far outperforms those based on greedy placement along many key dimensions."

    "abstract": "Quantitative ultrasound (QUS) analysis of placental tissue holds significant promise for evaluating pregnancy health and detecting placental pathologies. However, widespread clinical adoption of QUS is limited by the need for manual selection of a proper region of interest (ROI) for the calculation, which increases the analysis time and introduces operator variability. This study presents an automated ROI determination method that uses deep learning segmentation directly on minimally processed raw RF data (along with corresponding B-mode data for comparison) to replace manual ROI selection in placental QUS analysis while also taking advantage of the model’s internal confidence thresholds to reduce inclusion of non-placental tissue near ambiguous tissue boundaries. Using a diverse, multi-national data set of 1084 annotated ultrasound images, the proposed automated ROI model achieved a mean Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) above 0.8 for confidence thresholds between 50% to 75%. At thresholds above 75%, precision improved, but both DSC and recall performance declined, and the amount of placental tissue identified for an accurate QUS calculation fell below the minimum required ROI size. Bland-Altman analysis showed tight agreement between the QUS values derived from ground truth ROIs and automated ROIs up to a 75% confidence threshold, but reduced agreement at higher thresholds, consistent with inferior performance obtained for placental pixel area below the minimum. These findings demonstrate both the feasibility of automated ROI determination and the need for careful consideration of the confidence thresholds when assessing model performance."

    "abstract": "Reconstructing process variables from latent variables is a well-established approach for fault detection (FD). This method has been extensively applied in FD tasks for permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drive systems. However, recent studies have primarily focused on application-oriented designs, often overlooking the intrinsic relationship between latent and process variables. To address this gap, this paper proposes an invertible neural network (INN)-based FD method specifically designed for PMSM drive systems. The distributional relationship between process variables and latent variables is rigorously established using an INN in conjunction with the change-of-variables formula. The main objectives of this work are threefold: 1) To propose a modeling approach for PMSM drive systems based on composite nonlinear mappings; 2) To develop an INN-based framework that facilitates bidirectional mapping between process variables and latent variables; 3) To integrate a residual generative module into the INN architecture to enable effective FD in PMSM drive systems. The proposed method is validated on a PMSM system, demonstrating its effectiveness in practical FD scenarios."

These weapon systems are subjected to extreme stresses from long-term exposure in harsh environments, which affects their total life cycle and reliability. A thorough reliability analysis of weapon-integrated pressure sensors exposed to environmental stresses during long-term storage and transportation, emphasizing performance drift and ageing, is presented in this article. Laboratory experiments were conducted under controlled conditions simulating climatic and dynamic stresses as per MIL-STD-810H. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated how to use interval-censored field failure data to estimate the life distribution of a population in service, where pressor sensors encounter varying stress levels over time, and to determine key reliability metrics, including failure rate, mean time to failure, and probability over a 10-year storage period. The study offers quantitative insights into stress-related deterioration, supporting the development of condition-based calibration strategies, predictive maintenance planning, and robust sensor designs suitable for extended military storage applications."

    "abstract": "Hall current sensors suffer from severe measurement inaccuracies over wide temperature range due to sensitivity drift, offset variation, and nonlinear errors. To address these issues, GaAs Hall current sensor with integrated current conductor incorporating a wide-temperature digital calibration method is proposed and verified in the paper. Firstly, a three-dimensional electro-magnetic-thermal coupled model of GaAs Hall element is established to accurately simulate temperature-dependent characteristics. Based on the modeling and experimental validation, an integrated current conductor packaging structure is optimized through structural simulation, eliminating bulky magnetic concentrators and ensuring stable flux concentration from -40 °C to 150 °C. Furthermore, a signal conditioning chip is developed with integrated digital calibration, including a rotating current module for offset suppression, a three-stage programmable amplifier for dynamic sensitivity adjustment, and a polynomial-based temperature compensation algorithm for correcting both sensitivity and static voltage drift. Experimental results confirm that the proposed calibration method effectively suppresses temperature-induced errors, maintaining the sensor error within ±0.3% of the full scale (±20 A) across -40 °C to 150 °C. Compared with conventional analog or narrow-range calibration methods, the proposed approach achieves higher accuracy, enhanced reliability, and extended applicability under extreme temperature conditions, making it suitable for high-precision current sensing in industrial and automotive applications."

Different from existing learning-based data-driven solutions, we adopt the Fundamental Lemma perspective, which reduces the level of excitation required on data. The solution in this work handles unknown system matrices: only knowledge of the exosystem matrix is required, an assumption standard in data-driven approaches. The data-driven output regulation problem is first transformed into a convex semi-definite program: then, necessary and sufficient analysis shows that the solvability of the output regulation problem and of the semi-definite program are equivalent. The proposed approach also allows to impose a performance index for the regulated error in terms of specified convergence rate, without additional requirements on data."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Many audio applications, including echocancellation and active noise control, rely on the availability of accurately estimated room impulse responses (RIRs). For these applications, it is common that the source signal is short and primarily consists of speech or music, which may cause the estimation of the RIR to be poorly conditioned. Although priors on the amplitudes of the RIR could in principle be used to resolve the conditioning issue, there are situations where also the delay structure of the RIR is uncertain. In particular, we here consider when the prior is a simulated RIR obtained from a 3D-reconstruction of the room, from where uncertainties in the geometry, speed of sound, and the source and receiver positions all cause uncertainties in the delay structure of the simulated RIR. By considering such sources of error, we derive two robust regularizers for RIR estimation based on the concept of optimal transport. For each estimator, an efficient solver is proposed based on proximal splitting and Sinkhorn-type iterations. From numerical experiments on real data, we find that when only the uncertainty in the amplitude structure is considered in the regularizer, the simulated prior can in fact worsen the estimation as compared to the Tikhonov and Lasso estimators. Interestingly enough, when robustness for uncertainties in the delay structure is also introduced using the proposed regularizers, even the most naive room model, i.e., a shoe-box approximation, can significantly improve the estimate."

    "abstract": "Accurate estimation of the relative attitude and angular velocity between two rigid bodies is fundamental in aerospace applications such as spacecraft rendezvous and docking. In these scenarios, a chaser vehicle must determine the orientation and angular velocity of a target object using onboard sensors. This work addresses the challenge of designing an Equivariant Filter (EqF) that can reliably estimate both the relative attitude and the target angular velocity using noisy observations of two known, non-collinear vectors fixed in the target frame. To derive the EqF, a symmetry for the system is proposed and an equivariant lift onto the symmetry group is calculated. Observability and convergence properties are analyzed. Simulations demonstrate the filter's performance, with Monte Carlo runs yielding statistically significant results. The impact of low-rate measurements is also examined and a strategy to mitigate this effect is proposed. Experimental results, using fiducial markers and both conventional and event cameras for measurement acquisition, further validate the approach, confirming its effectiveness in a realistic setting."

    "abstract": "With the rise of deep learning, an increasing number of deep learning methods have been applied to the field of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) ocean parameters retrieval, yielding many promising results. Normalized radar cross section (NRCS) of SAR images and SAR image spectra respectively provide descriptions of sea states from the space and frequency domains, which are beneficial for constructing more accurate models for significant wave height (SWH) retrieval. To make the most of SAR data's space and frequency domain characteristics, this study develops a CNN-based approach for SWH retrieval, which fuses spatial and frequency information effectively. The model automatically extracts robust features from both the space and frequency domains through dual-branch convolutional layers. Shallow features from both the space and frequency domains are enhanced and fused by employing the feature cross fusion module (FCFM). Subsequently, the learnable weighted fusion module (LWFM) is applied to perform a weighted fusion of deep features from these domains, leading to the development of a high-precision SAR SWH retrieval model. Most models based on the GF-3 SAR data focus on wave mode, with limited utilization of other imaging modes. To develop a model applicable to various imaging modes, this study collects GF-3 SAR data from different imaging modes, such as SS, UFS, and FSII, and matches them with the fifthgeneration European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts reanalysis data (ERA5) to train and evaluate the model. The comparative analysis demonstrates that the proposed model performs well on the ERA5 test dataset, thereby certifying its effectiveness."

A stratified shuffle split strategy and a balanced dataset guarantee fair training and testing. The frontend, coded in html, CSS, and JavaScript, supports dynamic audio visualization and easy user interaction through web audio Api, whereas the backend, implemented with python and flask, processes real-time audio and machine learning operations. Iterative feedback-based updates enhance system flexibility even further, which makes it worthwhile for use in music education, production, transcription, and research applications. In spite of difficulties in overlapping sound separation and intricate polyphonic audio analysis, this research emphasizes the revolutionary potential of intelligent audio processing in developing music technology."

Predicting the price of a pre-owned automobile is a challenging task, as it depends on multiple factors such as the car's age, model, fuel type, kilometres driven, transmission type, and more. Traditional methods often rely on manual inspection or basic pricing guides, which can lead to inconsistent and inaccurate results. In this study, we explore the use of machine learning algorithms to predict the price of second-hand cars by analysing historical data. Various regression-based models like Linear Regression, Rigde Regression, Lasso Regression, Elastic Net, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, LightGBM, XGBoost, Support Vector Regressor, K-Neighbors and MLP Regressor are tested and compared for accuracy and performance. The dataset is cleaned, pre- processed, and used to train and evaluate these models. Our results show that machine learning, especially Random Forest, can predict car prices with high accuracy. We also discuss feature importance to understand which attributes influence the price the most. Overall, the approach provides a fast, data- driven, and reliable way to estimate the value of used automobiles."

There remains a significant challenge to achieving a balance between detection accuracy and real-time inference on resource-constrained edge devices despite advances in deep learning. This paper addresses this gap by enhancing the YOLOv9c object detection framework with two distinct backbone architectures: MobileNet V3-Small, which is a lightweight convolutional neural network optimized for edge deployment, and Swin Transformer, which is a hierarchical vision transformer that captures rich contextual features. We present a systematic, dual-backbone performance benchmark that quantifies the critical trade-off between computational efficiency and detection precision, which is essential for guiding IIoT deployment strategies. We conducted experiments on the Street View Road Damage Detection (SVRDD) dataset to evaluate detection accuracy, computational efficiency, and latency. The MobileNet backbone achieves the highest mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 74.0% (a 1.5% gain over baseline) and recall of 68.8% (a 7.3% gain over baseline), demonstrating improved accuracy while maintaining a low inference time on a baseline GPU, indicating its suitability for deployment on IoT edge devices. Importantly, the MobileNet variant reduces the parameter count from 25.6 M to 2.54 M and the Giga Floating-point Operations Per Second (GFLOPs) from 102.3 to 0.49, making it more efficient for IIoT edge devices. Both backbones performed better than the YOLOv9c baseline model in terms of accuracy, thus providing scalable and practical solutions for real-time infrastructure monitoring. These findings contribute to the development of intelligent, efficient, and scalable object detection systems tailored for smart city and IIoT environments."

    "abstract": "Brain-computer Interface (BCI) technology enables direct communication between the brain and external devices via non-invasive methods and holds significant potential in neu roengineering, rehabilitation, and human-computer interaction. However, decoding motor imagery (MI) from electroencephalo gram (EEG) signals remains challenging due to these signals' non-stationary characteristics and the limited interpretability of existing deep learning models. In this paper, we propose a novel Hierarchical Collaborative Fuzzy Network (HCFN) for interpretable EEG-based MI decoding. We introduce an Adaptive Fuzzy Temporal Convolutional Network (AFTCN) that employs dynamic fuzzy kernels within causal convolutions to extract robust temporal features from EEG signals. Additionally, we design a fuzzy attention-guided Takagi–Sugeno–Kang (TSK) architecture that achieves a tighter integration between feature extraction and fuzzy inference through a novel fuzzy feedback loop, thereby improving the discriminability of extracted features. Extensive experiments on the BCI Competition IV-2a, IV-2b and OpenBMI datasets, under both subject-dependent and cross subject evaluation paradigms, demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in classification ac curacy and Cohen's kappa. Furthermore, we provide multi-level interpretability analyses, from macro to micro perspectives, elucidating the model's decision-making processes and highlighting the advantages of our collaborative reasoning framework over conventional cascaded approaches.

    "abstract": "Perceptual voice quality assessment plays a vital role in diagnosing and monitoring voice disorders. Traditional methods, such as the Consensus Auditory-Perceptual Evaluation of Voice (CAPE-V) and the Grade, Roughness, Breathiness, Asthenia, and Strain (GRBAS) scales, rely on expert raters and are prone to inter-rater variability, emphasizing the need for objective solutions. This study introduces the Voice Quality Assessment Network (VOQANet), a deep learning framework that employs an attention mechanism and Speech Foundation Model (SFM) embeddings to extract high-level features. To further enhance performance, we propose VOQANet+, which integrates self-supervised SFM embeddings with low-level acoustic descriptors-namely jitter, shimmer, and harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR). Unlike previous approaches that focus solely on vowel-based phonation (PVQD-A), our models are evaluated on both vowel-level and sentence-level speech (PVQD-S) to assess generalizability. Experimental results demonstrate that sentence-based inputs yield higher accuracy, particularly at the patient level. Overall, VOQANet consistently outperforms baseline models in terms of root mean squared error (RMSE) and Pearson correlation coefficient across CAPE-V and GRBAS dimensions, with VOQANet+ achieving even greater performance gains. Additionally, VOQANet+ maintains consistent performance under noisy conditions, suggesting enhanced robustness for real-world and telehealth applications. This work highlights the value of combining SFM embeddings with low-level features for accurate and robust pathological voice assessment."

This article empirically analyzes the connections between different training characteristics and the impact of SDC on LLM training. Using deterministic training workloads on real-world SDC-affected hardware, we quantify SDC impact by measuring the difference from the baselines on healthy hardware and provide insights into training robustness against SDC by systematically controlled experiments. We find that SDC impact correlates strongly with training stability and loss landscape regions, with Not-a-Number (NaN) occurring during training larger models. We further study if setting elementwise gradient bounds can mitigate SDC impact considering that SDC can change gradients by large magnitudes. Our results show that a proper bound can reduce the relative performance gap caused by SDC but cannot avoid SDC-induced NaN and may compromise training performance on healthy hardware."

    "abstract": "Electromigration-induced hillocks and voids in Cu interconnects pose increasingly significant reliability challenges to microelectronic devices, as device scaling and current density continue to rise in advanced integrated circuits. These defects can cause critical short-circuit and open-circuit failures. However, the quantitative mechanisms governing these failure modes remain insufficiently understood, limiting the precise prediction of defect morphology and growth dynamics. In this work, we develop a physically based phase field model to investigate the formation and evolution of hillocks and voids in Cu interconnects under electric current stressing, incorporating the influence of grain morphology. Our results show that hillocks tend to form and grow on the anode side, with directional mass migration inducing voids on the cathode side, leading to increased electrical resistance and potential signal degradation. Interconnects with finer polycrystalline structures exhibit more rapid hillock and void growth, due to the increased number of grain boundaries that enhance atomic diffusion pathways. Hydrostatic stress not only flattens void morphology but also accelerates the growth of both hillocks and voids. The stress-driven diffusion flux flows into the hillock regions adjacent to the anode, promoting the formation of taller hillocks. The proposed model qualitatively reproduces key features observed in experimental studies, offering microstructure-aware insights into electromigration-induced failure mechanisms and providing a foundation for predictive reliability analysis and design optimization of Cu interconnects."

    "abstract": "Recently, self-supervised pretraining algorithms have been extensively investigated in the field of remote sensing, yielding significant performance improvements in change detection tasks. However, many existing algorithms inadequately exploit multi-level features, which impedes their ability to precisely extract salient change characteristics and accurately determine the structural integrity of changed targets. Moreover, most mainstream approaches tend to neglect the mining of shallow, frequency-domain details, thereby limiting the model's capacity to discern object boundaries. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multi-dimensional feature alignment self-supervised pretraining framework, termed MDFANet. Specifically, we introduce a Hierarchical Decoupling and Multi-dimensional Feature Alignment (HDMFA) mechanism that facilitates the precise capture of multiple change cues at different levels through decoupled modeling of deep and shallow features and the design of multi-dimensional alignment branches. Additionally, we develop a Shallow Frequency-domain Feature Alignment (SFFA) branch that emphasizes the high-frequency components in the input data, effectively compensating for the inadequate representation of edge features in the spatial domain and enhancing the model's ability to detect complex boundaries. Experimental results on LEVIR-CD, SYSU-CD and EGY-BCD datasets validate the superiority of MDFANet, which outperforms SSLCD, Cmid and other SOTA methods by 1.7–2.3% in F1 score."

The proposed approach aims to complement the existing ERP system while reducing dependence on paper-based processes and Excel spreadsheets on the production floor. The research focuses exclusively on resolving identified challenges using MES, excluding alternative software solutions. Ten thematic categories of challenges were identified: detailed planning, change management, deviation handling, information flow, quality gate implementation, production reporting, traceability, transparency, pending tasks, and non-value-adding work. Primary data collection was conducted through semi-structured and unstructured interviews. Findings indicate that most challenges can be fully or partially mitigated through MES implementation, while detailed planning would require an Advanced Planning and Scheduling (APS) system. These results provide practical insights for manufacturing firms seeking to diagnose operational inefficiencies and evaluate MES as a potential solution."

This paper investigates an advanced architecture for a star-topology IoT network, wherein the central coordinator node is equipped with a solar-based energy harvesting system. The energy accrued is utilized not only to maintain the coordinator’s operational integrity but also to facilitate Wireless Power Transmission (WPT) to neighboring peripheral nodes.

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) vibration measurement is crucial for analyzing the dynamic property of complex structures. To address the issue of large volume and mass in existing FBG accelerometers, a 3D FBG accelerometer based on composite circular hinge is proposed using fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensing technology. The integrated design and 3D printing solution result in the miniaturization of the overall structure, measuring <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$25 ~\\text{mm} \\times 24 ~\\text{mm} \\times 8 ~\\text{mm}$</tex>, with a weight reduction to 18.1 g. This research establishes the dynamic model of the sensor using the virtual displacement and d'Alembert principle. Furthermore, the structural stiffness of the two types of circular hinges are derived by the Castigliano's second theorem. Sensitivity and inherent frequency of the integrated accelerometer are conducted using finite element simulation and vibration experiment. The time-domain and amplitude-frequency curves indicate that the first order inherent frequency of the FBG accelerometer is approximately 500 Hz, with sensitivities of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$35 \\text{pm} / \\mathrm{g}, 70 \\text{pm} / \\mathrm{g}$</tex>, and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$58 \\text{pm} / \\mathrm{g}$</tex> in the <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$X, Y$</tex>, and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$Z$</tex> directions, respectively. Theoretical, simulation, and experimental results show a high degree of consistency. Meanwhile, the stereoscopic layout concept of four FBG enables the self-temperature compensation function of the sensor, with excellent lateral anti-interference performance, making it effectively applicable for structural vibration monitoring."

In a campus deployment, one gateway covered the FIIT parking lot. End-node sensing achieved ±3 cm accuracy over 15 cm to 270 cm. We observed an implementation pitfall: with the LMIC-node stack, deep-sleep timing breaks increased average draw to about 70 mA (≈ 43 h on 3000 mA h) despite a low deep-sleep current, motivating either a different stack or solar assistance. A simple 2-minute edge debounce suppressed transient occupancy flaps and reduced uplinks. We discuss architecture, coverage, and power lessons for student prototypes."

    "abstract": "Text-to-image synthesis is a difficult task. It involves the translation of descriptive text to visual content, which maps language and image representations. Among several approaches, StackGAN was one of the most notable frameworks because of the pioneer two-stage architecture. The first stage generated low-resolution images based on the global structure. Then, the first stage results were utilized and refined in the second stage into high-resolution, realistic images with improved details. This paper reports the performance of StackGAN on a subset of the Flickr dataset where embeddings of textual descriptions are obtained from the USE. Experimental results will show that the model produces semantically coherent images, which are also visually coherent. A study focuses on the prospect of StackGAN in creative content generation and discusses challenges such as maintaining diversity and mitigating artifacts."

This study introduces a novel Explainable AI (XAI) driven framework specifically designed for real-time water quality monitoring and management. The proposed system integrates IoT-based data collection, hybrid cloud-edge preprocessing, interpretable machine learning, and ethical oversight to ensure transparency, trust, and actionable insights. Unlike conventional black-box models, our architecture embeds XAI modules across the entire pipeline from inference to optimization to provide stakeholders with interpretable predictions, anomaly alerts, and resource recommendations.

    "abstract": "Wind energy is rapidly becoming one of the pillars of clean energy production. In 2023, wind power contributed to almost 8% of the global electricity generation. However, the harsh and variable environments to which wind turbines are exposed make them prone to electrical, mechanical, structural, and control system faults. This reliability issue is one of the main challenges of wind energy production. From an electrical perspective, components such as generators, power converters, transformers, and switchgear are the leading contributors to turbine unavailability and costly maintenance. Among these, power converters represent a significant portion of electrical downtime, making them a critical focus for improving system reliability. This article reviews wind turbine converter architectures and examines two representative faults to highlight the dependency of fault detection methods on different architectures. Building on this foundation, we introduce a new architecture-independent fault detection and classification concept. This paper is designed to facilitate future research and practical applications."

    "abstract": "Accurate time recovery and clock synchronization are crucial for achieving high-contrast astronomical images using the recently proposed \"Optical Aperture Synthesis\" (OAS) method, which utilizes photonic integrated circuits (Photo-IC) to align the phases of photons captured by multiple optical sub-apertures/telescopes. In this method, the modulated optical signal from an artificial laser guide star serves as the global phase reference for each sub-aperture/telescope. After this optical signal is converted to an electrical signal and sampled, a digital signal processing (DSP) system processes the modulated signal to suppress excess jitter and accurately measures the phase offset caused by various factors such as atmospheric fluctuations and instrumentation non-idealities. Control signals derived using these phase estimates are fed back to the Photo-IC to correct for the phase variations for all sub-apertures/telescopes. Although numerical simulations showed that the proposed DSP system is possibly accurate enough to recover the phase variations, early measurements showed that temperature variations are detrimental to the stability of the analog signal chain."

Experimental measurements were performed across a range of operating conditions to quantify inverter efficiency and power dissipation characteristics. The results indicate that the choice of PWM method has a significant influence on both switching dynamics and overall power loss, with certain techniques offering a favourable trade-off between efficiency and implementation complexity. These findings provide valuable insight into the selection of PWM control strategies for enhancing the performance and efficiency of BLDC motor drives."

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the detection of phishing attacks in the context of less-automated TLDs (LaTLDs). With the rise of connected devices and social networks, these underdocumented environments are becoming increasingly vulnerable. Existing solutions, often developed for TLDs with large data volumes and mostly unimodal in nature, show limitations when applied to local specificities and attacks that combine multiple modalities.To tackle this challenge, we propose a multimodal approach combining visual analysis (screenshots) and structural analysis (HTML). The method relies on two triplet-based networks trained on augmented data simulating phishing attacks (HTML reformulations generated by language models and visual transformations through noise injection). The distances extracted from each modality are then fused into a supervised classifier.Despite the constraints associated with the limited dataset size and the complexity of multimodality, our approach achieves an F1-score of 0.9948 in the best configuration. These results confirm its effectiveness, outperforming unimodal approaches, and pave the way for integration into national registry governance processes."

A debt risk scoring model ranks countries based on fiscal vulnerability to provide insight into long-term economic resilience. The framework integrates macro-fiscal data through 2024-2025 from OECD and IMF reports. Beyond analytics, the study addresses ethical and governance concerns in the use of AI for fiscal decision-making. Transparency, accountability, and fairness are examined alongside potential biases that may disadvantage developing economies.

We review current trends, common challenges, and effective strategies for integrating these elements in practice. Our methodology involves a broad review of recent literature and real-world examples at the intersection of technology and business. The motivation behind this research stems from the urgent need for agriculture to become more energy-efficient and climate-resilient.

Yet, significant gaps in knowledge and awareness persist, necessitating targeted educational initiatives and transparent communication to foster informed perspectives. In analyzing 184 adults across Milan and Turin, consumer perceptions towards AI-enabled sustainability solutions revealed a generally positive yet varied impact on sustainable behaviors, as well as mixed assessments of government policies related to AI and sustainability.

In this study, based on the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, we employed preprocessing methods including data cleaning, handling of missing and abnormal values, feature engineering, and standardization to construct four machine learning models—LightGBM, RandomForest, KNN, and Naive Bayes—for predicting the onset of diabetes. Model hyperparameters were tuned using 10-fold cross-validation and grid search, and comprehensive evaluations of each model's Accuracy, ROC AUC, Sensitivity, Specificity, and PR AUC were conducted on an independent test set. The experimental results indicate that RandomForest and LightGBM perform exceptionally well across multiple evaluation metrics, exhibiting high predictive accuracy and stability. Furthermore, by applying the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) method for interpretability analysis on the optimal model, we revealed the significant contributions of features such as Glucose, BMI, and Age to the model's decision-making process, with Pregnancies showing a particularly significant positive impact on predicting diabetes risk. This study not only provides an efficient machine learning method for early diabetes screening but also enhances the model's transparency and credibility in clinical applications through interpretability analysis."

    "abstract": "Sedentary behavior in schools and universities contributes to negative health outcomes, creating demand for classroom-based physical activity interventions. Active workstations—including cycling, standing, and treadmill desks—enable movement during academic tasks. This review summarizes studies from 2015–2025 examining their effects on health and learning. Evidence shows that active workstations increase energy expenditure by 15–36% without impairing academic performance; cycling desks yield the largest benefits. Some studies also report gains in attention, concentration, and student engagement, with particular advantages for learners with ADHD or autism spectrum disorders. Effective use depends on appropriate equipment, teacher training, and integration into curricula. Neurophysiological evidence indicates that light activity may enhance cognition through improved arousal and cerebral blood flow. Overall, active workstations offer a feasible way to reduce sedentary time in education while supporting academic outcomes."

    "abstract": "An on-load tap changer (OLTC) controls an electrical transformer’s turns ratio and, consequently, its voltage ratio so that the voltage supplied is constant. This work’s objective is to conduct thorough literature research based on the design and analysis of the autotransformer’s onload tap changer using voltage regulation. A thorough search for relevant papers is conducted using the Scopus database. The search is refined to focus only on the article titles, abstracts, and keywords, while excluding publications written in Chinese and Korean. The study employs machine learning techniques, particularly recurrent neural networks and fuzzy logic controllers, to predict and optimize OLTC operations in dynamic grid conditions, particularly with renewable energy sources. Studies also point to the growing use of vibro-acoustic signal analysis, deep learning models, and frequency domain techniques to diagnose early-stage mechanical faults in OLTC systems. This research contributes to improving operational efficiency and voltage regulation in power systems by optimizing and analyzing the design of on-load tap changers in autotransformers."

    "abstract": "Polar codes have come to the forefront of research in communication channel coding, being a performant scheme used in the fifth $(5 \\mathrm{G})$ and sixth generations $(6 \\mathrm{G})$ with good results in data transmission reliability. Along with their study, special types of decoders were developed. The original one, proposed by the polar code inventor, was called the Successive Cancellation (SC). Over the years, several polar code decoders have been created and tested. In this paper, we investigate the performance of two types: SC and Belief Propagation (BP) under $\\alpha$-stable impulsive noise, a non-Gaussian model that is often present in power line communications or in wireless environments with heavy-tailed interference. Simulation results provide a comparative analysis of the bit error rate (BER) performance as a function of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), highlighting the degradation caused by varying levels of impulsiveness. There is no significant difference between the decoders considered. SC brings a gain of about 0.1 dB at $S N R=3$, when $\\alpha=2$. If the noise is strongly impulsive, $\\alpha=1.5$, the BER has a high value for both SC and BP. Additionally, probability density function (PDF) plots and power spectral density (PSD) representations of the noise are included to illustrate its statistical and spectral characteristics for different values of the model parameters. For $\\alpha=2$, the distribution approaches a Gaussian one. It is symmetric when $\\beta=0$; otherwise, it is skewed to the left (for $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}=-1$) or to the right (for $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}=1$). In the presence of SaS noise, even with a flat PSD, the absolute power level is significantly higher than that of AWGN. All the simulations were done in MATLAB and compared with the Gaussian channel case."

    "abstract": "Real-time highway traffic flow monitoring is essential in constructing traffic management and transportation systems. However, it is still a significant challenge due to the large and increasing traffic flow, complex traffic scenarios and unique geographical environment. This article proposes a novel method for highway traffic flow monitoring based on the spatio-temporal vibration distribution of ultra-weak fiber Bragg grating (UWFBG) arrays. The continuous short-term energy characteristics of each UWFBG sensor are extracted by analyzing the collected vehicle vibration data, and the dynamic spatio-temporal vibration energy distribution of pavement is obtained. Then, vehicle trajectories are retrieved, and the corresponding traffic flow parameters are calculated to achieve long-term stable traffic flow monitoring. Unlike traditional traffic flow detection, which is limited to localized areas or affected by geographic and weather conditions, the experimental results show that the vehicle detection results are highly consistent with the actual situation, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for real-time lane-level traffic flow monitoring in high-volume and complex environment, which provides the sensing foundation for full-time, full-domain, and all-weather traffic flow monitoring of intelligent transportation system."

In particular, we consider apodization in the form of a phase ring grating to increase the detail of the point spread function (PSF), as well as to introduce more significant visual features for different types of aberrations. Note, the ring grating leads to the formation of a conical wave front in the paraxial region and annular intensity in the focal plane. It is known that the conical wave front is associated with Bessel beams, which, due to their special structure, are very sensitive to various wave front distortions. Thus, introducing a conical wave front will lead to a certain pre-distortion, which will increase the detailing of the PSF due to the annular structure of the beam. This should increase the efficiency of detecting/recognizing aberrations using various methods, including artificial intelligence tools."

A balanced and custom-annotated corpus, the LexiGuard-dataset, was created to capture expressions of misogyny, misandry, and neutrality across three levels of toxicity (low, medium, high). The dataset combines synthetic and real-world social media comments and represents a novel resource for offensive language research in the Slovak context. The proposed model, built on the XLM-RoBERTa architecture and optimized through a multitask learning approach, simultaneously classifies the type of expression and its toxicity level. Experimental evaluation achieved 89% accuracy for expression type and 85% for toxicity classification, confirming the model’s robustness in identifying both subtle and explicit manifestations of sexist discourse. A prototype web application demonstrates the system’s applicability, enabling real-time analysis and user interaction. The results highlight LexiGuard’s potential for practical deployment in online content moderation, while also emphasizing the importance of ethical considerations and future extensions toward broader context-aware hate speech detection."

Scenario 1 increases the building’s self-sufficiency from 52.4% to 75.9%, but excess energy is mostly exported due to limited storage. Scenario 2 achieves a 94.9% self-sufficiency rate by integrating a 270 kWh LFP (LiFePO4) battery system, minimizing grid dependence. The results demonstrate the benefits of combining local RES production with storage to support energy independence and decarbonization in urban infrastructure."

    "abstract": "In this paper, a novel ultra-wideband three-dimensional Frequency Selective Surface (3-D FSS) with considerable angle stability is proposed. This FSS comprises two orthogonal metallic elliptical rings submerged in multi-layer dielectric slabs. The stopband of the 3-D FSS is located at DC-5 GHz, while the passband is from 7 GHz to 13 GHz for both TE and TM polarizations. The angle stability of the structure reaches 70°, and the insertion losses of the passband are no more than 0.6 dB, regardless of the varying angles. The transition zone is sharp, and the reflection band rejections are superior to 10 dB below 5 GHz. The orthogonal metallic elliptical rings build the main frame of the filtering characteristics to maintain the bandwidth and the angle stability. Seven layers of dielectric slabs improve the matching between the metallic structures and the free space to alleviate the burrs and the ripples in the passband."

By numerical calculation, the mean velocity was obtained in certain places of the intake and then compared with the swim ability of certain fish species that can be found in the considered river section. Special attention was paid to ensuring upstream migration in rivers, also known as potamodromous migration, which involves fish traveling from lower rivers to higher reaches, often for spawning or feeding. Migration represents a crucial process for maintaining fish populations and supporting healthy ecosystems. Obstacles like dams or intakes can impact migration, reducing the fish populations. Thus, special care and thorough research are required to ensure proper living conditions for aquatic fauna. This paper also summarizes different studies and results obtained so far for maintaining adequate migratory conditions at mountain river water intakes."

    "abstract": "Nowadays, the world faces significant challenges in addressing depression, especially among teenagers. Feelings of worthlessness or guilt, fixation on past failures, and self-blame are common symptoms. Frequent or recurring thoughts of death, suicidal ideation, attempts, or suicide itself can indicate depression, affecting 121 million people worldwide. In today’s social media-dominated world, individuals spend considerable time on platforms like Twitter, primarily communicating via text. This architecture integrates NLP models to gather data efficiently, assisting psychologists in better understanding and treating various mental illnesses. In this work, dataset is obtained from Twitter streaming, and the focus is on classifying tweets containing keywords such as Depression, Anxiety, Sadness, Suicide, death, Stress etc. Models are developed to understand and extract information from English text data, utilizing a suitable deployment architecture to effectively handle data from the Twitter API. This paper focuses on analyzing tweets associated with depression, employing various Machine Learning algorithms for classification such as Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Naive Bayes. Through these classifiers, the objective is to identify patterns and gain insights into depression trends by analyzing a mix of tweets. The classifier models demonstrate higher accuracy and better performance metrics for class 0, with precision and recall values generally exceeding 80%. The reliable, balanced dataset achieves the highest accuracy of 85.6% with Random Forest."

A common approach to recover feasibility is to eliminate the constraints that cause the conflicts in the system. This approach allows the system to provide an explanation as: “if the user is willing to drop some of their constraints, there exists a solution”. However, this form of explanation might not be very informative. A counter-factual explanation is a type of explanation that can provide a basis for the user to recover feasibility by helping them understand what changes can be applied to their existing constraints rather than removing them. We propose an efficient approach NoPropCounter-factualXplain to find counter-factual explanations for infeasible problems. We also propose a version of this algorithm which takes into account preferences called PrefnoPropCounter-factualXplain. We showcase it's usability in real world scenario using the producer/consumer constraint which is useful in problems which involve resource allocation."

    "abstract": "To address the issues of power angle instability and oscillations in grid-forming Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC) stations caused by AC grid voltage sags in flexible HVDC transmission systems, this paper proposes a transient power angle stability control strategy based on Model Predictive Control (MPC). Firstly, a grid-forming MMC station model is established. The relationship between active power, output voltage, and power angle stability is analyzed using the Virtual Synchronous Generator (VSG) power angle characteristic. Secondly, building upon conventional droop control, an MPC algorithm is introduced. The algorithm dynamically optimizes the active power command in real time based on power angle deviation and active power deviation. This indirectly achieves adaptive adjustment of the droop coefficients. By compensating for the active power deficit in the system, it effectively suppresses power angle oscillations. Furthermore, it ensures rapid system recovery to stable operation after grid fault clearance. Finally, a corresponding simulation model is developed on the MATLAB/Simulink platform. Time-domain simulations verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed control strategy."

The influence of these artificial entities poses substantial risks to fundamental freedoms, including thought, expression, and decision-making, while also creating significant social, political, cultural, and economic challenges for society. To mitigate this influence, it is essential to identify and analyze the factors that contribute to the effectiveness of artificial entities. Despite significant advancements in recent years in the detection, modeling, and analyzing of the effects of artificial entities, less attention has been paid to the accurate identification of the factors influencing their role in the formation of public opinion. This gap persists, particularly in the context of simultaneously considering both consensus-building and polarization-inducing stimuli. In this study, we try modeling artificial entities in social networks and conduct a series of experiments under various conditions to examine the factors that influence their success. To this end, we also introduce new criteria for assessing the formation of public opinion and the effectiveness of artificial entities, addressing the current lack of suitable metrics in this domain. The study demonstrates that attachment strategy, intelligence level, and lifespan of artificial entities play critical roles in shaping public opinions. We show that even a small presence of artificial entities can lead to consensus, underscoring the importance of their characteristics in shaping public discourse. By understanding the factors that influence the success of artificial entities in manipulating public opinion, policymakers, social network platforms, governing organizations, and individuals can effectively counteract their influences."

    "abstract": "The imperatively excellent performance of wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) transmission over a fiber optic link, demands flat, i.e. not wavelength-selective transfer function. This implies that, mostly during installation and commissioning of a WDM-aimed fiber link, it is of interest to measure its frequency response, by complex stimulus-response tests using a tunable laser source coupled with an optical spectrum analyzer. On the contrary, a simple and practically costless alternative that we propose here, is testing in time domain by means of the ubiquitous optical time-domain reflectometer (OTDR), considering its distinctly reflective trace pattern as approximation of the fiber channel two-way power-delay profile, whose rms delay spread is the straightforward indicator of the fiber attenuation vs. wavelength characteristics’ unflatness qualifying the fiber as either appropriate for WDM transport, or requiring piecewise “flattening” of the transfer function by applying coherent optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (CO-OFDM). Specifically, the proposed OTDR – aided WDM suitability fiber test model applied on the exemplar traces, showed significant peak-to-peak DWDM spectrum unflatness, i.e. the pronounced frequency selectivity strongly indicating the need for introducing CO-OFDM on top of WDM. This was found to be monotonically tracked by the WDM transmission performance – the bit-error rate (BER) values in particular, measured with and without the CO-OFDM applied."

    "abstract": "The increasing integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into everyday life makes it essential to explain AI-based decision-making in a way that is understandable to all users, including those with disabilities. Accessible explanations are crucial, as accessibility in technology promotes digital inclusion and allows everyone, regardless of their physical, sensory, or cognitive abilities, to use these technologies effectively. This paper presents a systematic literature review of the research on the accessibility of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), specifically considering individuals with sight loss. Our methodology includes searching several academic databases with search terms to capture intersections between XAI and accessibility. The results of this survey highlight the lack of research on accessible XAI (AXAI) and stress the importance of including the disability community in XAI development to promote digital inclusion and accessibility and remove barriers. Most XAI techniques rely on visual explanations, such as heatmaps or graphs, which are inaccessible to individuals who are blind or have low vision. Therefore, it is necessary to develop explanation methods through non-visual modalities, such as auditory and tactile feedback; visual modalities accessible to persons with low vision; and personalized solutions that meet the needs of individuals, including those with multiple disabilities. We further emphasize the importance of integrating universal design principles into AI development practices to ensure that AI technologies are usable for everyone. We conclude the paper by discussing what constitutes a good explanation and desiderata for AXAI implementations."

    "abstract": "Most dependency-aware task scheduling algorithms are formulated with an optimization objective of minimizing makespan. In this paper, we directed our research towards algorithms which optimize for early availability of partial output data in heterogeneous computing environments. We proposed a dependency-aware task scheduling model for heterogeneous datacenters, we built the task scheduling algorithms to be able to adapt to the dynamically changing conditions of a realistic heterogeneous system (varying DAG structures, dynamic arrival of task sub-graphs, task-related computing requirements, resource constraints such as limited battery or limited memory for edge resources). We defined the relevant performance metrics, and we continued our efforts to build the 2HD performance evaluation framework that is publicly available for task scheduling experimentation with support for comprehensive parametrization. In this paper, we proposed heuristic-based (2HD and Rand-2HD) and learning-based (QL-2HD) utility-driven DAG task scheduling algorithms to effectively address our research objective. QL-2HD is a Q-learning enhanced variant of 2HD, designed to learn the DAG structure and the properties of a dynamic heterogeneous computing environment. 2HD provides a gain of 47.62% in utility at a cost of 2.13% makespan loss, and QL-2HD provides a gain of 52.11% in utility at a cost of 4.92% makespan loss, when compared to HEFT and other state-of-the-art algorithms on real-world benchmarks (specifically on the Epigenomics and Montage workflows). By performing experiments on a wide range of graphs of various sizes (up to 8000 tasks), we observed that for larger DAG sizes, we get higher utility gains (up to 82.02% for 2HD and up to 87.72% for QL-2HD) at even lower makespan costs. To illustrate the practical benefit of the utility metric, we outlined the actual difference between makespan and the utility-based time at which 50% of the output data is generated by the system, clearly highlighting the efficiency of the 2HD and QL-2HD utility-driven task scheduling algorithms for earlier partial data readiness. Finally, we highlighted multiple use cases in the edge–cloud continuum that would benefit from the improvements provided by the 2HD and QL-2HD utility-driven algorithms, and suggested future work directions."

Two user studies were conducted: one to ensure the system's usability with 25 healthy individuals, and another to measure tremor improvement over a five-day training program with seven individuals diagnosed with idiopathic PD. PD participants were randomly assigned to either a haptic resistive force group or a no haptic resistance group.

PDS samples the residual voltages from multiple ADC conversion cycles to increase the NS effect, without the need for large integration capacitors of the typical cascaded passive integrators. A preamplifier is placed between the sampling capacitors and the integrator to avoid signal attenuation, while further reducing the area of the integrator. PDS and preamplifier introduce two left-half-plane poles to the noise transfer function (NTF) to boost the NS effect, while reducing the impact of the parasitic capacitance to essentially enhance the robustness. A prototype 9-bit NS-SAR ADC is designed in a 130-nm CMOS process. At an oversampling ratio (OSR) of 16, the proposed PDS NS-SAR ADC achieves 80.93-dB peak signal to noise and distortion ratio (SNDR) and provides 4.2 NS/area efficiency factor.

By combining thermal imaging with a core detector, based on an object detection model, and a secondary detector, leveraging temporal features, the framework significantly enhances the detection of thermal anomalies and the identification of fires using raw Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR) thermal imaging. The framework was tested with different core detectors, trained using the Thermal Anomaly (TA) dataset, on the Fire’s Latent Activity Monitoring and Evaluation through Thermography (FLAME-T) dataset, achieving improvements in mean Average Precision (mAP) and F1 scores of up to 35.9% and 20.9%, respectively, with the addition of the secondary detector. Although these improvements introduced higher processing times, the framework demonstrated its capability to maintain high detection accuracy even on a resource-constrained platform like the Raspberry Pi 5. The proposed novel identification algorithm achieves high classification accuracy for early fires at a significant depth of field, with accuracies of up to 0.913 and identification times of approximately 2 ms, making it suitable for edge applications.

In the context of research, taxation is frequently studied due to the many existing issues and the potential benefits that tax research can offer. The objectives of this study are (1) to identify research trends in taxation, particularly in tax digitalization, and (2) to explore the potential of taxation research for future studies. The current problem is that taxation is often seen as a specific topic with research applications that are limited and highly dependent on the context of each country. However, tax policies in one country can be adopted by others, especially in terms of using technology to enhance tax revenue and oversight. The benefits of this research are: (1) to describe the trends in tax digitalization research, and (2) to provide insights into potential future research, particularly in tax digitalization. The method used in this research is a quantitative description with bibliometric analysis through VOSViewer with the keyword “Digital Taxation System”. The results of bibliometric analysis with the keyword Digital Taxation Sytem show that there are 8 clusters with 73 items with VOSViewer depth analysis showing a less intense green color which indicates that the topic has not been widely researched and discussed. Hence, there is a great opportunity to research the topic of digital taxation systems in the field of taxation. Considering Indonesia’s ongoing implementation of the Core Tax Administration System (CTAS), significant avenues for future research emerge."

    "abstract": "Ethiopia produces a wide range of coffee beans. Coffee is the nation’s primary export, a key source of foreign currency, and a vital income source for farmers. However, the approach to classifying the quality of Wolaita coffee beans is an expert observation with the naked eye. This approach is unfeasible due to subjective decisions, proneness to error due to fatigue, excessive processing time, and a smaller number of experts. Therefore, it is critical to automatically classify the quality classification of the Wolaita coffee bean through a model. Thus, this research tackles the challenges of manually classifying the quality of Wolaita coffee beans by developing an effective model. To do so, the 3133 image dataset was collected from the Ethiopian Commodity Exchange (ECX) Wolaita branch, annotated with domain experts, and preprocessed to make the dataset smooth and clean. In an attempt, the study explored custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), VGG19, and ResNet50 algorithms. All of the work was done using Python and the supporting libraries. Consequently, an experiment result shows that the VGG19 pre-trained model achieves an accuracy of 99.2% to classify the quality of the Wolaita coffee bean into six grades: G1, G2, G3, G4, G5, and UG (ungraded). Therefore, VGG19 was taken as an effective and robust performance for the quality grading of Wolaita coffee beans. Furthermore, automatically classifying the diverse range of agricultural scenarios and refinement of the model can be a future research direction."

Initially, the bowtie antenna was loaded with a standard square patch AMC reflector, which exhibited a significant dip in gain due to strong surface currents on the AMC surface. To address this issue, the design methodology focused on progressively reducing the surface area of the standard square patch AMC unit cell by modifying its edges, thereby decreasing the surface current distribution. This approach resulted in a wide cross shaped AMC design. To further minimize the current distribution, the surface area of the cross shaped AMC design was further reduced, leading to a thinner cross shaped unit cell. However, the AMC became out of phase. Finally, two conducting T-strips were added to the thin cross shaped AMC design, ultimately developing a modified cross shaped AMC design.

Unlike the traditional QAS, the LLM based QAS are general purpose and have the capability of fine-tuned to specific purpose QAS using different techniques. Currently the LLM based pre-trained models are used to develop different QAS. T5, XLM-R, BERT, and SQuaD are the common models used to develop QAS. There are gaps related to those models, including training time, dataset preparation, computational costs, hallucination, biasness, shortage of high-quality datasets are common issues in the existing LLM based QAS. In general the current state of the art of QAS is the application of LLM which has the capability of supporting multimodality depending on the models used and the techniques applied. The Agentic AI is considered as an example of LLM used in QAS. This Agentic AI has the capability of accepting users query, understanding the users query, selecting an AI agent from a list of AI agents that will be responsible for providing answers to the users query, finally the selected AI agents will act based on the query to provide answer for users query. Using such kind of Agentic AI models for QAS will minimize searching time and optimizes QAS efficiency and effectiveness.

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of intelligent driving technology, intelligent perception system plays a more and more important role in enhancing road safety. Millimeter-wave radar serves as a vital component of intelligent perception systems. However, due to the very small radar cross-section (RCS) of pedestrians, it is challenging for millimeter-wave radar to effectively detect pedestrians in complex urban road environments, where the RCS of vehicles is much greater than that of pedestrians. To address this problem, RCS enhancement surfaces are proposed. However, RCS enhancement surfaces are mainly metasurfaces, which can only enhance the RCS in a specific direction, thus cannot operate effectively when the pedestrians are in different gestures on the road. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a wearable wide-angle RCS enhancement flexible surface that can significantly improve the RCS of pedestrians, thereby providing a more reliable guarantee for road safety. This wide-angle RCS enhancement flexible surface is mainly composed of a flexible material surface, a metallic spherical reflector, and a Luneburg lens array. Simulation results show that, when compared with large metal plate, monostatic RCS enhancement in wideangle range of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$-65^{\\circ}$</tex> to 65° can be achieved in frequency range from 77 GHz to 81 GHz.

However, when using methods such as the method of moments for numerical calculations, the coincidence or near coincidence of the source triangle and the field triangle may lead to singularity problems in the integration, seriously affecting the accuracy and efficiency of the calculation. This article proposes an effective method for handling the singularity of surface triangle addition and subtraction. By introducing specific geometric transformations and singular term addition and subtraction techniques, this method successfully solves the singularity problem in surface triangle mesh generation. The experimental results show that this method can significantly improve computational accuracy, reduce computation time, and provide a new and effective means for electromagnetic scattering analysis of complex targets in CEM."

    "abstract": "This paper mainly proposes an improved evaluation design method for electromagnetic compatibility systems. In this method, the weight of each evaluation index is first calculated using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to reflect its relative importance in the overall assessment. The entropy weight method further quantifies the objective weight of the indices to reduce the impact of subjective judgment. The fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method deals with the uncertainty and fuzziness of the evaluation objects through fuzzy mathematics, transforming qualitative evaluations into quantitative values. By using the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method, combined with the weights determined by AHP and the entropy weight method, a comprehensive assessment of the electromagnetic compatibility performance of complex electromagnetic propulsion systems is conducted. The improved AHP-entropy weight fuzzy comprehensive evaluation algorithm combines the systematic nature of AHP, the objectivity of the entropy weight method, and the ability of the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method to handle uncertainty, which can effectively reduce errors caused by subjective and objective factors, providing a new perspective and tool for electromagnetic compatibility assessment. This paper mainly focuses on evaluating a complex electromagnetic system using three EMC design schemes. The improved AHP-entropy weight fuzzy comprehensive evaluation algorithm is used to evaluate and compare the electromagnetic compatibility of these three schemes, ultimately calculating the best electromagnetic compatibility performance, and the calculation results verify the effectiveness of the method."

    "abstract": "Environmental pressures have long driven the shift toward non-fossil fuel alternatives in energy systems. However, the impact of climate change on reliability of renewable sources has received limited attention. Brazil’s energy system, dominated by hydropower (71%), faces increasing strain from prolonged dry conditions and growing peak demand. Only half of this hydro capacity is reservoir-type dispatchable, increasing reliability concerns. While expansions in wind, solar, and natural gas have been pursued, they introduce volatility and logistical complexity, with imposed constraints of domestic reserves and imports. Biomass emerges as a flexible and viable alternative, particularly in decentralized applications. It offers emission reductions and cost savings when derived from locally sourced agricultural residues, in form of biogas and biomethane energy streams. This paper applies the extended Combined Gas and Electricity Network model to assess infrastructure interdependencies and diversification strategies under Brazil’s energy transition. Results show that small-scale biomass, paired with energy efficiency and demand management, enhances resilience. Energy efficiency, despite higher upfront costs, provides long-term savings and emission reductions. The findings highlight the need for diversified, low-emission strategies with energy conservation as the foundation of sustainable development."

Furthermore, we show that the topological charge (TC) of the BBG beams can be dynamically controlled by tuning a single parameter, enabling precise adjustment of the beam's phase structure. These unique properties highlight the potential of BBG beams in applications such as optical microscopy, where rapid intensity rotation enhances longitudinal resolution, and in optical trapping, where tunable vorticity and intensity profiles enable non-destructive manipulation of particles."

Its increasing prevalence, especially among young people, highlights the urgent need for better detection and treatment methods. Early detection of melanoma is crucial because it can quickly extend to different body parts if not caught and treated promptly. Melanoma spreads rapidly and becomes very dangerous if not addressed early. Detecting melanoma early greatly increases the chances of successful treatment, but if it's found late, it can become uncontrollable and impossible to cure. Identifying melanoma visually can be challenging. Melanoma can also appear in different shapes and forms, making it harder to recognize. Various techniques are available for detecting melanoma.

Template matching is then implemented to match the reference defect-free image with the input image to determine areas of mismatch. To prevent unwanted data and false positives, heuristic filtering is implemented. YOLO Class Map Check is then employed to label and classify certain defect types, i.e., missing holes, spurious copper, open circuits, and shorts, on the output image directly. One of the most important features of the system is its AI advisory module, which gives insight into potential reasons for each defect and recommends the necessary corrective measures, helping quality control engineers in decision-making. The analytics dashboard provides real-time metrics on total scans, OK and defective PCBs, and a detailed defect report table exportable as PDF for audits and records. This project is significant since it automates a historically manual, timeconsuming, and error-prone inspection process.

Adding fluid-solid interactions further escalates this complexity, requiring simulations that are both physically accurate and computationally more tractable. Existing methods often fall short in aspects of either accuracy, efficiency, or stability, and sometimes may also consume excessive memory, rendering them unsuitable for many practical applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel, more practical solution combining a collision-enhanced lattice Boltzmann method with a finite-volume approach. This hybrid solver is designed to effectively simulate multiphase, multi-component flows via the phase-field modeling with a novel wetting boundary treatment in the finite-volume framework, while significantly reducing memory consumption. It enables simulations of multiple fluid phases under varied conditions, capturing rich interfacial behaviors. Additionally, it incorporates an immersed-boundary method to efficiently handle complex fluid-solid interactions. Validation tests confirm that our method produces physically consistent results and demonstrates accuracy across multiple evaluations. We provide comprehensive simulation results, along with comparisons of memory consumption and efficiency, highlighting the practical utility and superiority of our solver over conventional methods."

    "abstract": "AlGaN-based far-ultraviolet C light-emitting diodes (far-UVC LEDs) and ultravioletB (UVB) LEDs have a wide range of applications to kill viruses and bacteria, and a large market is expected. However, the efficiency of far-UVC LEDs is still much lower than that of blue LEDs due to the quite low light-extraction efficiency (LEE) and hole injection efficiency. We investigated the influence of Al-compositionally graded Mg-doped multi-quantum-barrier electron-blocking-layer (Al graded p-MQB EBL) and Al-compositionally graded Mg-doped p-AlGaN hole injection layer (HIL) on the carrier injection toward the active region of UVB LED. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the world record 10 % and light output power of 42 mW on bare-wafer under continuouswave operation at room temperature in the absence of standard package, flip-chip, and resin-like lenses are achieved. These improvements are attributed to the use of transparent Al -graded Mg doped p-AlGaN HIL and p-MQB EBL structure for hole transport toward the multi-quantum wells via intra-band tunneling mechanisms. Using Al-graded p-MQB EBL coupled with softly polarized p-AlGaN HIL and the highly reflective 0.4 nm -thick Ni and 200 nm -thick Al p-electrode in the UVB LED were combined effect on EQE. In the case of AlGaN-based far-UVC emission, the influence of the n -AlGaN buffer layer's growth temperature on its relaxation and electrical properties in <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$228{-}$</tex> 230 nm far-UVC LED is also investigated. Quite a low contact resistivity (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\rho_{c}$</tex>) of 0.05Ω - <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\text{cm}^{2}$</tex> on the <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathrm{n}-\\text{AlGaN}$</tex> contact layer was also achieved. The low relaxation ratio is critical for the suppression of transverse magnetic (TM)-mode as well as for promoting transverse electric (TE)-mode emission (along the <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$c$</tex>-axis). Finally, the power and EQE were significantly improved to a record value of 2.2 mW and 0.42 % under pulse operation and 1.4 mW and 0.41 % under CW operation on wafer at RT. This is the highest value of EQE in far-UVC LED grown on c-Sapphire."

    "abstract": "Image captioning has become one of the important areas of research that automatically produces comprehensible natural language descriptions of visual content, especially static images, by integrating computer vision and NLP components. The discipline has seen considerable works done through deep learning architectures, recurrent neural networks and, more recently, vision-language pre-training paradigms. Image captioning is one of the challenging applications of machine learning, especially when describing images in low-resource languages. In this paper, a multilayer CNN-LSTM network is designed for recognizing objects in an image and providing Amharic captions of the same. For the experiment, we have created a manually annotated Amharic version of the Flickr8k dataset. Based on the proposed methodology for a caption generation task, we develop a pre-trained deep learning model combining visual feature extraction and sequence generation. To find out the best model, we did experiments with several model variations by tuning key parameters such as embedding size, epoch, Dropout for encoder and decoder, and dense layer. Performance of the presented system is evaluated using BLEU. Our best model uses an LSTM with embedding size of 256, Dropout for encoder and decoder of 0.4, and deterministic generation, that achieves a BLEU-1 score of 0.529174 and a BLEU-2 value of 0.335369, showing LSTMs can perform quite well for automatic image annotation."

    "abstract": "This study addresses the challenge of deploying accurate yet computationally efficient models for medical image recognition. We propose a hybrid knowledge distillation (KD) strategy that integrates both response-based and feature-based approaches. The method strengthens a lightweight student network by enabling it to learn from a deeper teacher model, with joint optimization guided by a dual-loss function (cross-entropy and temperature-scaled KL divergence) and a feature alignment module. This approach ensures the student model not only learns the final prediction logic but also captures critical mid-level representations and focuses on key anatomical regions, thereby achieving high accuracy and generalization while maintaining a low computational footprint. The proposed method was systematically validated across homogeneous and heterogeneous network architectures, utilizing ResNet families as exemplars. Initial evaluations on CIFAR-10 confirmed the synergistic benefits of our hybrid approach compared to single-modality KD. Subsequently, the strategy was applied to the OCT2017 ophthalmic dataset, where it achieved a remarkable 98.76% accuracy and high recall, demonstrating its strong potential for practical applications such as pre-clinical screening and edge device deployment. This work provides a robust framework for developing generalizable lightweight models for medical imaging. Future research will explore the application of this method to larger-scale and more diverse medical imaging modalities, and further validate its efficacy in actual clinical workflows and segmentation tasks."

    "abstract": "For first-year undergraduate students, making the move from high school to college entails major changes in their academic, social, and personal lives. The preservation of physical health frequently takes a backseat among these modifications. Many academic institutions have implemented mentorship programs designed to help students completely in order to solve this issue. This study examines whether mentorship programs may improve the physical health of first-year college students. This study uses a mixed-methods approach to evaluate the association between mentorship programs and improvements in physical health by combining quantitative surveys and qualitative interviews. Through the use of a questionnaire, information was gathered to assess changes in physical health-related behaviors including exercise frequency and nutritional preferences. Results show that mentorship programs have a beneficial impact on first-year undergraduate students' physical health. Data from the survey show that participants' participation with healthy lifestyle choices has significantly improved, including their frequency of exercise and dietary habits. Mentorship may improve one's quality of life while also helping first-year undergraduate students succeed by boosting their physical wellness."

First, we present a general definition for counterfactuals for model-based clustering that includes plausibility and feasibility constraints. Then we consider the counterfactual generation problem for <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$k$</tex>-means and Gaussian clustering assuming Euclidean distance. Our approach takes as input the factual, the target cluster, a binary mask indicating actionable or immutable features and a plausibility factor specifying how far from the cluster boundary the counterfactual should be placed. In the <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$k$</tex>-means clustering case, analytical mathematical formulas are presented for computing the optimal solution, while in the Gaussian clustering case (assuming full, diagonal, or spherical covariances) our method requires the numerical solution of a nonlinear equation with a single parameter only. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach through illustrative examples and quantitative experimental comparisons."

    "abstract": "We propose a lightweight and adaptable model tailored to German argument mining in two dissimilar domains. It offers improvements over the state-of-the-art, as well as over recent LLM approaches. Specifically, we achieve an 11.5 % absolute improvement across all classes of the SPWSLE dataset as well as 3.5% absolute detection performance boost across all datasets of the CIMT collection. We show that for both tasks, the hitherto disjoint steps of argument detection followed by argument classification can be merged with no loss in quality, resulting in a greater than <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$2 x$</tex> training and inference speed-up. For the naive baseline, this joint scheme also significantly improves results. For CIMT we propose realistic evaluation that incorporates actual detection results instead of simulating perfect detection. We also investigate the transferability between and to new datasets and find it to be higher than in previous work and in certain cases even better than within the dataset. A super model trained on all other datasets adapts to unseen data without re-training or performance loss."

This work presents an original study of such PVCSs, leveraging Gaussian mixture model (GMM) scenario creation, human-in-the-loop analytics, and state-of-the-art Matlab modeling. The originality consists in combining realistic behavioral scenario generation, robust state-of-charge (SOC) and load supervision, and a suite of new visual figures for transparent, user-centric academic evaluation. The “human-in-the-loop” approach, which involves incorporating real-world user behaviors and unpredictability into the computer simulation, is a significant aspect of this research. By capturing daily/behavioral dynamics, renewable energy sources fluctuation, and storage effects across five analytics figures, it has been demonstrated how smart controls and data-driven insights can enhance self-sufficiency and robustness. Results highlight the design trade-offs, detect potential vulnerabilities, and demonstrate the viability of off-grid PVCSs even under human behavioral uncertainty."

Yet, extracting accurate and explainable predictions from complex time-series data remains challenging. Deep learning models such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks offer strong predictive power but act as ‘black boxes,’ while fuzzy systems provide interpretability but lack robustness in dynamic industrial settings. To address these limitations, recent studies have integrated fuzzy inference with LSTMs. In this paper, we propose FiLSTM (Fuzzy Rule Induction for LSTM), a hybrid model that leverages Decision Trees to generate fuzzy rules and membership functions directly from data. This approach enhances both interpretability and prediction, achieving higher accuracy, faster computation, and lower execution time compared to FLSTM. FiLSTM advances PdM systems toward real-time, scalable, and transparent industrial applications."

Manual softening suffers from ergonomic risks, inconsistent pressure application, and long processing times. The proposed device integrates stainless-steel heated rollers (internal temperature $40{ }^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$) with a progressive compression mechanism driven by four rotating symmetric cams. Thermal and structural performance were evaluated via finite-element simulation in ANSYS fluent and ANSYS Mechanical. A theoretical heat-transfer model predicted a power requirement of 66.23 W to maintain a roller surface temperature of $35{ }^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, closely matching the simulation result of 65.26 W (1.5% deviation). Theoretical analysis revealed a contact pressure of 0.21 MPa (0.1% of stainless-steel yield strength), while the simulation resulted 0.247 MPa, and a maximum stress of 1.5 MPa under cyclic loading with peak deformations below $10^{-8} \\mathrm{~m}$. An experimental assessment of an operating torque of $\\mathbf{5. 7 4 ~ N m}$ (safety factor 1.5), informing motor and transmission sizing.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a new quadruped spider bot that is installed with a mini remote Bluetooth camera that helps in increase perception of the environment and movement through rough terrains. While the wheeled rover usually fails to move around obstacles or on a rough surface, the quadruped spider bot is adaptive in its limb structure to be stable and mobile in the obstacle course. The incorporation of a high-resolution Bluetooth camera enables live space and physical barrier surveillance, offering extremely valuable, real time visual feedback into the navigation plan. This capability can overcome the drawback of wheeled robots, in which robots face problems of terrain along with assessment of environment. The mobility of the spider bot is enhanced by its sense system, allowing it to maneuver in rough terrains, and thus more appropriate for rescue, exploration activities or for the physical inspection of remote areas. In the light of the above-discussed findings, this study fills the existing research gap in environmental perception as well as adaptive navigation to enhance advanced characteristics of robotic systems for multifaceted and complex applications. This paper describes the design, construction, and improvement analysis of the quadruped spider bot, it shows that the quadruped spider bot has better mobility and perceptual ability than wheeled robots."

We conducted experiments using the LC-QuAD 1.0 benchmark and a 70B-parameter instruction-tuned LLM, exploring multiple dynamic example selection strategies based on BERT embeddings. We evaluated performance based on the retrieved answers and the structural similarity of the queries. We found that adding similar examples to the prompt enhanced performance; however, the gains became minimal beyond approximately ten examples. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, diversity did not yield the expected improvements. We also conducted an error analysis and further experiments, revealing a recurring issue: even when gold URIs are provided, the models often generate fake URIs, and additional problems persist."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Deep learning models have become central to many computer vision tasks, yet their vulnerability to adversarial attacks-particularly in black-box settings-remains a significant concern. Iterative attacks such as I-FGSM and PGD are commonly used to strengthen perturbations, but their ability to transfer across different architectures remains underexplored. In this paper, we present a systematic evaluation of adversarial transferability across both closely related architectures–Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Dilated CNN–and fundamentally different ones-CNN and Vision Transformer (ViT)-using both high-resolution (ANIMAL5) and low-resolution (FMNIST) datasets. To capture the impact of attack configuration, we vary the perturbation size <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(\\epsilon)$</tex>, step size (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\alpha$</tex>) and number of iterations. Our results show that iterative attacks tend to overfit to the source model and that their transferability decreases as the number of steps increases. This effect is further amplified when architectural differences such as dilation or attention mechanisms are present. Higher <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\epsilon$</tex> values partially compensate for this drop in transferability, providing marginal improvement across settings. In addition, we show that increasing input resolution reduces transferability for CNN and Dilated CNN-based targets, whereas ViTs maintain strong transferability even from low-resolution inputs when global structure is preserved. These findings indicate that architectural generalization, rather than iterative strength alone, is a key driver of adversarial transferability."
