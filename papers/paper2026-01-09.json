    "abstract": "The brain of an organism is a complex system where neurons exhibit significant differences in their properties and connection methods. It is this diversity that endows biological neural networks with powerful computational and reasoning capabilities. At the same time, different types of input signals elicit responses from specific types of neurons, thereby enhancing the network's ability to extract features and tolerate errors. In this work, we aim to simulate heterogeneous neural networks with higher similarity to biological brains. We propose and construct a heterogeneous recurrent spiking neural network model by adjusting the parameters of the LIF neuron model and STDP parameters to build and train a spiking neural network with heterogeneous neuronal and synaptic dynamics. We apply improved Bayesian optimization for parameter tuning in the spiking neural network, enhancing network heterogeneity and improving model robustness and training speed. By analyzing the impact of different heterogeneity features on neuronal and synaptic behavior, we study their influence on the overall performance and behavior of the neural network. Experiments have shown that heterogeneity can significantly improve the performance of spiking neural networks and enhances robustness and generalization capabilities."

    "abstract": "Thermal shock, leg design, and current profile may also affect the transient performance and reliability of a segmented thermoelectric cooler (STEC), but it has not yet been studied. Hence, this study conducts a detailed 3-D transient analysis of STEC with two distinct leg geometries: square and circular cross sections. Effects of various operational conditions, including pulse current profiles, segment leg ratios, and thermal shock scenarios, on the transient supercooling, coefficient of performance (COP), and thermal stress of STEC are investigated. The results indicate that the quadratic current pulse demonstrated the best cooling performance among the tested current pulse shapes, achieving temperature reductions of 5.3 K for square-leg configuration and 6.1 K for circular-leg configuration compared to the steady-state minimum temperatures at optimal current. Additionally, the analysis highlights the influence of segment leg ratios, with a hot-side to cold-side segment length ratio of 7:3, showing improved thermal performance by achieving reduced cold-side temperature. Under thermal shock conditions, higher power current pulses effectively minimized peak temperature rise while maintaining reasonable thermal stress levels. These findings provide valuable insights into optimizing the design and operation of STECs for hotspot cooling applications, paving the way for developing more efficient and reliable next-generation cooling systems."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in non-invasive blood pressure (BP) monitoring are transforming the field, offering alternatives to traditional cuff-based methods that are often limited by discomfort and intermittent measurement. Following PRISMA guidelines, this review systematically analyses studies published between 2020 and 2024, categorizing current BP measurement techniques into cuff-based, cuffless, and contactless methods. Special attention is given to emerging technologies such as photoplethysmography (PPG), electrocardiography (ECG), bioimpedance, radar sensing, and remote PPG (rPPG), as well as the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) for signal processing and BP estimation. The review evaluates the comparative performance, clinical relevance, and readiness for real-world application across modalities. While cuffless and contactless approaches show significant promise for continuous and user-friendly monitoring, their accuracy often depends on calibration, multimodal data fusion, and robust algorithm design. Ethical considerations related to unobtrusive monitoring are also discussed. This work highlights current limitations, identifies future research opportunities, and supports the development of next-generation, AI-driven BP monitoring systems suitable for both clinical and consumer use."

    "abstract": "An accurate detection of the spread of colorectal cancer to lymph nodes is a critical factor in determining the patient prognosis and treatment. Standard histological evaluation faces significant challenges that start from the intrinsic fragility of lymph node tissues, making them difficult to process and prepare for analysis, and from the subsequent manual review of slides, demanding extensive reading time from pathologists. There is a need of computer assisted diagnostic companion of the pathologist that provide objectivity and workflow efficacy. To address this, our study introduces an innovative approach that combines label-free imaging with machine learning (ML) for detection of metastatic invasions into lymph nodes. We utilized a Digital Holographic Microscope to obtain quantitative phase images (QPIs) of unstained samples. QPIs were cropped in superpixels that were classified with two supervised machine learning models (coarse and fine models) based on phase-shift parameters extracted from each superpixel. The ML-based procedure classified pixels with 97.91% Sensitivity and 98.62% Specificity into normal and invasion classes, and delineated invasion and areas with high suspicion grade from normal areas in segmented images. Our tool supports the clinicians in identifying malignant areas and focusing their expertise on the tumor boundaries, representing a step forward in computer-assisted cancer diagnosis."
