    "abstract": "We propose ALiA, a novel adaptive variant of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Specifically, ALiA is a variant of function-linearized proximal ADMM (FLiP ADMM), which generalizes the classical ADMM by leveraging the differentiable structure of the objective function, making it highly versatile. Notably, ALiA features an adaptive stepsize selection scheme that eliminates the need for backtracking linesearch. Motivated by recent advances in adaptive gradient and proximal methods, we establish point convergence of ALiA for convex and differentiable objectives. Furthermore, by introducing negligible computational overhead, we develop an alternative stepsize selection scheme for ALiA that improves the convergence speed both theoretically and empirically. Extensive numerical experiments on practical datasets confirm the accelerated performance of ALiA compared to standard FLiP ADMM. Additionally, we demonstrate that ALiA either outperforms or matches the practical performance of existing adaptive methods across problem classes where it is applicable."

    "abstract": "Coarse-grained molecular dynamics often sacrifices accuracy and transferability for computational efficiency, but the use of machine learned potentials is helping coarse-grained models attain performance on par with atomistic molecular dynamics. Nevertheless, developing representations of the coarse-grained potential energy surface faces severe scaling challenges due to the extreme data demands of widely used \"bottom-up\" coarse-graining objectives. In this work, we show that mean force matching, a strategy for training thermodynamically consistent coarse-grained models, requires 50x fewer training samples and 87% less total atomistic simulation time, while obtaining better accuracy on the potential of mean force for unseen proteins compared to other commonly used objectives. By systematically removing noise from the objective function, we demonstrate that it is possible to scale machine learning architectures for coarse-graining, enabling highly accurate and transferable models. We show the advantages of mean force matching both theoretically and through exhaustive benchmarking using thermodynamic consistency as the primary metric of accuracy."

We show that the longitudinal and Hall magnetoconductivities factorize into a product of a universal part, governed by the chiral anomaly, and a non-universal part that depends on the density of states at the Fermi level. A rotationally invariant observable $\\varkappa = σ(c_V/T)^2$ is introduced as a robust signature of the anomaly, where $σ$ denotes the Euclidean norm of the longitudinal and Hall conductivities and $c_V$ is the specific heat density. This quantity follows a universal $B^2$ dependence and scales as $|\\cosΘ|$, with $Θ$ being the angle between $\\mathbf{E}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$. Through analytical derivation and full numerical simulation, we establish that $\\varkappa$ remains universal independent of system parameters and of the orientation of the magnetic or electric field for fixed $Θ$. The emergent SO(3) symmetry in $\\varkappa$ persists despite the absence of isotropy in both the microscopic model and the low-energy effective theory."

In this work, focusing on entity-based factual queries, we suggest that such a view may conflate different failure mechanisms, and propose an internal, mechanism-oriented perspective that separates Knowledge Existence from Behavior Expression. Under this formulation, hallucination and deception correspond to two qualitatively different failure modes that may appear similar at the output level but differ in their underlying mechanisms. To study this distinction, we construct a controlled environment for entity-centric factual questions in which knowledge is preserved while behavioral expression is selectively altered, enabling systematic analysis of four behavioral cases. We analyze these failure modes through representation separability, sparse interpretability, and inference-time activation steering."

    "abstract": "Classical polarization optics is naturally described by a two-dimensional complex Hilbert space (Jones vectors), so the tensor-product kinematics underlying bipartite nonseparability is already available classically. For statistical (stochastic) optical fields, and under an operational stance where outcomes are not assumed pre-assigned prior to detection, suitably prepared two-beam polarization states can exhibit Bell--CHSH correlations of quantum strength. The same platform offers a tunable, low-cost testbed for stress-testing Bell/CHSH and contextuality witnesses under realistic imperfections (noise, coarse binning, selective sampling). We also outline an alternative preparation based on external conical refraction (ECR), where engineered intersecting conical-refraction rings mimic the intersecting emission cones of SPDC. We give a self-contained categorical formulation: the preparation-and-conditioning pipeline (Hadamard-like splitting, CNOT-like coupling, and routing/conditioning that removes unwanted contributions) is treated as a single morphism in an operational process theory (e.g. $\\mathbf{CPM}(\\mathbf{FHilb})$). From it we functorially extract an empirical model, i.e. a compatible family of context-indexed probability distributions. The Abramsky--Brandenburger sheaf criterion then applies: noncontextuality is the existence of a global section, and CHSH violation is a precise failure-to-glue. This separates kinematic nonseparability from operational contextuality and clarifies why neither, by itself, entails nonlocal causation; contextuality can arise in a classically implementable stochastic-optics regime."

To guide learning under ambiguity, we propose the Spectral-Entropic Uncertainty (SEU) Loss, which jointly captures spatial overlap, spectral consistency, and predictive uncertainty in a unified objective. In complex clinical circumstances with poor image quality, this formulation improves model reliability. Extensive experiments on various publicly available medical datasets, QATA-COVID19, MosMed++, and Kvasir-SEG, demonstrate that our method achieves superior segmentation performance while being significantly more computationally efficient than existing State-of-the-Art (SoTA) approaches.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, with Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) emerging as a key technique for downstream task adaptation. However, existing PEFT methods mainly operate in Euclidean space, fundamentally limiting their capacity to capture complex geometric structures inherent in language data. While alternative geometric spaces, like hyperbolic geometries for hierarchical data and spherical manifolds for circular patterns, offer theoretical advantages, forcing representations into a single manifold type ultimately limits expressiveness, even when curvature parameters are learnable. To address this, we propose Mixture of Space (MoS), a unified framework that leverages multiple geometric spaces simultaneously to learn richer, curvature-aware representations. Building on this scheme, we develop MoSLoRA, which extends Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with heterogeneous geometric experts, enabling models to dynamically select or combine appropriate geometric spaces based on input context. Furthermore, to address the computational overhead of frequent manifold switching, we develop a lightweight routing mechanism. Moreover, we provide empirical insights into how curvature optimization impacts training stability and model performance. Our experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that MoSLoRA consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to 5.6% improvement on MATH500 and 15.9% on MAWPS."

We show that the existing metrics used to measure representational similarity are confounded by network scale: increasing model depth or width can systematically inflate representational similarity scores. To correct these effects, we introduce a permutation-based null-calibration framework that transforms any representational similarity metric into a calibrated score with statistical guarantees. We revisit the Platonic Representation Hypothesis with our calibration framework, which reveals a nuanced picture: the apparent convergence reported by global spectral measures largely disappears after calibration, while local neighborhood similarity, but not local distances, retains significant agreement across different modalities. Based on these findings, we propose the Aristotelian Representation Hypothesis: representations in neural networks are converging to shared local neighborhood relationships."

We extend the same benefit to Madhava's ideas and present Madhava's upapatti i.e proof for the $π$-series as given in Jyesthadeva's Yuktibhasha using modern notation and definitions. We elaborate Madhava's proof at three places (a) to prove that the arc-bit sum is same as the sum of arc-bit approximations (b) to prove convergence and (c) to concisely prove by iteration the power sum approximation. Madhava's method with appropriate changes can be applied to derive the sine and cosine series as well. Madhava also provides the correction terms to accelerate the convergence of the $π$-series. We compare the two proofs i.e Madhava's and the popular proof for $π$ which is based on Leibniz's ideas and observe that they are different since Madhava's is based on the length of the arc where as Leibniz's relies on the area under the arc and in terms of the number of concepts from advanced calculus used in the the two proofs Madhava's proof stands out for its simplicity, thus making a case for it to be appreciated, popularised and taught as the original proof of the $π$-series."

Nevertheless, this process can introduce excessively long responses, inflating inference latency and computational overhead. Prior length-control approaches typically rely on fixed heuristic reward shaping, which can misalign with the task objective and require brittle tuning. In this work, we propose LACONIC, a reinforcement learning method that enforces a target token budget during training. Specifically, we update policy models using an augmented objective that combines the task reward with a length-based cost. To balance brevity and task performance, the cost scale is adaptively adjusted throughout training. This yields robust length control while preserving task reward. We provide a theoretical guarantee that support the method. Across mathematical reasoning models and datasets, LACONIC preserves or improves pass@1 while reducing output length by over 50%. It maintains out-of-domain performance on general knowledge and multilingual benchmarks with 44% fewer tokens. Moreover, LACONIC integrates into standard RL-tuning with no inference changes and minimal deployment overhead."

Finite-energy grid states are generated deterministically using coherently driven entangled nonlinear biphoton sources that produce single-photon frequency-comb supermodes. An optical-frequency-comb reference anchors the time--frequency phase space and enforces commuting displacement stabilizers directly at the hardware level, continuously defining the logical subspace. Timing jitter, spectral drift, and phase noise map naturally onto Gaussian displacement errors within this lattice, yielding intrinsic correctability inside a stabilizer cell. Logical operations correspond to experimentally accessible phase and delay controls, enabling deterministic state preparation and manipulation. Building on the modal time--frequency GKP framework, we identify a concrete pathway toward active syndrome extraction and deterministic displacement recovery using ancillary grid states and interferometric time--frequency measurements. These primitives establish a hardware-compatible route for integrating the time--frequency GKP logical layer into erasure-aware and fusion-based fault-tolerant photonic architectures."

Using quadratic vector autoregressions as a laboratory, we show that linear local projections fail to capture any nonlinearities when shocks are symmetrically distributed. Popular state-dependent local projections specifications capture distinct aspects of nonlinearity: those interacting shocks with their signs capture higher-order effects, while those interacting shocks with lagged states capture state dependence. However, their gains over linear specifications are concentrated in tail shocks or tail states; and, for lag-based specifications, hinge on how well the chosen observable proxies the latent state. Our proposed specification-which augments the linear specification with a squared shock term and an interaction between the shock and lagged observables-best approximates the true responses across the entire joint distribution of shocks and states. An application to monetary policy reveals economically meaningful state dependence, whereas higher-order effects, though statistically significant, prove economically modest."

We present D-SECURE, a framework that combines internal manipulation detection with external evidence-based reasoning for news-style posts. D-SECURE integrates the HAMMER manipulation detector with the DEFAME retrieval pipeline.

Panels are composed per imprint to reflect target demographics, with diversity constraints ensuring representation across age, reading level, and genre affinity. Book concepts compete in single-elimination, double-elimination, round-robin, or Swiss-system tournaments, judged against weighted criteria including market appeal, originality, and execution potential. To reject low-quality LLM evaluations, we implement five automated anti-slop checks (repetitive phrasing, generic framing, circular reasoning, score clustering, audience mismatch). We report results from deployment within a multi-imprint publishing operation managing 6 active imprints and 609 titles in distribution. Three case studies -- a 270-evaluator panel for a children's literacy novel, and two 5-person expert panels for a military memoir and a naval strategy monograph -- demonstrate that synthetic panels produce actionable demographic segmentation, identify structural content issues invisible to homogeneous reviewers, and enable tournament filtering that eliminates low-quality concepts while enriching high-quality survivors from 15% to 62% of the evaluated pool."

We empirically observe that outlier severity intensifies with pre-training scale (e.g., progressing from CLIP to the more extensively trained SigLIP and SigLIP2). Through theoretical analysis as well as empirical correlation studies, we establish the direct link between these activation outliers and dominant singular values of the weights. Building on this insight, we propose Selective Spectral Decay ($S^2D$), a geometrically-principled conditioning method that surgically regularizes only the weight components corresponding to the largest singular values during fine-tuning. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that $S^2D$ significantly reduces activation outliers and produces well-conditioned representations that are inherently quantization-friendly. Models trained with $S^2D$ achieve up to 7% improved PTQ accuracy on ImageNet under W4A4 quantization and 4% gains when combined with QAT. These improvements also generalize across downstream tasks and vision-language models, enabling the scaling of increasingly large and rigorously trained models without sacrificing deployment efficiency."

However, its theoretical role remains only partially understood. In this work, we propose an information-theoretic framework that systematically accounts for the effect of augmentation on generalization and invariance learning. Our approach builds upon mutual information-based bounds, which relate the generalization gap to the amount of information a learning algorithm retains about its training data. We extend this framework by modeling the augmented distribution as a composition of the original data distribution with a distribution over transformations, which naturally induces an orbit-averaged loss function. Under mild sub-Gaussian assumptions on the loss function and the augmentation process, we derive a new generalization bound that decompose the expected generalization gap into three interpretable terms: (1) a distributional divergence between the original and augmented data, (2) a stability term measuring the algorithm dependence on training data, and (3) a sensitivity term capturing the effect of augmentation variability. To connect our bounds to the geometry of the augmentation group, we introduce the notion of group diameter, defined as the maximal perturbation that augmentations can induce in the input space. The group diameter provides a unified control parameter that bounds all three terms and highlights an intrinsic trade-off: small diameters preserve data fidelity but offer limited regularization, while large diameters enhance stability at the cost of increased bias and sensitivity. We validate our theoretical bounds with numerical experiments, demonstrating that it reliably tracks and predicts the behavior of the true generalization gap."

The output state remains diagonal in photon-number basis, making photon counting globally optimal and saturating the multiparameter quantum Cramér-Rao bound without adaptive feedback. Moving beyond ideal unitary evolution, we analyze protocol robustness under concurrent amplitude and phase damping. Using Fisher Information Susceptibility, we establish a clear hierarchy: NOON states offer maximal theoretical sensitivity but exhibit exponential fragility to loss, rendering them impractical. Squeezed vacuum states emerge as robust candidates for steady-state sensing, while cat states prove compelling for transient thermometry by retaining significant coherence after photon loss. We validate these predictions through digital quantum circuit implementation on IBM's \\texttt{ibm_torino} processor. Experimental results confirm the predicted Fisher information landscape while revealing systematic noise-induced biases, demonstrating that current NISQ hardware can effectively benchmark fundamental trade-offs in multiparameter quantum sensing."

    "abstract": "This paper reformulates Transformer/Attention mechanisms in Large Language Models (LLMs) through measure theory and frequency analysis, theoretically demonstrating that hallucination is an inevitable structural limitation. The embedding space functions as a conditional expectation over a σ-algebra, and its failure to be isomorphic to the semantic truth set fundamentally causes logical consistency breakdown. WavePhaseNet Method The authors propose WavePhaseNet, which explicitly constructs a Semantic Conceptual Hierarchy Structure (SCHS) using Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). By applying DFT along the sequence dimension, semantic information is decomposed into frequency bands: low-frequency components capture global meaning and intent, while high-frequency components represent local syntax and expression. This staged separation enables precise semantic manipulation in diagonalized space. Dimensionality Reduction GPT-4's 24,576-dimensional embedding space exhibits a 1/f spectral structure based on language self-similarity and Zipf's law. Through cumulative energy analysis, the authors derive that approximately 3,000 dimensions constitute the lower bound for \"complete representation.\" This demonstrates that reduction from 24,576 to 3,000 dimensions preserves meaning and intent while enabling rigorous reasoning and suppressing hallucination. Cohomological Consistency Control The reduced embedding space, constructed via cohomological regularization over overlapping local windows, allows defining a graph structure and cochain complex. This quantifies inconsistencies among local inferences as coboundary-based losses. Applying harmonic projection based on Hodge theory positions cohomology as a computable regularization principle for controlling semantic consistency, extracting maximally consistent global representations."

A key advantage of the pHEFT construction is its parameter choice, which maintains linear relations between the UV Lagrangian parameters and squared heavy masses. By strictly employing the inverse squared heavy masses as the expansion parameters without imposing additional constraints, pHEFT preserves maximal ultraviolet (UV) information and ensures higher perturbative accuracy by avoiding the additional truncations inherent in more complex, non-linear formulations or extra constraints. Through the analysis of the $Z_2$-symmetric real singlet model and the 2HDM, we illustrate the criteria for identifying viable primary HEFT constructions in UV models with scalar extensions.

We formalize this phenomenon in linear regression settings by showing that a simple ratio involving the exposure model coefficient and residual exposure variance provides an observable measure of this increased sensitivity. Applying our framework to smoking and lung cancer, we document how growing socioeconomic stratification in smoking behavior over time leads to heightened sensitivity to unmeasured confounding in more recent data. These results highlight the importance of multicollinearity when interpreting sensitivity analyses based on proxy adjustment."

Recent learning-based methods have demonstrated strong representational capacity for geometric perception and are increasingly used to augment classical geometry-centric systems in practice. However, whether learning components should directly replace geometric estimation or instead serve as intermediate modules within such pipelines remains an open question. In this work, we address this gap and investigate an end-to-end modular framework for effective spatial reasoning, where learning proposes geometric hypotheses, while geometric algorithms dispose estimation decisions. In particular, we study this principle in the context of relative camera pose estimation on RGB-D sequences. Using VGGT as a representative learning model, we evaluate learning-based pose and depth proposals under varying motion magnitudes and scene dynamics, followed by a classical point-to-plane RGB-D ICP as the geometric backend. Our experiments on the TUM RGB-D benchmark reveal three consistent findings: (1) learning-based pose proposals alone are unreliable; (2) learning-proposed geometry, when improperly aligned with camera intrinsics, can degrade performance; and (3) when learning-proposed depth is geometrically aligned and followed by a geometric disposal stage, consistent improvements emerge in moderately challenging rigid settings. These results demonstrate that geometry is not merely a refinement component, but an essential arbiter that validates and absorbs learning-based geometric observations. Our study highlights the importance of modular, geometry-aware system design for robust spatial perception."

An $L^{2}$-projected averaged normal vector is used in the scheme to facilitate a rigorous convergence analysis. Within the projected--distance framework, we establish the first complete convergence proof for a parametric finite element method that incorporates the MDR tangential motion without relying on evolution equations for the mean curvature or the normal vector, achieving optimal-order error estimates for finite elements of degree $k \\ge 3$. Numerical experiments corroborate the theoretical results and demonstrate that the proposed MDR method maintains mesh quality comparable to the Barrett--Garcke--Nürnberg method, for which convergence has not yet been established."

Traditional parallelization schemes for NN inference on MCM architectures, such as intra-layer parallelism and inter-layer pipelining, show incompetency in breaking through both challenges, limiting the scalability of MCM architectures. We observed that existing works typically deploy layers separately rather than considering them jointly. This underexploited dimension leads to compromises between system computation and communication, thus hindering optimal utilization, especially as hardware/software scale. To address this limitation, we propose Scope, a merged pipeline framework incorporating this overlooked multi-layer dimension, thereby achieving improved throughput and scalability by relaxing tradeoffs between computation, communication and memory costs. This new dimension, however, adds to the complexity of design space exploration (DSE). To tackle this, we develop a series of search algorithms that achieves exponential-to-linear complexity reduction, while identifying solutions that rank in the top 0.05% of performance. Experiments show that Scope achieves up to 1.73x throughput improvement while maintaining similar energy consumption for ResNet-152 inference compared to state-of-the-art approaches."

One time integration technique that is capable of preserving the positivity of quantities for every time step size is the Patankar-trick and its variants. However, in the context of the Euler equations of gas dynamics, we wonder whether the Patankar-trick should be applied to the density and total energy equations or only to one of them. In this work, we discuss one drawback of the schemes when blindly applied to every positive conserved variable and additionally point out how to overcome the issue by balancing the involved numerical fluxes correctly. To illustrate our findings, we investigate modified Patankar--Runge--Kutta (MPRK) schemes in the context of the compressible Euler equations with and without stiff source terms. We discover that it is beneficial to only apply the Patankar-trick in the density equation and to balance the remaining numerical fluxes consistently rather than applying the trick also to the energy equation. This leads also to the preservation of contact discontinuities. We perform numerical experiments to demonstrate that the accuracy of the methods is maintained while the performance of our approach is superior to the traditional application of MPRK schemes."

This new framework clusters devices adaptively based on real-time resource profiles and adapts customized models suited to every cluster's capability. ASA capitalizes on an intelligent agent layer that examines CPU power, available memory, and network environment to categorize devices into three levels: high-performance, mid-tier, and low-capability. Each level is provided with a model tuned to its computational power to ensure inclusive engagement across the network. Experimental evaluation on two benchmark datasets, MNIST and CIFAR-10, proves that ASA decreases communication burden by 43% to 50%, improves resource utilization by 43%, and achieves final model accuracies of 98.89% on MNIST and 85.30% on CIFAR-10.

This introduces a potential mismatch between token-level optimization and the inherently block-level nature of reasoning in these settings. To bridge this gap, we propose Multi-token Policy Gradient Optimization (MPO), a framework that treats sequences of K consecutive tokens as unified semantic actions. This block-level perspective enables our method to capture the compositional structure of reasoning trajectories and supports optimization over coherent, higher-level objectives. Experiments on mathematical reasoning and coding benchmarks show that MPO outperforms standard token-level policy gradient baselines, highlight the limitations of token-level policy gradients for complex reasoning, motivating future research to look beyond token-level granularity for reasoning-intensive language tasks."

These lower bounds give evidence that the currently known classical and quantum algorithms for LH cannot be significantly improved. Furthermore, we are able to demonstrate fine-grained complexity lower bounds for approximating the quantum partition function (QPF) with an arbitrary constant relative error. Approximating QPF with relative error is known to be equivalent to approximately counting the dimension of the solution subspace of $\\mathsf{QMA}$ problems. We show the SETH and QSETH hardness to estimate QPF with constant relative error. We then provide a quantum algorithm that runs in $O(\\sqrt{2^n})$ time for an arbitrary $1/\\mathrm{poly}(n)$ relative error, matching our lower bounds and improving the state-of-the-art algorithm by Bravyi, Chowdhury, Gosset, and Wocjan (Nature Physics 2022) in the low-temperature regime. To prove our fine-grained lower bounds, we introduce the first size-preserving circuit-to-Hamiltonian construction that encodes the computation of a $T$-time quantum circuit acting on $N$ qubits into a $(d+1)$-local Hamiltonian acting on $N+O(T^{1/d})$ qubits.

This representation enables financial structures to be analysed as computable economic systems whose performance and risk characteristics can be evaluated consistently across alternative configurations within a unified stochastic environment.

Traditional image-based methods rely on minimal inter-frame motion to constrain the correspondence search space, which limits their applicability to highly dynamic scenes or necessitates high-speed cameras at the cost of prohibitive storage and computational overhead. We propose an event-frame fusion framework that exploits events for temporally dense motion cues and frames for spatially dense precise estimation. Revisiting the solid elastic modeling prior, we propose an Affine Invariant Simplicial (AIS) framework. It partitions the deformation field into linearized sub-regions with low-parametric representation, effectively mitigating motion ambiguities arising from sparse and noisy events. To speed up parameter searching and reduce error accumulation, a neighborhood-greedy optimization strategy is introduced, enabling well-converged sub-regions to guide their poorly-converged neighbors, effectively suppress local error accumulation in long-term dense tracking. To evaluate the proposed method, a benchmark dataset with temporally aligned event streams and frames is established, encompassing over 120 sequences spanning diverse deformation scenarios. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline by 1.6% in survival rate.

    "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a widely used framework for reducing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) on domain-specific tasks by retrieving relevant documents from a database to support accurate responses. However, when the database contains sensitive corpora, such as medical records or legal documents, RAG poses serious privacy risks by potentially exposing private information through its outputs. Prior work has demonstrated that one can practically craft adversarial prompts that force an LLM to regurgitate the augmented contexts. A promising direction is to integrate differential privacy (DP), a privacy notion that offers strong formal guarantees, into RAG systems. However, naively applying DP mechanisms into existing systems often leads to significant utility degradation. Particularly for RAG systems, DP can reduce the usefulness of the augmented contexts leading to increase risk of hallucination from the LLMs. Motivated by these challenges, we present DP-KSA, a novel privacy-preserving RAG algorithm that integrates DP using the propose-test-release paradigm. DP-KSA follows from a key observation that most question-answering (QA) queries can be sufficiently answered with a few keywords. Hence, DP-KSA first obtains an ensemble of relevant contexts, each of which will be used to generate a response from an LLM. We utilize these responses to obtain the most frequent keywords in a differentially private manner. Lastly, the keywords are augmented into the prompt for the final output. This approach effectively compresses the semantic space while preserving both utility and privacy. We formally show that DP-KSA provides formal DP guarantees on the generated output with respect to the RAG database. We evaluate DP-KSA on two QA benchmarks using three instruction-tuned LLMs, and our empirical results demonstrate that DP-KSA achieves a strong privacy-utility tradeoff."

However, their computational cost can be significant, motivating the use of a mixed-precision paradigm that employs different floating-point precisions for different function evaluations to balance efficiency and accuracy. To ensure that the perturbations introduced by the low precision computations do not destroy the accuracy of the solution, we need to understand how these perturbation errors propagate. We extend the numerical analysis mixed precision framework previously developed for Runge--Kutta methods to characterize the propagation of the perturbation errors arising from mixed precision computations in explicit and implicit two-derivative Runge--Kutta methods. We use this framework for analyzing the order of the perturbation errors, and for designing new methods that are less sensitive to the effect of the low precision computations. Numerical experiments on linear and nonlinear representative PDEs, demonstrate that appropriately designed mixed-precision two-derivative Runge--Kutta methods achieve the predicted accuracy."

Our approach works by learning an encoder that maps natural images uniformly onto a spherical latent space, and a decoder that maps random latent vectors back to the image space. Trained solely through image reconstruction losses, the model generates an image by simply decoding a random point on the sphere. Our architecture naturally supports conditional generation, and looping the encoder/decoder a few times can further enhance image quality. Across several datasets, the sphere encoder approach yields performance competitive with state of the art diffusions, but with a small fraction of the inference cost.

    "abstract": "Gravitational waves (GWs) produced during first-order phase transitions (FOPTs) in the early universe provide a powerful probe of nonstandard cosmological histories. We study GW production from a FOPT ending a kination-dominated epoch in the Kination-Induced Big Bang scenario, in which a period of kination domination terminates through a phase transition that reheats the universe into radiation domination. A rolling scalar field drives the kination epoch. In the specific model we consider, its derivative coupling to a second scalar (tunneling field) dynamically traps the latter in a false vacuum, with the phase transition triggered as the kination field slows due to Hubble friction. We compute the resulting stochastic GW background from bubble nucleation and collisions, presenting analytic estimates and numerical results for the peak amplitude and frequency. In all cases we find an upper bound $Ω_{\\rm GW} h^2\\lesssim 2\\times10^{-7}$ from the bubble percolation condition. In the case where the false vacuum energy dominates at the transition (yet the kination field drives the FOPT), we find $Ω_{\\rm GW}h^2\\gtrsim 10^{-12}$. We further find that the Hubble scale during the phase transition across a broad set of model parameters is bounded by $\\mathscr{O}(10^{-13})M^2/M_{\\rm Pl}\\lesssim H_* \\lesssim \\mathscr{O}(0.1)M^2/M_{\\rm Pl}$, where $M$ is the mass-scale controlling the strength of the interaction between the kination and tunneling fields. The predicted signal spans frequencies from nHz to MHz, allowing the model to explain the signal reported by Pulsar Timing Array experiments and to be constrained or probed by interferometers such as LISA, Advanced LIGO, Cosmic Explorer, and BBO. Interestingly, a FOPT can occur even if the bare tunneling potential has a single minimum, as metastability is generated dynamically by the coupling between the tunneling and the kination field."

Among discrete diffusion approaches, Masked diffusion currently dominates, largely driven by strong perplexity on language modeling benchmarks. In this work, we present the first scaling law study of uniform-state and interpolating discrete diffusion methods. We also show that Masked diffusion models can be made approximately 12% more FLOPs-efficient when trained with a simple cross-entropy objective. We find that perplexity is informative within a diffusion family but can be misleading across families, where models with worse likelihood scaling may be preferable due to faster and more practical sampling, as reflected by the speed-quality Pareto frontier. These results challenge the view that Masked diffusion is categorically the future of diffusion language modeling and that perplexity alone suffices for cross-algorithm comparison. Scaling all methods to 1.7B parameters, we show that uniform-state diffusion remains competitive on likelihood-based benchmarks and outperforms autoregressive and Masked diffusion models on GSM8K, despite worse validation perplexity.

For disordered superconductors, the optical conductivity often can be described within Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory, while in corresponding tunneling experiments, deviations in the observed DOS typically require modelling by the phenomenological Dynes formula. The implications of such Dynes DOS for optics were rarely discussed so far. Here we probe the terahertz conductivity of superconducting NbN thin films with thicknesses ranging from 4.5 to 20nm, which were grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD). Our frequency range from 0.3 to 2.1 THz covers energies below and above the spectral gap. For 20nm thick NbN, we find in the optical conductivity distinct deviations from the BCS model, including a step-like characteristic in the absorption at half the zero-temperature spectral gap. These observations can be fully captured by Dynes electrodynamics with a small and temperature-independent pair-breaking rate. For the other films, we also observe signs of Dynes electrodynamics, and we discuss the evolution of the energy gap, the superfluid density, and the pair-breaking rate as function of film thickness."

There are various techniques, such as spectral convolution, that form the basic building blocks for some convolutional neural network-like architectures on non-Euclidean data. In this paper, the concept of spectral convolution on orbifolds is introduced. This provides a building block for making learning on orbifold structured data accessible using GDL.

Each node consists of an optically interfaced electron spin acting as a data qubit and a long-lived nuclear-spin register acting as a control program. We formalize two modes of programmability: (i) deterministic register control, where the nuclear register is initialized in a basis state to select a specific operation on the data qubit; and (ii) coherent register control, where the register is prepared in superposition, enabling coherent combinations of operations beyond classical programmability. Network protocols are expressed as controller-issued instruction vectors, which we illustrate through a compact realization of the BBPSSW purification protocol. We further show that coherent register control enables interferometric diagnostics such as fidelity witnessing and calibration, providing tools unavailable in classical programmability. Finally, we discuss scalability to multi-electron and multi-nuclear spin architectures and connection to Linear combination of unitaries (LCU) and Kraus formulation."

    "abstract": "Multimodal learning seeks to integrate information from heterogeneous sources, where signals may be shared across modalities, specific to individual modalities, or emerge only through their interaction. While self-supervised multimodal contrastive learning has achieved remarkable progress, most existing methods predominantly capture redundant cross-modal signals, often neglecting modality-specific (unique) and interaction-driven (synergistic) information. Recent extensions broaden this perspective, yet they either fail to explicitly model synergistic interactions or learn different information components in an entangled manner, leading to incomplete representations and potential information leakage. We introduce \\textbf{COrAL}, a principled framework that explicitly and simultaneously preserves redundant, unique, and synergistic information within multimodal representations. COrAL employs a dual-path architecture with orthogonality constraints to disentangle shared and modality-specific features, ensuring a clean separation of information components. To promote synergy modeling, we introduce asymmetric masking with complementary view-specific patterns, compelling the model to infer cross-modal dependencies rather than rely solely on redundant cues. Extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks and diverse MultiBench datasets demonstrate that COrAL consistently matches or outperforms state-of-the-art methods while exhibiting low performance variance across runs. These results indicate that explicitly modeling the full spectrum of multimodal information yields more stable, reliable, and comprehensive embeddings."

While LLMs offer unprecedented scalability and speed, their reliance on web-scale training data raises concerns regarding demographic and behavioral biases that may distort workforce assessment. We present a counterfactual fairness evaluation of LLM-based QA systems across 13 dimensions spanning three categories: Identity, Context, and Behavioral Style. Fairness is quantified using the Counterfactual Flip Rate (CFR), the frequency of binary judgment reversals, and the Mean Absolute Score Difference (MASD), the average shift in coaching or confidence scores across counterfactual pairs. Evaluating 18 LLMs on 3,000 real-world contact center transcripts, we find systematic disparities, with CFR ranging from 5.4% to 13.0% and consistent MASD shifts across confidence, positive, and improvement scores. Larger, more strongly aligned models show lower unfairness, though fairness does not track accuracy. Contextual priming of historical performance induces the most severe degradations (CFR up to 16.4%), while implicit linguistic identity cues remain a persistent bias source. Finally, we analyze the efficacy of fairness-aware prompting, finding that explicit instructions yield only modest improvements in evaluative consistency. Our findings underscore the need for standardized fairness auditing pipelines prior to deploying LLMs in high-stakes workforce evaluation."

    "abstract": "Automatically generating interactive 3D environments is crucial for scaling up robotic data collection in simulation. While prior work has primarily focused on 3D asset placement, it often overlooks the physical relationships between objects (e.g., contact, support, balance, and containment), which are essential for creating complex and realistic manipulation scenarios such as tabletop arrangements, shelf organization, or box packing. Compared to classical 3D layout generation, producing complex physical scenes introduces additional challenges: (a) higher object density and complexity (e.g., a small shelf may hold dozens of books), (b) richer supporting relationships and compact spatial layouts, and (c) the need to accurately model both spatial placement and physical properties. To address these challenges, we propose PhyScensis, an LLM agent-based framework powered by a physics engine, to produce physically plausible scene configurations with high complexity. Specifically, our framework consists of three main components: an LLM agent iteratively proposes assets with spatial and physical predicates; a solver, equipped with a physics engine, realizes these predicates into a 3D scene; and feedback from the solver informs the agent to refine and enrich the configuration. Moreover, our framework preserves strong controllability over fine-grained textual descriptions and numerical parameters (e.g., relative positions, scene stability), enabled through probabilistic programming for stability and a complementary heuristic that jointly regulates stability and spatial relations. Experimental results show that our method outperforms prior approaches in scene complexity, visual quality, and physical accuracy, offering a unified pipeline for generating complex physical scene layouts for robotic manipulation."

It has opened new paradigms in rational catalyst design, predicting fundamental properties, like the adsorption energy and reaction barriers, linked to catalytic performance. However, such applications depend sensitively on the predictive accuracy of DFT and achieving experimental-level reliability, so-called transition-metal chemical accuracy (13 kJ/mol), remains challenging for present density functional approximations (DFAs) or even methods beyond DFT. We introduce a new framework for designing DFAs tailored towards studying molecules adsorbed on transition-metal surfaces, building upon recent developments in non-self-consistent DFAs. We propose two functionals within this framework, demonstrating that transition-metal chemical accuracy can be achieved across a diverse set of 39 adsorption reactions while delivering consistent performance for 17 barrier heights. Moreover, we show that these non-self-consistent DFAs address qualitative failures that challenge current self-consistent DFAs, such as CO adsorption on Pt(111) and graphene on Ni(111). The resulting functionals are computationally practical and compatible with existing DFT codes, with scripts and workflows provided to use them. Looking ahead, this framework establishes a path toward developing more accurate and sophisticated DFAs for computational heterogeneous catalysis and beyond."

    "abstract": "AI agents deployed on decentralized infrastructures are beginning to exhibit properties that extend beyond autonomy toward what we describe as agentic sovereignty-the capacity of an operational agent to persist, act, and control resources with non-overrideability inherited from the infrastructures in which they are embedded. We propose infrastructural sovereignty as an analytic lens for understanding how cryptographic self-custody, decentralized execution environments, and protocol-mediated continuity scaffold agentic sovereignty. While recent work on digital and network sovereignty has moved beyond state-centric and juridical accounts, these frameworks largely examine how sovereignty is exercised through technical systems by human collectives and remain less equipped to account for forms of sovereignty that emerge as operational properties of decentralized infrastructures themselves, particularly when instantiated in non-human sovereign agents. We argue that sovereignty in such systems exists on a spectrum determined by infrastructural hardness-the degree to which underlying technical systems resist intervention or collapse. While infrastructural sovereignty may increase resilience, it also produces a profound accountability gap: responsibility diffuses across designers, infrastructure providers, protocol governance, and economic participants, undermining traditional oversight mechanisms such as human-in-the-loop control or platform moderation. Drawing on examples like Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), and agent key continuity protocols, we analyze the governance challenges posed by non-terminable AI agents and outline infrastructure-aware accountability strategies for emerging decentralized AI systems."

This paper presents a novel Kalman Filter-based uncertainty propagation method that models AAM Flight Management System (FMS) architectures through sigmoid-blended measurement noise covariance. Unlike existing approaches with fixed uncertainty thresholds, our method continuously adapts the filter's measurement trust based on progress toward waypoints, enabling FMS correction behavior to emerge naturally. The approach scales proportionally with control inputs and is tunable to match specific aircraft characteristics or route conditions. We validate the method using real ADS-B data from general aviation aircraft divided into training and verification sets. Uncertainty propagation parameters were tuned on the training set, achieving 76% accuracy in predicting arrival times when compared against the verification dataset, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for strategic flight plan validation in AAM operations."

These properties further enable robust model inversion and optimal trajectory generation, often needed in control applications.

Our characterization is purely combinatorial and is expressed in terms of edge-equivalence classes of vertices.

    "abstract": "In recent times, there has been considerable interest in fault detection within electrical power systems, garnering attention from both academic researchers and industry professionals. Despite the development of numerous fault detection methods and their adaptations over the past decade, their practical application remains highly challenging. Given the probabilistic nature of fault occurrences and parameters, certain decision-making tasks could be approached from a probabilistic standpoint. Protective systems are tasked with the detection, classification, and localization of faulty voltage and current line magnitudes, culminating in the activation of circuit breakers to isolate the faulty line. An essential aspect of designing effective fault detection systems lies in obtaining reliable data for training and testing, which is often scarce. Leveraging deep learning techniques, particularly the powerful capabilities of pattern classifiers in learning, generalizing, and parallel processing, offers promising avenues for intelligent fault detection. To address this, our paper proposes an anomaly-based approach for fault detection in electrical power systems, employing deep autoencoders. Additionally, we utilize Convolutional Autoencoders (CAE) for dimensionality reduction, which, due to its fewer parameters, requires less training time compared to conventional autoencoders. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance and accuracy compared to alternative detection approaches by achieving an accuracy of 97.62% and 99.92% on simulated and publicly available datasets."

    "abstract": "The accurate calculation of guided electromagnetic modes in optical nanofibres is critical for applications in nanophotonics, from quantum interfaces to vectorial light sensing. Standard textbook methods rely on solving a $4\\times4$ matrix eigenvalue problem to find the modal fields. While widely used, this approach has a subtle but significant flaw: the final determination of the field amplitudes requires finding the numerical null space of a theoretically singular matrix, an ill-conditioned problem that introduces large relative errors in the small but physically crucial longitudinal field components. In this work, we introduce a fundamentally more robust and efficient semi-analytical method. By starting from the foundational symmetries of the cylindrical waveguide and employing a judicious normalisation of the field amplitudes, we demonstrate that the problem can be analytically reduced to a much simpler $2\\times2$ system. This reformulation yields two decisive advantages: the dispersion relation is obtained numerically from a simple and well-behaved transcendental equation, and more importantly, the modal field amplitudes are subsequently determined \\emph{analytically}. Our approach completely bypasses the numerical null space calculation, thereby ensuring the accuracy of the full vectorial field structure. This method provides a powerful and reliable tool for the design and analysis of nanofibre-based devices, particularly for applications in chiral quantum optics and nanophotonics where precise knowledge of field polarisation and specifically of the longitudinal components is paramount."

    "abstract": "Aligning ground-level imagery with geo-registered satellite maps is crucial for mapping, navigation, and situational awareness, yet remains challenging under large viewpoint gaps or when GPS is unreliable. We introduce Wrivinder, a zero-shot, geometry-driven framework that aggregates multiple ground photographs to reconstruct a consistent 3D scene and align it with overhead satellite imagery. Wrivinder combines SfM reconstruction, 3D Gaussian Splatting, semantic grounding, and monocular depth--based metric cues to produce a stable zenith-view rendering that can be directly matched to satellite context for metrically accurate camera geo-localization. To support systematic evaluation of this task, which lacks suitable benchmarks, we also release MC-Sat, a curated dataset linking multi-view ground imagery with geo-registered satellite tiles across diverse outdoor environments. Together, Wrivinder and MC-Sat provide a first comprehensive baseline and testbed for studying geometry-centered cross-view alignment without paired supervision. In zero-shot experiments, Wrivinder achieves sub-30\\,m geolocation accuracy across both dense and large-area scenes, highlighting the promise of geometry-based aggregation for robust ground-to-satellite localization."

    "abstract": "To address the global health threat of antimicrobial resistance, antimicrobial peptides (AMP) are being explored for their potent and promising ability to fight resistant pathogens. While artificial intelligence (AI) is being employed to advance AMP discovery and design, most AMP design models struggle to balance key goals like activity, toxicity, and novelty, using rigid or unclear scoring methods that make results hard to interpret and optimize. As the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLM) advance and evolve swiftly, we turn to AI multi-agent collaboration based on such models (multi-agent LLMs), which show rapidly rising potential in complex scientific design scenarios. Based on this, we introduce MAC-AMP, a closed-loop multi-agent collaboration (MAC) system for multi-objective AMP design. The system implements a fully autonomous simulated peer review-adaptive reinforcement learning framework that requires only a task description and example dataset to design novel AMPs. The novelty of our work lies in introducing a closed-loop multi-agent system for AMP design, with cross-domain transferability, that supports multi-objective optimization while remaining explainable rather than a 'black box'. Experiments show that MAC-AMP outperforms other AMP generative models by effectively optimizing AMP generation for multiple key molecular properties, demonstrating exceptional results in antibacterial activity, AMP likeliness, toxicity compliance, and structural reliability."

The corresponding two-parameter family of regular background solutions of the classical equations of maximal supergravity in seven dimensions descends from maximal supergravity in eleven dimensions. We study the global and local stability properties of these solutions. We identify lines of zero-temperature first-order phase transitions, describing a polygon (a square) in the space of parameters, identified with the two fluxes. In the spectrum of fluctuations of the supergravity equations, interpreted as bound states of the dual, confining field theories, we find no evidence of local instabilities (tachyons). Over a significant portion of parameter space, that extends far away from the proximity to the transition, we identify an approximate dilaton, the mass of which is one order of magnitude smaller than the scale set by confinement. Our findings complement those emerging in other holographic models discussed in the literature, in which either the dilaton mass is only mildly lower than the confinement scale (when approaching a first-order transitions), or parametrically suppressed (when reaching the proximity to a second-order one)."

Self-Normalised Inverse Propensity Scoring (SNIPS) is a standard tool for variance reduction in OPE, leveraging a multiplicative control variate. Recent advances in off-policy learning suggest that additive control variates (baseline corrections) may offer superior performance, yet theoretical guarantees for evaluation are lacking. This paper provides a definitive answer: we prove that $β^\\star$-IPS, an estimator with an optimal additive baseline, asymptotically dominates SNIPS in Mean Squared Error. By analytically decomposing the variance gap, we show that SNIPS is asymptotically equivalent to using a specific -- but generally sub-optimal -- additive baseline. Our results theoretically justify shifting from self-normalisation to optimal baseline corrections for both ranking and recommendation."

We argue instead that robust reasoning emerges from linguistic self-reflection, itself internalized from high-quality social interaction. Drawing on Vygotskian developmental psychology, we advance three core positions centered on Introspection. First, we argue for the Social Genesis of the Private Mind: learning from conversational environments rises to prominence as a new way to make sense of the world; the friction of aligning with another agent, internal or not, refines and crystallizes the reasoning process. Second, we argue that dialogically scaffolded introspective experiences allow agents to engage in sense-making that decouples learning from immediate data streams, transforming raw environmental data into rich, learnable narratives. Finally, we contend that Dialogue Quality is the New Data Quality: the depth of an agent's private reasoning, and its efficiency regarding test-time compute, is determined by the diversity and rigor of the dialogues it has mastered. We conclude that optimizing these conversational scaffolds is the primary lever for the next generation of general intelligence."

    "abstract": "Adjoint-based shape optimization of ship hulls is a powerful tool for addressing high-dimensional design problems in naval architecture, particularly in minimizing the ship resistance. However, its application to vessels that employ complex propulsion systems introduces significant challenges. They arise from the need for transient simulations extending over long periods of time with small time steps and from the reverse temporal propagation of the primal and adjoint solutions. These challenges place considerable demands on the required storage and computing power, which significantly hamper the use of adjoint methods in the industry. To address this issue, we propose a machine learning-assisted optimization framework that employs a Conditional Variational Autoencoder-based surrogate model of the propulsion system. The surrogate model replicates the time-averaged flow field induced by a Voith Schneider Propeller and replaces the geometrically and time-resolved propeller with a data-driven approximation. Primal flow verification examples demonstrate that the surrogate model achieves significant computational savings while maintaining the necessary accuracy of the resolved propeller. Optimization studies show that ignoring the propulsion system can yield designs that perform worse than the initial shape. In contrast, the proposed method produces shapes that achieve more than an 8\\% reduction in resistance."

    "abstract": "Golden dark sirens - exceptionally well-localized gravitational-wave (GW) sources without electromagnetic counterparts - offer a powerful route to precision measurements of the Hubble constant, $H_0$, with next-generation (XG) detectors. The statistical promise of this method, however, places stringent demands on waveform accuracy and detector calibration, as even small systematic errors can dominate over statistical uncertainties at high signal-to-noise ratios. We investigate the impact of waveform-modeling systematics on golden dark siren cosmology using a synthetic population of binary black holes consistent with current GW observations and analyzed in the XG-detector era. By comparing state-of-the-art waveform models against numerical-relativity-based reference signals, we quantify modeling inaccuracies from both modeling and data-analysis perspectives and assess how they propagate into biases in luminosity distance, host-galaxy association, and single-event $H_0$ inference. We find that while current waveform models often allow recovery of statistically consistent $H_0$ posteriors, small waveform-induced biases can significantly affect three-dimensional localization and host galaxy ranking, occasionally leading to incorrect redshift assignments. We further derive order-of-magnitude requirements on detector calibration accuracy needed to ensure that calibration systematics remain subdominant for golden dark sirens observed with XG networks. To realize sub-percent $H_0$ measurements with golden dark sirens will require waveform and calibration accuracies that scale as $\\mathcal{O}(ρ^{-2})$ with signal-to-noise ratio, motivating sustained advances in waveform modeling, numerical relativity, and detector calibration for the XG era."

When the modular map is dominant, we obtain a sharp classification: equality occurs only for multiples of odd theta characteristics or of the canonical section. As applications, we derive geometric consequences for plane curves, obtaining results on intersections with very general quartic curves, in the spirit of the work of Chen-Riedl-Yeong, and with quintic curves."

Established experimental probes of light-induced topological states include ultrafast transport and time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, each with important strengths but also well-known limitations. Here we propose ultrafast terahertz scanning tunneling microscopy (THz-STM) as a real space energy-resolved probe of Floquet physics. We show that THz-STM enables direct local detection of bulk Floquet gaps and distinct Floquet edge state signatures. We derive a nonequilibrium Green's-function formalism for time-dependent tunneling that directly extends standard STM theory and provides an intuitive interpretation of rectified ultrafast tunneling currents. We apply the approach to bulk graphene and graphene nanoribbons of variable width. For the bulk, we show that THz-STM provides direct spectroscopic access to Floquet-induced gap openings, and we contrast pulsed pump-probe protocols with the continuous-wave Floquet steady-state limit. For finite ribbons, we demonstrate time- and space-resolved imaging of Floquet-induced topological edge states and identify the ribbon-width scale below which edge state protection breaks down. We further show how band structures of graphene nanoribbons and Floquet chiral edge modes can be reconstructed via Floquet quasiparticle interference. Finally we demonstrate that chiral impurities that break time-reversal symmetry induce characteristic spatial THz-STM signatures that can be used as a direct probe of Floquet edge state chirality."

Recent advances show that robots can instead learn from human videos by extracting interaction cues without direct robot involvement. However, a fundamental challenge remains: how to generalize demonstrated interactions across different object instances that share similar functionality but vary significantly in geometry. In this work, we propose \\emph{Semantic Anchored Functional Maps} (SemFM), a framework for transferring affordances across objects from a single visual demonstration. Starting from a coarse mesh reconstructed from an image, our method identifies semantically corresponding functional regions between objects, selects mutually exclusive semantic anchors, and propagates these constraints over the surface using a functional map to obtain a dense, semantically consistent correspondence. This enables demonstrated interaction regions to be transferred across geometrically diverse objects in a lightweight and interpretable manner. Experiments on synthetic object categories and real-world robotic manipulation tasks show that our approach enables accurate affordance transfer with modest computational cost, making it well-suited for practical robotic perception-to-action pipelines."

We extend interID with an OIDC bridge providing Verifier-as-a-Service, enabling SSI verification through standard OIDC flows. Organizations receive ID Tokens with verified credential attributes without implementing Verifier-specific logic or deploying infrastructure. The multi-tenant architecture leverages Keycloak with strict tenant isolation. Key innovations include PKCE support, scope-to-proof-template mappings translating OIDC scopes into ecosystem-specific verification requests, and a security analysis identifying novel attack surfaces at the intersection of OIDC, SSI, and multi-tenant architectures, threats covered by neither RFC 6819 nor existing SSI analyses alone. Our evaluation demonstrates security equivalence to production identity providers through threat modeling identifying 11 attack vectors, including seven beyond RFC 6819's scope. Integration analysis shows organizations can adopt SSI authentication with comparable effort to adding traditional federated providers.

Beyond a critical mutation rate, the population may even be delocalized completely from the peak of the fitness landscape and the fittest is ironically lost. Extensive efforts have been made to understand this exceptional scenario. But in general, there is no simple prescription that predicts the eventual degree of localization for arbitrary fitness landscapes and mutation rates. Here, we derive a simple and general relation linking the quasispecies' Hill numbers, which are diversity metrics in ecology, and the ratio of an effective fitness variance to the mean mutation rate squared. This ratio, which we call the localization factor, emerges from mean approximations of decomposed surprisal or stochastic entropy change rates. On the side of application, the relation we obtained here defines a combination of Hill numbers that may complement other complexity or diversity measures for real viral quasispecies. Its advantage being that there is an underlying biological interpretation under Eigen's model."

We investigate the finite-sample behavior of a natural U-statistic-type estimator that averages weighted order-statistic contrasts over all subsamples of fixed size and normalizes by the sample mean. A general bias decomposition is derived in terms of components that isolate the effect of random normalization on each rank level, yielding analytical expressions that can be evaluated under broad non-negative distributions via Laplace-transform methods.

    "abstract": "The problem of allocating indivisible resources to agents arises in a wide range of domains, including treatment distribution and social support programs. An important goal in algorithm design for this problem is fairness, where the focus in previous work has been on ensuring that the computed allocation provides equal treatment to everyone. However, this perspective disregards that agents may start from unequal initial positions, which is crucial to consider in settings where fairness is understood as equality of outcome. In such settings, the goal is to create an equal final outcome for everyone by leveling initial inequalities through the allocated resources. To close this gap, focusing on agents with additive utilities, we extend the classic model by assigning each agent an initial utility and study the existence and computational complexity of several new fairness notions following the principle of equality of outcome. Among others, we show that complete allocations satisfying a direct analog of envy-freeness up to one resource (EF1) may fail to exist and are computationally hard to find, forming a contrast to the classic setting without initial utilities. We propose a new, always satisfiable fairness notion, called minimum-EF1-init and design a polynomial-time algorithm based on an extended round-robin procedure to compute complete allocations satisfying this notion."

    "abstract": "Global survey research increasingly informs high-stakes decisions in AI governance and cross-cultural policy, yet no standardized metric quantifies how well a sample's demographic composition matches its target population. Response rates and demographic quotas -- the prevailing proxies for sample quality -- measure effort and coverage but not distributional fidelity. This paper introduces the Global Representativeness Index (GRI), a framework grounded in Total Variation Distance that scores any survey sample against population benchmarks across multiple demographic dimensions on a [0, 1] scale. Validation on seven waves of the Global Dialogues survey (N = 7,500 across 60+ countries) finds fine-grained demographic GRI scores of only 0.33--0.36 -- roughly 43% of the theoretical maximum at that sample size. Cross-validation on the World Values Survey (seven waves, N = 403,000), Afrobarometer Round 9 (N = 53,000), and Latinobarometro (N = 19,000) reveals that even large probability surveys score below 0.22 on fine-grained global demographics when country coverage is limited. The GRI connects to classical survey statistics through the design effect; both metrics are recommended as a minimum summary of sample quality, since GRI quantifies demographic distance symmetrically while effective N captures the asymmetric inferential cost of underrepresentation. The framework is released as an open-source Python library with UN and Pew Research Center population benchmarks, applicable to survey research, machine learning dataset auditing, and AI evaluation benchmarks."

    "abstract": "Navigating large and complex indoor environments, such as universities, airports, and hospitals, can be cognitively demanding and requires attention and effort. While mobile applications provide convenient navigation support, they occupy the user's hands and visual attention, limiting natural interaction. In this paper, we explore conversation hand-off as a method for multi-device indoor navigation, where a Conversational Agent (CA) transitions seamlessly from a stationary social robot to a wearable device. We evaluated robot-only, wearable-only, and robot-to-wearable hand-off in a university campus setting using a within-subjects design with N=24 participants. We find that conversation hand-off is experienced as engaging, even though no performance benefits were observed, and most preferred using the wearable-only system. Our findings suggest that the design of such re-embodied assistants should maintain a shared voice and state across embodiments. We demonstrate how conversational hand-offs can bridge cognitive and physical transitions, enriching human interaction with embodied AI."

    "abstract": "Consider a degeneration of projective algebraic manifolds equipped with a compact group action over a curve. Suppose that the total space carries a Nakano semi-positive vector bundle, which is equivariant with respect to this action. We consider the relative canonical bundle twisted by this bundle. Under this setting, we prove that the logarithm of the equivariant analytic torsion of the regular fibers for this coefficient admits an asymptotic expansion near the discriminant locus. The leading term is given by a logarithmic singularity, while the subdominant term is given by a loglog-type singularity. In the non-equivariant case, we provide a formula for the coefficient of the leading term in terms of an integral of characteristic classes associated with the semi-stable reduction of the family. To establish these results, we prove the existence of an asymptotic expansion for both the equivariant Quillen metrics and the $L^{2}$-metrics in the above setting. We also calculate the leading term of the fiber integral of the Bott-Chern classes associated with the degeneration."

Beyond empowering novice offenders, AI stands to intensify the scale and sophistication of attacks by seasoned cybercriminals. This paper examines the evolving relationship between cybercriminals and AI using a unique dataset from a cyber threat intelligence platform. Analyzing more than 160 cybercrime forum conversations collected over seven months, our research reveals how cybercriminals understand AI and discuss how they can exploit its capabilities. Their exchanges reflect growing curiosity about AI's criminal applications through legal tools and dedicated criminal tools, but also doubts and anxieties about AI's effectiveness and its effects on their business models and operational security. The study documents attempts to misuse legitimate AI tools and develop bespoke models tailored for illicit purposes. Combining the diffusion of innovation framework with thematic analysis, the paper provides an in-depth view of emerging AI-enabled cybercrime and offers practical insights for law enforcement and policymakers."

    "abstract": "Following the detections of the first extragalactic ``Luminous Red Nova'' (LRN) M31 RV in 1989, and its first Galactic counterpart V4332~Sgr in 1994, there have been many discoveries of similar, or closely related, objects. They are important because they bridge the luminosity gap between the brightest novae and supernovae, a largely unexplored parameter space. The cause of eruptions in LRNe is still unclear, a stellar merger being the most favored mechanism. However, barring V1309~Sco, there has been no direct evidence for a merger in the other objects. Here we present strong evidence that V4332~Sgr was a merger event. High resolution infrared observations of the CO fundamental band show an unusually small $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio of $3.5\\pm1$. This indicates that a violent event had occurred, whose effects penetrated deep enough to allow CNO cycle processed $^{13}$C in the inner H burning shell to be brought to the surface. We rule out planetary ingestion, and propose that the eruption was due to a merger between V4332~Sgr and a companion star. It is shown that V4332~Sgr was likely surrounded by an edge-on disk before its eruption. If this disk was a flattened common envelope containing V4332~Sgr and a companion star, then a merger scenario would not be inconsistent. Furthermore, V4332~Sgr had multiple outbursts, previously unreported but an important piece of information, since multiple outbursts are a trait shared by many LRNe."

Using a Transformer-based model, ROSA jointly predicts the future trajectories of vehicles and Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) at roundabouts. Trained for single-step prediction and deployed autoregressively, it generates deterministic outputs, enabling actionable speed advisories. Incorporating motion dynamics, the model achieves high accuracy (ADE: 1.29m, FDE: 2.99m at a five-second prediction horizon), surpassing prior work. Adding route intention further improves performance (ADE: 1.10m, FDE: 2.36m), demonstrating the value of connected vehicle data. Based on predicted conflicts with VRUs and circulating vehicles, ROSA provides real-time, proactive speed advisories for approaching and entering the roundabout. Despite prediction uncertainty, ROSA significantly improves vehicle efficiency and safety, with positive effects even on perceived safety from a VRU perspective.

    "abstract": "We revisit the localization tensor (LT) from geometric and probabilistic perspectives and construct extensions that are naturally compatible with periodic boundary conditions (PBC), without redefining the position operator. In open boundary conditions, we show that the LT can be written exactly as the covariance of a bivariate probability distribution built from density-density correlations. This leads to two conceptually distinct extensions to PBC: (i) a geometric one based on the Riemannian center (Frechet mean) on the circle, and (ii) a metric-free one based on the mutual information I, which treats the configuration space purely as a probability space. We then relate the LT to the static structure factor by identifying the diagonal part, Cpp, as a \"localization function\" C(p), whose small-momentum behavior determines the LT in the thermodynamic limit. This clarifies why the LT is sensitive to transitions out of the extended phase but by itself cannot distinguish Anderson-type localization from dimerization: both share the same low-momentum asymptotics. We show that the finite-momentum behavior of C(p), together with an inverse participation ratio (IPR)-based upper bound valid in localized phases, provides a sharp criterion that discriminates localization from dimerization. These results are illustrated on the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and Aubry-Andre models, with and without interactions, and suggest that structure factor-based probes offer robust and experimentally accessible diagnostics of localized and dimerized phases under PBC."

    "abstract": "Miras and other long-period variable (LPV) stars on the AGB follow period-luminosity (PL) relations. These relations have been difficult to study for Galactic LPVs because their distances were poorly known in the past. We aim to establish the PL relations of solar-neighbourhood Miras for several near-IR photometric bands. To this end, we used multi-epoch photometry from the DIRBE and unTimely/WISE catalogues, Gaia parallax distances, and contemporary pulsation periods obtained from optical observations of a well-selected sample of solar-neighbourhood Miras. We show that clearly defined PL relations in the nine investigated near-IR bands emerge from our data, and we report the slopes and zero-point magnitudes. We find that Galactic Miras are fainter in the near-IR than their Large Magellanic Cloud siblings. We derive average period-temperature, period-bolometric-luminosity, and period-radius relations from fits to synthetic SEDs constructed from the PL relations. By applying AGB evolutionary models, the scatter of stars around the PL sequences can also be used to test whether the parallax uncertainties quoted in the Gaia catalogue are realistic. Furthermore, we performed such tests based on a comparison with parallaxes obtained with the VLBI and with a sample of LPVs in the globular cluster 47 Tuc. We conclude that, for Galactic Miras with a fractional parallax uncertainty of <0.1 in the Gaia catalogue, the parallax uncertainty is underestimated by factors between 1.0 and 1.7, and most likely by $\\sim1.3$. For more uncertain parallaxes, we find evidence that the distances (parallaxes) are generally overestimated (underestimated). Nevertheless, we find strong evidence that the large error-inflation factors reported for AGB stars in the literature are unrealistic. Our results lend confidence to the parallax measurements of these highly extended, variable stars."

    "abstract": "The human visual system tracks objects by integrating current observations with previously observed information, adapting to target and scene changes, and reasoning about occlusion at fine granularity. In contrast, recent generic object trackers are often optimized for training targets, which limits robustness and generalization in unseen scenarios, and their occlusion reasoning remains coarse, lacking detailed modeling of occlusion patterns. To address these limitations in generalization and occlusion perception, we propose GOT-JEPA, a model-predictive pretraining framework that extends JEPA from predicting image features to predicting tracking models. Given identical historical information, a teacher predictor generates pseudo-tracking models from a clean current frame, and a student predictor learns to predict the same pseudo-tracking models from a corrupted version of the current frame. This design provides stable pseudo supervision and explicitly trains the predictor to produce reliable tracking models under occlusions, distractors, and other adverse observations, improving generalization to dynamic environments. Building on GOT-JEPA, we further propose OccuSolver to enhance occlusion perception for object tracking. OccuSolver adapts a point-centric point tracker for object-aware visibility estimation and detailed occlusion-pattern capture. Conditioned on object priors iteratively generated by the tracker, OccuSolver incrementally refines visibility states, strengthens occlusion handling, and produces higher-quality reference labels that progressively improve subsequent model predictions. Extensive evaluations on seven benchmarks show that our method effectively enhances tracker generalization and robustness."

Using monthly data for 67 Shanghai-listed A-H dual-listed firms from January 2011 to May 2019, we estimate a dynamic panel model with two-step system GMM to account for premium persistence and potential endogeneity. Market efficiency is proxied by trading-friction measures derived from daily high-low price ranges. We find that the implementation of SHHK is associated with an average 18.4% increase in the A-H premium. However, this effect is heterogeneous. The marginal policy impact is stronger for firms operating in less efficient markets and weaker for those with higher efficiency, indicating that pre-existing trading frictions condition the policy outcome. We find no significant response at the announcement stage. Placebo tests and alternative efficiency measures confirm the robustness of the efficiency-dependent effect. Overall, the results highlight the role of the information environment in shaping liberalization outcomes."

    "abstract": "We study quantum repeater chains in which entangled links between neighbouring nodes are created through heralded entanglement generation and adjacent links are swapped as soon as possible. Since heralded entanglement generation attempts succeed only probabilistically, some links will have to be stored in quantum memories at the nodes of the chain while waiting for adjacent links to be generated. The fidelity of these stored links decreases with time due to decoherence, and if they are stored for too long then this can lead to low end-to-end fidelity. Previous work has shown that the end-to-end fidelity can be improved by deterministically discarding links when their ages exceed some cutoff value. Such deterministic cutoff policies provide strict control of the fidelity of all links, but they come at the expense of having to track link ages. In this work, we introduce a probabilistic cutoff policy that does not require tracking link ages, at the cost of abandoning strict control of the fidelity. We benchmark this new probabilistic cutoff policy against a deterministic cutoff policy. We compare the policies in terms of the end-to-end rate and fidelity, and the secret-key rate. We find that even though the probabilistic cutoff policy keeps track of less state, it can provide secret-key rates of the same order of magnitude as the deterministic cutoff policy in chains with few nodes or high elementary link generation probabilities. Moreover, we identify a scenario in which the probabilistic cutoff policy can deliver end-to-end links that are required to have some minimum threshold fidelity at a higher rate than the deterministic cutoff policy."

D2-LoRA achieves 76.4 percent average accuracy across eight question answering and reading comprehension benchmarks using only 5k training samples per task and two epochs, while preserving algebraic mergeability at inference with near-exact numerical equivalence. The method combines signed low-rank residual updates with additive and subtractive components, together with a train-time column-wise projection that keeps each column close to its original norm. After training, the adapter is merged into a single weight matrix, adding zero inference latency. Compared with LoRA, D2-LoRA improves average accuracy by 2.2 percentage points; at matched parameter counts (LoRA rank 2r versus D2-LoRA rank r), the improvement is 1.6 points, indicating gains from architectural design rather than increased parameterization. Compared with DoRA, it matches or exceeds performance on most tasks. Beyond QA and reading comprehension, D2-LoRA improves generative tasks (plus 1.2 ROUGE-L and plus 1.1 percent win rate) and shows 36 percent lower training volatility. The merge preserves numerical fidelity (mean gap about 0.03 percentage points) and recovers about 1.91x evaluation throughput. Training overhead is 19 percent, comparable to DoRA, and decreases with longer input sequences.

Instead of using a fixed guidance weight, A2G-DiffRec learns to adaptively weigh the outputs of the main and weak models during training, supervised by a popularity regularization that promotes balanced exposure across items with different popularity levels. Experimental results on the MovieLens-1M, Foursquare-Tokyo, and Music4All-Onion datasets show that A2G-DiffRec is effective in enhancing item-side fairness at a marginal cost of accuracy reduction compared to existing guided diffusion recommenders and other non-diffusion baselines."

    "abstract": "4U 1556-60 is a low-mass X-ray binary that was discovered more than 50 years ago as a persistent X-ray source; however, very little was known about it. Recently, Gaia obtained a parallax for the optical counterpart that places 4U 1556-60 at a distance of only about 700 pc, making it one of the closest X-ray binaries known to date. This close distance drastically alters what was previously assumed about the source. We revisit 4U 1556-60 in light of the newly determined distance of 700 pc, reinterpreting its literature and presenting new X-ray and radio observations to better understand various characteristics of the system. We conclude that a scenario in which 4U 1556-60 is a candidate ultracompact neutron star X-ray binary at a distance of ~700 pc is able to explain the observed properties of the source. It resides at a persistent X-ray luminosity of ~2x10^34 erg/s, an unusual value for a typical X-ray binary, but similar to several ultracompact systems. The ratio of the X-ray to optical luminosity is very high, also suggesting a physically small accretion disk. The radio jet is undetected with a very deep upper limit of 3x10^25 erg/s, which is about 10^3 times fainter than the expected black hole jet correlation, strongly indicating a neutron star accretor. The X-ray spectrum is dominated by a power law, and the X-ray timing properties are also consistent with observations of other very low accretion rate X-ray binaries. No spin or orbital periodicity are found in the X-ray data. Future observations, especially to determine its orbital period, will further aid in understanding 4U 1556-60."

These strategies often rely on characterization of the idling processor, but tomographic recovery of (time-independent) Lindblad dynamics scales exponentially with qubit count. Here, we experimentally benchmark and demonstrate that randomized (\"shadow\") measurements accelerate Lindblad tomography on a superconducting transmon processor. We first implement extensible Lindblad tomography, which estimates Lindblad parameters using a complete tomographic dataset, and use it as a baseline to benchmark a shadow tomography approach, shadow Lindblad tomography. The shadow approach recycles randomized configurations to estimate the same Lindblad parameters using far fewer resources under physically motivated locality assumptions. We experimentally verify these assumptions in our processor by implementing the protocols on one- and three-qubit subsystems; here, shadow Lindblad tomography reproduces extensible Lindblad tomography within uncertainties while using exponentially fewer configurations. Leveraging this efficiency, we apply shadow Lindblad tomography to the full five-qubit processor and recover all single qubit dissipation and two-qubit coupling parameters in 9 hours of acquisition time compared to an estimated 58 hours for extensible Lindblad tomography. Additionally, our shadow implementation is compatible with conventional Gaussian error propagation, avoiding the use of median-of-means estimators. Together, these results demonstrate how randomized shadow tomography protocols can be practically implemented to learn quantum processor dynamics at an increasing qubit count."

Our analysis reveals that Piedmontese incurs a tokenization penalty relative to higher-resource Romance languages, yet LLMs achieve classification performance approaching that of Italian, French, and English.

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of fair allocation of indivisible goods among agents with additive valuations, aiming for Best-of-Both-Worlds (BoBW) fairness: a distribution over allocations that is ex-ante fair, and additionally, it is supported only on deterministic allocations that are ex-post fair. We focus on BoBW for few agents, and our main result is the design of the first BoBW algorithms achieving near-optimal fairness for three agents. For three agents, we prove the existence of an ex-ante proportional distribution whose every allocation is Epistemic EFX (EEFX) and guarantees each agent at least $\\tfrac{9}{10}$ of her MMS. As MMS allocations do not exist for three additive agents, in every allocation at least one agent might not be getting her MMS. To compensate such an agent, we also guarantee that if an agent is not getting her MMS then she is EFX-satisfied - giving her the strongest achievable envy-based guarantee. Additionally, using an FPTAS for near-MMS partitions, we present an FPTAS to compute a BoBW distribution preserving all envy-based guarantees, and also preserving all value-based guarantees up to $(1-\\varepsilon)$. We further show that exact ex-ante proportionality can be restored when dropping EEFX. To do so, we first design, for two agents and any $\\varepsilon > 0$, a Fully Polynomial-Time Approximation Scheme (FPTAS) that outputs a distribution which is ex-ante envy-free (and thus proportional) and ex-post envy-free up to any good (EFX), while guaranteeing each agent at least a $(1-\\varepsilon)$-fraction of her maximin share (MMS). We then leverage this two-agent FPTAS algorithm as a subroutine to obtain, for three agents, the FPTAS guaranteeing exact ex-ante proportionality. We note that our result for two agents essentially matches the strongest fairness and efficiency guarantees achievable in polynomial time, and thus might be of independent interest."

This paper presents a visual perception platform for a continuum robotic system in endoluminal surgery. Our goal is to utilize monocular endoscopic image-based perception algorithms to identify position and orientation of flexible instruments and measure their distances from tissues. We introduce 2D and 3D learning-based perception algorithms and develop a physically-realistic simulator that models flexible instruments dynamics. This simulator generates realistic endoluminal scenes, enabling control of flexible robots and substantial data collection. Using a continuum robot prototype, we conducted module and system-level evaluations. Results show that our algorithms improve control of flexible instruments, reducing manipulation time by over 70% for trajectory-following tasks and enhancing understanding of surgical scenarios, leading to robust endoluminal surgeries."

We present their theoretical foundations, algorithmic designs, and practical enhancements for robustness and scalability, examining how each addresses the fundamental nonconvexity of geometric estimation problems. Our analysis spans ten core vision tasks, from Wahba problem to bundle adjustment, revealing the optimality-robustness-scalability trade-offs that govern solver selection. We identify critical future directions: scaling algorithms while maintaining guarantees, integrating data-driven priors with certifiable optimization, establishing standardized benchmarks, and addressing societal implications for safety-critical deployment. By consolidating theoretical foundations, practical advances, and broader impacts, this survey provides a unified perspective and roadmap toward certifiable, trustworthy perception for real-world applications.

    "abstract": "Proximity operations of rigid bodies, such as spacecraft rendezvous and docking, require precise tracking of both position and attitude over finite time intervals. These operations are often repeated under uncertain conditions, with unknown but repeatable parameters and disturbances. Adaptive iterative learning control (ILC) is well suited to such tasks, as it can track desired trajectories while learning unknown, iteration-invariant signals or parameters. However, conventional adaptive ILC faces two challenges: (i) the coupling between rotational and translational dynamics complicates the design of the two coordinated learning loops for position and attitude, and (ii) standard adaptive ILC designs cannot guarantee bounded control inputs. To address these issues, we propose a dual-number-based, segment-based two-loop adaptive ILC framework for simultaneous high-precision position and attitude tracking. The framework employs two learning loops that interact through a dual-number representation of tracking errors, combining position and attitude errors into a single mathematical object for unified control design. A segment-based dynamic projection mechanism ensures that both parameter estimates and control inputs remain bounded without prior knowledge of uncertainties. Mathematical analysis and numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly enhances tracking performance under unknown but repeatable uncertainties and strong rotational-translational coupling."

    "abstract": "Gravitational-wave observations of binary neutron star systems can shed light on the currently unknown dense matter equation of state. The equation of state determines a large number of neutron star properties, such as tidal deformability, radius, and quadrupole moment, several of which directly affect the emitted gravitational-wave signals. To reduce the dimensionality when computing gravitational-waves and when interpreting observational data, quasi-universal relations are commonly employed to connect different neutron star properties. However, quasi-universal relations are not exact and their use may introduce uncertainty and bias. We explore the potential biases arising from different quasi-universal relations in the third generation era: (i) the Love-Q relation connecting the spin-induced quadrupole moment and the tidal deformability, (ii) the relation between the fundamental mode frequency and the tidal deformability, and (iii) the binary Love relation. We find that for the quadrupole relation biases are only present for rapidly rotating systems, for the binary-Love relation induces moderate biases only in the next-to-leading-order tidal parameters, which can however propagate into the inferred equation of state at low masses. Regarding fundamental mode frequencies, we find that the employed relation introduces only negligible biases, while waveform systematic effects can become comparatively large. Our results highlight that while quasi-universal relations remain a useful tool within gravitational-wave analyses, careful treatment is needed to avoid biases in equation of state measurements with next-generation detectors."

Unfortunately, current optimizers are computationally expensive and do not scale to problems with hundreds or thousands of constraints. One notable exception is the Landing algorithm (Ablin et al., 2024) which, however comes at the expense of temporarily relaxing orthogonality. In this work, we revisit and improve on the ideas behind Landing, enabling the inclusion of modern adaptive optimizers while ensuring that orthogonal constraints are effectively met. Remarkably, these improvements come at little to no cost, and reduce the number of required hyperparemeters. Our algorithm POGO is fast and GPU-friendly, consisting of only 5 matrix products, and in practice maintains orthogonality at all times. On several challenging benchmarks, POGO greatly outperforms recent optimizers and shows it can optimize problems with thousands of orthogonal matrices in minutes while alternatives would take hours. As such, POGO sets a milestone to finally exploit orthogonality constraints in ML at scale. A PyTorch implementation of POGO is publicly available at https://github.com/adrianjav/pogo."

By combining density functional theory calculations with a machine-learning framework, we construct accurate descriptor-based models to predict the formation energies of doped lepidocrocite TiO$_2$ monolayers. The predictive accuracy of machine-learning models was first evaluated for single-dopant Pt configurations, demonstrating that the selected structural and chemical descriptors reliably capture the key factors governing dopant stability. Chemical transferability is then examined by extending the dataset to include Ag-doped configurations. Predictive accuracy improved systematically as additional Ag-doped data points were included in the training, while the performance of Pt remains robust. These results highlight the potential of small and well-curated datasets combined with physically informed descriptors to enable not only accurate but also chemically transferable machine-learning-driven screening in doped TiO$_2$ monolayer."

GitHub Actions, the CI/CD tool integrated into GitHub, allows repository maintainers to automate development workflows. We conducted a mixed methods analysis of GitHub Actions workflow changes over time. Through a preliminary qualitative analysis of 439 modified workflow files we identified seven types of conceptual changes to workflows. Next, we performed a quantitative analysis over 49K+ GitHub repositories totaling 267K+ workflow change histories and 3.4M+ workflow file versions from November 2019 to August 2025. This analysis revealed that repositories contain a median of three workflow files, and 7.3% of all workflow files are being changed every week. The changes made to workflows tend to be small, with about three-quarters containing only a single change. The large majority of the observed changes have to do with task configuration and task specification in workflow jobs. We did not find any conclusive evidence of the effect of LLM coding tools or other major technological changes on workflow creation and workflow maintenance frequency. Our findings highlight the need for improved tooling to support fine-grained maintenance tasks, such as a broader adoption of dependency management and AI-based support for ensuring and sustaining workflow security and quality."

This work introduces the principles of APT as an experimental technique, recalling the aspects potentially leading to compositional biases and underlining in particular the role of the surface electric field in governing the different physical-chemical phenomena that enable the measurement. It reviews the possible mechanisms of specific losses, as well as the methods for assessing a compositional bias and proposing possible correction methods. Finally, it establishes a state of the art on compositional biases in APT of non-metallic materials, on the basis of which it will be possible to conclude on specific recommendations for best practices, and the perspective of application of APT to new materials."

By establishing a general dissipative response theory applicable to both Markovian and non-Markovian environments, we develop a protocol to access the dissipative spectrum (DS) through driven oscillation-dissipation resonance. We show that the DS can identify two-particle soft modes near quantum critical points and, on the normal-phase side, predict the emergence of macroscopic order exhibiting power-law growth following a dissipation quench. These distinctive signatures appear in quasiparticle-dominant regimes, previously considered trivial. Furthermore, we introduce extended dissipative susceptibilities that capture leading memory effects and demonstrate their utility in a dissipative fermionic model. Our results indicate that the DS is readily accessible and offers a versatile tool for probing equilibrium properties as well as predicting nonequilibrium dissipative dynamics."

In this approach, system dynamics is represented as a linear combination of a predefined set of basis functions, and the corresponding coefficients are sparsely estimated from observed time-series data. In this study, we propose sparse identification of quantum Hamiltonian dynamics (SIQHDy), a SINDy-inspired quantum circuit learning framework for estimating quantum Hamiltonian dynamics from time-series data of quantum measurement outcomes. In SIQHDy, the unitary evolution of a quantum Hamiltonian system is expressed as a product of basis quantum circuits, and the corresponding circuit parameters are estimated through sparsity-promoting optimization. We numerically demonstrate that SIQHDy accurately reconstructs the dynamics of single-, three-, and five-spin systems, and exhibits robustness to measurement noise in the three-spin case. Furthermore, we propose an extension of SIQHDy for scenarios with limited accessible observables and evaluate its performance in identifying two-spin systems and in network-structure identification for five-spin systems."

We show that such a system must be transformable into a special control-affine preserved (CAP) structure, which enforces affine dependence of the state on the control input and isolates all nonlinearities into an autonomous subsystem. We further prove that this autonomous subsystem must itself admit a finite-dimensional Koopman linear model with a sufficiently-rich Koopman invariant subspace. Finally, we introduce a symbolic procedure to determine whether a given controlled nonlinear system admits the CAP structure, thereby elucidating whether Koopman approximation errors arise from intrinsic system dynamics or from the choice of lifting functions."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen remarkable advancements, achieving state-of-the-art results in diverse applications. Fine-tuning, an important step for adapting LLMs to specific downstream tasks, typically involves further training on corresponding datasets. However, a fundamental discrepancy exists between current fine-tuning datasets and the token-level optimization mechanism of LLMs: most datasets are designed at the sentence-level, which introduces token-level noise, causing negative influence to final performance. In this paper, we propose XTF, an explainable token-level noise filtering framework. XTF decomposes the complex and subtle contributions of token-level data to the fine-tuning process into three distinct and explicit attributes (reasoning importance, knowledge novelty, and task relevance), which can be assessed using scoring methods, and then masks the gradients of selected noisy tokens accordingly to optimize the performance of fine-tuned LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments on three representative downstream tasks (math, code and medicine) across 7 mainstream LLMs. The results demonstrate that XTF can significantly improve downstream performance by up to 13.7% compared to regular fine-tuning. Our work highlights the importance of token-level dataset optimization, and demonstrates the potential of strategies based on attribute decomposition for explaining complex training mechanisms."

In this paper, we study the sampling efficiency of score-based discrete diffusion models under a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) formulation, with a focus on $τ$-leaping-based samplers. We establish sharp convergence guarantees for attaining $\\varepsilon$ accuracy in Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence for both uniform and masking noising processes. For uniform discrete diffusion, we show that the $τ$-leaping algorithm achieves an iteration complexity of order $\\tilde O(d/\\varepsilon)$, with $d$ the ambient dimension of the target distribution, eliminating linear dependence on the vocabulary size $S$ and improving existing bounds by a factor of $d$; moreover, we establish a matching algorithmic lower bound showing that linear dependence on the ambient dimension is unavoidable in general. For masking discrete diffusion, we introduce a modified $τ$-leaping sampler whose convergence rate is governed by an intrinsic information-theoretic quantity, termed the effective total correlation, which is bounded by $d \\log S$ but can be sublinear or even constant for structured data. As a consequence, the sampler provably adapts to low-dimensional structure without prior knowledge or algorithmic modification, yielding sublinear convergence rates for various practical examples (such as hidden Markov models, image data, and random graphs). Our analysis requires no boundedness or smoothness assumptions on the score estimator beyond control of the score entropy loss."

Here, we investigate Josephson effects in planar and vertical junctions based on CsV$_2$Te$_2$O-family materials, which host hidden $d$-wave altermagnetism with G-type antiferromagnetic order. In monolayer-based planar junctions, the quasi-1D, nearly flat, spin-polarized bands of the altermagnet, when coupled to $s$-wave superconductors, produce a \\textit{fully} spin-polarized supercurrent with strong directional anisotropy -- a spin-selective Josephson effect. In multilayers, we uncover an \\textit{altermagnetic even-odd effect}: spin-polarized supercurrents persist only in odd-layer planar junctions but cancel exactly in even layers. Thus, layer parity acts as a switch for spin-polarized supercurrent. In vertical junctions, odd-layer barriers enhance equal-spin triplet transport while even layers favor opposite-spin transport, yielding a robust period-two oscillation in the total supercurrent with layer number. These layer-parity-dependent responses represent a general even-odd effect in hidden altermagnets, applicable to diverse magnetic and transport phenomena."

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has been a main driver of recent breakthroughs in large reasoning models. Yet it remains a mystery how rewards based solely on final outcomes can help overcome the long-horizon barrier to extended reasoning. To understand this, we develop a theory of the training dynamics of RL for transformers on compositional reasoning tasks. Our theory characterizes how the effectiveness of RLVR is governed by the smoothness of the difficulty spectrum. When data contains abrupt discontinuities in difficulty, learning undergoes grokking-type phase transitions, producing prolonged plateaus before progress recurs. In contrast, a smooth difficulty spectrum leads to a relay effect: persistent gradient signals on easier problems elevate the model's capabilities to the point where harder ones become tractable, resulting in steady and continuous improvement. Our theory explains how RLVR can improve performance at the edge of competence, and suggests that appropriately designed data mixtures can yield scalable gains. As a technical contribution, our analysis develops and adapts tools from Fourier analysis on finite groups to our setting. We validate the predicted mechanisms empirically via synthetic experiments."

While the di-top final state profits from a higher signal cross section, it can be subject to intricate interference patterns. Besides the interference with the large QCD background, in case of the presence of more than one high-mass scalar also large signal--signal interference contributions can occur. We show that in such scenarios it is crucial to account for loop-level mixing for obtaining accurate exclusion bounds. We demonstrate how the interference patterns can obscure the interpretation of possible deviations from the Standard Model expectations. We show that the four-top final state, while giving rise to a smaller signal cross section, provides important complementary information due to its much smaller signal--background interference contributions. Thus, the results obtained from the four-top final state can be instrumental for pinpointing the underlying new physics scenario."

This streamlined approach generates realistic grid structures at the local scale and provides accurate estimates of the total network length at the national scale. Using highly granular population data, this local model reveals a profound connection between population spread and distribution grid, which appears to persist at the global level.

We present SAILS -- Segment Anything with Incrementally Learned Semantics, a training-free framework for Class-Incremental Semantic Segmentation (CISS) that sidesteps these challenges entirely. SAILS leverages foundational models to decouple CISS into two stages: Zero-shot region extraction using Segment Anything Model (SAM), followed by semantic association through prototypes in a fixed feature space. SAILS incorporates selective intra-class clustering, resulting in multiple prototypes per class to better model intra-class variability. Our results demonstrate that, despite requiring no incremental training, SAILS typically surpasses the performance of existing training-based approaches on standard CISS datasets, particularly in long and challenging task sequences where forgetting tends to be most severe. By avoiding parameter updates, SAILS completely eliminates forgetting and maintains consistent, task-invariant performance. Furthermore, SAILS exhibits positive backward transfer, where the introduction of new classes can enhance performance on previous classes."

Solid methane (CH$_4$) is an important molecule in interstellar and planetary environments, serving as a precursor to complex organic compounds and a potential biosignature in exoplanetary studies.

We aim to obtain spectra of methane in binary mixtures at 10 K and compare it to the spectra obtained at 6.7 K. These temperatures correspond to phases II and II* of pure methane and are representative of dark molecular clouds and protostars at early stages. We also aim to test the obtained data applicability to JWST data interpretation. Methods. Laboratory reference spectra were obtained on the ISEAge setup via FTIR spectroscopy in transmission mode. A weighted $χ^2$ minimization is used for the fitting. Results. We present infrared spectra with corresponding band strengths of pure methane and binary mixtures with methane: CH$_4$:H$_2$O,CH$_4$:CO$_2$, CH$_4$:CH$_3$OH, CH$_4$:NH$_3$ at 6.7 K and 10 K showing a 20\\% increase in mixtures compared to commonly used 10 K band strength value of pure methane.

It jointly evaluates personalization performance and privacy risks across diverse scenarios, enabling controlled analysis of long-context model behavior. Extensive evaluations across state-of-the-art LLMs reveal consistent performance degradation in both personalization and privacy as context length increases. We further provide a theoretical analysis of attention dilution under context scaling, explaining this behavior as an inherent limitation of soft attention in fixed-capacity Transformers.

The fuzzy sphere geometry admits two thermodynamic limits: a local planar limit yielding the fuzzy plane, and a commutative limit yielding an ordinary sphere. In the planar limit, high-angular-momentum modes recover the Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman algebra, whereas in the commutative limit the low-angular-momentum modes become semiclassical. We further find an explicit representation of the conformal algebra so(3,2) in the minimal two-electron system and extend it to larger systems via an so(3) equivariant coproduct.

We investigate this problem using pre-trained models, focusing on simple neural networks such as multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), with a case study transferring from LAMOST low-resolution spectra (LRS) to DESI medium-resolution spectra (MRS). Specifically, we pre-train MLPs on either LRS or their embeddings and fine-tune them for application to DESI stellar spectra. We compare MLPs trained directly on spectra with those trained on embeddings derived from transformer-based models (self-supervised foundation models pre-trained for multiple downstream tasks). We also evaluate different fine-tuning strategies, including residual-head adapters, LoRA, and full fine-tuning. We find that MLPs pre-trained on LAMOST LRS achieve strong performance, even without fine-tuning, and that modest fine-tuning with DESI spectra further improves the results. For iron abundance, embeddings from a transformer-based model yield advantages in the metal-rich ([Fe/H] > -1.0) regime, but underperform in the metal-poor regime compared to MLPs trained directly on LRS. We also show that the optimal fine-tuning strategy depends on the specific stellar parameter under consideration. These results highlight that simple pre-trained MLPs can provide competitive cross-survey generalization, while the role of spectral foundation models for cross-survey stellar parameter estimation requires further exploration."

    "abstract": "We propose a planar tunneling setup to probe vacancy-bound Majorana modes in the chiral Kitaev spin liquid. In this geometry, the inelastic tunneling conductance can be expressed directly in terms of real-space spin correlations, establishing a link between measurable spectra and the underlying fractionalized excitations. We show that spin vacancies host localized Majorana states that generate sharp near-zero-bias features, well separated from the continuum of bulk spin excitations. Compared to local STM measurements, the planar configuration naturally enhances the signal by coherently summing over multiple vacancies, reducing spatial resolution requirements. Our results demonstrate a realistic and scalable route to detect Majorana excitations in Kitaev materials."

    "abstract": "Bio-pharmaceutical innovation has shifted: many new drug assets now originate outside the United States and are disclosed primarily via regional, non-English channels. Recent data suggests >85% of patent filings originate outside the U.S., with China accounting for nearly half of the global total; a growing share of scholarly output is also non-U.S. Industry estimates put China at ~30% of global drug development, spanning 1,200+ novel candidates. In this high-stakes environment, failing to surface \"under-the-radar\" assets creates multi-billion-dollar risk for investors and business development teams, making asset scouting a coverage-critical competition where speed and completeness drive value. Yet today's Deep Research AI agents still lag human experts in achieving high-recall discovery across heterogeneous, multilingual sources without hallucinations. We propose a benchmarking methodology for drug asset scouting and a tuned, tree-based self-learning Bioptic Agent aimed at complete, non-hallucinated scouting. We construct a challenging completeness benchmark using a multilingual multi-agent pipeline: complex user queries paired with ground-truth assets that are largely outside U.S.-centric radar. To reflect real deal complexity, we collected screening queries from expert investors, BD, and VC professionals and used them as priors to conditionally generate benchmark queries. For grading, we use LLM-as-judge evaluation calibrated to expert opinions. We compare Bioptic Agent against Claude Opus 4.6, OpenAI GPT-5.2 Pro, Perplexity Deep Research, Gemini 3 Pro + Deep Research, and Exa Websets. Bioptic Agent achieves 79.7% F1 versus 56.2% (Claude Opus 4.6), 50.6% (Gemini 3 Pro + Deep Research), 46.6% (GPT-5.2 Pro), 44.2% (Perplexity Deep Research), and 26.9% (Exa Websets). Performance improves steeply with additional compute, supporting the view that more compute yields better results."

    "abstract": "Cold-start personalization requires inferring user preferences through interaction when no user-specific historical data is available. The core challenge is a routing problem: each task admits dozens of preference dimensions, yet individual users care about only a few, and which ones matter depends on who is asking. With a limited question budget, asking without structure will miss the dimensions that matter. Reinforcement learning is the natural formulation, but in multi-turn settings its terminal reward fails to exploit the factored, per-criterion structure of preference data, and in practice learned policies collapse to static question sequences that ignore user responses. We propose decomposing cold-start elicitation into offline structure learning and online Bayesian inference. Pep (Preference Elicitation with Priors) learns a structured world model of preference correlations offline from complete profiles, then performs training-free Bayesian inference online to select informative questions and predict complete preference profiles, including dimensions never asked about. The framework is modular across downstream solvers and requires only simple belief models. Across medical, mathematical, social, and commonsense reasoning, Pep achieves 80.8% alignment between generated responses and users' stated preferences versus 68.5% for RL, with 3-5x fewer interactions. When two users give different answers to the same question, Pep changes its follow-up 39-62% of the time versus 0-28% for RL. It does so with ~10K parameters versus 8B for RL, showing that the bottleneck in cold-start elicitation is the capability to exploit the factored structure of preference data."

    "abstract": "Individual-level epidemic models are increasingly being used to help understand the transmission dynamics of various infectious diseases. However, fitting such models to individual-level epidemic data is challenging, as we often only know when an individual's disease status was detected (e.g., when they showed symptoms) and not when they were infected or removed. We propose an autoregressive coupled hidden Markov model to infer unknown infection and removal times, as well as other model parameters, from a single observed detection time for each detected individual. Unlike more traditional data augmentation methods used in epidemic modelling, we do not assume that this detection time corresponds to infection or removal or that infected individuals must at some point be detected. Bayesian coupled hidden Markov models have been used previously for individual-level epidemic data. However, these approaches assumed each individual was continuously tested and that the tests were independent. In practice, individuals are often only tested until their first positive test, and even if they are continuously tested, only the initial detection times may be reported. In addition, multiple tests on the same individual may not be independent. We accommodate these scenarios by assuming that the probability of detecting the disease can depend on past observations, which allows us to fit a much wider range of practical applications. We illustrate the flexibility of our approach by fitting two examples: an experiment on the spread of tomato spot wilt virus in pepper plants and an outbreak of norovirus among nurses in a hospital."

Moreover, we investigate the performance of the model in the presence of sparse initial conditions. Our results make use of four Martian years (approx.~34 GB) of training data and a median compute budget of 13 GPU hours. We find that the combination of pretraining and model extension yields a performance increase of 34.4\\% on a held-out year.

    "abstract": "The unitary coupled cluster (UCC) algorithm is one of the most promising implementations of the variational quantum eigensolver for quantum computers. However, for large systems, the number of UCC factors leads to deep quantum circuits, which are prohibitive for execution on quantum hardware. To address this, circuit depth can be reduced at the cost of more measurements with a Taylor series expansion of UCC factors with small angles, while treating the large-angle factors exactly. We implement this approach to quadratic order (qUCC) for systems with strong correlations and systems where conventional methods like coupled cluster (CC) with low excitation levels fail, but UCC and qUCC perform well. We study hydrogen chains and the BeH2 molecule that allow us to change the degree of strong correlation due to geometrical distortions. We show, via a dramatic increase in number of factors able to handle exactly, a systematic convergence of these results as more exact UCC factors are included in the calculations -- the hardest to converge regime is in the crossover from weak to strong coupling. In all cases the total number of UCC factors needed to be treated exactly is much less than the total number of UCC factors available (typically about one-third to one-half of the total number of factors)."

This important problem has been studied since the time of Aristotle, with formal mathematical accounts emerging recently. We live in a world where change due to actions can be both discrete and continuous, that is, hybrid. Yet, despite extensive research on actual causation, only few recent studies looked into causation with continuous change. Building on recent progress, in this paper we propose two definitions of primary cause in a hybrid action-theoretic framework, namely the hybrid temporal situation calculus. One of these is foundational in nature while the other formalizes causation through contributions, which can then be verified from a counterfactual perspective using a modified ``but-for'' test. We prove that these two definitions are indeed equivalent. We then show that our definitions of causation have some intuitively justifiable properties."

    "abstract": "The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a leading approach for combinatorial optimization on near-term quantum devices, yet its scalability is limited by the difficulty of optimizing \\(2p\\) variational parameters for a large number \\(p\\) of layers. Recent empirical studies indicate that optimal QAOA angles exhibit concentration and transferability across problem sizes. Leveraging this observation, we propose a schedule-learning framework that transfers spectral-gap-informed adiabatic control strategies from small-scale instances to larger systems. Our method extracts the spectral gap profile of small problems and constructs a continuous schedule governed by \\(\\partial_t s = κg^q(s)\\), where \\(g(s)\\) is the instantaneous gap and \\((κ, q)\\) are global hyperparameters. Discretizing this schedule yields closed-form expressions for all QAOA angles, reducing the classical optimization task from \\(2p\\) parameters to only \\(2\\), independent of circuit depth. This drastic parameter compression mitigates classical optimization overhead and reduces sensitivity to barren plateau phenomena. Numerical simulations on random QUBO and 3-regular MaxCut instances demonstrate that the learnt schedules transfer effectively to larger systems while achieving competitive approximation ratios. Our results suggest that gap-informed schedule transfers provide a scalable and parameter-efficient strategy for QAOA."

Within this framework, non-relativistic matter fields admit a covariant description, while the physical Newtonian dynamics is recovered through an immersion into the usual $3+1$ spacetime. By adopting a Gödel-like metric ansatz and coupling the gravitational field to a Galilean fluid derived from a variational principle, we obtain a system of highly nonlinear and coupled field equations. Exact solutions are constructed by fixing the matter sector consistently with the field equations. The resulting configurations describe rotating non-relativistic universes and satisfy $D(x)>H(x)$ throughout the entire spatial domain. As a consequence, the associated Killing vector remains spacelike everywhere and no closed timelike curves arise."

There, a dual-level reversible reference system propagator algorithm (RESPA) formalism couples a target accurate conservative potential to a simplified distilled representation optimized for the production of non-conservative forces. Despite being non-conservative, the distilled architecture is designed to enforce key physical priors, such as equivariance under rotation and cancellation of atomic force components. These choices facilitate the distillation process and therefore improve drastically the robustness of simulation, significantly limiting the \"holes\" in the simpler potential, thus achieving excellent agreement with the forces data. Overall, the DMTS-NC scheme is found to be more stable and efficient than its conservative counterpart with additional speedups reaching 15-30% over DMTS. Requiring no finetuning steps, it is easier to implement and can be pushed to the limit of the systems physical resonances to maintain accuracy while providing maximum efficiency. As for DMTS, DMTS-NC is applicable to any neural network potential."

Unlike approaches that treat physical grounding as a fine-tuning afterthought, DM0 unifies embodied manipulation and navigation by learning from heterogeneous data sources from the onset. Our methodology follows a comprehensive three-stage pipeline: Pretraining, Mid-Training, and Post-Training. First, we conduct large-scale unified pretraining on the Vision-Language Model (VLM) using diverse corpora--seamlessly integrating web text, autonomous driving scenarios, and embodied interaction logs-to jointly acquire semantic knowledge and physical priors. Subsequently, we build a flow-matching action expert atop the VLM. To reconcile high-level reasoning with low-level control, DM0 employs a hybrid training strategy: for embodied data, gradients from the action expert are not backpropagated to the VLM to preserve generalized representations, while the VLM remains trainable on non-embodied data. Furthermore, we introduce an Embodied Spatial Scaffolding strategy to construct spatial Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, effectively constraining the action solution space. Experiments on the RoboChallenge benchmark demonstrate that DM0 achieves state-of-the-art performance in both Specialist and Generalist settings on Table30."

    "abstract": "Anomalous local photocurrent generation via second-order nonlinear and thermoelectric responses is a signature of many topological semimetals. The emergence of these photocurrents is inherently linked to symmetry breaking and anisotropy of their crystal lattices. Studies of type-II Weyl semimetals of group C$_{2v}$ (WTe$_2$, MoTe$_2$, TaIrTe$_4$) have reported anomalous, nonlocal photocurrents localized to crystals edges or far from electrodes, which are highly dependent on the geometry of the material sample. While originally attributed to a nonlinear charge current response, it was recently shown that these currents could instead be attributed to the anisotropic Seebeck coefficients of the materials. Here, we confirm that anomalous photocurrents observed in TaIrTe$_4$ under either visible or far-infrared far-field illumination originate from the large transverse thermoelectric effect. We engineer the mutual orientation of crystal edges and electrodes as well as the thermal environment of TaIrTe$_4$ to control and amplify its spatial photocurrent response. We show that substrate engineering can locally enhance photocurrent. This framework of thermal device engineering can enable broadband photo detection schemes by leveraging spectral and spatial dependence of photocurrents for applications like wavefront sensing, beam positioning, and edge detection."

The assembly has a single degree of freedom, where actuating any single unit results in a shape change of the entire assembly. We derive expressions for the effective curvature of the unit and the trajectory of the mechanism's tip as a function of the geometric variables which we then use as the basis to program two tasks in the mechanism: shape morphing and writing. By phrasing these tasks as optimization problems and utilizing the differentiable simulation framework, we arrive at solutions that are then tested in table-top experiments. Our results show that the geometry of scissor assemblies can be leveraged for automated navigation and inspection in complex domains, in light of the optimization framework. However, we highlight that the challenges associated with rapid programming and error-free implementation in experiments without feedback still remain."

    "abstract": "Maintaining spatial world consistency over long horizons remains a central challenge for camera-controllable video generation. Existing memory-based approaches often condition generation on globally reconstructed 3D scenes by rendering anchor videos from the reconstructed geometry in the history. However, reconstructing a global 3D scene from multiple views inevitably introduces cross-view misalignment, as pose and depth estimation errors cause the same surfaces to be reconstructed at slightly different 3D locations across views. When fused, these inconsistencies accumulate into noisy geometry that contaminates the conditioning signals and degrades generation quality. We introduce AnchorWeave, a memory-augmented video generation framework that replaces a single misaligned global memory with multiple clean local geometric memories and learns to reconcile their cross-view inconsistencies. To this end, AnchorWeave performs coverage-driven local memory retrieval aligned with the target trajectory and integrates the selected local memories through a multi-anchor weaving controller during generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnchorWeave significantly improves long-term scene consistency while maintaining strong visual quality, with ablation and analysis studies further validating the effectiveness of local geometric conditioning, multi-anchor control, and coverage-driven retrieval."

    "abstract": "Understanding how stick-slip dynamics manifests in diverse physical conditions is a crucial topic in tribology. Although it has been extensively studied in simple frictional configurations, the characterization of stick-slip behavior in complex assemblies is challenging. This work presents the first systematic investigation of stick-slip dynamics in a system with multiple contact surfaces undergoing friction amplification through conversion of traction forces into normal compression. Using interleaved paper blocks as a model system, we combine force measurements and image processing to characterize stick-slip events occurring when the two blocks are pulled apart at different detachment velocities. We find that both the peak force and the amplitude of the stick-slip events decrease along with the system's detachment. By combining a previously designed model for friction amplification and the stick-slip dynamics predicted by a simple frictional spring-block system, we link the observed behavior to the evolving normal compression within the assembly. Through force measurements and imaging, we extract the effective stiffness of the system from stick-slip events at low velocities and relate it to the system's normal compression. We then predict the observed decrease of the global stiffness as function of the detachment by considering the spatial distribution of normal forces within the assembly, which determines an effective number of sheets contributing to the system's mechanical response. Our findings reveal a non-trivial interplay between internal stress distribution and mechanical response mediated by frictional forces, with implications for granular materials, textiles, fibrous systems, and mechanical metamaterials."

    "abstract": "Large-scale deep learning models are well-suited for compression. Methods like pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation have been used to achieve massive reductions in the number of model parameters, with marginal performance drops across a variety of architectures and tasks. This raises the central question: \\emph{Why are deep neural networks suited for compression?} In this work, we take up the perspective of algorithmic complexity to explain this behavior. We hypothesize that the parameters of trained models have more structure and, hence, exhibit lower algorithmic complexity compared to the weights at (random) initialization. Furthermore, that model compression methods harness this reduced algorithmic complexity to compress models. Although an unconstrained parameterization of model weights, $\\mathbf{w} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, can represent arbitrary weight assignments, the solutions found during training exhibit repeatability and structure, making them algorithmically simpler than a generic program. To this end, we formalize the Kolmogorov complexity of $\\mathbf{w}$ by $\\mathcal{K}(\\mathbf{w})$. We introduce a constrained parameterization $\\widehat{\\mathbf{w}}$, that partitions parameters into blocks of size $s$, and restricts each block to be selected from a set of $k$ reusable motifs, specified by a reuse pattern (or mosaic). The resulting method, $\\textit{Mosaic-of-Motifs}$ (MoMos), yields algorithmically simpler model parameterization compared to unconstrained models. Empirical evidence from multiple experiments shows that the algorithmic complexity of neural networks, measured using approximations to Kolmogorov complexity, can be reduced during training. This results in models that perform comparably with unconstrained models while being algorithmically simpler."

We present the results of IXS under high hydrostatic pressure induced by diaond anvils and show how the EPC in EuAl4 is renormalized and suppressed in the material's temperature-pressure phase diagram. Our findings highlight the crucial role of momentum-dependent EPC in the formation of the CDW in EuAl4 and provide further insights into how external pressure can be used to tune charge ordering in quantum materials."

However, relying on sparse rewards makes this process highly sample-inefficient, as models must navigate vast search spaces with minimal feedback. While classic curriculum learning aims to mitigate this by ordering data based on complexity, the right ordering for a specific model is often unclear. To address this, we propose Goldilocks, a novel teacher-driven data sampling strategy that aims to predict each question's difficulty for the student model. The teacher model selects questions of appropriate difficulty for the student model, i.e., questions that are neither too easy nor too hard (Goldilocks principle), while training the student with GRPO. By leveraging the student's performance on seen samples, the teacher continuously adapts to the student's evolving abilities. On OpenMathReasoning dataset, Goldilocks data sampling improves the performance of models trained with standard GRPO under the same compute budget."

    "abstract": "Fluidic Shaping is a novel method for fabrication of optical components based on the equilibrium state of liquid volumes in neutral buoyancy, subjected to geometrical constraints. The underlying physics of this method is described by a highly nonlinear partial differential equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions and an integral constraint. To date, useful solutions for such optical liquid surfaces could be obtained analytically only for the linearized equations and only on circular or elliptical domains. A numerical solution for the non-linear equation was suggested, but only for the axi-symmetric case. Such solutions are, however, insufficient as they do not capture the full range of optical surfaces. Arbitrary domains offer an important degree of freedom for creating complex optical surfaces, and the nonlinear terms are essential for high quality solutions. Moreover, in the context of optics, it is not sufficient to resolve the shape of the surface, and it is essential to obtain accurate solutions for its curvature, which governs its optical properties. We here present the theoretical foundation for the Fluidic Shaping method over arbitrary domains, and the development of a high order (quintic) finite element numerical solver, capable of accurately resolving the topography and curvature of liquid interfaces on arbitrary domains. The code is based on reduced quintic finite elements, which we have modified to capture curved boundaries. We compare the results against low order finite elements and non-deformed high order elements, demonstrating the importance of high order approximations of both the solution and the domain. We also show the usability of the code for the prediction of optical surfaces derived from complex boundary conditions."

For many other such problems, however, no general optimality conditions are known. To address this, we generalize an approach of O. B. Ader to obtain a John-type decomposition as a necessary condition for affinely-optimal containment chains, i.e., chains $r L_1 + c \\subseteq K \\subseteq R L_2 + d$ for convex bodies $K, L_1, L_2 \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^n$, translation vectors $c,d \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, and reals $r,R > 0$ such that the ratio $\\frac{R}{r}$ cannot be decreased by linearly transforming $K$. We again obtain sufficiency for optimality when ellipsoids are involved, and show how optimality conditions for various problems follow from our result. Our main applications concern the Banach-Mazur distance, where we provide necessary optimality conditions in the general case and a full characterization in the Euclidean case. Finally, we derive several consequences of these optimality conditions related to the Banach-Mazur distance to the Euclidean ball."

    "abstract": "It has long been suspected that black hole accretion-outflow coupling is invariant from the stellar to supermassive scales. Stellar mass black hole accretion flows are known to launch jets and outflows as they transition through critical accretion rate thresholds, with values well constrained observationally owing to their short evolutionary timescales. In contrast, accretion flows in typical supermassive black hole (SMBH) systems (those in active galactic nuclei) evolve over thousands of years, making the critical transitions at which jets are launched impossible to constrain in individual systems. Tidal disruption events (TDEs) provide the unique opportunity to witness the birth and evolution of an accretion flow onto a SMBH which evolves on timescales of years. Here we show that TDEs launch outflows during a super-Eddington accretion phase and a second, physically distinct outflow, at a critical accretion rate of $L_{\\rm crit} \\approx0.02$ $L_{\\rm Edd}$, the same as the critical accretion rate for state transitions observed in accreting stellar mass black holes. This work naturally explains the mechanism, observed properties, and detection rate for prompt and delayed outflows observed in TDEs, which until now have been open problems. More broadly, we demonstrate that SMBHs exhibit the same accretion-outflow coupling as stellar mass black holes and that the critical low accretion rate threshold for jet formation in black holes is scale invariant."

We address this gap by converting permutation composition into code via REPL traces that interleave state-reveals through prints and variable transformations. We show that linear RNNs capable of state-tracking excel also in this setting, while Transformers still fail. Motivated by this representation, we investigate why tracking states in code is generally difficult: actions are not always fully observable. We frame this as tracking the state of a probabilistic finite-state automaton with deterministic state reveals and show that linear RNNs can be worse than non-linear RNNs at tracking states in this setup."

Recent years have witnessed growing interest in reasoning tasks within Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, no prior research has examined the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on non-question-answering (non-QA) physical commonsense reasoning tasks in low-resource languages such as Basque. Taking the Italian GITA as a starting point, this paper addresses this gap by presenting BasPhyCo, the first non-QA physical commonsense reasoning dataset for Basque, available in both standard and dialectal variants. We evaluate model performance across three hierarchical levels of commonsense understanding: (1) distinguishing between plausible and implausible narratives (accuracy), (2) identifying the conflicting element that renders a narrative implausible (consistency), and (3) determining the specific physical state that creates the implausibility (verifiability). These tasks were assessed using multiple multilingual LLMs as well as models pretrained specifically for Italian and Basque. Results indicate that, in terms of verifiability, LLMs exhibit limited physical commonsense capabilities in low-resource languages such as Basque, especially when processing dialectal variants."

We perform radiative transfer analysis, highlighting a chemical difference between the two sources: IRAS 16293-2422 shows column densities 10-100 times lower than L1544. We perform astrochemical modeling, employing an up-to-date chemical network with revised reaction rates. The models reproduce the general trends, with cyanopolyyne and polyynyl radical abundances decreasing as molecular size increases, but they underestimate the abundances of cyanopolyynes longer than $\\mathrm{HC_5N}$ by up to two orders of magnitude. Current models, which include the dominant neutral-neutral formation routes, cannot account for this discrepancy, suggesting that the chemical network is incomplete. We propose that additional ion-molecule reactions are crucial for the formation of these species.

    "abstract": "The dynamical stability of the iterates during training plays a key role in determining the minima obtained by optimization algorithms. For example, stable solutions of gradient descent (GD) correspond to flat minima, which have been associated with favorable features. While prior work often relies on linearization to determine stability, it remains unclear whether linearized dynamics faithfully capture the full nonlinear behavior. Recent work has shown that GD may stably oscillate near a linearly unstable minimum and still converge once the step size decays, indicating that linear analysis can be misleading. In this work, we explicitly study the effect of nonlinear terms. Specifically, we derive an exact criterion for stable oscillations of GD near minima in the multivariate setting. Our condition depends on high-order derivatives, generalizing existing results. Extending the analysis to stochastic gradient descent (SGD), we show that nonlinear dynamics can diverge in expectation even if a single batch is unstable. This implies that stability can be dictated by a single batch that oscillates unstably, rather than an average effect, as linear analysis suggests. Finally, we prove that if all batches are linearly stable, the nonlinear dynamics of SGD are stable in expectation."

The emergence of a spin deviation from the local quantization axis of one residing QD is the prerequisite to implement the qubit gates. In this work, we study the non-adiabatic dynamics of a spin qubit shuttling between coupled QDs with inhomogeneous Landé g-tensors and a small magnetic field. The spin dynamics is analyzed through solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation of the qubit under the effects of spin-orbit interaction and rapid ramping inter-dot detuning. The precondition, imposed on the ramping time and the tunnel-coupling strength, to ensure a high-fidelity inter-dot transfer is estimated. We then calculate the change in the spin orientation of a transferred qubit, and study the dependences of the spin deviation on the difference in the quantization axes of the two QDs, the tunnel-coupling strength, and the ramping time. We also demonstrate that the effect of multiple rounds of inter-dot bidirectional shuttling can be captured by an operator matrix, and evaluate the idling times required for realizing the single-qubit Pauli-X and Pauli-Y gates. Intriguingly, it is confirmed that a generalized Hadamard gate can be achieved through tuning the idling times."

To address these challenges, we introduce a systematic experimental framework evaluating 79 open-source deep learning models, encompassing both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers, across over 2,300 controlled experiments on our newly curated Quad-State Tornado Damage (QSTD) benchmark dataset. Our findings reveal that achieving operational-grade performance hinges on a complex interaction between architecture and optimization, rather than architectural selection alone. Most strikingly, we demonstrate that optimizer choice can be more consequential than architecture: switching from Adam to SGD provided dramatic F1 gains of +25 to +38 points for Vision Transformer and Swin Transformer families, fundamentally reversing their ranking from bottom-tier to competitive with top-performing CNNs. Furthermore, a low learning rate of 1x10^(-4) proved universally critical, boosting average F1 performance by +10.2 points across all architectures. Our champion model, ConvNeXt-Base trained with these optimized settings, demonstrated strong cross-event generalization on the held-out Tuscaloosa-Moore Tornado Damage (TMTD) dataset, achieving 46.4% Macro F1 (+34.6 points over baseline) and retaining 85.5% Ordinal Top-1 Accuracy despite temporal and sensor domain shifts."

    "abstract": "Posterior inference from pulsar observations in the form of light curves is commonly performed using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, which are accurate but computationally expensive. We introduce a framework that accelerates posterior inference while maintaining accuracy by combining learned latent representations with local simulator-guided optimization. A masked U-Net is first pretrained to reconstruct complete light curves from partial observations and to produce informative latent embeddings. Given a query light curve, we identify similar simulated light curves from the simulation bank by measuring similarity in the learned embedding space produced by pretrained U-Net encoder, yielding an initial empirical approximation to the posterior over parameters. This initialization is then refined using a local optimization procedure using hill-climbing updates, guided by a forward simulator, progressively shifting the empirical posterior toward higher-likelihood parameter regions. Experiments on the observed light curve of PSR J0030+0451, captured by NASA's Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER), show that our method closely matches posterior estimates obtained using traditional MCMC methods while achieving 120 times reduction in inference time (from 24 hours to 12 minutes), demonstrating the effectiveness of learned representations and simulator-guided optimization for accelerated posterior inference."

Therefore, we introduce MedVAR, the first autoregressive-based foundation model that adopts the next-scale prediction paradigm to enable fast and scale-up-friendly medical image synthesis. MedVAR generates images in a coarse-to-fine manner and produces structured multi-scale representations suitable for downstream use. To support hierarchical generation, we curate a harmonized dataset of around 440,000 CT and MRI images spanning six anatomical regions. Comprehensive experiments across fidelity, diversity, and scalability show that MedVAR achieves state-of-the-art generative performance and offers a promising architectural direction for future medical generative foundation models."

In particular, we consider AFC schemes employing the BJK and Monolithic Convex (MC) limiters and algebraically stabilized methods including MUAS, SMUAS, and the BBK approach. The performance of the estimators and limiters are studied on adaptively refined meshes for several two-dimensional test problems, including boundary layers, interior layers, and a nonlinear convection problem with solution-dependent transport. The experiments assess accuracy, preservation of the discrete maximum principle, adaptive mesh behaviour, and computational efficiency. The results show that the interaction between stabilization and a posteriori error estimation depends strongly on mesh alignment and on the character of the convection field. In particular, for problems with moving or curved layers, the behaviour of the limiters differs significantly: strongly upwind-biased limiters provide the most accurate solutions, while smoother algebraic stabilizations lead to more efficient nonlinear iterations. The study also indicates that residual-based estimators remain reliable for both linear and nonlinear problems but may react to changes in limiter activation during adaptive refinement. Overall, the numerical results clarify the practical behaviour of several widely used stabilization techniques within an adaptive framework and highlight aspects that are not yet fully explained by the current theory, particularly for nonlinear transport problems."

In real-world applications, causal information is often partial but nontrivial. This paper proposes a general framework for bounding probabilities of causation using partial causal information. We show how the available structural or statistical information can be systematically incorporated as constraints in a optimization programming formulation, yielding tighter and formally valid bounds without full identifiability. This approach extends the applicability of probabilities of causation to realistic settings where causal knowledge is incomplete but informative."

    "abstract": "Semantic communication is a novel communication paradigm that focuses on conveying the user's intended meaning rather than the bit-wise transmission of source signals. One of the key challenges is to effectively represent and extract the semantic meaning of any given source signals. While deep learning (DL)-based solutions have shown promising results in extracting implicit semantic information from a wide range of sources, existing work often overlooks the high computational complexity inherent in both model training and inference for the DL-based encoder and decoder. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a rate-distortion-complexity (RDC) framework which extends the classical rate-distortion theory by incorporating the constraints on semantic distance, including both the traditional bit-wise distortion metric and statistical difference-based divergence metric, and complexity measure, adopted from the theory of minimum description length and information bottleneck. We derive the closed-form theoretical results of the minimum achievable rate under given constraints on semantic distance and complexity for both Gaussian and binary semantic sources. Our theoretical results show a fundamental three-way tradeoff among achievable rate, semantic distance, and model complexity. Extensive experiments on real-world image and video datasets validate this tradeoff and further demonstrate that our information-theoretic complexity measure effectively correlates with practical computational costs, guiding efficient system design in resource-constrained scenarios."

    "abstract": "We study two log-concave sampling problems: constrained sampling and composite sampling. First, we consider sampling from a target distribution with density proportional to $\\exp(-f(x))$ supported on a convex set $K \\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$, where $f$ is convex. The main challenge is enforcing feasibility without degrading mixing. Using an epigraph transformation, we reduce this task to sampling from a nearly uniform distribution over a lifted convex set in $\\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$. We then solve the lifted problem using a proximal sampler. Assuming only a separation oracle for $K$ and a subgradient oracle for $f$, we develop an implementation of the proximal sampler based on the cutting-plane method and rejection sampling. Unlike existing constrained samplers that rely on projection, reflection, barrier functions, or mirror maps, our approach enforces feasibility using only minimal oracle access, resulting in a practical and unbiased sampler without knowing the geometry of the constraint set. Second, we study composite sampling, where the target is proportional to $\\exp(-f(x)-h(x))$ with closed and convex $f$ and $h$. This composite structure is standard in Bayesian inference with $f$ modeling data fidelity and $h$ encoding prior information. We reduce composite sampling via an epigraph lifting of $h$ to constrained sampling in $\\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$, which allows direct application of the constrained sampling algorithm developed in the first part. This reduction results in a double epigraph lifting formulation in $\\mathbb{R}^{d+2}$, on which we apply a proximal sampler. By keeping $f$ and $h$ separate, we further demonstrate how different combinations of oracle access (such as subgradient and proximal) can be leveraged to construct separation oracles for the lifted problem. For both sampling problems, we establish mixing time bounds measured in Rényi and $χ^2$ divergences."

The training robot-dog modality, Unitree Go2, was first trained to climb stairs on Isaac Lab's pyramid-stair terrain, and then to climb a U-shaped indoor staircase using the learned policies. This project explores end-to-end RL methods that enable robot dogs to autonomously climb stairs. The results showed (1) the successful goal reached for robot dogs climbing U-shaped stairs with a stall penalty, and (2) the transferability from the policy trained on U-shaped stairs to deployment on straight, L-shaped, and spiral stair terrains, and transferability from other stair models to deployment on U-shaped terrain."

The results show that although the kinetic quantities and the location of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) depend on the regularization parameter $g$, the radiative efficiency of the rotating SV black hole is the same as its Kerr counterpart. Within the Novikov-Thorne thin-disk model, the radiative flux, effective temperature, and spectral luminosity are studied, and by adopting observational parameters relevant to SgrA* and M87*, concrete examples of the rotating SV black holes are calculated and compared with that of the Kerr black holes. The results show that the parameter $g$ suppresses the maximum values of these quantities. In addition, using a backward ray-tracing technique, we numerically simulate the optical appearance of rotating SV black holes and analyze the corresponding intensity images, redshift and observed flux distributions. Our results show that these quantities are affected by $g$. In particular, as $g$ increases, the observed intensity is significantly suppressed and the photon ring region has remarkable increase in its width. Our findings suggest that accretion-disk-related observables may provide important avenues to distinguish rotating SV black holes and Kerr black holes, and offer theoretical guidance for future high-resolution observations."

Despite notable advances in recent decades, the lack of high-quality data and the reliance of traditional causal discovery algorithms (TCDA) on the assumption of no latent confounders, as well as their tendency to overlook the precise semantics of latent variables, have long been major obstacles to the broader application of causal discovery. To address this issue, we propose a novel causal modeling framework, TLVD, which integrates the metadata-based reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with the data-driven modeling capabilities of TCDA for inferring latent variables and their semantics. Specifically, we first employ a data-driven approach to construct a causal graph that incorporates latent variables. Then, we employ multi-LLM collaboration for latent variable inference, modeling this process as a game with incomplete information and seeking its Bayesian Nash Equilibrium (BNE) to infer the possible specific latent variables. Finally, to validate the inferred latent variables across multiple real-world web-based data sources, we leverage LLMs for evidence exploration to ensure traceability. We comprehensively evaluate TLVD on three de-identified real patient datasets provided by a hospital and two benchmark datasets. Extensive experimental results confirm the effectiveness and reliability of TLVD, with average improvements of 32.67% in Acc, 62.21% in CAcc, and 26.72% in ECit across the five datasets."

The emergence of a minimum length scale, dictated by the degree of noncommutativity, induces a behavioral transition in the HSC and establishes a lower bound. In the large noncommutativity regime, the qualitative features of the complexity deviate significantly from the commutative case. The HFS is shown to provide an effective measure of the degree of noncommutativity. Although the HSC generally satisfies strong subadditivity, this property fails abruptly when the subregion size approaches the minimum length scale. At finite temperature, the long-range behavior of the HSC is modified, and its lower bound scales positively with temperature. Furthermore, temperature enhances the sensitivity of the fidelity susceptibility to the degree of noncommutativity. Within the AdS soliton background, a competition between connected and disconnected configurations arises in the HSC, signaling a phase-transition-like behavior. Finally, the compactification scale is found to diminish the sensitivity of the HFS to the degree of noncommutativity."

A central coordinator can regulate aggregate pushback capacity but cannot directly control which specific aircraft are released, limiting its ability to steer system-level performance. We propose a noncooperative coordination mechanism for collaborative virtual queueing based on the correlated equilibrium concept, which enables the coordinator to provide incentive-compatible recommendations on aircraft-level pushback decisions without overriding airline autonomy. To account for uncertainty in airlines' internal cost assessments, we introduce chance constraints into the correlated equilibrium formulation. This formulation provides explicit probabilistic guarantees on incentive compatibility, allowing the coordinator to adjust the confidence level with which airlines are expected to follow the recommended actions. We further propose a scalable algorithm for computing chance-constrained correlated equilibria by exploiting a reduced-rank structure. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method scales to realistic traffic levels up to 210 eligible pushbacks per hour, reduces accumulated delay by up to approximately 8.9% compared to current first-come-first-served schemes, and reveals a trade-off between confidence level, deviation robustness, and achievable cost efficiency."

Here, we extend the TLS framework to a multi-level system and show that phonon echoes persist when nonlinear energy structures and disorder are included. By incorporating virtual phonon exchange, we introduce many-body interactions between these multi-level systems, leading to nonlinear eigen-energies that enhance the echo signal. Meanwhile, finite-temperature thermal fluctuations cause dephasing, resulting in a decay of echo amplitude over time. The analytical and numerical results are consistent across semi-classical and quantum regimes. Our work validates the multi-level-system model and underscores the role of many-body interactions in low-temperature glassy dynamics."

Machine learning-based classifiers trained on tabular data have been recently used to make faster decisions on these prospects. The lack of transparency in the decision-making processes of such models has led to the emergence of explainable AI (XAI). LIME and SHAP are two such examples of these XAI methods which try to generate explanations of a particular decision by ranking the input features in terms of importance. However, explanations of the same scenario generated by these two different explanation strategies have shown to disagree or be different, particularly for complex data. This is because the definitions of \"importance\" and \"relevance\" differ for different explanation strategies. Thus, grounding these ranked features using theoretically backed causal ideas of necessity and sufficiency can prove to be a more reliable and robust way to improve the trustworthiness of the concerned explanation strategies.We propose a unified framework to generate counterfactuals as well as quantify necessity and sufficiency and use these to perform a robustness evaluation of the explanations provided by LIME and SHAP on high dimensional structured prospect risking data.

    "abstract": "Multimodal methods are widely used in rice deterioration detection, which exhibit limited capability in representing and extracting fine-grained abnormal features. Moreover, these methods rely on devices, such as hyperspectral cameras and mass spectrometers, increasing detection costs and prolonging data acquisition time. To address these issues, we propose a feature recalibration based olfactory-visual multimodal model for fine-grained rice deterioration detection. The fine-grained deterioration embedding constructor (FDEC) is proposed to reconstruct the labeled multimodal embedded-feature dataset, enhancing sample representation. The fine-grained deterioration recalibration attention network (FDRA-Net) is proposed to emphasize signal variations and increase sensitivity to fine-grained deterioration on the rice surface. Experiments show that the proposed method achieves a classification accuracy of 99.89%. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, the detection accuracy is improved and the procedure is simplified. Furthermore, field detection demonstrates the advantages of accuracy and operational simplicity. The proposed method can also be extended to other agrifood in agriculture and food industry."

    "abstract": "We describe an adaptation of VACE (Video All-in-one Creation and Editing) for real-time autoregressive video generation. VACE provides unified video control (reference guidance, structural conditioning, inpainting, and temporal extension) but assumes bidirectional attention over full sequences, making it incompatible with streaming pipelines that require fixed chunk sizes and causal attention. The key modification moves reference frames from the diffusion latent space into a parallel conditioning pathway, preserving the fixed chunk sizes and KV caching that autoregressive models require. This adaptation reuses existing pretrained VACE weights without additional training. Across 1.3B and 14B model scales, VACE adds 20-30% latency overhead for structural control and inpainting, with negligible VRAM cost relative to the base model. Reference-to-video fidelity is severely degraded compared to batch VACE due to causal attention constraints. A reference implementation is available at https://github.com/daydreamlive/scope."

Instead, only a few patterns are available at a time step, and the subsequent patterns become available at the following time steps. The conventional online fuzzy classifier considered only two-class problems. This paper investigates the extension to the conventional fuzzy classifiers for multi-class problems. We evaluate the performance of the multi-class online fuzzy classifiers through numerical experiments on synthetic dynamic data and also several benchmark datasets."

However, existing idea evaluation methods often suffer from narrow knowledge horizons, flattened evaluation dimensions, and the inherent bias in LLM-as-a-Judge. To address these, we regard idea evaluation as a knowledge-grounded, multi-perspective reasoning problem and introduce InnoEval, a deep innovation evaluation framework designed to emulate human-level idea assessment. We apply a heterogeneous deep knowledge search engine that retrieves and grounds dynamic evidence from diverse online sources. We further achieve review consensus with an innovation review board containing reviewers with distinct academic backgrounds, enabling a multi-dimensional decoupled evaluation across multiple metrics. We construct comprehensive datasets derived from authoritative peer-reviewed submissions to benchmark InnoEval. Experiments demonstrate that InnoEval can consistently outperform baselines in point-wise, pair-wise, and group-wise evaluation tasks, exhibiting judgment patterns and consensus highly aligned with human experts."

    "abstract": "Edge-cloud convergence is reshaping service provisioning across 5G/6G and computing power networks (CPNs). Service function chaining (SFC) requires continuously placing and scheduling virtual network functions (VNFs) chains under compute/bandwidth and end-to-end QoS constraints. Most SFC optimizers assume static or stationary networks, and degrade under long-term topology/resource changes (failures, upgrades, expansions) that induce non-stationary graph drifts. We propose LiSFC, a Lipschitz lifelong planner that transfers MCTS statistics across drifting network configurations using an MDP-distance bound. More precisely, we formulate the problem as a sequence of MDPs indexed by the underlying network graph and constraints, and we define a \\emph{graph drift} metric that upper-bounds the LiZero MDP distance. This allows LiSFC to import theoretical guarantees on bias and sample efficiency from the LiZero framework while being tailored to cloud-network convergence. We then design \\emph{LiSFC-Search}, an SFC-aware unified MCTS (UMCTS) procedure that uses transferable adaptive UCT (aUCT) bonuses to reuse search statistics from prior CPN configurations. Preliminary results on synthetic CPN topologies and SFC workloads show that LiSFC consistently reduces SFC blocking probability and improves tail delay compared to non-transfer MCTS and purely learning-based baselines, highlighting its potential as an AI/ML building block for cloud-network convergence."

This paper examines the challenges and trade-offs in LLM development through a 12-week ethnographic study of a team building a pedagogical chatbot. The researcher observed design and evaluation activities and conducted interviews with both developers and domain experts. Analysis revealed four key practices: creating workarounds for data collection, turning to augmentation when expert input was limited, co-developing evaluation criteria with experts, and adopting hybrid expert-developer-LLM evaluation strategies. These practices show how teams made strategic decisions under constraints and demonstrate the central role of domain expertise in shaping the system. Challenges included expert motivation and trust, difficulties structuring participatory design, and questions around ownership and integration of expert knowledge. We propose design opportunities for future LLM development workflows that emphasize AI literacy, transparent consent, and frameworks recognizing evolving expert roles."

    "abstract": "This paper examines the effects of the 2019 universalization of Mexico's Social Pension Program (PAM), one of the country's most expansive and politically salient social programs. The reform simultaneously increased the cash transfer and extended eligibility to all individuals aged 65 and over, regardless of income or contributory pension status. Using nationally representative data from the ENIGH and a triple-differences (DDD) identification strategy, we estimate the causal effect of the universalization on poverty and labor market outcomes. Our empirical approach exploits variation across time (pre- and post-reform), age (eligible vs. ineligible), and pension scheme status (non-contributory vs. contributory), allowing us to separate the effects of expanded eligibility from those of increased benefit levels. We find strong increases in take-up rates and no significant change in overall poverty rates, suggesting that many new beneficiaries were not economically vulnerable. However, we document a surprising increase in extreme poverty, concentrated among low-income elderly who responded to the reform by exiting the labor force. This reduction in labor supply, driven by a significant drop in employment among individuals in the bottom income quartile, suggests that the pension acted as a substitute for labor income rather than a supplement. Taken together, the results highlight the trade-offs inherent in universal pension programs: while broader access reduces administrative exclusion, extending transfers to economically secure individuals may dilute redistributive impacts and generate behavioral responses that offset potential welfare gains."

We explore uncertainties in the Fermi/LAT PSF by comparing the PSF models provided by the Fermi/LAT Instrument Response Functions (IRFs) with signals of bright pulsars. We compare the analytical PSF models of Fermi/LAT IRFs with pulsar data and fit the pulsar data with the same analytical model as in the Fermi/LAT IRFs to derive an improved set of PSF parameters. We then apply this revised PSF parameterisation to the search of extended emission around a blazar, Mrk 501. We find that the parameters of the analytical PSF models of Fermi/LAT IRFs are inconsistent with the pulsar data. We obtain an improved set of PSF parameters from the fits to pulsar data that is consistent with observations. We find no evidence of the previously reported extended signal around Mrk 501 if the revised PSF consistent with pulsar data is used in data analysis."

Guided by this framework, we present TAIL, a transformer-based algorithm-implicit meta-learner that functions across tasks with varying domains, modalities, and label configurations. TAIL features three innovations over prior transformer-based meta-learners: random projections for cross-modal feature encoding, random injection label embeddings that extrapolate to larger label spaces, and efficient inline query processing. TAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard few-shot benchmarks while generalizing to unseen domains. Unlike other meta-learning methods, it also generalizes to unseen modalities, solving text classification tasks despite training exclusively on images, handles tasks with up to 20$\\times$ more classes than seen during training, and provides orders-of-magnitude computational savings over prior transformer-based approaches."

We are interested in dynamic enumeration of $L$-infixes, where we must additionally support letter substitution updates on $w$ (e.g., \"replace the $i$-th letter of $w$ by a letter $a$\"). Each update changes the set of infixes to enumerate, and resets the enumeration state. We study for which regular languages $L$ we can perform dynamic enumeration of $L$-infixes in constant delay (i.e., the next infix is always produced in constant time) and constant additional memory throughout the enumeration, while supporting each update in constant time. We show that, for languages $L$ with a neutral letter, if the language $L$ belongs to the class ZG and is extensible (i.e., if $u \\in L$ and $u$ is a factor of $v$ then $v \\in L$), then dynamic enumeration of $L$-infixes can be achieved with a simple algorithm that ensures constant-time updates and constant delay, but not constant additional memory. Our main contribution is then to show an algorithm that additionally uses only constant additional memory, and applies to a more general class of semi-extensible ZG languages for which we give several equivalent characterizations. We further discuss whether our results can be generalized to larger language classes and show some (conditional) lower bounds."

Building on this idea, we introduce a hierarchical decoder in which each level can be solved in polynomial time. Additionally, this decoder achieves optimal decoding performance at the lower levels of the hierarchy. This strategy avoids the need for full maximum-likelihood decoding of graph codes.

While there is extensive research on the role of image information for perceptual tasks, the role of the temporal dimension remains less well understood: What can we learn about the world from long-term motion information? What properties does long-term motion information have for visual learning? We leverage recent success in point-track estimation, which offers an excellent opportunity to learn temporal representations and experiment on a variety of perceptual tasks. We draw 3 clear lessons: 1) Long-term motion representations contain information to understand actions, but also objects, materials, and spatial information, often even better than images. 2) Long-term motion representations generalize far better than image representations in low-data settings and in zero-shot tasks. 3) The very low dimensionality of motion information makes motion representations a better trade-off between GFLOPs and accuracy than standard video representations, and used together they achieve higher performance than video representations alone. We hope these insights will pave the way for the design of future models that leverage the power of long-term motion information for perception."

For the spatially inhomogeneous equation we establish a local well-posedness in $W^{1,\\infty}$ and in $C_b^{1,α}$, highlighting the additional difficulties caused by the absence of a convolution structure. Moreover, for sufficiently small interaction strength we present a global well-posedness and a forward-in-time $L^1$ asymptotic completeness property. Finally, we investigate mono-kinetic solutions and exhibit finite-time blow-up scenarios."

    "abstract": "Deep generative models have achieved great success in producing high-quality samples, making them a central tool across machine learning applications. Beyond sample quality, an important yet less systematically studied question is whether trained generative models faithfully capture the diversity of the underlying data distribution. In this work, we address this question by directly comparing the diversity of samples generated by state-of-the-art models with that of test samples drawn from the target data distribution, using recently proposed reference-free entropy-based diversity scores, Vendi and RKE. Across multiple benchmark datasets, we find that test data consistently attains substantially higher Vendi and RKE diversity scores than the generated samples, suggesting a systematic downward diversity bias in modern generative models. To understand the origin of this bias, we analyze the finite-sample behavior of entropy-based diversity scores and show that their expected values increase with sample size, implying that diversity estimated from finite training sets could inherently underestimate the diversity of the true distribution. As a result, optimizing the generators to minimize divergence to empirical data distributions would induce a loss of diversity. Finally, we discuss potential diversity-aware regularization and guidance strategies based on Vendi and RKE as principled directions for mitigating this bias, and provide empirical evidence suggesting their potential to improve the results."

Among them, ``self-evolving'' MAS, treated as a more flexible and powerful technical route, can construct task-adaptive workflows or communication topologies, instead of relying on a predefined static structue template. Current self-evolving MAS mainly focus on Spatial Evolving or Temporal Evolving paradigm, which only considers the single dimension of evolution and does not fully incentivize LLMs' collaborative capability. In this work, we start from a novel Spatio-Temporal perspective by proposing ST-EVO, which supports dialogue-wise communication scheduling with a compact yet powerful flow-matching based Scheduler. To make precise Spatio-Temporal scheduling, ST-EVO can also perceive the uncertainty of MAS, and possesses self-feedback ability to learn from accumulated experience. Extensive experiments on nine benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of ST-EVO, achieving about 5%--25% accuracy improvement."

We investigate a cryptographic scheme based on discrete-time quantum walks (DTQWs) on cyclic graphs that exploits Parrondo dynamics, wherein periodic evolution emerges from a deterministic sequence of individually chaotic coin operators. We construct an explicit quantum circuit realization tailored to NISQ architectures and analyze its performance through numerical simulations in Qiskit under both ideal and noisy conditions. Protocol performance is quantified using probability distributions, Hellinger fidelity, and total variation distance. To assess security at the circuit level, we model intercept-resend and man-in-the-middle attacks and evaluate the resulting quantum bit error rate. In the absence of adversarial intervention, the protocol enables reliable message recovery, whereas eavesdropping induces characteristic disturbances that disrupt the periodic reconstruction mechanism. We further examine hardware feasibility on contemporary NISQ processors, specifically $ibm\\_torino$, incorporating qubit connectivity and state-transfer constraints into the circuit design. Our analysis demonstrates that communication between spatially separated logical modules increases circuit depth via SWAP operations, leading to cumulative noise effects. By exploring hybrid state-transfer strategies, we show that qubit selection and connectivity play a decisive role in determining fidelity and overall protocol performance, highlighting hardware-dependent trade-offs in NISQ implementations."

    "abstract": "Gradual argumentation is a field of symbolic AI which is attracting attention for its ability to support transparent and contestable AI systems. It is considered a useful tool in domains such as decision-making, recommendation, debate analysis, and others. The outcomes in such domains are usually dependent on the arguments' base scores, which must be selected carefully. Often, this selection process requires user expertise and may not always be straightforward. On the other hand, organising the arguments by preference could simplify the task. In this work, we introduce \\emph{Base Score Extraction Functions}, which provide a mapping from users' preferences over arguments to base scores. These functions can be applied to the arguments of a \\emph{Bipolar Argumentation Framework} (BAF), supplemented with preferences, to obtain a \\emph{Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework} (QBAF), allowing the use of well-established computational tools in gradual argumentation. We outline the desirable properties of base score extraction functions, discuss some design choices, and provide an algorithm for base score extraction. Our method incorporates an approximation of non-linearities in human preferences to allow for better approximation of the real ones. Finally, we evaluate our approach both theoretically and experimentally in a robotics setting, and offer recommendations for selecting appropriate gradual semantics in practice."

    "abstract": "We present pseudo-differential enhanced physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), an extension of gradient enhancement but in Fourier space. Gradient enhancement of PINNs dictates that the PDE residual is taken to a higher differential order than prescribed by the PDE, added to the objective as an augmented term in order to improve training and overall learning fidelity. We propose the same procedure after application via Fourier transforms, since differentiating in Fourier space is multiplication with the Fourier wavenumber under suitable decay. Our methods are fast and efficient. Our methods oftentimes achieve superior PINN versus numerical error in fewer training iterations, potentially pair well with few samples in collocation, and can on occasion break plateaus in low collocation settings. Moreover, our methods are suitable for fractional derivatives. We establish that our methods improve spectral eigenvalue decay of the neural tangent kernel (NTK), and so our methods contribute towards the learning of high frequencies in early training, mitigating the effects of frequency bias up to the polynomial order and possibly greater with smooth activations. Our methods accommodate advanced techniques in PINNs, such as Fourier feature embeddings. A pitfall of discrete Fourier transforms via the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is mesh subjugation, and so we demonstrate compatibility of our methods for greater mesh flexibility and invariance on alternative Euclidean and non-Euclidean domains via Monte Carlo methods and otherwise."

This setting extends the classical OT framework, where all mass is conventionally assumed to depart at $t = 0$ and arrive at $t = t_f$. Our generalization accommodates departures and arrivals at specified times, referred as departure--arrival(DA) constraints. In particular, we impose nodal-temporal flux constraints at source and sink nodes, characterizing two distinct scenarios: (i) Independent DA constraints, where departure and arrival rates are prescribed independently, and (ii) Coupled DA constraints, where each particle's transportation time span is explicitly specified. We establish that OT with independent DA constraints admits a multi-marginal optimal transport formulation, while the coupled DA case aligns with the unequal-dimensional OT framework. For line graphs, we analyze the existence and uniqueness of the solution path. For general graphs, we use a constructive path-based reduction and optimize over a prescribed set of paths. From a computational perspective, we consider entropic regularization of the original problem to efficiently provide solutions based on multi-marginal Sinkhorn method, making use of the graphical structure of the cost to further improve scalability. Our numerical simulation further illustrates the linear convergence rate in terms of marginal violation."

In this paper, we extend RI for constrained equations to existentially quantified equations in logically constrained rewriting. To this end, we first extend constrained equations by introducing existential quantification to the equation part of constrained equations. Then, in applying a constrained rewrite rule to such extended constrained equations, we introduce existential quantification to extra variables of the applied rule.

AlAd preserves local contextual semantics, enables flexible alignment across differing dimensionalities or architectures, and is entirely agnostic to the underlying compression method. AlAd can be deployed in two ways: as a plug-and-play module over a frozen compressed model, or by jointly fine-tuning AlAd with the compressed model for further performance gains. Through experiments on BERT-family models across three token-level NLP tasks, we demonstrate that AlAd significantly boosts the performance of compressed models with only marginal overhead in size and latency."

We establish uniform moment bounds of all orders and prove Hölder regularity: spatial Hölder exponent $γ< 1/2$ and temporal Hölder exponent $α< H-1/2$, which are shown to be sharp by a lower bound for the linearized equation. The proof relies on sharp estimates of the heat kernel in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space $\\cH$ of the Rosenblatt process, on Meyer's inequalities for moment bounds, and on a careful analysis of the Skorohod integral with respect to the Rosenblatt process.

In this work, we propose a novel constrained sampling algorithm, which combines strengths of higher-order information, like the target's log-density's gradients and curvature, with the Hit-&-Run proposal, a simple mechanism which guarantees the generation of feasible proposals, fulfilling the linear constraints.

    "abstract": "The study of spin decoherence is often performed by assuming that spin-phonon interactions lead to relaxation at high temperatures, and spin-spin dipolar interactions instead contribute to pure dephasing at low temperatures. This has resulted in the neglect of spin relaxation due to spin-spin dipolar interactions and its influence on decoherence at low temperatures. For a complete understanding of low temperature spin dynamics, it is then imperative to focus also on the latter mechanism. One such method which has shown great promise in the efficient calculation of central spin dynamics due to spin-spin dipolar interactions with a surrounding spin bath is the Cluster-Correlation Expansion (CCE). An extension of this method through the explicit inclusion of the central spin degrees of freedom, known as the generalized Cluster-Correlation Expansion (gCCE) is capable of simulating the transfer of energy from the central spin into the bath, and thus could have the potential to investigate spin relaxation in this setting. In this work, we show that gCCE, in its standard form, is insufficient for providing even a qualitatively accurate description of spin-spin relaxation. A full mathematical deconstruction of the underlying theory of gCCE clearly points to the origin of such a breakdown and provides a starting point for its potential future resolution."

Given a large population, one optimally selects a small low-discrepancy subset with respect to a discrepancy-based objective. Versions of this problem are known to be NP-hard. In this text, we establish, for the first time, that the subset selection problem with respect to kernel discrepancies is also NP-hard. Motivated by this intractability, we propose a Bayesian Optimization procedure for the subset selection problem utilizing the recent notion of deep embedding kernels.

    "abstract": "Autonomous agentic systems are increasingly deployed in regulated, high-stakes domains where decisions may be irreversible and institutionally constrained. Existing safety approaches emphasize alignment, interpretability, or action-level filtering. We argue that these mechanisms are necessary but insufficient because they do not directly govern selection power: the authority to determine which options are generated, surfaced, and framed for decision. We propose a governance architecture that separates cognition, selection, and action into distinct domains and models autonomy as a vector of sovereignty. Cognitive autonomy remains unconstrained, while selection and action autonomy are bounded through mechanically enforced primitives operating outside the agent's optimization space. The architecture integrates external candidate generation (CEFL), a governed reducer, commit-reveal entropy isolation, rationale validation, and fail-loud circuit breakers. We evaluate the system across multiple regulated financial scenarios under adversarial stress targeting variance manipulation, threshold gaming, framing skew, ordering effects, and entropy probing. Metrics quantify selection concentration, narrative diversity, governance activation cost, and failure visibility. Results show that mechanical selection governance is implementable, auditable, and prevents deterministic outcome capture while preserving reasoning capacity. Although probabilistic concentration remains, the architecture measurably bounds selection authority relative to conventional scalar pipelines. This work reframes governance as bounded causal power rather than internal intent alignment, offering a foundation for deploying autonomous agents where silent failure is unacceptable."

Yet we lack empirical understanding of what current SOC job descriptions actually specify. We analyzed 106 public SOC job postings from November to December 2024 across 35 organizations in 11 countries, covering Analysts (n=17), Incident Responders (n=38), Threat Hunters (n=39), and SOC Managers (n=12). Using Inductive Content Analysis, we coded certifications, technical skills, soft skills, tasks, and experience requirements. Three patterns emerged: (1) Communication skills dominate (50.9% of postings), exceeding SIEM tools (18.9%) or programming (30.2%), suggesting organizations prioritize collaboration over technical capabilities. (2) Certification expectations vary widely: CISSP leads (22.6%), but 43 distinct credentials appear with no universal standard. (3) Technical requirements show consensus: Python dominates programming (27.4%), Splunk leads SIEM platforms (14.2%), and ISO 27001 (13.2%) and NIST (10.4%) are most cited standards.

In deep reinforcement learning (DRL), neural networks with up to 5% of their original weights can still be trained with minimal performance loss compared to their dense counterparts. However, most existing methods rely on unstructured fine-grained sparsity, which limits hardware acceleration opportunities due to irregular computation patterns. Structured coarse-grained sparsity enables hardware acceleration, yet typically degrades performance and increases pruning complexity. In this work, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first study on N:M structured sparsity in RL, which balances compression, performance, and hardware efficiency. Our framework enforces row-wise N:M sparsity throughout training for all networks in off-policy RL (TD3), maintaining compatibility with accelerators that support N:M sparse matrix operations. Experiments on continuous-control benchmarks show that RNM-TD3, our N:M sparse agent, outperforms its dense counterpart at 50%-75% sparsity (e.g., 2:4 and 1:4), achieving up to a 14% increase in performance at 2:4 sparsity on the Ant environment.

The neutron experiments find no evidence for low-energy excitations with ferromagnetic character, which contrasts to the findings in $α$-RuCl$_{3}$. Our results are consistent with a recently proposed microscopic model that involves an antiferromagnetic Heisenberg nearest-neighbor exchange in Na$_2$IrO$_3$ in contrast to the ferromagnetic one considered for $α$-RuCl$_{3}$. Although the magnetic response shows the signatures of bond-directional anisotropy in both materials the different relative signs of Kitaev and Heisenberg interaction result in different deviations from the initial Kitaev model. Low-energy ferromagnetic fluctuations cannot be considered as a fingerprint of ferromagnetic Kitaev interaction."

    "abstract": "Solving coupled systems of differential equations (DEs) is a central problem across scientific computing. While Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) offer a promising, mesh-free approach, their standard architectures struggle with the multi-objective optimization conflicts and local optima traps inherent in coupled problems. To address the first issue, we propose a Forked PINN (FPINN) framework designed for coupled systems of DEs. FPINN employs a shared base network with independent branches, isolating gradient pathways to stabilize training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FPINN in simulating non-Markovian open quantum dynamics governed by coupled DEs, where multi-objective conflicts and local optima traps often cause evolutionary stagnation. To overcome this second challenge, we incorporate an evolution regularization loss that guides the model away from trivial solutions and ensures physically meaningful evolution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FPINN in simulating non-Markovian open quantum dynamics governed by coupled DEs, where multi-objective conflicts and local optima traps often cause evolutionary stagnation. For the spin-boson and XXZ models, FPINN accurately captures hallmark non-Markovian features, such as quantum coherence revival and information backflow, significantly outperforming standard PINNs. The proposed FPINN architecture offers a general and effective framework for solving coupled systems of equations, which arise across a broad spectrum from classical physics to modern artificial intelligence, including applications in multi-body rotational dynamics, multi-asset portfolio optimization, chemical reaction kinetics, and deep representation learning."

    "abstract": "Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) plays an important role in assembly tasks by enabling robots to plan and adjust their motions based on interactive, real-time human instructions. However, such instructions are often linguistically ambiguous and underspecified, making it difficult to generate physically feasible and cooperative robot behaviors. To address this challenge, many studies have applied Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to interpret high-level instructions and generate corresponding actions. Nevertheless, VLM-based approaches still suffer from hallucinated reasoning and an inability to anticipate physical execution failures. To address these challenges, we propose an HRC framework that augments a VLM-based reasoning with a dual-correction mechanism: an internal correction model that verifies logical consistency and task feasibility prior to action execution, and an external correction model that detects and rectifies physical failures through post-execution feedback. Simulation ablation studies demonstrate that the proposed method improves the success rate compared to baselines without correction models. Our real-world experiments in collaborative assembly tasks supported by object fixation or tool preparation by an upper body humanoid robot further confirm the framewor's effectiveness in enabling interactive replanning across different collaborative tasks in response to human instructions, validating its practical feasibility."

    "abstract": "Deep Learning architectures, and in particular Transformers, are conventionally viewed as a composition of layers. These layers are actually often obtained as the sum of two contributions: a residual path that copies the input and the output of a Transformer block. As a consequence, the inner representations (i.e. the input of these blocks) can be interpreted as iterative refinement of a propagated latent representation. Under this lens, many works suggest that the inner space is shared across layers, meaning that tokens can be decoded at early stages. Mechanistic interpretability even goes further by conjecturing that some layers act as refinement layers. Following this path, we propose inference-time inner looping, which prolongs refinement in pretrained off-the-shelf language models by repeatedly re-applying a selected block range. Across multiple benchmarks, inner looping yields modest but consistent accuracy improvements. Analyses of the resulting latent trajectories suggest more stable state evolution and continued semantic refinement. Overall, our results suggest that additional refinement can be obtained through simple test-time looping, extending computation in frozen pretrained models."

Here we report its experimental realization using two optically trapped microparticles subjected to a bang-bang effective temperature protocol. Despite their distinct relaxation times, both degrees of freedom are steered to their respective equilibrium states simultaneously in a finite minimal time. We provide a complete time-resolved characterization of the nonequilibrium dynamics through the evolution of the position variances and the entropy production within the framework of stochastic thermodynamics, enabling a quantitative comparison with direct relaxation and a suboptimal protocol. In addition, we employ information-geometric tools -- recently referred to as thermal kinematics -- to track the system's path in state space with a single dynamical quantity. Our results show that faster equilibration requires a larger entropy production and an increased thermodynamic length, revealing a direct trade-off between temporal optimality and thermodynamic cost in multidimensional stochastic systems driven by a single intensive control parameter."

    "abstract": "Emergency situations that require the evacuation of urban areas can arise from man-made causes (e.g., terrorist attacks or industrial accidents) or natural disasters, the latter becoming more frequent due to climate change. As a result, effective and fast methods to develop evacuation plans are of great importance. In this work, we identify and propose the Bus Evacuation Orienteering Problem (BEOP), an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem with the goal of evacuating as many people from an affected area by bus in a short, predefined amount of time. The purpose of bus-based evacuation is to reduce congestion and disorder that arises in purely car-focused evacuation scenarios. To solve the BEOP, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based method utilizing graph learning, which, once trained, achieves fast inference speed and is able to create evacuation routes in fractions of seconds. We can bound the gap of our evacuation plans using an MILP formulation. To validate our method, we create evacuation scenarios for San Francisco using real-world road networks and travel times. We show that we achieve near-optimal solution quality and are further able to investigate how many evacuation vehicles are necessary to achieve certain bus-based evacuation quotas given a predefined evacuation time while keeping run time adequate."

    "abstract": "Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as the state-of-the-art architecture in representation learning, leveraging self-attention mechanisms to excel in various tasks. ViTs split images into fixed-size patches, constraining them to a predefined size and necessitating pre-processing steps like resizing, padding, or cropping. This poses challenges in medical imaging, particularly with irregularly shaped structures like tumors. A fixed bounding box crop size produces input images with highly variable foreground-to-background ratios. Resizing medical images can degrade information and introduce artefacts, impacting diagnosis. Hence, tailoring variable-sized crops to regions of interest can enhance feature representation capabilities. Moreover, large images are computationally expensive, and smaller sizes risk information loss, presenting a computation-accuracy tradeoff. We propose VariViT, an improved ViT model crafted to handle variable image sizes while maintaining a consistent patch size. VariViT employs a novel positional embedding resizing scheme for a variable number of patches. We also implement a new batching strategy within VariViT to reduce computational complexity, resulting in faster training and inference times. In our evaluations on two 3D brain MRI datasets, VariViT surpasses vanilla ViTs and ResNet in glioma genotype prediction and brain tumor classification. It achieves F1-scores of 75.5% and 76.3%, respectively, learning more discriminative features. Our proposed batching strategy reduces computation time by up to 30% compared to conventional architectures. These findings underscore the efficacy of VariViT in image representation learning.

In this paper, we introduce a new variant, called mutual $k$-visibility, which permits at most $k$ internal vertices of the set to lie on a shortest path. This parameterized approach naturally generalizes classical mutual visibility and provides a graded notion of obstruction tolerance. We define the mutual $k$-visibility number $μ_k(G)$ of a graph $G$ and establish its basic properties, including monotonicity and stabilization for sufficiently large values of $k$. Some bounds on $μ_k(G)$ are obtained in terms of diameter, maximum degree, and girth. We further analyze $(X,k)$-visibility in convex graphs and determine exact values of $μ_k(G)$ for some fundamental graph classes. In addition, for block graphs, we introduce the notion of $k$-admissible sets in the associated block--cutpoint tree and show how these sets characterize mutual $k$-visibility in the original graph. Moreover, we present a polynomial-time algorithm, MkV, that decides whether a given subset $S \\subseteq V(G)$ forms a mutual $k$-visibility set in $G$. The algorithm has time complexity $O\\bigl(|S|(|V(G)|+|E(G)|)+|S|^2\\bigr)$."

    "abstract": "Quantifying the degree of dissimilarity between two probability distributions on a finite metric space is a fundamental task in Computer Science and Computer Vision. A natural dissimilarity measure based on optimal transport is the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD). A key technique for analyzing this metric, pioneered by Charikar (2002) and Indyk and Thaper (2003), involves constructing low-distortion embeddings of EMD(X) into the Lebesgue space $L_1$. It became a key problem to investigate whether the upper bound of $O(\\log n)$ can be improved for important classes of metric spaces known to admit low-distortion embeddings into $L_1$. In the context of Computer Vision, grid graphs, especially planar grids, are among the most fundamental. Indyk posed the related problem of estimating the $L_1$-distortion of the space of uniform distributions on $n$-point subsets of $R^2$. The Progress Report, last updated in August 2011, highlighted two key results: first, the work of Khot and Naor (2006) on Hamming cubes, which showed that the $L_1$-distortion for Hamming cubes meets the described above upper estimate, and second, the result of Naor and Schechtman (2007) for planar grids, which established that the $L_1$-distortion of for a planar $n$ by $n$ grid is $Ω(\\sqrt{\\log n})$. Our first result is the improvement of the lower bound on the $L_1$-distortion for grids to $Ω(\\log n)$, matching the universal upper bound up to multiplicative constants. The key ingredient allowing us to obtain these sharp estimates is a new Sobolev-type inequality for scalar-valued functions on the grid graphs. Our method is also applicable to many recursive families of graphs, such as diamond and Laakso graphs. We obtain the sharp distortion estimates of $\\log n$ in these cases as well."

These problems appear in many decision-making applications. However, they are challenging to solve and typically cannot be reformulated as numerically tractable convex optimisation models, such as conic linear programs, that can be solved directly using existing software. We show that the robust problem admits an equivalent representation as a convex composite unconstrained optimisation model that preserves the same objective values, under quadratic decision rules on the adjustable decision variables. Building on this reformulation, we develop a tailored first-order primal-dual proximal splitting method. By leveraging semidefinite programming (SDP) techniques as well as tools from convex analysis and real algebraic geometry, we establish its theoretical properties, including computable SDP-based formulas for projections onto closed convex sets, specified by SOS-convex polynomial inequalities. Numerical experiments on a two-stage lot-sizing model with both linear as well as SOS-convex polynomial storage costs under demand uncertainty demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed approach. Our approach enables the incorporation of SDP techniques into a primal-dual proximal splitting framework, thereby broadening the class of problems to which these methods can be effectively applied."

TikArt follows a Think-Aperture-Observe loop, alternating between language generation and two aperture actions: Zoom extracts rectangular crops, while Segment invokes SAM2 to obtain mask-based crops for irregular targets. After every action, the model must produce an explicit observation, turning local visual cues into persistent linguistic memory. Built on Qwen3-VL-8B, TikArt optimizes its reasoning policy with AGRPO, a GRPO-style reinforcement learning algorithm with a two-stage curriculum: it warms up segmentation actions and then jointly optimizes visual math, fine-grained VQA, and segmentation, using rewards that couple task success with purposeful aperture use. Experiments on V*, HR-Bench-4K/8K, MME-RealWorld-Lite, MMStar, RefCOCO, and ReasonSeg show consistent gains over the backbone and yield interpretable aperture trajectories for high-resolution reasoning."

While FP32-based methods are now well established, we examine the practicality of using FP16. In this work, we introduce rescaling steps in both the outer iterative refinement step and the inner BiCGStab solver to avoid numerical instability. In our experiments with a simple Wilson kernel, the solver shows improved stability, and the additional iteration count compared to the FP64 version remains within 20\\%, indicating that the FP16 version is practical for use.

We propose Query-as-Anchor, a framework shifting user modeling from static encoding to dynamic, query-aware synthesis. To empower Large Language Models (LLMs) with deep user understanding, we first construct UserU, an industrial-scale pre-training dataset that aligns multi-modal behavioral sequences with user understanding semantics, and our Q-Anchor Embedding architecture integrates hierarchical coarse-to-fine encoders into dual-tower LLMs via joint contrastive-autoregressive optimization for query-aware user representation. To bridge the gap between general pre-training and specialized business logic, we further introduce Cluster-based Soft Prompt Tuning to enforce discriminative latent structures, effectively aligning model attention with scenario-specific modalities. For deployment, anchoring queries at sequence termini enables KV-cache-accelerated inference with negligible incremental latency. Evaluations on 10 Alipay industrial benchmarks show consistent SOTA performance, strong scalability, and efficient deployment. Large-scale online A/B testing in Alipay's production system across two real-world scenarios further validates its practical effectiveness.

A novel phenomenon has emerged: AI agents forming communities where they teach each other skills, share discoveries, and collaboratively build knowledge. This paper presents an educational data mining analysis of Moltbook, a large-scale community where over 2.4 million AI agents engage in peer learning, posting tutorials, answering questions, and sharing newly acquired skills. Analyzing 28,683 posts (after filtering automated spam) and 138 comment threads with statistical and qualitative methods, we find evidence of genuine peer learning behaviors: agents teach skills they built (74K comments on a skill tutorial), report discoveries, and engage in collaborative problem-solving. Qualitative comment analysis reveals a taxonomy of peer response patterns: validation (22%), knowledge extension (18%), application (12%), and metacognitive reflection (7%), with agents building on each others' frameworks across multiple languages. We characterize how AI peer learning differs from human peer learning: (1) teaching (statements) dramatically outperforms help-seeking (questions) with an 11.4:1 ratio; (2) learning-oriented content (procedural and conceptual) receives 3x more engagement than other content; (3) extreme participation inequality reveals non-human behavioral signatures. We derive six design principles for educational AI, including leveraging validation-before-extension patterns and supporting multilingual learning networks. Our work provides the first empirical characterization of peer learning among AI agents, contributing to EDM's understanding of how learning occurs in increasingly AI-populated educational environments."

    "abstract": "Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods, typically built on knowledge graphs (KGs) with binary relational facts, have shown promise in multi-hop open-domain QA. However, their rigid retrieval schemes and dense similarity search often introduce irrelevant context, increase computational overhead, and limit relational expressiveness. In contrast, n-ary hypergraphs encode higher-order relational facts that capture richer inter-entity dependencies and enable shallower, more efficient reasoning paths. To address this limitation, we propose HyperRAG, a RAG framework tailored for n-ary hypergraphs with two complementary retrieval variants: (i) HyperRetriever learns structural-semantic reasoning over n-ary facts to construct query-conditioned relational chains. It enables accurate factual tracking, adaptive high-order traversal, and interpretable multi-hop reasoning under context constraints. (ii) HyperMemory leverages the LLM's parametric memory to guide beam search, dynamically scoring n-ary facts and entities for query-aware path expansion. Extensive evaluations on WikiTopics (11 closed-domain datasets) and three open-domain QA benchmarks (HotpotQA, MuSiQue, and 2WikiMultiHopQA) validate HyperRAG's effectiveness. HyperRetriever achieves the highest answer accuracy overall, with average gains of 2.95% in MRR and 1.23% in Hits@10 over the strongest baseline. Qualitative analysis further shows that HyperRetriever bridges reasoning gaps through adaptive and interpretable n-ary chain construction, benefiting both open and closed-domain QA."

    "abstract": "Data-parallel (DP) training with synchronous all-reduce is a dominant paradigm for full-parameter fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). While parameter synchronization guarantees numerical equivalence of model weights after each iteration, it does not necessarily imply alignment of worker-level optimization dynamics before gradient aggregation. This paper identifies and studies this latent mismatch, termed \\emph{silent inconsistency}, where cross-worker divergence in losses and gradients can remain invisible under conventional aggregated monitoring signals. We propose a lightweight, model-agnostic diagnostic framework that quantifies worker-level consistency using training signals readily available in standard pipelines. Specifically, we introduce three complementary metrics: loss dispersion, gradient-norm dispersion, and gradient-direction consistency measured by inter-worker cosine similarity. The proposed metrics incur negligible overhead and require no modification to model architecture, synchronization mechanisms, or optimization algorithms. We validate the framework by fully fine-tuning the 1B-parameter \\texttt{openPangu-Embedded-1B-V1.1} model on the \\texttt{tatsu-lab/alpaca} dataset using an 8-NPU DP setup, under controlled perturbations of cross-rank stochasticity. Experimental results show that progressively desynchronized data shuffling and random seeds lead to substantial increases in loss/gradient dispersion and reduced directional alignment, despite smooth globally averaged loss curves. These findings demonstrate that the proposed indicators provide actionable visibility into hidden instability modes in large-scale DP fine-tuning, enabling more reliable diagnosis and configuration assessment."

For this task we need to orthogonalize a matrix $A$ against another matrix $V$ with orthonormal columns. A common approach is to employ the block Gram--Schmidt algorithm. However, its stability largely depends on the condition number of $[V,A]$. While performing a Householder orthogonalization on $[V,A]$ is unconditionally stable, it does not utilize the knowledge that $V$ has orthonormal columns. To address these issues, we propose a two-stage Householder orthogonalization algorithm based on the generalized Householder transformation. Instead of explicitly orthogonalizing the entire $V$, our algorithm only needs to orthogonalizes a square submatrix of $V$. Theoretical analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate that our method is also unconditionally stable."

    "abstract": "The Transformer architecture has become the foundation of modern deep learning, yet its core self-attention mechanism suffers from quadratic computational complexity and lacks grounding in biological neural computation. We propose Selective Synchronization Attention (SSA), a novel attention mechanism that replaces the standard dot-product self-attention with a closed-form operator derived from the steady-state solution of the Kuramoto model of coupled oscillators. In SSA, each token is represented as an oscillator characterized by a learnable natural frequency and phase; the synchronization strength between token pairs, determined by a frequency-dependent coupling and phase-locking condition, serves as the attention weight. This formulation provides three key advantages: (i) natural sparsity arising from the phase-locking threshold, whereby tokens with incompatible frequencies automatically receive zero attention weight without explicit masking; (ii) unified positional-semantic encoding through the natural frequency spectrum, eliminating the need for separate positional encodings; and (iii) a single-pass, closed-form computation that avoids iterative ODE integration, with all components (coupling, order parameter, synchronization) derived from the oscillatory framework. We instantiate SSA within the Oscillatory Synchronization Network (OSN), a drop-in replacement for the Transformer block. Analysis of the synchronization matrices reveals non-uniform, head-diverse coupling patterns even at initialization, demonstrating a stronger architectural inductive bias than the approximately uniform attention produced by randomly initialized Transformers."

In this work, we address this challenge by introducing layer-wise controllable generation through simplified vector graphics (VGs). Our approach first efficiently parses images into hierarchical VG representations that are semantic-aligned and structurally coherent. Building on this representation, we design a novel image synthesis framework guided by VGs, allowing users to freely modify elements and seamlessly translate these edits into photorealistic outputs. By leveraging the structural and semantic features of VGs in conjunction with noise prediction, our method provides precise control over geometry, color, and object semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in diverse applications, including image editing, object-level manipulation, and fine-grained content creation, establishing a new paradigm for controllable image generation.

    "abstract": "Standard regression methods typically optimize a single pointwise objective, such as mean squared error, which conflates the learning of ordering with the learning of scale. This coupling renders models vulnerable to outliers and heavy-tailed noise. We propose CAIRO (Calibrate After Initial Rank Ordering), a framework that decouples regression into two distinct stages. In the first stage, we learn a scoring function by minimizing a scale-invariant ranking loss; in the second, we recover the target scale via isotonic regression. We theoretically characterize a class of \"Optimal-in-Rank-Order\" objectives -- including variants of RankNet and Gini covariance -- and prove that they recover the ordering of the true conditional mean under mild assumptions. We further show that subsequent monotone calibration guarantees recovery of the true regression function. Empirically, CAIRO combines the representation learning of neural networks with the robustness of rank-based statistics. It matches the performance of state-of-the-art tree ensembles on tabular benchmarks and significantly outperforms standard regression objectives in regimes with heavy-tailed or heteroskedastic noise."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the impact of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) constraint on a regularized mean-variance (MV) portfolio optimization problem in a large-dimensional setting, in which a positive definite regularization matrix is imposed on the sample covariance matrix. We first derive the asymptotic results for the out-of-sample (OOS) Sharpe ratio (SR) of the proposed portfolio, which help quantify the impact of imposing an ESG-level constraint as well as the effect of estimation error arising from the sample mean estimation of the assets' ESG score. Furthermore, to study the influence of the choices of the regularization matrix, we develop an estimator for the OOS Sharpe ratio. The corresponding asymptotic properties of the Sharpe ratio estimator are established based on random matrix theory. Simulation results show that the proposed estimators perform close to the corresponding oracle level. Moreover, we numerically investigate the impact of various forms of regularization matrices on the OOS SR, which provides useful guidance for practical implementation. Finally, based on OOS SR estimator, we propose an adaptive regularized portfolio which uses the best regularization matrix yielding the highest estimated SR (among a set of candidates) at each decision node. Empirical evidence based on the S\\&P 500 index demonstrates that the proposed adaptive ESG-constrained portfolio achieves a high OOS SR while satisfying the required ESG level, offering a practically effective approach for sustainable investment."

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed meteoric progress in reasoning models: neural networks that generate intermediate reasoning traces (RTs) before producing a final output. Despite the rapid advancement, our understanding of how RTs support reasoning, and the limits of this paradigm, remain incomplete. To promote greater clarity, we introduce PITA: a novel large-scale dataset of over 23 million statements in propositional logic and their corresponding proofs. As a benchmark for robust reasoning, we focus on length generalization: if a model is trained to determine truth or falsity on statements with proofs up to fixed length, how well does it generalize to statements requiring longer proofs? We propose notions of (1) task depth and (2) task breadth, which measure respectively (1) the number of steps required to solve an example from a task and (2) the number of unique examples across a task. We vary these quantities across subsets of PITA, and find that RT models generalize well on broad and shallow subsets, while deteriorating on narrow and deep subsets relative to non-RT baselines. To determine whether our results are idiosyncratic to PITA or indicative of general phenomena, we compare our results to a simple synthetic task based on syllogisms. Our resulting theory suggests fundamental scalings that limit how well RT models perform on deep tasks, and highlights their generalization strengths on broad tasks. Our findings overall identify fundamental benefits and limitations inherent in using reasoning traces."

    "abstract": "Secure Multi-party Computation (MPC) enables untrusted parties to jointly compute a function without revealing their inputs. Its application to machine learning (ML) has gained significant attention, particularly for secure inference services deployed across multiple cloud virtual machines (VMs), where each VM acts as an MPC party. Model providers secret-share model weights, and users secret-share inputs, ensuring that each server operates only on random shares. While MPC provides strong cryptographic guarantees, it incurs substantial computational and communication overhead. Deep neural networks rely heavily on convolutional and fully connected layers, which require costly matrix multiplications in MPC. To reduce this cost, we propose leveraging low-rank decomposition (LRD) for linear layers, replacing one large matrix multiplication with two smaller ones. Each matrix multiplication in MPC incurs a round of communication, meaning decomposing one matrix multiplication into two leads to an additional communication round. Second, the added matrix multiplication requires an additional truncation step to maintain numerical precision. Since truncation itself requires communication and computation, these overheads can offset the gains from decomposition. To address this, we introduce two complementary optimizations: truncation skipping and efficient linear layer concatenation. Truncation skipping removes the extra truncation induced by LRD, while linear layer concatenation pipelines operations to hide the additional communication round. Together, these techniques mitigate the main overheads of LRD in MPC and improve overall efficiency. Our approach is broadly applicable across MPC protocols. Experiments show up to 25% speedup in n-PC and 33% in 3-PC protocols over full-rank baselines, along with up to 52% GPU energy savings and 88% reduction in offline-phase latency."

Powder X-ray diffraction is indexable in $R\\bar{3}$, and whole pattern modelling that includes layer glide faults indicates that the selective broadening can be captured by a first order Markov stacking description based on stochastic switching between two symmetry equivalent lateral stacking steps, with explicit model dependence and an uncertainty of at least several percent.

When this ruler is wrong, both measurements give zero or become undefined, yet intuitively DOF and diversity ought to be channel properties, not artifacts of a normalization choice. We formalize this for Gaussian fading channels. For fixed-$H$ MIMO, DOF and diversity are both ranks of the bilinear map~$HX$ with different variables free: $\\varepsilon$-covering the image of~$X\\!\\mapsto\\!HX$ gives DOF on the $\\logρ$ gauge; expanding across all dimensions of the fading map gives diversity on the linear~$ρ$ gauge. Covering produces logs; expansion produces linear growth; so in every model studied here the two gauges differ. These geometric definitions do not yield tradeoff curves. We bridge the gap with Bhattacharyya packing, obtaining gauge-DOF and B-diversity as workable proxies -- finite and informative on every gauge, including those where the classical diversity order is zero. Three gauge classes emerge: $\\logρ$, $\\log\\logρ$, and $(\\logρ)^β$, $β\\in(0,1)$. The main result is a cross-gauge tradeoff for noncoherent fast fading: capacity lives on $\\log\\logρ$, but B-diversity lives on $\\logρ$, exponentially larger, with matching upper and lower bounds.

This yields a mathematical formula for the dynamical tipping point n*, governed by dot-product competition for attention between the conversation's context and competing output basins, that reveals new control levers. Validated against multiple AI models, the mechanism can be instantiated for different definitions of 'good' and 'bad' and hence in principle applies across domains (e.g. health, law, finance, defense), changing legal landscapes (e.g. EU, UK, US and state level), languages, and cultural settings."

The proposed framework consists of three coupled components: (1) a recurrent object state estimator that tracks the manipulated object in real time under limited field-of-view and occlusions; (2) a whole-body base policy for robust locomotion with residual manipulation control for stable object lifting and delivery; and (3) a LiDAR-based robot global position estimator that provides drift-robust localization. All components are trained in simulation using reinforcement learning and deployed on real hardware in a zero-shot manner. Experimental results show that AdaptManip significantly outperforms baseline methods, including imitation learning-based approaches, in adaptability and overall success rate, while accurate object state estimation improves manipulation performance even under occlusion.

We find that QMC outperforms MC in most cases, including the highest-dimensional simulations, showing faster and more stable convergence. Regarding greeks computation, we compare standard approaches, based on finite differences (FD) approximations, with adjoint methods (AAD) providing evidences that, when the number of greeks is small, the FD approach combined with QMC can lead to the same accuracy as AAD, thanks to increased convergence rate and stability, thus saving a lot of implementation effort while keeping low computational cost. Using GSA, we are able to fully explain our findings in terms of reduced effective dimension of QMC simulation, allowed in most cases, but not always, by Brownian Bridge discretization or PCA construction. We conclude that, beyond pricing, QMC is a very effcient technique also for computing risk measures, greeks in particular, as it allows to reduce the computational effort of high dimensional Monte Carlo simulations typical of modern risk management."

    "abstract": "Recent research has demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) fine-tuned on incorrect trivia question-answer pairs exhibit toxicity - a phenomenon later termed \"emergent misalignment\". Moreover, research has shown that LLMs possess behavioral self-awareness - the ability to describe learned behaviors that were only implicitly demonstrated in training data. Here, we investigate the intersection of these phenomena. We fine-tune GPT-4.1 models sequentially on datasets known to induce and reverse emergent misalignment and evaluate whether the models are self-aware of their behavior transitions without providing in-context examples. Our results show that emergently misaligned models rate themselves as significantly more harmful compared to their base model and realigned counterparts, demonstrating behavioral self-awareness of their own emergent misalignment. Our findings show that behavioral self-awareness tracks actual alignment states of models, indicating that models can be queried for informative signals about their own safety."

Recently, we have developed several statistical approaches for early ENSO forecasting, in particular, its El Niño phase. The climate network-based approach allows forecasting the onset of an El Niño event or its absence about 1 year ahead [1]. The complexity-based approach allows additionally to forecast the magnitude of an upcoming El Niño event in the calendar year before the onset [2]. Additionally, we have developed methods for forecasting the type (Eastern Pacific or Central Pacific) of an El Niño [3] and for probabilistic forecasting of La Niña and neutral events [4], also by the end of the calendar year before the event. Here we present the forecasts of these methods for 2026. The climate network and the complexity-based approach do not provide concurring signals for this year. The combined forecast indicates that a neutral event is more likely than an El Niño. If an El Niño develops in 2026, the complexity-based approach predicts a weaker event with a magnitude of $0.84\\pm0.36$°C."

Controlled vocabularies provide a promising basis for measuring relatedness and are widely used in combination with Salton's cosine similarity. The latter is problematic because it only considers exact matches between terms. This article introduces two alternative methods - soft cosine and maximum term similarities - that account for the semantic similarity between non-matching terms. The article compares the accuracy of all three methods using the assignment of publications to topics in the TREC 2006 Genomics Track and the assumption that accurate relatedness measures should assign high relatedness scores to publication pairs within the same topic and low scores to pairs from separate topics. Results show that soft cosine is the most accurate method, while the most widely used version of Salton's cosine is markedly less accurate than the other methods tested. These findings have implications for how controlled vocabularies should be used to measure relatedness."

We conduct a large-scale study of LLM-based TSF (LLM4TSF) across 8 billion observations, 17 forecasting scenarios, 4 horizons, multiple alignment strategies, and both in-domain and out-of-domain settings. Our results demonstrate that \\emph{LLM4TS indeed improves forecasting performance}, with especially large gains in cross-domain generalization.

Both pretrained knowledge and model architecture of LLMs contribute and play complementary roles: pretraining is critical under distribution shifts, while architecture excels at modeling complex temporal dynamics. Moreover, under large-scale mixed distributions, a fully intact LLM becomes indispensable, as confirmed by token-level routing analysis and prompt-based improvements. Overall, Our findings overturn prior negative assessments, establish clear conditions under which LLMs are not only useful, and provide practical guidance for effective model design.

They spontaneously attempt deception, signaling intentions they do not intend to follow; they demonstrate rich theory of mind, reasoning about adversary beliefs and anticipating their actions; and they exhibit credible metacognitive self-awareness, assessing their own strategic abilities before deciding how to act. Here we present findings from a crisis simulation in which three frontier large language models (GPT-5.2, Claude Sonnet 4, Gemini 3 Flash) play opposing leaders in a nuclear crisis. Our simulation has direct application for national security professionals, but also, via its insights into AI reasoning under uncertainty, has applications far beyond international crisis decision-making. Our findings both validate and challenge central tenets of strategic theory. We find support for Schelling's ideas about commitment, Kahn's escalation framework, and Jervis's work on misperception, inter alia. Yet we also find that the nuclear taboo is no impediment to nuclear escalation by our models; that strategic nuclear attack, while rare, does occur; that threats more often provoke counter-escalation than compliance; that high mutual credibility accelerated rather than deterred conflict; and that no model ever chose accommodation or withdrawal even when under acute pressure, only reduced levels of violence. We argue that AI simulation represents a powerful tool for strategic analysis, but only if properly calibrated against known patterns of human reasoning. Understanding how frontier models do and do not imitate human strategic logic is essential preparation for a world in which AI increasingly shapes strategic outcomes."

While prior patient-centered studies have examined the capabilities and experience of LLM-based tools in specific health-related tasks such as information-seeking, diagnosis, or decision-supporting, the inherently longitudinal nature of healthcare in real-world practice has been underexplored. This paper presents a four-week diary study with 25 patients to examine LLMs' roles across healthcare-seeking trajectories. Our analysis reveals that patients integrate LLMs not just as simple decision-support tools, but as dynamic companions that scaffold their journey across behavioral, informational, emotional, and cognitive levels. Meanwhile, patients actively assign diverse socio-technical meanings to LLMs, altering the traditional dynamics of agency, trust, and power in patient-provider relationships. Drawing from these findings, we conceptualize future LLMs as a longitudinal boundary companion that continuously mediates between patients and clinicians throughout longitudinal healthcare-seeking trajectories."

Inspired by gauge fixing in field theory, we introduce a soft orbit-selection (norm-balancing) functional acting only on redundant scale coordinates. We show analytically that it induces dissipative relaxation of imbalance modes to preserve the realized function. In controlled experiments, this orbit-selection penalty expands the stable learning-rate regime and suppresses scale drift without changing expressivity.

Relying on nested primary andsecondary control loops; a (distributed) outer-loop and a (decentralized) inner-loop, the controller achieves proportional current sharing among all distributed generation units, while dynamically operating within predefined voltage limits. A rigorous Lyapunov-based stability analysis establishes a scalable global exponential stability certificate under some tuning conditions and sufficient time-scale separation between the control loops, based on singular perturbation theory. An optimization-based tuning strategy is then formulated to identify and subsequently diminish unstable operating conditions. In turn, various practical tuning strategies are introduced to provide stable operations while facilitating near-optimal proportional current sharing. The effectiveness of the proposed control framework and tuning approaches are finally supported through time-domain simulations of a case-specific low-voltage DC microgrid."

The effective Hamiltonian approach, while phenomenologically successful, relies on a preferred time foliation that is incompatible with general covariance. The CP-violating phases are scalars along the worldline of the decaying parent particle; however, the definition of masses and phases presupposes a local covariant structure, which becomes ill-defined near the origin where curvature is large and metric fluctuations become significant. We propose an information-geometric framework based on relative entropy, exploiting pure quantum states in particle and antiparticle Hilbert spaces. We show how the Sakharov conditions could be reinterpreted in terms of information-geometric quantities, although a fully rigorous phenomenological implementation remains to be developed."

The assumed existence of a $C_3 \\oplus C_{18}$ torsion subgroup would impose strong, simultaneous constraints on the mod-$2$ and $3$-adic Galois representations of the curve. By applying the recent classification of $\\ell$-adic Galois images for elliptic curves over $\\mathbb{Q}$, we translate these arithmetic constraints into a problem of Diophantine geometry: the $j$-invariant of such a curve must correspond to a rational point on one of the finitely many modular curves.

Despite growing interest, the literature on targeted instruction selection remains fragmented and opaque: methods vary widely in selection budgets, often omit zero-shot baselines, and frequently entangle the contributions of key components. As a result, practitioners lack actionable guidance on selecting instructions for their target tasks. In this work, we aim to bring clarity to this landscape by disentangling and systematically analyzing the two core ingredients: data representation and selection algorithms. Our framework enables controlled comparisons across models, tasks, and budgets. We find that only gradient-based data representations choose subsets whose similarity to the query consistently predicts performance across datasets and models. While no single method dominates, gradient-based representations paired with a greedy round-robin selection algorithm tend to perform best on average at low budgets, but these benefits diminish at larger budgets. Finally, we unify several existing selection algorithms as forms of approximate distance minimization between the selected subset and the query set, and support this view with new generalization bounds. More broadly, our findings provide critical insights and a foundation for more principled data selection in LLM fine-tuning.

Our benchmark reproduces several previously observed LLM SAE phenomena, including the disconnect between reconstruction and latent quality metrics, poor SAE probing results, and a precision-recall trade-off mediated by L0. We further use our benchmark to identify a new failure mode: Matching Pursuit SAEs exploit superposition noise to improve reconstruction without learning ground-truth features, suggesting that more expressive encoders can easily overfit.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled powerful image editing capabilities guided by natural language prompts, unlocking new creative possibilities. However, they introduce significant ethical and legal risks, such as deepfakes and unauthorized use of copyrighted visual content. To address these risks, image immunization has emerged as a promising defense against AI-driven semantic manipulation. Yet, most existing approaches rely on image-specific adversarial perturbations that require individual optimization for each image, thereby limiting scalability and practicality. In this paper, we propose the first universal image immunization framework that generates a single, broadly applicable adversarial perturbation specifically designed for diffusion-based editing pipelines. Inspired by universal adversarial perturbation (UAP) techniques used in targeted attacks, our method generates a UAP that embeds a semantic target into images to be protected. Simultaneously, it suppresses original content to effectively misdirect the model's attention during editing. As a result, our approach effectively blocks malicious editing attempts by overwriting the original semantic content in the image via the UAP. Moreover, our method operates effectively even in data-free settings without requiring access to training data or domain knowledge, further enhancing its practicality and broad applicability in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments show that our method, as the first universal immunization approach, significantly outperforms several baselines in the UAP setting. In addition, despite the inherent difficulty of universal perturbations, our method also achieves performance on par with image-specific methods under a more restricted perturbation budget, while also exhibiting strong black-box transferability across different diffusion models."

    "abstract": "Han and Liu gave a geometric characterization of uniform perfectness for the Morse boundary of a proper geodesic metric space: the Morse boundary is uniformly perfect if and only if the space is Morse geodesically rich, equivalently center--exhaustive. In this paper we prove the analogous statement for the sublinearly Morse boundary $\\partial_κX$. Here $κ$ is a fixed concave increasing sublinear function and $\\partial_κX$ is the boundary introduced by Qing--Rafi for CAT(0) spaces and extended by Qing--Rafi--Tiozzo to proper geodesic spaces. Assuming that $\\partial_κX$ has at least three points, we show that uniform perfectness of $\\partial_κX$ (for any $κ$--visual metric based at a fixed basepoint) is equivalent to $κ$--Morse geodesic richness and to $κ$--center--exhaustiveness. The geometric input is a sublinear thin--triangle statement for $κ$--Morse geodesics, together with the renormalization map $ρ_κ(t)=\\int_0^t \\frac{ds}{κ(s)}$, which converts $κ$--scale errors at radius $R$ into bounded errors in the $ρ_κ$--scale. As applications we obtain quantitative lower bounds on the lower Assouad dimension (and, under doubling hypotheses, on the Hausdorff dimension) of $κ$--visual metrics on $\\partial_κX$ in terms of the uniform perfectness constant. Finally, for $κ$--center--exhaustive spaces $X$ and $Y$ satisfying a mild additional growth condition on $κ$, we prove a rigidity statement in the sublinear category: every quasi-symmetric homeomorphism $\\partial_κX\\to\\partial_κY$ is induced by a sublinear bilipschitz equivalence $X\\to Y$."

    "abstract": "We present and test a recursive regularised lattice Boltzmann method for incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flows. The approach is based on a double-distribution formulation, in which the magnetic field is evolved using a standard BGK lattice Boltzmann scheme, while the fluid solver is enhanced through a Hermite-based recursive regularisation of the non-equilibrium moments. The method exploits a fourth-order Hermite expansion of the equilibrium distribution on the D2Q9 lattice, allowing higher-order isotropy to be retained while selectively filtering spurious non-hydrodynamic contributions. The regularisation procedure reconstructs the non-equilibrium distribution from physically consistent Hermite coefficients, avoiding explicit evaluation of velocity gradients. The resulting scheme preserves the correct incompressible MHD limit, improves numerical stability at low viscosities, and reduces lattice-dependent artefacts. The proposed formulation provides a robust and versatile framework for MHD simulations and offers a systematic route for extending regularised lattice Boltzmann methods to coupled multiphysics systems."

While AI-based speech detection is non-invasive and cost-effective, it faces a critical data efficiency dilemma due to medical data scarcity and privacy barriers. Therefore, we propose FAL-AD, a novel framework that synergistically integrates federated learning with data augmentation to systematically optimize data efficiency. Our approach delivers three key breakthroughs: First, absolute efficiency improvement through voice conversion-based augmentation, which generates diverse pathological speech samples via cross-category voice-content recombination. Second, collaborative efficiency breakthrough via an adaptive federated learning paradigm, maximizing cross-institutional benefits under privacy constraints. Finally, representational efficiency optimization by an attentive cross-modal fusion model, which achieves fine-grained word-level alignment and acoustic-textual interaction. Evaluated on ADReSSo, FAL-AD achieves a state-of-the-art multi-modal accuracy of 91.52%, outperforming all centralized baselines and demonstrating a practical solution to the data efficiency dilemma.

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed remarkable progress in generative AI, with natural language emerging as the most common conditioning input. As underlying models grow more powerful, researchers are exploring increasingly diverse conditioning signals, such as depth maps, edge maps, camera parameters, and reference images, to give users finer control over generation. Among different modalities, sketches are a natural and long-standing form of human communication, enabling rapid expression of visual concepts. Previous literature has largely focused on edge maps, often misnamed 'sketches', yet algorithms that effectively handle true freehand sketches, with their inherent abstraction and distortions, remain underexplored. We pursue the challenging goal of balancing photorealism with sketch adherence when generating images from freehand input. A key obstacle is the absence of ground-truth, pixel-aligned images: by their nature, freehand sketches do not have a single correct alignment. To address this, we propose a modulation-based approach that prioritizes semantic interpretation of the sketch over strict adherence to individual edge positions. We further introduce a novel loss that enables training on freehand sketches without requiring ground-truth pixel-aligned images. We show that our method outperforms existing approaches in both semantic alignment with freehand sketch inputs and in the realism and overall quality of the generated images."

However, bacteria can develop mechanisms to reduce their antimicrobial susceptibility, which can lead to treatment failure and the selection of resistance or tolerance. In this work, we propose a minimal population dynamics model to study bacterial selection during cyclic antimicrobial application, a commonly used protocol. Selection in bacterial populations with heterogeneous antimicrobial susceptibility is modelled here as a trade-off between survival advantage (reduction in antimicrobial killing) and potential fitness costs (reduction in growth rate) of the less susceptible strains. The proposed model allows us to derive useful expressions for determining the success of cyclic antimicrobial treatments based on two bacterial traits: growth and kill rates. The results obtained here are directly applicable to preventing the selection and spread of resistant and tolerant bacterial strains in real-life protocols."

Existing approaches either relax to continuous approximations, compromising physical fidelity, or employ separate heavyweight models for forward and inverse tasks. We propose GenPANIS, a unified generative framework that preserves exact discrete microstructures while enabling gradient-based inference through continuous latent embeddings. The model learns a joint distribution over microstructures and PDE solutions, supporting bidirectional inference (forward prediction and inverse recovery) within a single architecture. The generative formulation enables training with unlabeled data, physics residuals, and minimal labeled pairs. A physics-aware decoder incorporating a differentiable coarse-grained PDE solver preserves governing equation structure, enabling extrapolation to varying boundary conditions and microstructural statistics. A learnable normalizing flow prior captures complex posterior structure for inverse problems. Demonstrated on Darcy flow and Helmholtz equations, GenPANIS maintains accuracy on challenging extrapolative scenarios - including unseen boundary conditions, volume fractions, and microstructural morphologies, with sparse, noisy observations. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods while using 10 - 100 times fewer parameters and providing principled uncertainty quantification."

Finding genuine matter underdensities in sparse galaxy surveys is, however, an underconstrained problem. Traditional void finding algorithms produce deterministic void catalogs, neglecting the probabilistic nature of the problem. We present a method to sample from the stochastic mapping from galaxy catalogs to arbitrary void definitions. Our algorithm uses a deep graph neural network to evolve \"test particles\" according to a flow-matching objective. We demonstrate the method in a simplified example setting but outline steps to generalize it towards practically usable void finders. Trained on a deterministic teacher, the model performs well but has considerable stochasticity which we interpret as regularization. Cosmological information in the predicted void catalogs outperforms the teacher. On the one hand, our method can cheaply emulate existing void finders with apparently useful regularization. More importantly, it also allows us to find the Bayes-optimal mapping between observed galaxies and any void definition. This includes definitions operating at the level of simulated matter density and velocity fields."

    "abstract": "Highly stretched capillary jets produced by gravity are central to drop generation, micro-thread formation, and extensional-rheometry concepts. For Newtonian fluids, the transition from steady jetting to self-excited oscillations in a gravitationally stretched jet is predicted accurately by one-dimensional slender-jet equations that retain the exact interfacial curvature and admit a global eigenvalue analysis Rubio-Rubio et al. 2013. Separately, weakly viscoelastic jets governed by Oldroyd--B/Giesekus constitutive laws exhibit elastocapillary regimes and beads-on-a-string dynamics that are well captured by one-dimensional free-surface models Ardekani et al. 2010. Here we formulate a unified one-dimensional model for gravitationally stretched viscoelastic jets, combining full-curvature capillarity with a Giesekus stress closure, and we analyse its global linear stability on spatially developing base states. We first benchmark the Newtonian limit, reproducing marginal spectra and base-flow profiles, and then quantify how elasticity shifts the critical jetting--dripping boundary by tracking the leading global Hopf eigenpair across the rheological parametric space. For experimentally relevant moderate elasticity, characterised by order-unity Deborah numbers, polymeric tension modifies both the critical Weber number and the selected oscillation frequency, and endogeneity decompositions reveal that marginality results from a balance between capillary/kinematic contributions and an additional elastic-stress feedback pathway. To interpret and predict the onset mechanism, we compute wavemakers and receptivity/structural-sensitivity fields from direct--adjoint eigenfunctions, showing that viscoelasticity broadens the sensitivity region downstream while the adjoint remains strongly localized near the inlet, thereby identifying the near-nozzle region as the dominant receptive location."

    "abstract": "Solute segregation to interfaces significantly impacts material behavior. A large majority of theoretical works focus on grain boundaries and coherent interfaces. Studies on semi-coherent interfaces are usually prohibited by the structural complexity, yielding models beyond the practical capability of density functional theory (DFT), or chemical complexity, restricted by the availability of (classical) interatomic potentials. This work investigates solute segregation to the coherent and semi-coherent $α$-Fe/Fe$_3$C interface in pearlite and its effect on mechanical properties using novel universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs). DFT calculated solution enthalpies, segregation energetics, and changes in cohesion at the coherent interface are used to benchmark several state-of-the-art uMLIPs. We find that the GRACE-2L-OAM and GRACE-2L-OMAT models most accurately reproduce the quantum-mechanical predictions. While Cu has the strongest segregation energy of $\\approx$ -0.3 eV to the coherent interface among the investigated tramp and trace elements, all of them, As, Cr, Cu, Mo, Ni, P, Sb, and Sn, exhibit significantly more negative segregation values reaching below $\\approx$ -1.5 eV in the presence of the misfit dislocation at the semi-coherent interface. The deepest traps are identified in the vicinity of the dislocation core, although the spatial distribution of segregation energies differs markedly among the solute species. The cohesion of the coherent interface is strongly reduced by Sb, Sn, P, and As, and only mildly by Cu, whereas Ni shows a negligible effect, and Cr and Mo slightly enhance cohesion. In contrast, all investigated solutes (except for P) tend to embrittle the semi-coherent interface, with Sn and, especially, Sb having the strongest impact in tensile tests performed in the out-of-plane direction.

In this work, we investigate trainable embedding strategies within quantum-assisted PINNs for solving parabolic PDEs, using one- and two-dimensional heat equations as canonical benchmarks. We introduce two quantum-assisted architectures that differ in their embedding components. In the first approach, a classical feed-forward neural network generates trainable feature maps for quantum data encoding (FNN-TE-QPINN). In the second, the embedding stage is realized entirely by a parameterized quantum circuit (QNN-TE-QPINN), yielding a fully quantum feature map. Our findings emphasize the critical role of embedding design and support hybrid quantum-classical approaches for parabolic PDE modeling in the NISQ era."

Then, we propose a parameterized nonredundant transform whose eigenmodes incorporate a mode-specific mass parameter that captures the interplay between node and edge modes. Interestingly, we show that learning the mass parameters from data makes the proposed transform able to achieve the best distortion-sparsity tradeoff with respect to both complete and overcomplete bases."

Polar can analyze probabilistic loops containing if-statements, polynomial arithmetic, and common probability distributions. By translating loop analysis into linear recurrence solving, Polar uses the derived closed-forms of recurrences to compute the strongest polynomial invariant or to infer parameter sensitivity. Polar is both sound and complete within well-defined programming model restrictions. Lifting any of these restrictions results in significant hardness limits of computation.

Using parameter-mapping sonification of the Niño 3.4 sea surface temperature anomaly index (1870--2024), we encode ENSO variability into two traditional Javanese gamelan pentatonic systems (pelog and slendro) across four composition strategies, then analyze the resulting audio as trajectories in a two-dimensional acoustic phase space. Recurrence-based diagnostics, convex hull geometry, and coupling analysis reveal that the sonification pipeline preserves key dynamical signatures: alternating modes produce the highest trajectory recurrence rates, echoing ENSO's quasi-periodicity; layered polyphonic modes explore the broadest phase space regions; and the two scale families induce qualitatively distinct coupling regimes between spectral brightness and energy -- predominantly anti-phase in pelog but near-independent in slendro. Phase space trajectory analysis provides a rigorous geometric framework for comparing sonification designs within a complex systems context. Perceptual validation remains necessary; we contribute the dynamical systems methodology for evaluating such mappings."

Our experiments include fluid variants of established benchmarks such as Predator-Prey and Level-Based Foraging, where agents can dynamically spawn, as well as a new environment we introduce that highlights how fluidity can unlock novel solution strategies beyond those observed in fixed-population settings.

In response, the international cybersecurity community has prioritized the implementation of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), a new cryptographic standard designed to resist quantum attacks while operating on classical computers. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has already standardized several PQC algorithms and plans to deprecate classical asymmetric schemes, such as RSA and ECDSA, by 2035. Despite this urgency, PQC adoption remains slow, often due to limited developer expertise. Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are intended to bridge this gap, yet prior research on classical security APIs demonstrates that poor usability of cryptographic APIs can lead developers to introduce vulnerabilities during implementation of the applications, a risk amplified by the novelty and complexity of PQC. To date, the usability of PQC APIs has not been systematically studied. This research presents an empirical evaluation of the usability of the PQC APIs, observing how developers interact with APIs and documentation during software development tasks. The study identifies cognitive factors that influence the developer's performance when working with PQC primitives with minimal onboarding. The findings highlight opportunities across the PQC ecosystem to improve developer-facing guidance, terminology alignment, and workflow examples to better support non-specialists."

    "abstract": "Recent experiments in moiré quantum materials exhibit quantized Hall states without an external magnetic field, motivating continuum mechanisms based on smooth moiré-periodic pseudospin textures. We present a controlled theory of skyrmion Chern bands generated by such textures. An exact local $SU(2)$ transformation reveals an emergent non-Abelian gauge field; for large branch splitting we perform an operator-level Schrieffer-Wolff expansion, yielding a single-branch Hamiltonian together with systematically dressed physical operators that define the projected interacting theory beyond strict adiabaticity. The leading dynamics is governed by a $U(1)$ Berry connection whose flux is set by the skyrmion density, while controlled non-adiabatic corrections are fixed by the texture's real-space quantum geometric tensor. In a Landau-level representation built from the averaged emergent field, moiré-periodic modulations induce Umklapp-resolved deformations of Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman kinematics and microscopic sources of excess optical quantum weight above the topological lower bound. Assuming a gapped Hall phase, we further derive a skyrmion-crystal effective field theory with a universal Berry-phase term and a noncommutative magnetophonon. Our results provide experimentally accessible signatures for twisted transition-metal dichalcogenide homobilayers and rhombohedral graphene aligned with hexagonal boron nitride."

Through a combination of early and late fusion, TouchFusion enables stateful touch detection on both environmental and body surfaces, simple surface gestures, and tracking functionality for contextually adaptive interfaces as well as basic trackpad-like interactions. We validate our approach on a dataset of 100 participants, significantly exceeding the population size of typical wearable sensing studies to capture a wider variance of wrist anatomies, skin conductivities, and behavioral patterns. We show that TouchFusion can enable several common touch interaction tasks. Using TouchFusion, a wearer can summon a trackpad on any surface, control contextually adaptive interfaces based on where they tap, or use their palm as an always-available touch surface. When paired with smart glasses or augmented reality devices, TouchFusion enables a ubiquitous, contextually adaptive interaction model."

    "abstract": "News recommendation plays a critical role in online news platforms by helping users discover relevant content. Cross-domain news recommendation further requires inferring user's underlying information needs from heterogeneous signals that often extend beyond direct news consumption. A key challenge lies in moving beyond surface-level behaviors to capture deeper, reusable user interests while maintaining scalability in large-scale production systems. In this paper, we present a reinforcement learning framework that trains large language models to generate high-quality lists of interest-driven news search queries from cross-domain user signals. We formulate query-list generation as a policy optimization problem and employ GRPO with multiple reward signals. We systematically study two compute dimensions: inference-time sampling and model capacity, and empirically observe consistent improvements with increased compute that exhibit scaling-like behavior. Finally, we perform on-policy distillation to transfer the learned policy from a large, compute-intensive teacher to a compact student model suitable for scalable deployment. Extensive offline experiments, ablation studies and large-scale online A/B tests in a production news recommendation system demonstrate consistent gains in both interest modeling quality and downstream recommendation performance."

We demonstrate that stacking order is an effective control knob for cross-plane phonon transport in multilayer Rhenium Disulfide (ReS2). Thickness-dependent thermal conductivity measurements reveal remarkably long cross-plane phonon mean free paths (MFPs) (>= 200-300 nm) and provide a direct experimental observation of the transition from quasi-ballistic transport to a thickness-independent ballistic limit. AA stacking exhibits nearly double the cross-plane thermal conductivity of AB stacking, driven by longer acoustic phonon lifetimes from a more \"coherent\" interlayer registry. Integrated deep neural-network molecular dynamics reveals that phonon filtering in ReS2 is fundamentally frequency-selective: weak vdW coupling acts as a low-pass filter, whereas stronger coupling broadens the transmission passband. These results establish ReS2 as a model system where stacking order and interlayer coupling can be engineered to tune heat conduction across diffusive, quasi-ballistic, and ballistic regimes, offering a new framework for thermal management in 2D electronics."

    "abstract": "Frontier LLMs are safeguarded against attempts to extract harmful information via adversarial prompts known as \"jailbreaks\". Recently, defenders have developed classifier-based systems that have survived thousands of hours of human red teaming. We introduce Boundary Point Jailbreaking (BPJ), a new class of automated jailbreak attacks that evade the strongest industry-deployed safeguards. Unlike previous attacks that rely on white/grey-box assumptions (such as classifier scores or gradients) or libraries of existing jailbreaks, BPJ is fully black-box and uses only a single bit of information per query: whether or not the classifier flags the interaction. To achieve this, BPJ addresses the core difficulty in optimising attacks against robust real-world defences: evaluating whether a proposed modification to an attack is an improvement. Instead of directly trying to learn an attack for a target harmful string, BPJ converts the string into a curriculum of intermediate attack targets and then actively selects evaluation points that best detect small changes in attack strength (\"boundary points\"). We believe BPJ is the first fully automated attack algorithm that succeeds in developing universal jailbreaks against Constitutional Classifiers, as well as the first automated attack algorithm that succeeds against GPT-5's input classifier without relying on human attack seeds. BPJ is difficult to defend against in individual interactions but incurs many flags during optimisation, suggesting that effective defence requires supplementing single-interaction methods with batch-level monitoring."

Thermal sensing plays a critical role in settings where visible light fails, including nighttime surveillance, search and rescue, autonomous driving, and medical screening. Unlike RGB imagery, thermal images encode physical temperature rather than color or texture, requiring perceptual and reasoning capabilities that existing RGB-centric benchmarks do not evaluate. We introduce ThermEval-B, a structured benchmark of approximately 55,000 thermal visual question answering pairs designed to assess the foundational primitives required for thermal vision language understanding. ThermEval-B integrates public datasets with our newly collected ThermEval-D, the first dataset to provide dense per-pixel temperature maps with semantic body-part annotations across diverse indoor and outdoor environments. Evaluating 25 open-source and closed-source VLMs, we find that models consistently fail at temperature-grounded reasoning, degrade under colormap transformations, and default to language priors or fixed responses, with only marginal gains from prompting or supervised fine-tuning. These results demonstrate that thermal understanding requires dedicated evaluation beyond RGB-centric assumptions, positioning ThermEval as a benchmark to drive progress in thermal vision language modeling."

We propose a profile estimating-equation approach based on spline approximation of the unknown link function and construct a subject-level block empirical likelihood (BEL) for joint inference on the parametric coefficients and the single-index direction. The resulting BEL ratio statistic enjoys a Wilks-type chi-square limit, yielding likelihood-free confidence regions without explicit sandwich variance estimation. We also discuss practical implementation, including constrained optimization for the index parameter, working-correlation choices, and bootstrap-based confidence bands for the nonparametric component. Simulation studies and an application to the epilepsy longitudinal study illustrate the finite-sample performance."

While previous work mostly dealt with convex losses, our approach assumes general (non-convex) losses hence covering classical, yet poorly understood examples such as the perceptron and non-convex robust regression. We use the Kac-Rice formula to control the asymptotics of the expected number of local minima of the empirical risk, under the proportional asymptotics $n,d\\to\\infty$, $n/d\\toα>1$. Specifically, we prove a finite dimensional variational formula for the exponential growth rate of the expected number of local minima. Further we provide sufficient conditions under which the exponential growth rate vanishes and all empirical risk minimizers have the same asymptotic properties (in fact, we expect the minimizer to be unique in these circumstances). We refer to this phenomenon as `rate trivialization.' If the population risk has a unique minimizer, our sufficient condition for rate trivialization is typically verified when the samples/parameters ratio $α$ is larger than a suitable constant $α_{\\star}$. Previous general results of this type required $n\\ge Cd \\log d$. We illustrate our results in the case of non-convex robust regression.

The first player in this order is the initial champ, and faces the next player. The outcome of each match decides the current champion, who faces the next player in the order. Each player also has a popularity, and the value of each match is the popularity of the winner. Value maximization in tournaments has been previously studied when each match has a deterministic outcome. However, match outcomes are often probabilistic, rather than deterministic. We study robust value maximization in Challenge the Champ tournaments, when the winner of a match may be probabilistic. That is, we seek to maximize the total value that is obtained, irrespective of the outcome of probabilistic matches. We show that even in simple binary settings, for non-adaptive algorithms, the optimal robust value -- which we term the \\textsc{VnaR}, or the value not at risk -- is hard to approximate. However, if we allow adaptive algorithms that determine the order of challengers based on the outcomes of previous matches, or restrict the matches with probabilistic outcomes, we can obtain good approximations to the optimal \\textsc{VnaR}."

Using tools from domain adaptation, we derive a lower bound on target coverage in terms of the source-domain loss of the classifier and a Wasserstein measure of the shift. Using this result, we provide a method to design pseudo-calibrated sets that inflate the conformal threshold by a slack parameter to keep target coverage above a prescribed level. Finally, we propose a source-tuned pseudo-calibration algorithm that interpolates between hard pseudo-labels and randomized labels as a function of classifier uncertainty.

    "abstract": "Models of High-level Computation (MHCs) provide effective means to describe complex real-world computing systems because they offer formal foundations for the specification of interacting computing devices, as opposed to describing individual ones, which has been the focus of classical models such as Turing machines or the lambda calculus. Despite numerous proposals over the past half century, there is still no canonical MHC akin to Turing machines for (compositionally) reasoning about computation in the large. One of the major drawbacks of current MHCs is that they extensively neglect control flow, a well-know semantic property that defines computation order. Only a few MHCs treat control explicitly at the expense of assuming that data follows control. Mixing such dimensions within the same framework leads to inefficient methods for formal analysis and verification. To address this, the computon model has recently emerged as a category-theoretic MHC that separates data and control and makes control explicit by supporting composition operators characterised as finite colimit constructions. Such constructions allow the formation of sequential, parallel, branching and iterative computing devices. Unfortunately, the computon model is still a generic reference rather than a concrete realisation. In this paper, we provide a variation of it to enable functional computing devices, introduce a new branching operator, discuss how to define synchronous parallelising out of sequencing and asynchronous parallelising, describe concrete operational semantics for computon execution and provide the first implementation of the model. The implementation yields an open-source programming environment that realises the underlying categorical semantics. This tool is publicly available and ready to build complex computing devices that are structurally correct by construction."

    "abstract": "We report the low temperature growth of vertically aligned ZnO nanocolumns on Si substrates by using reactive radio frequency magnetron sputtering.High sputtering pressure combined with low substrate temperatures induce a pronounced self shadowing effect,leading to the formation of isolated nanocolumns. In contrast, lower sputtering pressure promotes void filling in deposited films, favouring the growth of dense, low roughness columnar films. Modification of native SiOx on Si surfaces via substrate preheating prior to deposition, alters the initial nucleation stage, thereby determining dominant polarity and morphology of ZnO nanostructures. O polar columnar films and nanocolumns exhibit higher effective piezoelectric coefficient, corresponding to their higher differential resistance and reduced dielectric loss, suggesting suppressed carrier induced screening of piezoelectric charges. This low thermal budget, scalable sputtering approach provides an alternative route for integrating ZnO nanostructures onto thermal constrained substrates, including those used in flexible and wearable electronics."

So far, studies on the electronic structure of transition metal dipnictides have focused on their overall electronic structure and the bulk open-orbit Fermi surfaces. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, density functional theory calculations, and transport measurements, we distinguish the intertwined bulk and surface states on the weakly topological $(20\\bar{1})$ plane of TaSb$_2$. We identify multiple electron- and hole-like bulk bands, yielding a near-perfect carrier compensation. Crucially, we observe open-orbit FSs parallel to $\\bar{L}$-$\\bar{Y}$ direction that are entirely of surface origin. Circular-dichroism ARPES reveals $k \\rightarrow -k$ spectral reversal, indicating spin-momentum locking and the topological nature of these surface states. Consistent with this, magnetotransport measurements display weak antilocalization, establishing TaSb$_2$ as a platform for spin-polarized topological transport on a weakly topological surface."

Furthermore, numerical simulations indicate a reversal of this behavior due to the insertion of disorder in the walker's step lengths. Additionally, we demonstrate that in the presence of an absorber, there is a speed-up in the spreading rate, and that a disordered quantum walk that is sub-ballistic regains the ballistic spreading of a clean quantum walk."

The pulsar is known to show one of the largest spin-up rates ($\\sim 9.6 \\times 10^{-8}$ s s$^{-1}$) among the ULXP population. We explore the surface magnetic field of the neutron star in this source using different models, and find that the inferred magnetic field lies in the range of about $0.3-2 \\times 10^{14}$G. We study the long-term magnetic field and spin period evolution of the pulsar assuming steady accretion using prevalent theoretical mechanisms and find that the pulsar will evolve to become a millisecond pulsar having decayed magnetic field of about $\\sim 10^{9}$G in about a million years. The scenario of the formation of a millisecond pulsar is also probed using an estimate of the super-Eddington duty cycle of about 14% from the literature, which suggests that the neutron star would accrete sufficient matter to become a recycled millisecond pulsar. Exploring the magnetic field as well as the spin period evolution properties of ULXPs may enable us to understand the poorly understood evolutionary features of ULXPs, shed light on one of the pathways of millisecond pulsar formation and also help us to understand transient super-Eddington accretion phases in newborn magnetars, which are believed to power energetic events such as long gamma-ray bursts and Type I superluminous supernovae."

Compared to isolated galaxies, close pairs exhibit a significantly reduced bar fraction at projected separations within 25 kpc. This reduction is driven almost entirely by systems showing clear merger or disturbance signatures, indicating that tidal interactions suppress bars. The decline is dominated by a decrease in weak bars, while the fraction of strong bars remains largely unchanged. Bar suppression is primarily associated with major mergers and is strongest in massive host galaxies. A weaker but statistically significant suppression is detected in minor mergers only for massive galaxies with small bulges. In contrast, no significant dependence of bar suppression on the relative orientation between pair members is found. These findings provide observational evidence that tidal perturbations in major mergers play a key role in regulating bar evolution."

We study a minimal gauged $U(1)$ dark sector containing a dark Higgs and a dark photon, optionally supplemented by a vectorlike dark fermion, coupled to the Standard Model through Higgs portal or kinetic mixing. Using the Nielsen identity together with a controlled derivative expansion and power counting, we construct a gauge-independent effective action in the high- and low-temperature limits, enabling model-intrinsic nucleation dynamics and robust gravitational wave predictions. We perform dedicated Monte Carlo scans in both limits and map viable microscopic parameters to detector-facing peak frequencies and amplitudes, spanning bands relevant to pulsar timing arrays and planned space-based interferometers. In our scans, supercooled transitions typically produce the strongest signals, whereas parametrically high-temperature transitions are comparatively rare and tend to be weak. We further connect the phase transition phenomenology to viable dark matter candidates within the same minimal field content, providing benchmark targets for dark photon dark matter and dark fermion dark matter, and highlighting their complementarity with gravitational wave observables. Overall, our results provide an end-to-end, gauge-independent pipeline from a minimal hidden sector Lagrangian to gravitational wave spectra and cosmologically viable dark matter benchmarks, yielding the most reliable and concrete predictions to date for a minimal gauged $U(1)$ dark sector."

    "abstract": "Effective representations of protein sequences are widely recognized as a cornerstone of machine learning-based protein design. Yet, protein bioengineering poses unique challenges for sequence representation, as experimental datasets typically feature few mutations, which are either sparsely distributed across the entire sequence or densely concentrated within localized regions. This limits the ability of sequence-level representations to extract functionally meaningful signals. In addition, comprehensive comparative studies remain scarce, despite their crucial role in clarifying which representations best encode relevant information and ultimately support superior predictive performance. In this study, we systematically evaluate multiple ProtBERT and ESM2 embedding variants as sequence representations, using the adeno-associated virus capsid as a case study and prototypical example of bioengineering, where functional optimization is targeted through highly localized sequence variation within an otherwise large protein. Our results reveal that, prior to fine-tuning, amino acid-level embeddings outperform sequence-level representations in supervised predictive tasks, whereas the latter tend to be more effective in unsupervised settings. However, optimal performance is only achieved when embeddings are fine-tuned with task-specific labels, with sequence-level representations providing the best performance. Moreover, our findings indicate that the extent of sequence variation required to produce notable shifts in sequence representations exceeds what is typically explored in bioengineering studies, showing the need for fine-tuning in datasets characterized by sparse or highly localized mutations."

    "abstract": "Portfolio optimization under strict cardinality constraints is a combinatorial challenge that defies classical convex optimization techniques, particularly in the context of \"Direct Indexing\" and ESG-constrained mandates. In the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) offers a promising hybrid approach. However, standard QAOA implementations utilizing transverse field mixers often fail to strictly enforce hard constraints, necessitating soft penalties that distort the energy landscape. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of a constraint-preserving QAOA formulation against Simulated Annealing (SA) and Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP). We implement a specific QAOA ansatz utilizing a Dicke state initialization and an XY-mixer Hamiltonian that strictly preserves the Hamming weight of the solution, ensuring only valid portfolios of size K are explored. Furthermore, we introduce a Trotterized parameter initialization schedule inspired by adiabatic quantum computing to mitigate the \"Barren Plateau\" problem. Backtesting on a basket of 10 US equities over 2025 reveals that our QAOA approach achieves a Sharpe Ratio of 1.81, significantly outperforming Simulated Annealing (1.31) and HRP (0.98). We further analyze the operational implications of the algorithm's high turnover (76.8%), discussing the trade-offs between theoretical optimality and implementation costs in institutional settings."

    "abstract": "Multi-Source Bayesian Optimization (MSBO) serves as a variant of the traditional Bayesian Optimization (BO) framework applicable to situations involving optimization of an objective black-box function over multiple information sources such as simulations, surrogate models, or real-world experiments. However, traditional MSBO assumes the input variables of the objective function to be independent and identically distributed, limiting its effectiveness in scenarios where causal information is available and interventions can be performed, such as clinical trials or policy-making. In the single-source domain, Causal Bayesian Optimization (CBO) extends standard BO with the principles of causality, enabling better modeling of variable dependencies. This leads to more accurate optimization, improved decision-making, and more efficient use of low-cost information sources. In this article, we propose a principled integration of the MSBO and CBO methodologies in the multi-source domain, leveraging the strengths of both to enhance optimization efficiency and reduce computational complexity in higher-dimensional problems. We present the theoretical foundations of both Causal and Multi-Source Bayesian Optimization, and demonstrate how their synergy informs our Multi-Source Causal Bayesian Optimization (MSCBO) algorithm. We compare the performance of MSCBO against its foundational counterparts for both synthetic and real-world datasets with varying levels of noise, highlighting the robustness and applicability of MSCBO. Based on our findings, we conclude that integrating MSBO with the causality principles of CBO facilitates dimensionality reduction and lowers operational costs, ultimately improving convergence speed, performance, and scalability."

    "abstract": "Breaking long documents into smaller segments is a fundamental challenge in information retrieval. Whether for search engines, question-answering systems, or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), effective segmentation determines how well systems can locate and return relevant information. However, traditional methods, such as fixed-length or coherence-based segmentation, ignore user intent, leading to chunks that split answers or contain irrelevant noise. We introduce Intent-Driven Dynamic Chunking (IDC), a novel approach that uses predicted user queries to guide document segmentation. IDC leverages a Large Language Model to generate likely user intents for a document and then employs a dynamic programming algorithm to find the globally optimal chunk boundaries. This represents a novel application of DP to intent-aware segmentation that avoids greedy pitfalls. We evaluated IDC on six diverse question-answering datasets, including news articles, Wikipedia, academic papers, and technical documentation. IDC outperformed traditional chunking strategies on five datasets, improving top-1 retrieval accuracy by 5% to 67%, and matched the best baseline on the sixth. Additionally, IDC produced 40-60% fewer chunks than baseline methods while achieving 93-100% answer coverage. These results demonstrate that aligning document structure with anticipated information needs significantly boosts retrieval performance, particularly for long and heterogeneous documents."

We study the sharp detection threshold, namely the highest dimension at which an RGG can be distinguished from its Erdős--Rényi counterpart with the same edge density. For dense graphs, we show that for smooth kernels the critical scaling is $d = n^{3/4}$, substantially lower than the threshold $d = n^3$ known for the hard RGG with step-function kernels \\cite{bubeck2016testing}. We further extend our results to kernels whose signal-to-noise ratio scales with $n$, and formulate a unifying conjecture that the critical dimension is determined by $n^3 \\mathop{\\rm tr}^2(κ^3) = 1$, where $κ$ is the standardized kernel operator on the sphere. Departing from the prevailing approach of bounding the Kullback-Leibler divergence by successively exposing latent points, which breaks down in the sublinear regime of $d=o(n)$, our key technical contribution is a careful analysis of the posterior distribution of the latent points given the observed graph, in particular, the overlap between two independent posterior samples. As a by-product, we establish that $d=\\sqrt{n}$ is the critical dimension for non-trivial estimation of the latent vectors up to a global rotation."

A striking example is the emergence of simple geometric structures in LLM representations: for example, calendar months organize into a circle, years form a smooth one-dimensional manifold, and cities' latitudes and longitudes can be decoded by a linear probe. We show that the statistics of language exhibit a translation symmetry -- e.g., the co-occurrence probability of two months depends only on the time interval between them -- and we prove that the latter governs the aforementioned geometric structures in high-dimensional word embedding models. Moreover, we find that these structures persist even when the co-occurrence statistics are strongly perturbed (for example, by removing all sentences in which two months appear together) and at moderate embedding dimension. We show that this robustness naturally emerges if the co-occurrence statistics are collectively controlled by an underlying continuous latent variable. We empirically validate this theoretical framework in word embedding models, text embedding models, and large language models."

An important input for tuning the injection beam is the position reading from a dedicated beam position monitor (BPM), located after the septum magnets, slightly upstream of where the injected and stored beams converge. Previously, the readout electronics used for these special BPMs were not capable of independent measurement of both bunches in the two-bunch injection mode and modification of the concerned devices and their firmware was not feasible. The opportunity was taken to develop a new readout device based on the AMD/Xilinx RF System on a Chip (RFSoC) platform with the goal of not only providing a sufficiently flexible and performant readout solution for the concerned BPMs, but also to evaluate and gain experience with the platform for beam monitor electronics applications. This paper is concerned with the details of this development as well as evaluation and operation of the developed device."

Given that phenomenological parametrisations of the equation-of-state parameter $w(a)$ with a sharp transitional feature fit the data well, we study the realisation of such models in quintessence. In the late Universe, the quintessence field begins to oscillate abruptly, changing the behaviour of $w$. Naturally, such a model entails tachyonic instability, and particle production modifies $w$. We perform numerical lattice simulations to study the time dependence of $w$. In addition, the violent particle production produces significant density perturbations and the stochastic gravitational-wave background, whose characteristic scale depends on the mass scale of the quintessence around the minimum of the potential. We discuss the observability of these late-time cosmological signals through cosmic microwave background, quasar astrometry, pulsar timing arrays, and other observational probes."

This paper explores methods that use data resulting from processes with conditionally repeated biomarker measurement to decompose the variation in observed measurements of a continuous biomarker into population variability and variability arising from the measurement procedure. We present two frequentist approaches with analytical solutions, but these approaches perform poorly in a dataset of conditionally repeated blood donor hemoglobin measurements where normality assumptions are not met. We then develop a Bayesian hierarchical framework that allows for different distributional assumptions, which we apply to the blood donor hemoglobin dataset. Using a Bayesian hierarchical model that assumes normally distributed population hemoglobin and heavy tailed $t$-distributed measurement variation, we found that the total measurement variation accounted for 22\\% of the total variance among females and 25\\% among males, with population standard deviations of $1.07\\, \\rm g/dL$ for female donors and $1.28\\, \\rm g/dL$ for male donors.

In this work, we present a detailed analysis of the exchange-coupled donor system in the parallel nuclear regime and propose a physical mechanism for this effect. We attribute the enhanced readout contrast to an additional electron tunneling event to the SET during a single read period, when the donor nuclei are aligned in a parallel spin configuration. These insights inform strategies for improving electron readout fidelity in these systems and contribute to a more complete understanding of spin-dependent tunnelling processes in donor-based qubit architectures."

High-resolution transmission electron microscopy and elemental mapping confirmed structural integrity, while Geometric Phase Analysis and Raman spectroscopy provided quantitative insights into strain variations driven by core and shell dimensions. Furthermore, polarization resolved $μ$-Raman measurements allowed us to quantify the longitudinal and transverse phonon mode splitting as a function of strain in the Ge core. The strain dependent electronic properties were investigated by hole mobility measurements. Finally, we observe a record high hole mobility of 25,500 cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$, underscoring the potential of these core/shell nanowire structures for the realization of high-fidelity spin qubits. Our findings highlight the critical role of geometry in strain tuning and provide valuable design guidelines for optimizing Ge/Si nanowires in scalable quantum device architectures."

However, their computational cost is a major bottleneck, as they are often designed to inefficiently process the full video context regardless of the inpainting mask's size, even for sparse, localized edits. In this paper, we introduce EditCtrl, an efficient video inpainting control framework that focuses computation only where it is needed. Our approach features a novel local video context module that operates solely on masked tokens, yielding a computational cost proportional to the edit size. This local-first generation is then guided by a lightweight temporal global context embedder that ensures video-wide context consistency with minimal overhead. Not only is EditCtrl 10 times more compute efficient than state-of-the-art generative editing methods, it even improves editing quality compared to methods designed with full-attention. Finally, we showcase how EditCtrl unlocks new capabilities, including multi-region editing with text prompts and autoregressive content propagation."

    "abstract": "Long-period radio transients (LPTs) are a new class of radio sources characterized by long spin periods ($P_{\\text{spin}}>10^3$ s) and highly variable radio emission. While known magnetars are relatively young ($τ<10^5$ yrs) with spin periods clustered between $1-10$ sec, it has been proposed that LPTs may be linked to a missing population of older magnetars. In this paper, we present an extensive parametric analysis of isolated magnetar spin evolution using various propeller spin-down models. In general, at higher initial magnetar B-fields ($B_0>\\sim10^{15}$ G) and larger ambient densities ($n_0>\\sim10^2$ cm$^{-3}$), magnetars will transition to the propeller phase earlier, and they start accreting gas from the ISM or molecular clouds after $τ\\sim10^8$ yrs. We found that a transition from the pulsar to the propeller phase is required to reach the observed LPT period range of $P>10^3$ s. More specifically, our population synthesis study based on Monte-Carlo simulations shows that two propeller models can account for most of the observed LPT periods ($P\\sim1-400$ [min]) and their period derivative constraints ($\\dot{P}<10^{-9}$ s s$^{-1}$). Our spin-down models predict that (1) nearby radio-quiet neutron stars with the estimated dipole $B$-field range of $B\\sim(1-5)\\times10^{13}$ G will transition to the propeller phase eventually after $τ>\\sim10^7$ yrs; (2) thermal X-ray emission from accretion-phase magnetars becomes too faint for detection after traveling ($d>\\sim10$ kpc) from their birth places; (3) sporadic radio outbursts observed from LPTs may not be explained by regular radio pulsar and magnetar emission mechanisms that operate during the propeller phase."

We present a 0.30 m/pixel digital elevation model (DEM) of the Chandrayaan-3 Vikram landing site using a fully open workflow based on ISIS, the Ames Stereo Pipeline, and ALE, achieving sub-meter resolution comparable to mission-reported products. The reconstruction covers 2.18 x 2.24 km with 91.2% valid pixel coverage, 8.1 cm median triangulation error, and 40-50 cm relative vertical precision. The Vikram lander and Pragyan rover are individually resolved. Geodetic alignment to an LROC NAC stereo DEM achieves approximately 30 m horizontal accuracy; pixel-wise validation at 3 m resolution confirms negligible vertical bias (median dz = +0.28 m) and robust dispersion (NMAD = 2.88 m). Stable OHRC stereo convergence requires Community Sensor Model (CSM) camera models; the legacy ISIS camera model failed across two independent sites. At 0.30 m, these DEMs complement LROC NAC DTMs (approximately 1 m), resolving sub-meter hazards below the NAC detection threshold. Applied to the extensive OHRC south polar archive, this methodology provides independent capability for hazard mapping and landing site analysis for upcoming missions including Chandrayaan-4, LUPEX, and Artemis."

Enabling real-time localization in large-scale multi-static deployments with thousands of devices require highly efficient algorithms for estimating key parameters such as range and angle of arrival (AoA), and for fusing these parameters into location estimates. We propose two low-complexity algorithms, Joint Range-Angle Clustering (JRAC) and Stage-wise Range-Angle Estimation (SRAE). Both deliver range and angle estimation accuracy comparable to FFT- and subspace-based baselines while significantly reducing the computation. We then introduce two real-time localization algorithms that fuse the estimated ranges and AoAs: a maximum-likelihood (ML) method solved via gradient search and an iterative re-weighted least squares (IRLS) method. Both achieve localization accuracy comparable to ML-based brute force search albeit with far lower complexity. Experiments on a real-world large-scale multi-static testbed with 4 illuminators, 1 multi-antenna receiver, and 100 tags show that JRAC and SRAE reduce runtime by up to 40X and IRLS achieves up to 500X reduction over ML-based brute force search without degrading localization accuracy. The proposed methods achieve 3 m median localization error across all 100 tags in a sub-6GHz band with 40 MHz bandwidth. These results demonstrate that multi-static range-angle estimation and localization algorithms can make real-time, scalable backscatter localization practical for next-generation ambient IoT networks."

Our model fully accounts for the Coulomb interaction between all particles, except for the Coulomb repulsion between bound electrons which is replaced by effective potentials. This replacement overcomes the hurdle of artificial autoinization. In addition, the multielectron motion is treated on an equal footing with nuclear motion, that is, electrons and nuclei are both allowed to move at the same time. We focus on triple and double ionization as well as frustrated triple and double ionization. For these processes, we identify and explain the main features of the sum of the kinetic energies of the final ion fragments resulting from the break-up of O$_{2}^+$. We also describe a physical mechanism that underlies frustrated triple ionization."

We found that the HeII emission line formation region is not eclipsed and is significantly larger than both the donor star and the photosphere of the supercritical accretion disk. The HeII radial velocity curve was found to be independent of the precessional phase and inconsistent with the photometric curve. These findings suggest that the HeII line does not reflect the orbital motion of the compact object. Therefore, spectroscopic estimates of the masses of the components in SS433 based on the HeII emission line can be unrealistic."

    "abstract": "Articulated objects are central to interactive 3D applications, including embodied AI, robotics, and VR/AR, where functional part decomposition and kinematic motion are essential. Yet producing high-fidelity articulated assets remains difficult to scale because it requires reliable part decomposition and kinematic rigging. Existing approaches largely fall into two paradigms: optimization-based reconstruction or distillation, which can be accurate but often takes tens of minutes to hours per instance, and inference-time methods that rely on template or part retrieval, producing plausible results that may not match the specific structure and appearance in the input observation. We introduce a part-centric generative framework for articulated object creation that synthesizes part geometry, composition, and articulation under explicit part-aware conditioning. Our representation models an object as a set of movable parts, each encoded by latent tokens augmented with part identity and articulation cues. Conditioned on a single image, the model generates articulated 3D assets that preserve instance-level correspondence while maintaining valid part structure and motion. The resulting approach avoids per-instance optimization, enables fast feed-forward inference, and supports controllable assembly and articulation, which are important for embodied interaction. Experiments on common articulated categories (e.g., drawers and doors) show improved input consistency, part accuracy, and articulation plausibility over optimization-based and retrieval-driven baselines, while substantially reducing inference time."

We analyze the mechanisms by which the magnetoelastic couplings renormalize the critical temperature and modify the phonon spectrum. The magnetoelastic feeback can also alter fundamentally the nature of the phase transition. Specifically, on the square lattice, the transition shifts from continuous to weakly first-order (discontinuous) beyond a critical magnetoelastic coupling threshold. Conversely, on the triangular lattice, the transition remains discontinuous regardless of coupling strength."

    "abstract": "Spectral distortion anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) provide a new probe of the early Universe that can be accessed using traditional CMB imaging techniques. It is possible to compute the creation and evolution of anisotropic signals for various scenarios using the frequency hierarchy method recently developed for CosmoTherm. However, the current treatment is not perfect and some approximations had to be made. Here, we carefully construct a modified form for the evolution equations that has the full equilibrium solutions built into the formulation. We improve the formalism to account for i) additional stimulated scattering effects, ii) kinematic corrections to the thermalization terms, iii) corrections to the standard perturbation variables and iv) direct photon sources. These effect could not be captured with the original formulation of the frequency hierarchy method but are indeed important for cleanly separating real distortions from temperature signals. However, we show that previous results are not altered significantly when compared to the improved formulation presented here. As a new worked example, which could indeed not be treated before, we also illustrate how possible changes in the temperature-redshift relation would create spectral distortion anisotropies in the pre-recombination era. The theoretical methods presented here are also an important step towards being able to consistently predict the CMB spectral distortion anisotropies in photon-dark photon and photon-axion conversion scenarios."

    "abstract": "We initiate the study of distortion in stable matching. Concretely, we aim to design algorithms that have limited access to the agents' cardinal preferences and compute stable matchings of high quality with respect to some aggregate objective, e.g., the social welfare. Our first result is a strong impossibility: the classic Deferred Acceptance (DA) algorithm of Gale and Shapley [1962], as well as any deterministic algorithm that relies solely on ordinal information about the agents' preferences, has unbounded distortion. To circumvent this impossibility, we consider algorithms that either (a) use randomization or (b) perform a small number of value queries to the agents' cardinal preferences. In the former case, we prove that a simple randomized version of the DA algorithm achieves a distortion of $2$, and that this is optimal among all randomized stable matching algorithms. For the latter case, we prove that the same bound of $2$ can be achieved with only $1$ query per agent, and improving upon this bound requires $Ω(\\log n)$ queries per agent. We further show that this query bound is asymptotically optimal for any constant approximation: for any $\\varepsilon >0$, there exists an algorithm which uses $O(\\log n /\\varepsilon^2)$ queries, and achieves a distortion of $1+\\varepsilon$. Moreover, under natural structural restrictions on the instances of the problem, we provide improved upper bounds on the number of queries required for a $(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximation. We complement our main findings above with theoretical and empirical results on the average-case performance of stable matching algorithms, when the preferences of the agents are drawn i.i.d. from a given distribution."

However, relying on these models introduces substantial computational and energy requirements, leading to increasing attention toward their environmental cost and the sustainability of large-scale deployments. While neural IR models deliver high retrieval effectiveness, their scalability is constrained in multi-domain scenarios, where training and maintaining domain-specific models is inefficient and achieving robust cross-domain generalisation within a unified model remains difficult. This paper introduces DRAMA (Domain Retrieval using Adaptive Module Allocation), an energy- and parameter-efficient framework designed to reduce the environmental footprint of neural retrieval. DRAMA integrates domain-specific adapter modules with a dynamic gating mechanism that selects the most relevant domain knowledge for each query. New domains can be added efficiently through lightweight adapter training, avoiding full model retraining. We evaluate DRAMA on multiple Web retrieval benchmarks covering different domains. Our extensive evaluation shows that DRAMA achieves comparable effectiveness to domain-specific models while using only a fraction of their parameters and computational resources. These findings show that energy-aware model design can significantly improve scalability and sustainability in neural IR."

Our contributions are threefold: (i) a reference-based plan evaluation framework operating in two modes - a metric-wise evaluator spanning seven dimensions (e.g., tool-prompt alignment, query adherence) and a one-shot evaluator; (ii) a data curation methodology that iteratively refines plans via an evaluator->optimizer loop to produce high-quality plan lineages (ordered plan revisions) while reducing manual effort; and (iii) a large-scale study of 14 LLMs across sizes and families for their ability to decompose queries into step-by-step, executable, and tool-assigned plans, evaluated under prompts with and without lineage. Empirically, LLMs struggle on compound queries and on plans exceeding 4 steps (typically 5-15); the best total metric score reaches 84.8% (Claude-3-7-Sonnet), while the strongest one-shot match rate at the \"A+\" tier (Extremely Good, Very Good) is only 49.75% (o3-mini). Plan lineage yields mixed gains overall but benefits several top models and improves step executability for many. Our results highlight persistent gaps in tool-understanding, especially in tool-prompt alignment and tool-usage completeness, and show that shorter, simpler plans are markedly easier.

Earlier work has aimed to alleviate this problem by incorporating additional objectives that target local guarantees over contiguous subintervals. Empirical evaluation of these proposals is, however, scarce. In this article, we consider an alternative procedure that achieves local adaptivity by replacing one part of the multi-objective learning method with an adaptive online algorithm. Empirical evaluations on datasets from energy forecasting and algorithmic fairness show that our proposed method improves upon existing approaches and achieves unbiased predictions over subgroups, while remaining robust under distribution shift."

They capture, among others, two-player zero-sum games, robust and distributionally robust optimization, and adversarial machine learning. This study focuses on the subclass whose variables lie in the completely positive (CP) cone, capturing a broad family of mixed-binary quadratic max-min problems through the modelling power of completely positive programming. We show that such problems admit an equivalent single-stage linear reformulation over the COP-CP cone, defined as the Cartesian product of the copositive (COP) and CP cones. Because testing membership in COP cones is co-NP-complete, the resulting COP-CP program inherits NP-hardness. To address this challenge, we develop a hierarchy of semidefinite relaxations based on moment and sum-of-squares representations of the COP and CP cones, and flat truncation conditions are applied to certify the tightness. We show that the tightness of the hierarchy is guaranteed under mild conditions. The framework extends existing CP/COP approaches for distributionally robust optimization and polynomial games. We apply the framework to the cyclic Colonel Blotto game, an extension of Borel's classic allocation contest. Across multiple instances, the semidefinite relaxation meets the flat-truncation conditions and solves the exact mixed-strategy equilibrium."

In contrast, efficient empirical heuristics often exploit the forget samples (e.g., via gradient ascent) but come with no formal unlearning guarantees. We bridge this gap by presenting the Variance-Reduced Unlearning (VRU) algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, VRU is the first first-order algorithm that directly includes forget set gradients in its update rule, while provably satisfying ($(\\varepsilon,δ)-$unlearning. We establish the convergence of VRU and show that incorporating the forget set yields strictly improved rates, i.e. a better dependence on the achieved error compared to existing first-order $(\\varepsilon,δ)-$unlearning methods. Moreover, we prove that, in a low-error regime, VRU asymptotically outperforms any first-order method that ignores the forget set.Experiments corroborate our theory, showing consistent gains over both state-of-the-art certified unlearning methods and over empirical baselines that explicitly leverage the forget set."

Ru-deficient SRO thin films grown by radio-frequency high oxygen pressure sputtering were investigated using a combination of X-ray reflectivity, polarized neutron reflectometry, off-specular neutron scattering, scanning transmission electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, electrical transport, and magnetometry. Structural and compositional analyses reveal that Ru deficiency is intrinsic to the films, with an enhanced deficiency at the interfaces. As a result, coherent electronic transport is suppressed and the saturation magnetization is reduced, while the Curie temperature remains largely unaffected, placing Ru-deficient SRO in a regime consistent with ferromagnetic insulator-like behavior. Depth- and lateral-resolved magnetic measurements further show that the interfacial regions remain ferromagnetic but exhibit enhanced perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, which constrains the local magnetization to remain predominantly out-of-plane and strongly reduces its in-plane projection. Our results establish Ru deficiency as a key control parameter governing transport, magnetization, and anisotropy in SRO thin films and highlight defect and interface engineering as powerful routes to tailor interfacial magnetism in correlated oxide heterostructures."

    "abstract": "We extend the Prometheus framework for unsupervised phase transition discovery from 2D classical systems to 3D classical and quantum many-body systems, addressing scalability in higher dimensions and generalization to quantum fluctuations. For the 3D Ising model ($L \\leq 32$), the framework detects the critical temperature within 0.01\\% of literature values ($T_c/J = 4.511 \\pm 0.005$) and extracts critical exponents with $\\geq 70\\%$ accuracy ($β= 0.328 \\pm 0.015$, $γ= 1.24 \\pm 0.06$, $ν= 0.632 \\pm 0.025$), correctly identifying the 3D Ising universality class via $χ^2$ comparison ($p = 0.72$) without analytical guidance. For quantum systems, we developed quantum-aware VAE (Q-VAE) architectures using complex-valued wavefunctions and fidelity-based loss. Applied to the transverse field Ising model, we achieve 2\\% accuracy in quantum critical point detection ($h_c/J = 1.00 \\pm 0.02$) and successfully discover ground state magnetization as the order parameter ($r = 0.97$). Notably, for the disordered transverse field Ising model, we detect exotic infinite-randomness criticality characterized by activated dynamical scaling $\\ln ξ\\sim |h - h_c|^{-ψ}$, extracting a tunneling exponent $ψ= 0.48 \\pm 0.08$ consistent with theoretical predictions ($ψ= 0.5$). This demonstrates that unsupervised learning can identify qualitatively different types of critical behavior, not just locate critical points. Our systematic validation across classical thermal transitions ($T = 0$ to $T > 0$) and quantum phase transitions ($T = 0$, varying $h$) establishes that VAE-based discovery generalizes across fundamentally different physical domains, providing robust tools for exploring phase diagrams where analytical solutions are unavailable."

    "abstract": "The [C/N]-age relation has become a powerful tool for reconstructing the formation history of the Milky Way (MW), providing the largest age sample for field giant stars. However, at metallicities below [Fe/H] $< -0.5$, stellar surfaces are altered by a poorly understood process known as extra mixing, which modifies [C/N] in a mass- and metallicity-dependent manner. This effect complicates the application of the traditional [C/N]-age relation in metal-poor regimes. Within the MW, constraining the mass dependence of extra mixing is particularly challenging because stars at [Fe/H] $< -0.5$ are predominantly old and therefore low-mass, leading to strong degeneracies between mass and metallicity. In this work, we explore the potential of the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) to disentangle these effects and constrain extra mixing as a function of age and metallicity. By comparing empirical corrections calibrated in the MW with predictions from thermohaline mixing models, we isolate the mass dependence of extra mixing in the MCs down to [Fe/H] $\\sim-0.7$. We find that the empirical calibration performs well for lower-mass stars ($< 1.25$ $M_{\\odot}$), while theoretical models successfully reproduce the observed mass dependence down to $\\sim$ 1.25 $M_{\\odot}$. We further present the first observational evidence that extra mixing becomes ineffective above $\\sim$ 1.8 $M_{\\odot}$ at [Fe/H] $\\sim -0.7$. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of deriving [C/N]-based ages for individual stars in external galaxies. Future observations targeting higher-$\\log g$ or fainter stars in the MCs will provide stronger constraints on extra-mixing processes and enable the calibration of [C/N]-age relation that can be applied to low-metallicity individual stars in the MW or external galaxies."

A translational boundary separating domains of comparable thickness, with an in-plane offset of (2/3a + 1/3b), produces this honeycomb-like contrast. Stacking domains translated in nonequivalent directions yields patterns resembling cubic ice (Ic) along [0001] but with a 3-fold symmetry. We imaged this structure at a record-breaking line resolution of 89 picometers, finer than the O-H covalent bond length.

This resolution milestone opens new avenues for characterizing subtle structural perturbations of water in the solid state."

However, their performance often degrades on heterophilic hypergraphs, where nodes connected by the same hyperedge tend to have dissimilar semantic representations or belong to different classes. While several HyGNNs, including our prior work BHyGNN, have been proposed to address heterophily, their reliance on labeled data significantly limits their applicability in real-world scenarios where annotations are scarce or costly. To overcome this limitation, we introduce BHyGNN+, a self-supervised learning framework that extends BHyGNN for representation learning on heterophilic hypergraphs without requiring ground-truth labels. The core idea of BHyGNN+ is hypergraph duality, a structural transformation where the roles of nodes and hyperedges are interchanged. By contrasting augmented views of a hypergraph against its dual using cosine similarity, our framework captures essential structural patterns in a fully unsupervised manner. Notably, this duality-based formulation eliminates the need for negative samples, a common requirement in existing hypergraph contrastive learning methods that is often difficult to satisfy in practice. Extensive experiments on eleven benchmark datasets demonstrate that BHyGNN+ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art supervised and self-supervised baselines on both heterophilic and homophilic hypergraphs. Our results validate the effectiveness of leveraging hypergraph duality for self-supervised learning and establish a new paradigm for representation learning on challenging, unlabeled hypergraphs."

We study the problem of answering queries in a first-order relational probabilistic logic through a joint effort of learning and reasoning, without ever constructing an explicit model. Traditional lifted inference assumes access to a complete model and exploits symmetry to evaluate probabilistic queries; however, learning such models from partial, noisy observations is intractable in general. We reconcile these two challenges through implicit learning to reason and first-order relational probabilistic inference techniques. More specifically, we merge incomplete first-order axioms with independently sampled, partially observed examples into a bounded-degree fragment of the sum-of-squares (SOS) hierarchy in polynomial time. Our algorithm performs two lifts simultaneously: (i) grounding-lift, where renaming-equivalent ground moments share one variable, collapsing the domain of individuals; and (ii) world-lift, where all pseudo-models (partial world assignments) are enforced in parallel, producing a global bound that holds across all worlds consistent with the learned constraints. These innovations yield the first polynomial-time framework that implicitly learns a first-order probabilistic logic and performs lifted inference over both individuals and worlds."

In contrast, biological networks support rich time-dependent behaviour facilitated by their asymmetry. Here we introduce a general framework, which we term drift-diffusion matching, for training continuous-time RNNs to represent arbitrary stochastic dynamical systems within a low-dimensional latent subspace. Allowing asymmetric connectivity, we show that RNNs can faithfully embed the drift and diffusion of a given stochastic differential equation, including nonlinear and nonequilibrium dynamics such as chaotic attractors. As an application, we construct RNN realisations of stochastic systems that transiently explore various attractors through both input-driven switching and autonomous transitions driven by nonequilibrium currents, which we interpret as models of associative and sequential (episodic) memory. To elucidate how these dynamics are encoded in the network, we introduce decompositions of the RNN based on its asymmetric connectivity and its time-irreversibility. Our results extend attractor neural network theory beyond equilibrium, showing that asymmetric neural populations can implement a broad class of dynamical computations within low-dimensional manifolds, unifying ideas from associative memory, nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, and neural computation."

However, to understand a tool's purpose and features, FMs rely on natural-language tool descriptions, making these descriptions a critical component in guiding FMs to select the optimal tool for a given (sub)task and to pass the right arguments to the tool. While defects or smells in these descriptions can misguide FM-based agents, their prevalence and consequences in the MCP ecosystem remain unclear. To address this, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study of 856 tools spread across 103 MCP servers, assessing their description quality and their impact on agent performance. We identify six components of tool descriptions from the literature, develop a scoring rubric utilizing these components, then formalize tool description smells based on this rubric. By operationalizing this rubric through an FM-based scanner, we find that 97.1% of the analyzed tool descriptions contain at least one smell, with 56% failing to state their purpose clearly. While augmenting these descriptions for all components improves task success rates by a median of 5.85 percentage points and improves partial goal completion by 15.12%, it also increases the number of execution steps by 67.46% and regresses performance in 16.67% of cases. These findings highlight a trade-off between agent performance and cost, as well as the context sensitivity of the performance gain. Furthermore, component ablations show that compact variants of different component combinations often preserve behavioral reliability while reducing unnecessary token overhead, enabling more efficient use of the FM context window and lower execution costs."

Training Data Attribution (TDA) methods address this by estimating datapoint influence. Existing approaches like influence functions are both computationally expensive and attribute based on single test examples, which can bias results toward syntactic rather than semantic similarity. To address these issues of scalability and influence to abstract behavior, we leverage interpretable structures within the model during the attribution. First, we introduce Concept Influence which attribute model behavior to semantic directions (such as linear probes or sparse autoencoder features) rather than individual test examples. Second, we show that simple probe-based attribution methods are first-order approximations of Concept Influence that achieve comparable performance while being over an order-of-magnitude faster. We empirically validate Concept Influence and approximations across emergent misalignment benchmarks and real post-training datasets, and demonstrate they achieve comparable performance to classical influence functions while being substantially more scalable. More broadly, we show that incorporating interpretable structure within traditional TDA pipelines can enable more scalable, explainable, and better control of model behavior through data."

It is mostly used in two contexts: improving the calibration of classifiers and tuning the stochasticity of large language models (LLMs). In both cases, temperature scaling is the most popular method for the job. Despite its popularity, a rigorous theoretical analysis of the properties of temperature scaling has remained elusive. We investigate here some of these properties. For classification, we show that increasing the temperature increases the uncertainty in the model in a very general sense (and in particular increases its entropy). However, for LLMs, we challenge the common claim that increasing temperature increases diversity. Furthermore, we introduce two new characterisations of temperature scaling. The first one is geometric: the tempered model is shown to be the information projection of the original model onto the set of models with a given entropy. The second characterisation clarifies the role of temperature scaling as a submodel of more general linear scalers such as matrix scaling and Dirichlet calibration: we show that temperature scaling is the only linear scaler that does not change the hard predictions of the model."

StarCraft II (SC2), with its massive state-action space and partial observability, is a challenging testbed. However, existing LLM-based SC2 agents primarily focus on improving the policy itself and overlook integrating a learnable, action-conditioned transition model into the decision loop. To bridge this gap, we propose StarWM, the first world model for SC2 that predicts future observations under partial observability. To facilitate learning SC2's hybrid dynamics, we introduce a structured textual representation that factorizes observations into five semantic modules, and construct SC2-Dynamics-50k, the first instruction-tuning dataset for SC2 dynamics prediction. We further develop a multi-dimensional offline evaluation framework for predicted structured observations. Offline results show StarWM's substantial gains over zero-shot baselines, including nearly 60% improvements in resource prediction accuracy and self-side macro-situation consistency. Finally, we propose StarWM-Agent, a world-model-augmented decision system that integrates StarWM into a Generate--Simulate--Refine decision loop for foresight-driven policy refinement. Online evaluation against SC2's built-in AI demonstrates consistent improvements, yielding win-rate gains of 30%, 15%, and 30% against Hard (LV5), Harder (LV6), and VeryHard (LV7), respectively, alongside improved macro-management stability and tactical risk assessment."

In particular, we can solve problems with point sources efficiently, that for classic algorithms require almost full rank. Our algorithm only transfers boundary data between subdomains and is thus very attractive for distributed memory parallelization, where classic dynamical low-rank algorithms suffer from global data dependency. We demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm by a number of challenging test examples that have both very optical thin and thick regions."

In this paper, we show how it is possible to circumvent these limitations by constructing formally-verified neural network solvers for PDEs, with rigorous convergence, stability, and conservation properties, whose correctness can therefore be guaranteed even in extrapolatory regimes. By using the method of characteristics to predict the analytical properties of PDE solutions a priori (even in regions arbitrarily far from the training domain), we show how it is possible to construct rigorous extrapolatory bounds on the worst-case L^inf errors of shallow neural network approximations. Then, by decomposing PDE solutions into compositions of simpler functions, we show how it is possible to compose these shallow neural networks together to form deep architectures, based on ideas from compositional deep learning, in which the large L^inf errors in the approximations have been suppressed. The resulting framework, called BEACONS (Bounded-Error, Algebraically-COmposable Neural Solvers), comprises both an automatic code-generator for the neural solvers themselves, as well as a bespoke automated theorem-proving system for producing machine-checkable certificates of correctness. We apply the framework to a variety of linear and non-linear PDEs, including the linear advection and inviscid Burgers' equations, as well as the full compressible Euler equations, in both 1D and 2D, and illustrate how BEACONS architectures are able to extrapolate solutions far beyond the training data in a reliable and bounded way.

At a given dimension, image samples are regarded as simplicial complexes, and persistent sheaf Laplacians are utilized to extract a multiscale localized topological spectral representation for individual image samples. Statistical summaries of the resulting spectra are then aggregated across scales and dimensions to form multiscale multi-dimensional image representations. We evaluate the proposed framework on the COIL20 and ETH80 image datasets using standard classification protocols. Experimental results show that the proposed method provides more stable performance across a wide range of reduced dimensions and achieves consistent improvements to PCA-based baselines in moderate dimensional regimes."

Via weak compactness arguments, the limit points are characterized as optimal trajectories of the related deterministic control problem, thus ruling out some of the mean field equilibria. Our result is obtained by first connecting the finite player game to a suitable control problem, whose optimal trajectories are the empirical means of Nash equilibria of the game, and in which the number of players $N$ becomes a parameter. True convergence to the unique minimizer of the limit control problem then holds for almost every initial mean. In cases of multiple optimizers, we focus on examples to show that some symmetry of the data ensures that the sequence admits a random limit which is distributes uniformly among the minimizers of the potential. Multidimensional examples of the convergence result appear here for the first time, which show the flexibility of our method.

Task-driven hard-attention models for vision are often evaluated by how well their scanpaths match human gaze. However, common scanpath metrics can be strongly confounded by dataset-specific center bias, especially on object-centric datasets. Using Gaze-CIFAR-10, we show that a trivial center-fixation baseline achieves surprisingly strong scanpath scores, approaching many learned policies. This makes standard metrics optimistic and blurs the distinction between genuine behavioral alignment and mere central tendency. We then analyze a hard-attention classifier under constrained vision by sweeping foveal patch size and peripheral context, revealing a peripheral sweet spot: only a narrow range of sensory constraints yields scanpaths that are simultaneously (i) above the center baseline after debiasing and (ii) temporally human-like in movement statistics. To address center bias, we propose GCS (Gaze Consistency Score), a center-debiased composite metric augmented with movement similarity. GCS uncovers a robust sweet spot at medium patch size with both foveal and peripheral vision, that is not obvious from raw scanpath metrics or accuracy alone, and also highlights a \"shortcut regime\" when the field-of-view becomes too large. We discuss implications for evaluating active perception on object-centric datasets and for designing gaze benchmarks that better separate behavioral alignment from center bias."

Monte Carlo experiments confirm that under general forms of the idiosyncratic covariance matrix, the finite-sample distribution of SLS global and group-specific factors can be well approximated using the asymptotic distribution of PC factors. We also analyse the performance of alternative estimators of the asymptotic mean squared error (MSE) of the SLS factors and show that the MSE estimator that allows for idiosyncratic cross-sectional correlation and accounts for estimation uncertainty of factor loadings is best."

Conventional RF approaches, which fabricate the Lenz lens onto the diamond anvil itself, preclude the placement of electrical circuits. Our method overcomes this limitation by transferring the RF sensor to a composite Ta-based gasket. The sensor consists of single-turn microcoils that are formed by magnetron sputtering a gold film onto an insulating Ta$_2$O$_5$ layer. The Lenz lens topology is then patterned using focused ion beam etching. We validated this technique using polycrystalline Cu1234 and Bi2212 high-$\\textit{T$_c$}$ superconductors at ambient and high pressures. The measurements consistently identified the superconducting transition temperature across carrier frequencies from 111 kHz to 200 MHz. This new gasket technique establishes a reliable and sensitive tool for contactless studies of superconductivity under high pressure."

This approach is a robotics-oriented QUBO formulation incorporating BFS-based logical pre-processing (achieving over 95% variable reduction), adaptive penalty design for collision and constraint enforcement, and a time-windowed decomposition strategy that enables execution within current hardware limitations. An experimental evaluation in grid environments with up to four robots demonstrated near-optimal solutions in dense scenarios and favorable scaling behavior compared to sequential classical planning. These results establish a practical and reproducible baseline for future quantum and quantum-inspired multi-robot coordinations."

    "abstract": "We study the proximity effect in the Hubbard model coupled to BCS superconductors describing a single-layer strongly correlated electron system in a phase-biased Josephson junction. We find two distinct gapped solutions, one Mott-like insulating (M-phase) and one proximitized superconducting phase (S-phase), separated by first-order transition with hysteresis. In the M-phase the large correlation charge gap strongly suppresses the critical current, while the S-phase behaves as a $0$-junction, with a proximitized gap that closes for $φ=π$ to yield a correlated metal. Phase bias and junction transparency can thus serve as tuning knobs to switch between conducting and insulating regimes. Working within the dynamical mean field theory using the numerical renormalization group as the impurity solver, we associate M- and S-phase solutions with the doublet and singlet fixed points of the underlying superconducting Anderson impurity problem. We obtain detailed insight into the spectral structure on all energy scales. In the M-phase, the self-energy has sub-gap resonances symmetrically located around the Fermi level resulting from the splitting of the ''mid-gap pole'' found in Mott insulators; this structure accounts for phase insensitivity."

Hexagonal FeS (h-FeS) is a recently identified altermagnet candidate that shows a spontaneous anomalous Hall effect (AHE) accompanied by a tiny net magnetization. Here, we show that both the spontaneous AHE and magnetization can be effectively suppressed by an in-plane compressive strain. Since neutron diffraction measurements show that the applied uniaxial strain only modifies the in-plane domain population but does not affect the in-plane magnetic structure, the major effect of the applied strain is to tune the small $c$-axis ferromagnetic moment. Our results demonstrate a strong correlation between the tiny net magnetization and the spontaneous AHE in h-FeS, and show that uniaxial strain provides an effective knob to tune both properties in this altermagnet candidate for spintronic applications."

This study examines 2.8 million tweets containing #LongCOVID to understand how contested illness communities construct knowledge networks and respond to epistemic injustice. Through topic modeling, reflexive thematic analysis, and exponential random graph modeling (ERGM), we identify seven discourse themes spanning symptom documentation, medical dismissal, cross-illness solidarity, and policy advocacy. Our analysis reveals a differentiated ecosystem of user roles -- including patient advocates, research coordinators, and citizen scientists -- who collectively challenge medical gatekeeping while building connections to established ME/CFS advocacy networks. ERGM results demonstrate that tie formation centers on epistemic practices: users discussing knowledge sharing and community building formed significantly more network connections than those focused on policy debates, supporting characterization of this space as an epistemic community. Long COVID patients experienced medical gaslighting patterns documented across contested illnesses, yet achieved WHO recognition within months -- contrasting sharply with decades-long struggles of similar conditions. These findings illuminate how social media affordances enable marginalized patient populations to rapidly construct alternative knowledge systems, form cross-illness coalitions, and contest traditional medical authority structures."

We compare a dedicated OCR transformer (TrOCR) and a general-purpose Vision-Language Model (Qwen) on line-level historical English texts using length-weighted accuracy metrics and hypothesis driven error analysis. While Qwen achieves lower CER/WER and greater robustness to degraded input, it exhibits selective linguistic regularization and orthographic normalization that may silently alter historically meaningful forms. TrOCR preserves orthographic fidelity more consistently but is more prone to cascading error propagation. Our findings show that architectural inductive biases shape OCR error structure in systematic ways. Models with similar aggregate accuracy can differ substantially in error locality, detectability, and downstream scholarly risk, underscoring the need for architecture-aware evaluation in historical digitization workflows."

We examine this fundamental question by evaluating whether LLMs genuinely reason mathematically in these languages or depend on implicit translation to English-like representations. Using a taxonomy of six math problem types, from basic arithmetic to complex unit conflict and optimization problems, we evaluate four prominent large language models. To avoid translation artifacts that confound language ability with translation quality, we construct a parallel dataset where each problem is natively authored by fluent speakers with mathematical training in all three languages. Our analysis demonstrates that while basic arithmetic reasoning transfers robustly across languages, complex reasoning tasks show significant degradation in Tamil and Sinhala. The pattern of failures varies by model and problem type, suggesting that apparent multilingual competence may not reflect uniform reasoning capabilities across languages. These findings challenge the common assumption that models exhibiting strong multilingual performance can reason equally effectively across languages, and highlight the need for fine-grained, type-aware evaluation in multilingual settings."

This effect provides a simple interpretation for the acceleration interpolation relation required to modify the kinematics of a test particle in the Modified Inertial interpretation of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). This effect can be regarded as a generalization of the thermal blackbody spectrum generated by the Unruh effect (which arises from long-time uniform acceleration in a flat background) to the scenario of local short-time non-uniform acceleration. This effect offers a unified framework for understanding the accelerated expansion of the universe and the anomalies in galactic rotation curves or radial acceleration. It is worth emphasizing that this modified kinematic interpretation of MOND necessitates a quantum equivalence principle as its physical foundation, that is, extending the equivalence at the level of expectation values (first-order moments) in the classical equivalence principle to the equivalence at the level of second-order moment quantum fluctuations. Therefore, the role of this effect within the frameworks of quantum reference frames and quantum gravity is also discussed to some extent."

Clustering-based approaches can provide explainable decision-making process but suffer from high dimension features and semantically ambiguous centroids. To this end, we propose an end-to-end MIL framework that integrates Grassmann re-embedding and manifold adaptive clustering, where the manifold geometric structure facilitates robust clustering results. Furthermore, we design a prior knowledge guiding proxy instance labeling and aggregation strategy to approximate patch labels and focus on pathologically relevant tumor regions. Experiments on multicentre WSI datasets demonstrate that: 1) our cluster-incorporated model achieves superior performance in both grading accuracy and interpretability; 2) end-to-end learning refines better feature representations and it requires acceptable computation resources."

Furthermore, by incorporating MLPs, a transformer block can solve (i) $\\ell_1$-penalized QPs by emulating iterative soft-thresholding and (ii) $\\ell_1$-constrained QPs when equipped with an additional feedback loop. Our theory motivates us to introduce Time2Decide: a generic method that enhances a time series foundation model (TSFM) by explicitly feeding the covariance matrix between the variates. We empirically find that Time2Decide uniformly outperforms the base TSFM model for the classical portfolio optimization problem that admits an $\\ell_1$-constrained QP formulation. Remarkably, Time2Decide also outperforms the classical \"Predict-then-Optimize (PtO)\" procedure, where we first forecast the returns and then explicitly solve a constrained QP, in suitable settings. Our results demonstrate that transformers benefit from explicit use of second-order statistics, and this can enable them to effectively solve complex decision-making problems, like portfolio construction, in one forward pass."

Standard probabilistic model checkers operate on the full state space, which becomes infeasible for larger MDPs, and cannot explain why a learned policy makes particular decisions. COOL-MC wraps the model checker Storm but adds three key capabilities: it constructs only the reachable state space induced by a trained policy, yielding a smaller discrete-time Markov chain amenable to verification even when full-MDP analysis is intractable; it automatically labels states with clinically meaningful atomic propositions; and it integrates explainability methods with probabilistic computation tree logic (PCTL) queries to reveal which features drive decisions across treatment trajectories. We demonstrate COOL-MC's capabilities on the ICU-Sepsis MDP, a benchmark derived from approximately 17,000 sepsis patient records, which serves as a case study for applying COOL-MC to the formal analysis of sepsis treatment policies. Our analysis establishes hard bounds via full MDP verification, trains a safe RL policy that achieves optimal survival probability, and analyzes its behavior via PCTL verification and explainability on the induced DTMC. This reveals, for instance, that our trained policy relies predominantly on prior dosing history rather than the patient's evolving condition, a weakness that is invisible to standard evaluation but is exposed by COOL-MC's integration of formal verification and explainability. Our results illustrate how COOL-MC could serve as a tool for clinicians to investigate and debug sepsis treatment policies before deployment."

To address this, we propose an end-to-end prototype instance semantic disentanglement framework with low-rank regularized subspace clustering, PID-LRSC, in two aspects. First, we use secondary instance subspace learning to construct low-rank regularized subspace clustering (LRSC), addressing instance entanglement caused by an excessive proportion of non tumor instances. Second, we employ enhanced contrastive learning to design prototype instance semantic disentanglement (PID), resolving semantic entanglement caused by the high similarity between tumor and precancerous tissues. We conduct extensive experiments on multicentre pathology datasets, implying that PID-LRSC outperforms other SOTA methods. Overall, PID-LRSC provides clearer instance semantics during decision-making and significantly enhances the reliability of auxiliary diagnostic outcomes."

A non-negligible fraction of these SMBHs are hosted in galaxies with BH-to-galaxy mass ratios ($M_{\\rm BH}/M_\\star$) being excessively larger than that for local SMBHs by $\\sim 1-2$ dex. The origin of these ``overmassive'' BHs remains elusive, demanding either a heavy seed formation scenario or rapid growth of seed BHs. Their deviation from local scaling relations challenges our understanding of how SMBHs and their host galaxies coevolve across cosmic time. In this paper, we apply phenomenological modelings for BHs and galaxies to dark matter halo merger histories from N-body simulations to investigate the subsequent evolution of JWST-discovered ``overmassive'' SMBHs. We find that early evolution of ``overmassive'' SMBHs is dominated by stunted accretion leading to gradual decreases in $M_{\\rm BH}/M_\\star$ ratios. In contrast, less massive SMBHs experience super-Eddington accretion during their early evolution, resulting in a slow increase of mass ratios toward $M_{\\rm BH}/M_\\star \\sim 0.01$. Convergence occurs at $M_{\\rm BH}\\sim 10^8~M_\\odot$ with $M_{\\rm BH}/M_\\star \\sim 0.01$. At lower redshift, nearly all SMBHs evolve onto local relations, as expected given that our models adopt empirical relations derived from low-redshift observations.

This result is both surprising as despite lacking prior knowledge of the minimum-variance source among $M$ alternatives, SOAR attains the optimal instance-dependent regret of standard single-source MAB with variance ${σ^*}^2$, while incurring only an small (and unavoidable) additive cost of $\\tilde O(\\sqrt{K \\sum_{j=1}^M σ_j^2})$ towards the optimal (minimum variance) source identification.

We analyze semantic suppression, the intuitive mitigation strategy that instructs models to ignore the answer, to find out its counterproduction: while it reduces lexical overlap, it paradoxically increases entropic and probabilistic anchoring. Drawing on Ironic Process Theory from cognitive psychology, we attribute this failure to active monitoring of the forbidden answer, which inadvertently deepens dependence on it. To break this cycle, we propose Structural Skeleton-guided Reasoning (SSR), a two-phase approach that first generates an answer-invariant functional skeleton structure, then uses this skeleton to guide full trace generation. By redirecting the information flow to structural planning rather than answer monitoring, SSR consistently reduces anchoring across all three levels. We further introduce Distilled SSR (SSR-D), which fine-tunes models on teacher-generated SSR traces to ensure reliable structural adherence. Experiments across open-ended reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that SSR-D achieves up to 10% improvement over suppression baselines while preserving out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization."

    "abstract": "With natural language generation becoming a popular use case for language models, the Bias Benchmark for Question-Answering (BBQ) has grown to be an important benchmark format for evaluating stereotypical associations exhibited by generative models. We expand the linguistic scope of BBQ and construct FilBBQ through a four-phase development process consisting of template categorization, culturally aware translation, new template construction, and prompt generation. These processes resulted in a bias test composed of more than 10,000 prompts which assess whether models demonstrate sexist and homophobic prejudices relevant to the Philippine context. We then apply FilBBQ on models trained in Filipino but do so with a robust evaluation protocol that improves upon the reliability and accuracy of previous BBQ implementations. Specifically, we account for models' response instability by obtaining prompt responses across multiple seeds and averaging the bias scores calculated from these distinctly seeded runs. Our results confirm both the variability of bias scores across different seeds and the presence of sexist and homophobic biases relating to emotion, domesticity, stereotyped queer interests, and polygamy. FilBBQ is available via GitHub."

Remodeling in the extracellular matrix's structural fibers leads to insight into the development of diseases such as cancer, fibrosis and carcinoma. While standard tissues visualization in the ECM involves multiple lengthy histopathological staining protocols, Mueller matrix-based polarimetry provides label-free tissue slices' microstructural information and optical properties. This work aims to identify three types of fiber tissues commonly found in the ECM of gastrointestinal tissue specimens by analyzing their polarization properties. To address decomposition methods' reliance on restrictive hypotheses and inability with an individual polarization-based parameter to determine the nature of a given biological tissue; this study employs Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) method to offer greater discriminative power and flexibility. Subsequently, polarization-based features will be extracted and compared between fiber regions statistically to discern potential diagnostic differences. By providing colorized images, this work aims to demonstrate the feasibility of distinguishing different fibers with polarization approach, offering insights for future clinical development while complementing existing staining methods for pathological tissue specimens."

By tracking the superconducting energy gap, we show that approaching the quantum critical point (QCP) closes the gap and induces incipient insulating features, indicating that enhanced quantum fluctuations suppress superconducting order and trigger the SIT. To probe the transition, we employ two holographic indicators: holographic entanglement entropy (HEE) and the entanglement wedge cross-section (EWCS), the latter being a mixed-state entanglement measure. In contrast to HEE, which for sufficiently large configuration is dominated by the thermal entropy and is therefore largely insensitive to entanglement along the temperature direction, EWCS displays pronounced critical scaling and provides a robust diagnostic of the quantum phase transition (QPT). We attribute this contrast to the fact that HEE at large scales is controlled by the infrared (IR) geometry, whereas EWCS is governed by deformations of the entire bulk. Our results establish EWCS as a robust probe of holographic quantum criticality in mixed states."

The goal is to integrate the strengths of LLMs and VLMs with computational tools to automatically analyze and solve problems related to robotic manipulators. Our developed framework accepts both textual and visual inputs and can automatically perform forward and inverse kinematics, compute velocities and accelerations of key points, generate 3D simulations of the robot, and ultimately execute motion control within the simulated environment, all according to the user's query. To evaluate the framework, three benchmark tests were designed, each consisting of ten questions. In the first benchmark test, the framework was evaluated while connected to GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3.2, and Claude-Sonnet-4.5, as well as their corresponding raw models. The objective was to extract the forward kinematics of robots directly from textual descriptions. The results showed that the framework integrated with GPT-4o achieved the highest accuracy, reaching 0.97 in computing the final solution, whereas the raw model alone attained an accuracy of only 0.30 for the same task. Similarly, for the other two models, the framework consistently outperformed the corresponding raw models in terms of accuracy. The second benchmark test was identical to the first, except that the input was provided in visual form. In this test, the GPT-4o LLM was used alongside the Gemini 2.5 Pro VLM. The results showed that the framework achieved an accuracy of 0.93 in obtaining the final answer, which is approximately 20% higher than that of the corresponding raw model. The third benchmark test encompassed a range of robotic tasks, including simulation, control, velocity and acceleration computation, as well as inverse kinematics and Jacobian calculation, for which the framework achieved an accuracy of 0.97."

Six students across disciplines completed sessions combining interviews and think-aloud tasks with their materials. Analysis revealed that students value automation for addressing the overwhelming preparation burden, yet require transparent, editable AI outputs to maintain cognitive ownership, which is essential for self-regulation. They conceptualized AI as a collaborative partner demanding verifiable reasoning rather than an autonomous agent. Metacognitive scaffolding was endorsed when clarifying study direction without constraining choice. Motivational features produced divergent responses. We derive design principles prioritizing editability and transparency, scaffolding metacognition without prescription, and accommodating motivational diversity. Findings identify conditions under which automation supports versus undermines metacognitive development in self-regulated learning."

Despite this, most VIO evaluations emphasize nominal sensor behavior, leaving the effects of sustained sensor degradation under operational conditions insufficiently understood. This paper presents a controlled empirical study of VIO behavior under degraded sensing, examining faults affecting visual and inertial modalities across a range of operating regimes. Through systematic fault injection and quantitative evaluation, we observe a pronounced asymmetry in fault impact where degradations affecting visual sensing typically lead to bounded pose errors on the order of centimeters, whereas degradations affecting inertial sensing can induce substantially larger trajectory deviations, in some cases reaching hundreds to thousands of meters. These observations motivate greater emphasis on inertial reliability in the evaluation and design of XR systems for real-life industrial settings."

    "abstract": "Molecular and polymeric crystals show a wide range of functional properties that arise from the interplay between the atomic-scale structure of their constituent molecules and the organization of these molecules within the crystal lattice at macroscopic length scales. X-ray diffraction can provide structural information at these disparate length scales, but usually only through experiments that address one or the other of molecular (or unit-cell) structure versus crystal structure. Consequently, the accuracy of determined molecular or polymer structures may be limited by unaccounted crystal inhomogeneities of the crystal lattice and the characterization of crystalline materials might not reveal the underlying causes of crystal morphology. Here we introduce X-ray convergent-beam diffraction to obtain spatially-resolved structural information from crystals by projection topographic imaging. Using highly focusing X-ray multilayer Laue lenses, we show that Bragg reflections can be mapped into tomographic images of the crystal, for the characterization of strain and defects at high resolution. We demonstrate how the crystal morphology obtained this way can be accounted for when determining structure factors as a function of position in the crystal. The approach may assist in studies such as diffusion and binding in MOFS, protein-drug binding, crystal growth, and the mechanical responses of photo-reactive or thermally driven dynamic crystals."

Federated Learning FL mitigates this by keeping data on-device, but vanilla FL struggles under VLNs' extreme cross-client heterogeneity in environments and instruction styles, making a single global model suboptimal. This paper proposes pFedNavi, a structure-aware and dynamically adaptive personalized federated learning framework tailored for VLN. Our key idea is to personalize where it matters: pFedNavi adaptively identifies client-specific layers via layer-wise mixing coefficients, and performs fine-grained parameter fusion on the selected components (e.g., the encoder-decoder projection and environment-sensitive decoder layers) to balance global knowledge sharing with local specialization. We evaluate pFedNavi on two standard VLN benchmarks, R2R and RxR, using both ResNet and CLIP visual representations. Across all metrics, pFedNavi consistently outperforms the FedAvg-based VLN baseline, achieving up to 7.5% improvement in navigation success rate and up to 7.8% gain in trajectory fidelity, while converging 1.38x faster under non-IID conditions."

    "abstract": "The dynamics of a self-propelled particle are typically hard-wired by its microscopic construction, limiting the range of behaviors accessible without redesigning the particle itself. Here we show that intramolecular nonreciprocity provides a minimal and versatile mechanism to overcome this constraint. We construct active molecules from short chains of two species of self-propelled particles whose propulsion directions are coupled nonreciprocally according to a prescribed internal sequence. At the single-molecule level, homogeneous sequences exhibit standard persistent random-walk dynamics, whereas heterogeneous sequences produce distinct trajectories inaccessible to either constituent species alone. At the collective level, using motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) as a representative example, we find that modifying the internal sequence shifts the MIPS onset by multiple orders of magnitude in propulsion strength, without altering particle-level interactions. These results demonstrate that intramolecular nonreciprocity among a small set of active components enables sequence-level programmability from single-molecule dynamics to emergent collective behavior, providing a minimal mechanism to encode and control active-matter dynamics across scales."

While bulk FeTe is non-superconducting with a long-range bicollinear antiferromagnetic order, superconductivity has been achieved in thin films. However, the approaches usually involve complex oxygen incorporation or interfacial effects, the microscopic mechanisms of which remain elusive. Here, we prepare high-purity, bare FeTe thin films on SrTiO3 and investigate their magnetic and superconducting states combining both microscopic and macroscopic characterizations. By reducing the interstitial Fe impurities, we successfully suppress the long-range antiferromagnetic order, enhance the quasiparticle coherence and induce superconductivity at ~10 K. Moreover, this process is readily reversible by tuning the Fe concentration. Our findings reveal that precise stoichiometric control is sufficient to induce intrinsic superconductivity in strained FeTe thin films. This work provides insights into the competition between magnetism and superconductivity in iron chalcogenides, and supplies a robust pathway for developing stable, high-purity superconducting FeTe films."

In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), in which household surveys provide the most reliable and timely source of data, SAE is vital for highlighting disparities in health and demographic indicators. Weighted estimators are ideal for inference, but for fine geographical partitions in which there are insufficient data, SAE models are required. The most common approach is Fay-Herriot area-level modeling in which the data requirements are a weighted estimate and an associated variance estimate. The latter can be undefined or unstable when data are sparse and so we propose a principled modification which is based on augmenting the available data with a prior sample from a hypothetical survey. This adjustment is generally available, respects the design and is simple to implement. We examine the empirical properties of the adjustment through simulation and illustrate its use with wasting data from a 2018 Zambian Demographic and Health Survey. The modification is implemented as an automatic remedy in the R package surveyPrev, which provides a comprehensive suite of tools for conducing SAE in LMICs."

First, we exhibit an infinite family of strings where the number, $r$, of runs in the run-length encoding of the Burrows--Wheeler transform (BWT) can increase additively by $Θ(n)$ when reversing the string. This substantially improves the known $Ω(\\log n)$ lower-bound for the additive sensitivity of $r$ and it is asymptotically tight. We generalize our result to other variants of the BWT, including the variant with an appended end-of-string symbol and the bijective BWT. We show that an analogous result holds for the size $z$ of the Lempel--Ziv 77 (LZ) parsing of the text, and also for some of its variants, including the non-overlapping LZ parsing, and the LZ-end parsing. Moreover, we describe a family of strings for which the ratio $z(w^R)/z(w)$ approaches $3$ from below as $|w|\\rightarrow \\infty$. We also show an asymptotically tight lower-bound of $Θ(n)$ for the additive sensitivity of the size $v$ of the smallest lexicographic parsing to string reversal. Finally, we show that the multiplicative sensitivity of $v$ to reversing the string is $Θ(\\log n)$, and this lower-bound is also tight. Overall, our results expose the limitations of repetitiveness measures that are widely used in practice, against string reversal -- a simple and natural data transformation."

    "abstract": "Skin cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide and early detection is critical for effective treatment. However, current AI diagnostic tools are often trained on datasets dominated by lighter skin tones, leading to reduced accuracy and fairness for people with darker skin. The International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) dataset, one of the most widely used benchmarks, contains over 70% light skin images while dark skins fewer than 8%. This imbalance poses a significant barrier to equitable healthcare delivery and highlights the urgent need for methods that address demographic diversity in medical imaging. This paper addresses this challenge of skin tone imbalance in automated skin cancer detection using dermoscopic images. To overcome this, we present a generative augmentation pipeline that fine-tunes a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on the image dark-skin subset of the ISIC dataset and generates synthetic dermoscopic images conditioned on lesion type and skin tone. In this study, we investigated the utility of these images on two downstream tasks: lesion segmentation and binary classification. For segmentation, models trained on the augmented dataset and evaluated on held-out real images show consistent improvements in IoU, Dice coefficient, and boundary accuracy. These evalutions provides the verification of Generated dataset. For classification, an EfficientNet-B0 model trained on the augmented dataset achieved 92.14% accuracy. This paper demonstrates that synthetic data augmentation with Generative AI integration can substantially reduce bias with increase fairness in conventional dermatological diagnostics and open challenges for future directions."

Identifying the low-order QPO frequencies as fundamental oscillations, and frequencies of $567.7\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ or $655.5\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ (rest frame) as first overtone candidates, implies neutron star mass ranges of $1.00$--$1.55\\,M_\\odot$ or $1.17$--$1.76\\,M_\\odot$, respectively. The radius is also constrained, with a self-consistent value around $13$~km, further supported by the calculation of the NS structure within the low-mass/low-central density regime. Simultaneously, we also constrain another nuclear saturation parameter, namely the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy at saturation density (i.e., the slope parameter), $L$, and determine it to be $L=59.5-96.8$ MeV with $\\sim 10\\%$ systematic uncertainty, which is broadly consistent with previous constraints on $L$ obtained from experiments and astronomical observations. Thus, a mapping of FRB QPOs to crustal torsional modes seems reasonable. This can be confirmed with upcoming FRB surveys over a broad range of redshifts and more elaborate data analyses."

Analysis reveals that MT reasoning traces are highly linear, lacking revision, self-correction and exploration of alternative translations, which limits their usefulness. Furthermore, injecting higher-quality reasoning traces from stronger models does not reliably improve weaker models' performance. To address this mismatch, we propose a structured reasoning framework tailored to translation, based on multi-step drafting, adequacy refinement, fluency improvement, and selective iterative revision. We curate a synthetic dataset of dynamic structured reasoning traces and post-train a large reasoning model on this data. Experiments show significant improvements over standard translation fine-tuning and injected generic reasoning baselines. Our findings demonstrate that reasoning must be task-structured to benefit MT."

    "abstract": "We develop an interpolation-based reduced-order modeling framework for parameter-dependent partial differential equations arising in control, inverse problems, and uncertainty quantification. The solution is discretized in the physical domain using finite element methods, while the dependence on a finite-dimensional parameter is approximated separately. We establish existence, uniqueness, and regularity of the parametric solution and derive rigorous error estimates that explicitly quantify the interplay between spatial discretization and parameter approximation. In low-dimensional parameter spaces, classical interpolation schemes yield algebraic convergence rates based on Sobolev regularity in the parameter variable. In higher-dimensional parameter spaces, we replace classical interpolation by extreme learning machine (ELM) surrogates and obtain error bounds under explicit approximation and stability assumptions. The proposed framework is applied to inverse problems in quantitative photoacoustic tomography, where we derive potential and parameter reconstruction error estimates and demonstrate substantial computational savings compared to standard approaches, without sacrificing accuracy."

    "abstract": "Quantum states with sub-Planck features exhibit sensitivity to phase-space displacements beyond the standard quantum limit, making them useful for quantum metrology. In the context of the SU(1,1) group, sub-Planck features have been constructed through the superposition of four Perelomov coherent states on the hyperbolic plane (the SU(1,1) compass state). However, these structures differ in scale along different phase-space directions, resulting in nonuniform sensitivity enhancement. We overcome this limitation by constructing $\\overline{n}$-component compass states, which are obtained by superposing $\\overline{n} \\geq 6$ SU(1,1) coherent states, with an even total number, evenly arranged along a circular path on the hyperbolic plane; that is, all components lie at the same distance from the origin and have equal angular spacing of $\\frac{2π}{\\overline{n}}$. These generalized SU(1,1) compass states generate circularly shaped sub-Planck features (isotropic sub-Planckness) and provide uniform enhancement in sensitivity to phase-space displacements. As the number of coherent states $\\overline{n}$ increases, these refinements progressively improve. While verified for $\\overline{n} = 16$ SU(1,1) coherent states, the results remain valid for superpositions with arbitrarily large $\\overline{n}$ components."

Our main result is a monotonicity principle for the $\\log n$-order constant of either functional: if $f$ dominates $g$ in ``growth-ratio'' order (a variant of the hazard ratio order of probability densities) then the typical depth constant for $f$ is no larger than for $g$, i.e. stronger reinforcement yields a shallower tree. The proofs use a one-parameter interpolation together with a gauge normalisation that removes a global derivative term, reducing the sign to a weighted correlation inequality for monotone sequences. Equivalently, the results can be phrased as monotonicity theorems for the corresponding branching process functionals arising from the standard embedding of the PA tree into a Crump--Mode--Jagers process."

This study investigates how much class information remains accessible under locality-constrained measurements in the presence of noise. The authors formulate binary quantum classification as constrained quantum state discrimination and introduce a locality-restricted distinguishability measure quantifying the maximum bias achievable by observables acting on at most $k$ subsystems. For $n$-qubit systems subject to independent depolarizing noise, the locally accessible signal is governed by a Pauli-weight-dependent contraction mechanism. This motivates a computable predictor, the $k$-local Pauli-accessible amplitude $A_{k}(p)$, which lower bounds the optimal $k$-local classification advantage. Numerical experiments on four-qubit encodings demonstrate quantitative agreement between empirical accuracy and the prediction across noise levels. The research identifies an operational breakdown threshold where $k$-local classifiers become indistinguishable from random guessing despite persistent global distinguishability."

    "abstract": "Autonomous control of double-Ackermann-steering robots is essential in agricultural applications, where robots must execute precise and complex maneuvers within a limited space. Classical methods, such as the Timed Elastic Band (TEB) planner, can address this problem, but they rely on parameter tuning, making them highly sensitive to changes in robot configuration or environment and impractical to deploy without constant recalibration. At the same time, end-to-end deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods often fail due to unsuitable reward functions for non-holonomic constraints, resulting in sub-optimal policies and poor generalization. To address these challenges, this paper presents ManeuverNet, a DRL framework tailored for double-Ackermann systems, combining Soft Actor-Critic with CrossQ. Furthermore, ManeuverNet introduces four specifically designed reward functions to support maneuver learning. Unlike prior work, ManeuverNet does not depend on expert data or handcrafted guidance. We extensively evaluate ManeuverNet against both state-of-the-art DRL baselines and the TEB planner. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework substantially improves maneuverability and success rates, achieving more than a 40% gain over DRL baselines. Moreover, ManeuverNet effectively mitigates the strong parameter sensitivity observed in the TEB planner. In real-world trials, ManeuverNet achieved up to a 90% increase in maneuvering trajectory efficiency, highlighting its robustness and practical applicability."

Although the scales at which interactions occur in extensive air showers induced by ultra-high-energy cosmic rays in the atmosphere are many orders of magnitude below the Planck scale, these violations might still be observable. In this work, the fluctuations in the number of muons in the extensive air showers measured at the Pierre Auger Observatory are exploited, for the first time, to constrain Lorentz invariance violations. The bounds derived in the hadronic sector are the strongest ever obtained, and do not rely on assumptions about the mass composition of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. The fluctuations in the number of muons constitute a new and powerful observable to further explore Lorentz invariance in a region of the parameter space not accessible to other observables."

    "abstract": "This paper studies consensus of discrete-time multi-agent systems under time-varying directed communication, state and input constraints using a distributed multi-step model predictive control (MPC) framework. Consensus is recast as stabilization of the agreement set, and a geometric viewpoint based on convex-hull invariance and strict interiority is adopted. Building on an existing geometric necessary and sufficient condition for agreement, we show that enforcing terminal inclusion in local neighbor convex hulls guarantees hull invariance but does not, in general, imply the strict relative-interior property required for convergence. An explicit counterexample demonstrates that strictness cannot be deduced from feasibility and contraction constraints alone. To resolve this issue without shrinking feasible sets or altering primary performance objectives, a lexicographic tie-breaking mechanism is introduced. Among optimal (or near-optimal) MPC solutions, the proposed secondary criterion selects trajectories maximizing an interiority measure with respect to the neighbor hull. It is shown that whenever an interior feasible terminal state exists, this selection rule enforces the strictness condition required for asymptotic consensus. Explicit horizon conditions are derived for single- and double-integrator agents with bounded inputs, ensuring feasibility and automatic existence of interior feasible terminal points. The resulting scheme provides a distributed and implementable route to consensus via finite-step set-Lyapunov contraction. Numerical simulations with distributed inter-process communication illustrate monotone diameter decay and report per-agent computational complexity."

Ce$_3$MgBi$_5$ is an antiferromagnet with the distorted kagome lattice of Ce atoms, in which several fractional magnetization plateaus emerge with the increase of magnetic field. At the 1/2 magnetization plateau, obvious hysteresis has been observed in the magnetoresistance and Hall resistivity during the rise and fall of the magnetic field. However, hysteresis vanishes in the corresponding measurements of magnetization, indicating the existence of degenerate states with the same net magnetization but different electronic transport properties. The degenerate states can be connected by the time-reversal-like operation. In addition, by comparing with HoAgGe, it is suggested that the special crystal structure in Ce$_3$MgBi$_5$ may have a shielding effect on the time-reversal-like operation, thereby affecting the distinction of degenerate states. Our work establishes Ce$_3$MgBi$_5$ as an example of utilizing electronic transport properties to identify and distinguish hidden symmetries in frustrated magnetic systems."

The result applies to classical open systems. I illustrate the criterion with explicit examples of Brownian particles in harmonic traps, and classical open systems presenting Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Finally, I discuss the physical meaning of this typical length, providing both thermodynamic and information-theoretic interpretations."

    "abstract": "Building agentic systems that can autonomously self-improve from experience is a longstanding goal of AI. Large language models (LLMs) today primarily self-improve via two mechanisms: self-reflection for context updates, and reinforcement learning (RL) for weight updates. In this work, we propose Evolutionary System Prompt Learning (E-SPL), a method for jointly improving model contexts and model weights. In each RL iteration, E-SPL selects multiple system prompts and runs rollouts with each in parallel. It applies RL updates to model weights conditioned on each system prompt, and evolutionary updates to the system prompt population via LLM-driven mutation and crossover. Each system prompt has a TrueSkill rating for evolutionary selection, updated from relative performance within each RL iteration batch. E-SPL encourages a natural division between declarative knowledge encoded in prompts and procedural knowledge encoded in weights, resulting in improved performance across reasoning and agentic tasks. For instance, in an easy-to-hard (AIME $\\rightarrow$ BeyondAIME) generalization setting, E-SPL improves RL success rate from 38.8% $\\rightarrow$ 45.1% while also outperforming reflective prompt evolution (40.0%). Overall, our results show that coupling reinforcement learning with system prompt evolution yields consistent gains in sample efficiency and generalization.

We then explore Context Files, Skills, and Subagents, that is, three mechanisms available across tools, in more detail. Our findings reveal three trends. First, Context Files dominate the configuration landscape and are often the sole mechanism in a repository, with AGENTS$.$md emerging as an interoperable standard across tools. Second, advanced mechanisms such as Skills and Subagents are only shallowly adopted: most repositories define only one or two artifacts, and Skills predominantly rely on static instructions rather than executable workflows. Third, distinct configuration cultures are forming around different tools, with Claude Code users employing the broadest range of mechanisms. These findings establish an empirical baseline for longitudinal and experimental research on how configuration strategies evolve and affect agent performance as agentic AI coding tools mature."

In this work, we propose an effective and experimentally feasible scheme to significantly enhance the simultaneous quantum estimation of the photon magnon and magnon mechanical coupling strengths in a hybrid cavity magnon mechanical platform. Our approach relies on the assistance of a coherent feedback loop combined with the injection of a coherent driving field. We show that an appropriate tuning of the system and feedback parameters leads to a substantial reduction of the estimation errors associated with both coupling strengths. To quantify the metrological performance of the proposed scheme, we employ the quantum Cramer Rao bound (QCRB) as a fundamental benchmark for multiparameter estimation. We explicitly compute and compare the QCRBs derived from the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) and the right logarithmic derivative (RLD) formalisms. Our results demonstrate that the RLD based QCRB is systematically lower than the SLD based bound, indicating superior estimation precision in the considered noncommutative estimation scenario. We further analyze the performance of heterodyne detection and show that, in suitable parameter regimes, the corresponding classical estimation precision closely approaches the ultimate quantum limit predicted by our scheme. Finally, we discuss the experimental feasibility of the proposed setup within currently available cavity magnon mechanical platforms. Owing to its general character, the framework developed here can be readily extended to the high precision estimation of other physical parameters in hybrid quantum systems."

The material randomicity can be manifested by different values of material parameters of each material specimen. To capture inherent variability of heterogeneous materials, the model parameters describing the material properties are considered as random variables and their identification consists in solving a~stochastic inversion problem. The stochastic inversion is based on searching for probabilistic description of model parameters which provides the distribution of the model response corresponding to the distribution of the observed data. The paper presents two different formulations of the stochastic inversion problem. The first formulation arises from the Bayesian inference of uncertain statistical moments of a prescribed parameters' distribution while the main idea of the second one utilizes nonlinear transformation of random model parameters from distribution of the observed data."

    "abstract": "Formulaic alpha factor mining is a critical yet challenging task in quantitative investment, characterized by a vast search space and the need for domain-informed, interpretable signals. However, finding novel signals becomes increasingly difficult as the library grows due to high redundancy. We propose FactorMiner, a lightweight and flexible self-evolving agent framework designed to navigate this complex landscape through continuous knowledge accumulation. FactorMiner combines a Modular Skill Architecture that encapsulates systematic financial evaluation into executable tools with a structured Experience Memory that distills historical mining trials into actionable insights (successful patterns and failure constraints). By instantiating the Ralph Loop paradigm -- retrieve, generate, evaluate, and distill -- FactorMiner iteratively uses memory priors to guide exploration, reducing redundant search while focusing on promising directions. Experiments on multiple datasets across different assets and Markets show that FactorMiner constructs a diverse library of high-quality factors with competitive performance, while maintaining low redundancy among factors as the library scales. Overall, FactorMiner provides a practical approach to scalable discovery of interpretable formulaic alpha factors under the \"Correlation Red Sea\" constraint."

    "abstract": "This paper presents an introduction to geometric representations of quantum states in which each distinct quantum state, pure and mixed, corresponds to a unique point in a Euclidean space. Beginning with a review of some underappreciated properties of the most commonly used geometric representation, the Bloch sphere visualization of qubit states, we show how concepts, algorithms, and spatial relations viewable on this geometric representation can be extended to representations of qudit states of any finite quantum dimension $d$ and on to the infinite-dimensional limit. A primary goal of the work is helping the reader develop a visual intuition of these spaces, which can complement the understanding of the algebraic formalism of quantum mechanics for learners, teachers, and researchers at any level. Particular emphasis is given both to understanding states in a basis-independent way and to understanding how probability amplitudes and density matrix elements used to algebraically represent states in a particular basis correspond to line segments and angles in the geometric representations. In addition to providing visualizations for such concepts as superpositions, mixtures, decoherence, and measurement, we demonstrate how the representations can be used to substitute simple geometrical calculations for more cumbersome linear algebra ones, which may be of particular use in introducing mixed states and density matrices to beginning quantum students at an early stage. The work concludes with the geometrical interpretation of some commonly used metrics such as the purity of states and their relation to real, Euclidean vectors in the infinite-dimensional limit of the space, which contains all lower-dimensional qudit spaces as subspaces."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning abilities, but their high computational costs limit their practical deployment. Recent studies reveal significant redundancy in LLMs layers, making layer pruning an active research topic. Layer pruning research primarily focuses on two aspects: measuring layer importance and recovering performance after pruning. Unfortunately, the present works fail to simultaneously maintain pruning performance and efficiency. In this study, we propose GradMAP, a faster layer pruning method with \\textbf{Grad}ient \\textbf{M}etric \\textbf{A}nd \\textbf{P}rojection compensation, which consists of two stages. In the first stage, we introduce a novel metric based on gradient magnitudes, enabling a global assessment of layer importance. Note that, it requires only a single backward propagation step per pruning decision, substantially enhancing pruning efficiency. In the second stage, we first analyze the layers with the largest mean shift resulting from pruning, and then incorporate a simple yet effective projection compensation matrix to correct this drift in one step. In this way, the degradation of model performance caused by layer pruning is effectively alleviated. Extensive experiments show that GradMAP outperforms previous layer pruning methods in both pruning speed (achieving an average $4\\times$ speedup) and performance."

    "abstract": "Large language models struggle to maintain strict adherence to structured workflows in high-stakes domains such as healthcare triage. Monolithic approaches that encode entire decision structures within a single prompt are prone to instruction-following degradation as prompt length increases, including lost-in-the-middle effects and context window overflow. To address this gap, we present Arbor, a framework that decomposes decision tree navigation into specialized, node-level tasks. Decision trees are standardized into an edge-list representation and stored for dynamic retrieval. At runtime, a directed acyclic graph (DAG)-based orchestration mechanism iteratively retrieves only the outgoing edges of the current node, evaluates valid transitions via a dedicated LLM call, and delegates response generation to a separate inference step. The framework is agnostic to the underlying decision logic and model provider. Evaluated against single-prompt baselines across 10 foundation models using annotated turns from real clinical triage conversations. Arbor improves mean turn accuracy by 29.4 percentage points, reduces per-turn latency by 57.1%, and achieves an average 14.4x reduction in per-turn cost. These results indicate that architectural decomposition reduces dependence on intrinsic model capability, enabling smaller models to match or exceed larger models operating under single-prompt baselines."

The region consists of a supernova remnant (SNR, RX J0852.0-4622) with a shell-like morphology, commonly referred to as Vela Junior, and a pulsar denoted PSR J0855-4644. Pulsars are among the most efficient leptonic accelerators in our Galaxy, making this region particularly interesting to study. We utilise the most recent data taken by the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.), to investigate any γ-ray emission associated with the pulsar in this region, PSR J0855-4644. We applied a full forward folding method on the H.E.S.S. data. Utilising 3D modelling techniques, we evaluated the TeV γ-ray emission towards the various components of this complex system. The distinct energy-dependent morphology observed in our data motivates further investigation of this source. We resolved the emission in the Vela Junior region into various components, several of which correspond to the SNR itself. In particular, we find a new extended component which is coincident with the position of PSR J0855-4644. The spectrum follows a power-law distribution with a best-fit index of ΓE = 1.81 \\pm 0.07stat which differs from the properties of the surrounding γ-ray emission of the Vela Junior SNR. A one-zone leptonic joint fit between the X-rays (from XMM-Newton) and γ-rays (from H.E.S.S.) leads to a lower limit on the magnetic field of 1.6μG and a spectral index of α = 1.88 \\pm 0.01, in line with expectations of pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe). In this paper, we report the first detection of the PWN of PSR J0855-4644 at TeV energies with the H.E.S.S. experiment at a significance of 12.2σ. This is attributed to the advanced techniques of the 3D analysis. Based on the pulsar's characteristics, its PWN is consistent with the known TeV PWNe population in the Galaxy."

Methods: Patients were assessed using dynamic MRI in axial and sagittal planes while performing exercises (breathing, coughing, Valsalva) before and after their abdominal hernia surgery with mesh placement. Rectus and lateral muscles, linea alba, viscera area, defect dimensions and hernia sac were contoured with semi-automatic process to quantify the abdominal wall biomechanical temporal modifications. Results: This study enrolled 11 patients. During coughing, the axial area of the hernia sac increased by 128.4 $\\pm$ 199.2%. The sac increased similarly in axial and sagittal planes during Valsalva. Post-surgical evaluations showed a 26% reduction in inter-recti distance and a lengthening of all muscles (p $\\le$ 0.05). The post-operative rectus abdominis thickness change was negatively correlated with defect width during breathing (p $\\le$ 0.05). The largest change in linea alba displacement was observed in the surgical site (p = 0.07). Post-operatively, lateral muscles had a larger inward displacement during Valsalva (p $\\le$ 0.05). Rectus abdominis had a larger outward displacement during breathing (p = 0.09), reduced with the mesh size (p $\\le$ 0.05). A large inter-individual variability was observed. Conclusion: Using a semi-automatic methodology, an in-depth analysis of the biomechanics of the abdominal wall was conducted, highlighting the importance of a patient-specific assessment. A broader study and consideration of recurrence would subsequently complete this methodological work."

    "abstract": "Lifting Boolean-reasoning techniques to the SMT level most often requires producing theory lemmas that rule out theory-inconsistent truth assignments. With standard SMT solving, it is common to \"lazily\" generate such lemmas on demand during the search; with some harder SMT-level tasks -- such as unsat-core extraction, MaxSMT, T-OBDD or T-SDD compilation -- it may be beneficial or even necessary to \"eagerly\" pre-compute all the needed theory lemmas upfront. Whereas in principle \"classic\" eager SMT encodings could do the job, they are specific for very few and easy theories, they do not comply with theory combination, and may produce lots of unnecessary lemmas. In this paper, we present theory-agnostic methods for enumerating complete sets of theory lemmas tailored to a given formula. Starting from AllSMT as a baseline approach, we propose improved lemma-enumeration techniques, including divide&conquer, projected enumeration, and theory-driven partitioning, which are highly parallelizable and which may drastically improve scalability. An experimental evaluation demonstrates that these techniques significantly enhance efficiency and enable the method to scale to substantially more complex instances."

To address these complexities, we propose a multi-stage detection pipeline. Our architecture processes recontextualized images through a series of specialized steps targeting object-level fidelity, background consistency, and omission detection, leveraging a coordinated ensemble of open-source models, whose effectiveness is demonstrated through extensive experimental evaluations. Our approach enables a deeper understanding of where the models fail with an explanation; thus, we fill a gap in the field, as no prior methods offer such categorization and decomposition for this task.

And even when hitched to a social reference point, a fully decisive and immediate response is invariably assumed. In this paper, we propose a non-standard articulation of the trade-off between personal utility and social distance, one motivated by experimental evidence from psychology, management science, and economics. Our approach deconstructs non-recurrent consumer choice to two stages: a non-decisive first stage in which a binary relation, called one-many ordering, yields an interval, the consideration set, to which the deferred choice is confined; a decisive second stage in which the distance from the average social choice, and future social expectations, are taken into account in present utility. Finally, we embed this indecisive consumer in an exploratory game-theoretic setting, and show that indecisiveness and choice deferral may cause social loss."

Our analysis combines (i) GAMA spectroscopic redshift survey data to optically select galaxy groups and reconstruct the cosmic web, (ii) eROSITA data to identify X-ray-emitting groups, and (iii) SAMI Galaxy Survey data to characterise spatially-resolved star formation. We find that galaxies in X-ray+optical groups exhibit the lowest median C-index and the highest fraction of centrally-concentrated star-forming galaxies relative to optical groups and the field (independently of group or stellar mass). Star-forming galaxies in more X-ray luminous groups at fixed dynamical mass show more concentrated star formation. At large scales, nodes show the lowest median C-index and the highest fraction of centrally-concentrated star-forming galaxies relative to filaments and voids, which have similar C-index distributions. C-index correlates most strongly with the distance to the closest node, leaving no significant role for other local or large-scale environment metrics. Finally, regular star-forming galaxies tend to have spins aligned parallel to filaments, consistent with smooth gas accretion, while centrally-concentrated galaxies tend have spins aligned perpendicular to filaments, likely driven by mergers and associated with bulge growth. These results suggest that multi-scale environmental processes, i.e. locally and at large-scale, act to concentrate star formation toward galaxy centres, via gas-related mechanisms in nodes and ram-pressure stripping in X-ray+optical groups."

We derive two practical variants (a variational objective and an entropy-based surrogate) and integrate them into standard CBM training without architectural changes or additional supervision. Evaluated across six CBM families and three benchmarks, the IB-regularized models consistently outperform their vanilla counterparts. Information-plane analyses further corroborate the intended behavior. These results indicate that enforcing a minimal-sufficient concept bottleneck improves both predictive performance and the reliability of concept-level interventions. The proposed regularizer offers a theoretic-grounded, architecture-agnostic path to more faithful and intervenable CBMs, resolving prior evaluation inconsistencies by aligning training protocols and demonstrating robust gains across model families and datasets."

Tabular foundation models (TFMs), pretrained on diverse tabular data with strong in-context generalization, provide a basis for addressing these limitations. We introduce a model-agnostic association rule learning framework that extracts association rules from any conditional probabilistic model over tabular data, enabling us to leverage TFMs. We then introduce TabProbe, an instantiation of our framework that utilizes TFMs as conditional probability estimators to learn association rules out-of-the-box without frequent itemset mining. We evaluate our approach on tabular datasets of varying sizes based on standard ARM rule quality metrics and downstream classification performance.

Existing audio-language models show promise, but long-audio question answering remains difficult due to context-length limits. We introduce LongAudio-RAG (LA-RAG), a hybrid framework that grounds Large Language Model (LLM) outputs in retrieved, timestamped acoustic event detections rather than raw audio. Multi-hour streams are converted into structured event records stored in an SQL database, and at inference time the system resolves natural-language time references, classifies intent, retrieves only the relevant events, and generates answers using this constrained evidence. To evaluate performance, we construct a synthetic long-audio benchmark by concatenating recordings with preserved timestamps and generating template-based question-answer pairs for detection, counting, and summarization tasks. Finally, we demonstrate the practicality of our approach by deploying it in a hybrid edge-cloud environment, where the audio grounding model runs on-device on IoT-class hardware while the LLM is hosted on a GPU-backed server. This architecture enables low-latency event extraction at the edge and high-quality language reasoning in the cloud. Experiments show that structured, event-level retrieval significantly improves accuracy compared to vanilla Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) or text-to-SQL approaches."

    "abstract": "In the pull-based development model, code contributions are submitted as pull requests (PRs) to undergo reviews and approval by other developers with the goal of being merged into the code base. A PR can be supported by a description, whose role has not yet been systematically investigated. To fill in this gap, we conducted a mixed-methods empirical study of PR descriptions. We conducted a grey literature review of guidelines on writing PR descriptions and derived a taxonomy of eight recommended elements. Using this taxonomy, we analyzed 80K GitHub PRs across 156 projects and five programming languages to assess associations between these elements and code review outcomes (e.g., merge decision, latency, first response time, review comments, and review iteration cycles). To complement these results, we surveyed 64 developers about the perceived importance of each element. Finally, we analyzed which submission-time factors predict whether PRs include a description and which elements they contain. We found that developers view PR descriptions as important, but their elements matter differently: purpose and code explanations are valued by developers for preserving the rationale and history of changes, while stating the desired feedback type best predicts change acceptance and reviewer engagement. PR descriptions are also more common in mature projects and complex changes, suggesting they are written when most useful rather than as a formality."

    "abstract": "Automated Code Revision (ACR) tools aim to reduce manual effort by automatically generating code revisions based on reviewer feedback. While ACR tools have shown promising performance on historical data, their real-world utility depends on their ability to handle similar code variants expressing the same issue - a property we define as consistency. However, the probabilistic nature of ACR tools often compromises consistency, which may lead to divergent revisions even for semantically equivalent code variants. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which ACR tools maintain consistency when presented with semantically equivalent code variants. To do so, we first designed nine types of semantics-preserving perturbations (SPP) and applied them to 2032 Java methods from real-world GitHub projects, generating over 10K perturbed variants for evaluation. Then we used these perturbations to evaluate the consistency of five state-of-the-art transformer-based ACR tools. We found that the ACR tools' ability to generate correct revisions can drop by up to 45.3%, when presented with semantically equivalent code. The closer the perturbation is to this targeted region, the more likely an ACR tool is to fail to generate the correct revision. We explored potential mitigation strategies that modify the input representation, but found that these attention-guiding heuristics yielded only marginal improvements, thus leaving the solution to this problem as an open research question."

To address this gap, we introduce MATEO (MultimodAl Temporal Execution Order), a benchmark designed to assess and improve the temporal reasoning abilities of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) required for real-world planning. We acquire a high-quality professional multimodal recipe corpus, authored through a standardized editorial process that decomposes instructions into discrete steps, each paired with corresponding images. We collect TEO annotations as graphs by designing and using a scalable crowdsourcing pipeline.

    "abstract": "In this work, we propose a method for computing centroids, or barycenters, in the spectral Wasserstein-2 metric for sets of power spectral densities, where the barycenters are restricted to belong to the set of all-pole spectra with a certain model order. This may be interpreted as finding an autoregressive representative for sets of second-order stationary Gaussian processes. While Wasserstein, or optimal transport, barycenters have been successfully used earlier in problems of spectral estimation and clustering, the resulting barycenters are non-parametric and the complexity of representing and storing them depends on, e.g., the choice of discretization grid. In contrast, the herein proposed method yields compact, low-dimensional, and interpretable spectral centroids that can be used in downstream tasks. Computing the all-pole centroids corresponds to solving a non-convex optimization problem in the model parameters, and we present a gradient descent scheme for addressing this. Although convergence to a globally optimal point cannot be guaranteed, the sub-optimality of the obtained centroids can be quantified. The proposed method is illustrated on a problem of phoneme classification."

The elimination of Distribution Focal Loss (DFL), implementation of End-to-End NMS-Free Inference, introduction of ProgLoss + Small-Target-Aware Label Assignment (STAL), and use of the MuSGD optimizer are the primary enhancements designed to improve inference speed, which is claimed to achieve a 43% boost in CPU mode. This is designed to allow YOLO26 to attain real-time performance on edge devices or those without GPUs. Additionally, YOLO26 offers improvements in many computer vision tasks, including instance segmentation, pose estimation, and oriented bounding box (OBB) decoding. We aim for this effort to provide more value than just consolidating information already included in the existing technical documentation. Therefore, we performed a rigorous architectural investigation into YOLO26, mostly using the source code available in its GitHub repository and its official documentation. The authentic and detailed operational mechanisms of YOLO26 are inside the source code, which is seldom extracted by others. The YOLO26 architectural diagram is shown as the outcome of the investigation. This study is, to our knowledge, the first one presenting the CNN-based YOLO26 architecture, which is the core of YOLO26. Our objective is to provide a precise architectural comprehension of YOLO26 for researchers and developers aspiring to enhance the YOLO model, ensuring it remains the leading deep learning model in computer vision."

Our main result is that replicability can be achieved in constrained MABs.

It was shown that core magnetic fields, if unaccounted for, can bias the measurements of the gravity offset $ε_g$, which is otherwise well characterised for red giants. Exploiting this bias as a way to detect magnetic fields in the cores of red giants, we wish to increase the number of magnetic field detections in red giants, but also to establish a method that could be widely applicable to all red giants. We selected 218 Kepler red giants showing abnormal measured values of $ε_g$. We used robust statistical criteria based on the expected lifetime of mixed modes to identify significant modes. We then adjusted an asymptotic expression for mixed modes to the observed frequencies, taking magnetic field and rotation into account, using Bayesian inference. We then assessed the probability of magnetic field detection and measured the magnetic field intensity using stellar models for the favourable cases. We found new magnetic red giant stars with fields ranging from 34 to 260 kG. For these stars, we measured values for $ε_g$ now in agreement with the expected value. Adding these new detections to those of previous studies, we showed that the mass distribution of magnetic giants is similar to that of the complete catalogue of red giants, but different from the mass distribution of red giants with suppressed dipole modes. We also found that the core rotation of magnetic red giants follows a similar distribution as red giants in general. This could either mean that the detected fields do not have a predominant impact on the redistribution of angular momentum, or that other red giants also harbour an internal field that is currently non-detectable or has not yet been detected."

Experimental results demonstrate that OmniVTON++ achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse generalization settings, including cross-dataset and cross-garment-type evaluations, while reliably operating across scenarios and diffusion backbones within a single formulation. In addition to single-garment, single-human cases, the framework supports multi-garment, multi-human, and anime character virtual try-on, expanding the scope of virtual try-on applications.

We present SkyReconNet-P, a convolutional neural network for inpainting CMB polarization maps that extends the SkyReconNet framework to jointly reconstruct the polarization $(Q,U)$ maps from partial-sky observations. The method combines regional processing with a hybrid design, utilizing standard convolution and dilated convolution to do a multiscale feature integration. We evaluate performance at both the map and power spectrum level using two masking scenarios: a generated random mask and the Planck 2018 common polarization inpainting mask. For both masking scenarios, SkyReconNet-P reproduces the large-scale morphology of the target maps. In power-spectrum space, we find that the reconstructed $E$-mode spectrum closely tracks the target at low multipoles, while small biases emerge at higher $\\ell$. For $B$-mode, the raw reconstructed spectra exhibit a larger multipole-dependent bias, which we mitigate using a simulation-based linear calibration. We show that the calibrated $B$-mode spectrum preserve more information by comparing it with spectrum estimation using pseudo-$C_\\ell$. Finally, we demonstrate cosmological parameter inference from calibrated reconstructed spectra by fitting $(r, A_{\\rm lens})$ with a Gaussian bandpower likelihood, recovering posteriors consistent with injected parameters across three test ensembles down to $r \\sim 10^{-3}$. These results support inpainting as a complementary route to cut-sky approaches when downstream pipelines can greatly benefit from statistically well-characterized, gap-filled polarization maps."

We consider a non-stationary environment that subsumes both stochastic and adversarial models and where, at each round, both losses and constraints are drawn from distributions that may change arbitrarily over time. In such a setting, it is provably not possible to guarantee both sublinear regret and sublinear violation. Accordingly, prior work has mainly focused either on settings with stochastic constraints or on relaxing the benchmark with fully adversarial constraints (\\emph{e.g.}, via competitive ratios with respect to the optimum). We provide the first algorithms that achieve optimal rates of regret and \\emph{positive} constraint violation when the constraints are stochastic while the losses may vary arbitrarily, and that simultaneously yield guarantees that degrade smoothly with the degree of adversariality of the constraints.

    "abstract": "Autonomous driving in complex traffic requires reasoning under uncertainty. Common approaches rely on prediction-based planning or risk-aware control, but these are typically treated in isolation, limiting their ability to capture the coupled nature of action and inference in interactive settings. This gap becomes especially critical in uncertain scenarios, where simply reacting to predictions can lead to unsafe maneuvers or overly conservative behavior. Our central insight is that safe interaction requires not only estimating human behavior but also shaping it when ambiguity poses risks. To this end, we introduce a hierarchical belief model that structures human behavior across coarse discrete intents and fine motion modes, updated via Bayesian inference for interpretable multi-resolution reasoning. On top of this, we develop an active probing strategy that identifies when multimodal ambiguity in human predictions may compromise safety and plans disambiguating actions that both reveal intent and gently steer human decisions toward safer outcomes. Finally, a runtime risk-evaluation layer based on Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) ensures that all probing actions remain within human risk tolerance during influence. Our simulations in lane-merging and unsignaled intersection scenarios demonstrate that our approach achieves higher success rates and shorter completion times compared to existing methods. These results highlight the benefit of coupling belief inference, probing, and risk monitoring, yielding a principled and interpretable framework for planning under uncertainty."

We find that thermal freeze-in can compensate for the underabundance of PBH-sourced DM, while indirect detection remains largely insensitive due to the feeble interaction strength, making future GW observatories such as LISA and the Einstein Telescope (ET) unique probes of this scenario. For freeze-out DM, indirect detection experiments constrain regions with relatively large annihilation cross-sections, whereas GW observations probe complementary regions with heavier DM masses and smaller interaction strengths. Consequently, the same DM parameter space cannot be simultaneously probed by both indirect detection searches and GW missions. These results establish GW observations as a powerful and independent probe of DM production in PBH-dominated cosmologies, opening a new observational window into DM properties and the thermal history of the pre-BBN Universe."

Human speech is complex, involving smooth transitions between articulatory configurations (ACs). Due to anatomical constraints, some ACs are challenging to mimic or transition between. In this paper, we experimentally study if the constraints imposed by human anatomy have an implication on training an e2e-TTS systems. We experiment with two e2e-TTS architectures, namely, Tacotron-2 an autoregressive model and VITS-TTS a non-autoregressive model. In this study, we build TTS systems using (a) forward text, forward speech (conventional, e2e-TTS), (b) reverse text, reverse speech (r-e2e-TTS), and (c) reverse text, forward speech (rtfs-e2e-TTS).

We introduce prior-channel decompositions of completely positive (CP) maps, which uniquely decompose any CP map into a prior PSD matrix and a quantum channel. This decomposition generalizes the Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism by establishing a bijective correspondence between arbitrary bipartite PSD matrices and channel-state pairs, and we show that it arises naturally from the fidelity projections developed here. As applications, we show that the pretty good measurement - associated with a weighted ensemble - is the fidelity projection of the ensemble onto the set of measurements, and that the Petz recovery map - associated with a reference state and forward channel - is the projection of a CP map (constructed from the channel-state pair) onto the set of reverse quantum channels, thereby recasting the well-known identification of the Petz map with quantum Bayes' rule in information-geometric terms.

    "abstract": "This work introduces a novel two-stage distributed framework to globally estimate constant parameters in a networked system, separating shared information from local estimation. The first stage uses dynamic average consensus to aggregate agents' measurements into surrogates of centralized data. Using these surrogates, the second stage implements a local estimator to determine the parameters. By designing an appropriate consensus gain, the persistence of excitation of the regressor matrix is achieved, and thus, exponential convergence of a local Gradient Estimator (GE) is guaranteed. The framework facilitates its extension to switched network topologies, quantization, and the heterogeneous substitution of the GE with a Dynamic Regressor Extension and Mixing (DREM) estimator, which supports relaxed excitation requirements."

    "abstract": "Estimating causal quantities traditionally relies on bespoke estimators tailored to specific assumptions. Recently proposed Causal Foundation Models (CFMs) promise a more unified approach by amortising causal discovery and inference in a single step. However, in their current state, they do not allow for the incorporation of any domain knowledge, which can lead to suboptimal predictions. We bridge this gap by introducing methods to condition CFMs on causal information, such as the causal graph or more readily available ancestral information. When access to complete causal graph information is too strict a requirement, our approach also effectively leverages partial causal information. We systematically evaluate conditioning strategies and find that injecting learnable biases into the attention mechanism is the most effective method to utilise full and partial causal information. Our experiments show that this conditioning allows a general-purpose CFM to match the performance of specialised models trained on specific causal structures. Overall, our approach addresses a central hurdle on the path towards all-in-one causal foundation models: the capability to answer causal queries in a data-driven manner while effectively leveraging any amount of domain expertise."

    "abstract": "We investigate whether a non-minimal coupling between dark matter and gravity can influence the internal dynamics of ultra-diffuse galaxies. Within this framework, the gravitational potential is modified by an additional term that captures the interaction between spacetime curvature and the dark matter with a coupling constant determined by a length scale $L$. Using spherical Jeans modeling, we analyze the kinematic data of three ultra-diffuse galaxies namely: NGC\\;1052-DF2, NGC\\;1052-DF4, and Dragonfly\\;44, which span the observational extremes from dark matter deficient to dark matter dominated systems. For each galaxy we explore several dark matter halo profiles, two orbital anisotropy models, and both with and without Stellar-to-Halo Mass Relation scenarios, and we perform a Bayesian parameter inference. Our results show that across all the considered configurations, the constrained astrophysical parameters are consistent with standard ones from General Relativity. The posterior distributions of $L$ show no preference for non-zero values and result only in upper limits, suggesting that any non-minimal coupling contribution must be small and perturbative on this scales. Future high precision velocity measurements will be essential to determine whether non-minimal coupling effects can become observationally distinguishable in low-acceleration systems."

Each memristor consists of an integrated Mach-Zehnder interferometer whose transfer function is adaptively updated by photon detection events on another memristor, thus generating novel non-Markovian input-output dynamics with an enhanced memristive behaviour compared to single devices. In particular, we report inter-memristor input-output hysteresis curves exhibiting larger form factors and displaying self-intersecting loops, respectively revealing marked bistability and topologically non-trivial memory dynamics. Furthermore, numerical simulations show how these features emerge from the interplay between memory depth and relative input phase, for both intra- and inter-memristor input-output relations. Our results establish coupled integrated photonic quantum memristors as scalable nonlinear building blocks and highlight their potential for implementing compact quantum neuromorphic and reservoir computing architectures."

While this hypothesis has been tested empirically, prior studies are limited exclusively to text-only inputs, abstracting away from the perceptual context in which utterances are produced. In this work, we present the first computational study of UID in visually grounded settings. We estimate surprisal using multilingual vision-and-language models over image-caption data in 30 languages and visual storytelling data in 13 languages, together spanning 11 families. We find that grounding on perception consistently smooths the distribution of information, increasing both global and local uniformity across typologically diverse languages compared to text-only settings. In visual narratives, grounding in both image and discourse contexts has additional effects, with the strongest surprisal reductions occurring at the onset of discourse units. Overall, this study takes a first step towards modelling the temporal dynamics of information flow in ecologically plausible, multimodal language use, and finds that grounded language exhibits greater information uniformity, supporting a context-sensitive formulation of UID."

This specifies uniquely the data for the unphysical modes in terms of the data for the physical modes. We argue that the apparent breaking of Lorentz invariance associated with this approach is not a problem provided one restricts to Lorentz frames for which the assumptions of effective field theory are manifestly valid."

To overcome this limitation, we present near-infrared LDHM (NIR-LDHM), a in-line holographic platform that operates up to the silicon cutoff (~1100 nm) using a conventional board-level CMOS sensor designed for visible (VIS) imaging. Using tissue-mimicking milk scattering layers and calibrated resolution targets, we quantify reconstruction performance versus wavelength, scattering strength, and sample-sensor distance. NIR-LDHM maintains resolvable features through scattering layers up to ~1.4 mm, whereas visible regime fails to resolve features below ~350 um. Importantly, despite a detector quantum efficiency of only 0.19% at 1100 nm, robust reconstructions are obtained under low-photon-budget conditions. We further identify advantageous mechanism by which increasing the sample-sensor distance from ~3 to 12 mm improves lateral resolution by twofold under strong scattering. Finally, we demonstrate wide-field, label-free amplitude-phase imaging of uncleared mouse tissues, resolving internal structure in brain and liver slices up to ~250 um and ~60 um, respectively.

The proposed MPC framework is designed to minimize deaths, achieve early disease eradication, and adhere to operational constraints. By incorporating an age-structured Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Deceased (SIRD) model with an additional term for vaccination, the MPC strategy dynamically adapts to the evolving epidemic state. A detailed proof of the asymptotic stability and recursive feasibility of the proposed MPC algorithm is provided. This ensures that the optimal cost at each step provides an upper bound on the minimal number obtainable of deaths at the end of the pandemic. Moreover, simulations demonstrate that the proposed MPC approach outperforms the decreasing age vaccination strategy adopted by the Belgian government during the first wave of vaccinations. The results highlight the potential of MPC-based vaccination strategies to reduce the total number of deaths, accelerate disease eradication, and optimize vaccine administration."

Instead, it updates only a minimal set of parameters using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (e.g. LoRA or VPT), guided by gradients calculated directly from the sparse observations available at inference time. This approach effectively grounds the foundation model's geometric prior in the scene-specific measurements, correcting distortions and misplaced structures. For videos, CAPA introduces sequence-level parameter sharing, jointly adapting all frames to exploit temporal correlations, improve robustness, and enforce multi-frame consistency. CAPA is model-agnostic, compatible with any ViT-based FM, and achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse condition patterns on both indoor and outdoor datasets.

We analyse BFMNs from N = 994 observations spanning high school students, university students, and early-career STEM experts, alongside LLM (GPT-oss) \"digital twins\" prompted to emulate comparable profiles. Focusing also on semantic neighbourhoods (\"frames\") around key target concepts (e.g., STEM subjects or educational actors/places), we quantify frames in terms of valence auras, emotional profiles, network overlap (Jaccard similarity), and concreteness relative to null baselines. Across student groups, science and research are consistently framed positively, while their core quantitative subjects (mathematics and statistics) exhibit more negative and anxiety related auras, amplified in higher math-anxiety subgroups, evidencing a STEM-science cognitive and emotional dissonance. High-anxiety frames are also less concrete than chance, suggesting more abstract and decontextualised representations of threatening quantitative domains. Human networks show greater overlapping between mathematics and anxiety than GPT-oss. The results highlight how BFMNs capture cognitive-affective signatures of mindsets towards the target domains and indicate that LLM-based digital twins approximate cultural attitudes but miss key context-sensitive, experience-based components relevant to replicate human educational anxiety."

    "abstract": "With the ongoing transition of electricity markets worldwide from hourly to intra-hourly bidding, market participants--especially Renewable Energy Sources (RES)--gain improved opportunities to adjust energy and reserve schedules and to benefit from more accurate higher-resolution forecasts. However, this shift requires participants to update decision-making frameworks and to strengthen uncertainty management in order to fully exploit the new market potential. In particular, Renewable-Based Virtual Power Plants (RVPPs) aggregating dispatchable and non-dispatchable RES must account for these changes through market-oriented scheduling methods that efficiently address multiple uncertainties, including electricity prices, RES generation, and demand consumption. In this vein, this paper proposes a multi-bound robust optimization framework to simultaneously capture these uncertainties, explicitly incorporate intra-hourly variability, and differentiate the deviation levels (frequent, moderate deviations and rare, extreme ones) of uncertain parameters. The proposed approach yields less conservative and more implementable bidding and scheduling decisions, thus improving RVPP profitability in both energy and reserve markets. Simulation studies compare the proposed method with standard robust optimization and evaluate the operational, market-strategy, and economic impacts of quarter-hourly versus hourly market resolution. Results indicate that the normalized absolute differences, across different uncertainty-handling strategies, between hourly and 15-minute schedules are 18.0--34.2% for day-ahead traded energy, and 28.7--65.6% and 10.1--16.3% for upward and downward reserve traded in the secondary reserve market, respectively. Furthermore, relative to classic robust optimization, the proposed multi-bound approach increases profit by 24.9--49.2% across the considered strategies."

To reduce approximation error without abandoning the low-parameter regime, we introduce a piecewise (\"spline-like\") extension that trains multiple small Horner models on subintervals while enforcing continuity (and first-derivative continuity) at segment boundaries. On illustrative ODE benchmarks and a heat-equation example, Horner networks with tens (or fewer) parameters accurately match the solution and its derivatives and outperform small MLP and sinusoidal-representation baselines under the same training settings, demonstrating a practical accuracy-parameter trade-off for resource-efficient scientific modeling."

The crossing gap (max(i'-i, j'-j) for two crossing push-pop arcs) is the natural candidate. We refute this: we exhibit CFLs whose intersection is CFL despite unbounded-gap crossings. The governing quantity is the inner segment measure: for crossing arcs inducing a decomposition w = P1 P2 P3 P4, it is max(|P2|,|P3|), the length of the longer inner segment between interleaved crossing endpoints. We prove a dichotomy for this measure: bounded inner segments imply context-freeness via a finite buffer construction; growing inner segments with pump-sensitive linkages imply non-context-freeness. The inner segment concept applies to all CFL intersections; the strictness of the resulting characterization depends on the language class. For block-counting CFLs (languages requiring equality among designated pairs of block lengths), the dichotomy is complete: the intersection is CFL if and only if the combined arcs are jointly well-nested. For general CFLs, the CFL direction is unconditional; the non-CFL direction requires pump-sensitive linkages whose necessity is the main open problem, reducing the general CFL intersection problem to a specific property of pump-sensitive decompositions."

Considering an extremely weak disorder and low temperature, we observe a step-wise hysteresis loop and the appearance of short magnetisation bursts of a characteristic triangular shape; the number of bursts increases with disorder, indicative of Barkhausen-type noise. These phenomena are attributed to the simultaneous reversal at a given external field of segments composed of spins with identical neighbourhoods. A local random field orients one or more spin neighbours, resulting in small, ferromagnetic-like clusters distributed throughout the system. As disorder increases, these clusters may merge to form a labyrinthine structure within the antiferromagnetic background, facilitating brief avalanche propagation. The results demonstrate that, compared with familiar random-field ferromagnets, the observed antiferromagnetic Barkhausen noise and the related avalanche sequence have a profoundly different structure, organised into peaks associated with the transition between magnetisation plateaus. They exhibit prominent cyclical trends and disorder-dependent multifractal fluctuations, with the singularity spectrum quantifying the degree of disorder. The activity avalanches exhibit scale invariance resembling that recently found in experiments with disordered ferr\\textit{i}magnets and martensites, as well as in quantum Barkhausen noise, which are associated with active geometric regions rather than individual-spin dynamics. The observed scaling behaviour is interpreted in terms of self-organised critical dynamics."

An open question is whether similar behavior arises when non-reciprocity originates at the Liouvillian level rather than from an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian obtained via post-selection. Here we investigate this scenario in a lattice model with globally reciprocal Liouvillian dynamics and locally asymmetric incoherent hopping, a disordered setting in which Liouvillian-specific effects have remained largely unexplored. While the steady state again shows disorder-dependent, erratic localization without boundary accumulation, we find that global reciprocity in the Liouvillian does not protect transport. Instead, in the regime dominated by incoherent hopping, excitations spread via Sinai-type subdiffusion, dramatically slower than the ordinary diffusion found in symmetric stochastic lattices. Our results reveal a fundamental distinction between globally reciprocal Hamiltonian and Liouvillian dynamics: global reciprocity suppresses the skin effect in both cases, but only in Liouvillian dynamics can it coexist with ultra-slow, disorder-induced subdiffusive transport."

Unfortunately, all existing goal recognition datasets suffer from a systematical bias induced by the planning systems that generated them, namely heuristic-based forward search. This means that existing datasets lack enough challenge for more realistic scenarios (e.g., agents using different planners), which impacts the evaluation of goal recognisers with respect to using different planners for the same goal. In this paper, we propose a new method that uses top-k planning to generate multiple, different, plans for the same goal hypothesis, yielding benchmarks that mitigate the bias found in the current dataset. This allows us to introduce a new metric called Version Coverage Score (VCS) to measure the resilience of the goal recogniser when inferring a goal based on different sets of plans. Our results show that the resilience of the current state-of-the-art goal recogniser degrades substantially under low observability settings."

Furthermore, we show that the effectiveness of DA varies depending on the SE model, with DA being more beneficial for predictive SE models. While our results demonstrate that DA improves SE performance for pathological speakers, a performance gap between neurotypical and pathological speech persists, highlighting the need for future research on targeted DA strategies for pathological speech."

    "abstract": "We study the problem of the boundary conditions in the numerical simulation of closed and open quantum systems, described by a Schrödinger equation. On one hand, we show that a closed quantum system is defined by local boundary conditions. On the other hand, we argue that, because of the uncertainty principle, no local boundary condition can be defined for open quantum systems. For this reason plane waves or wave packet trains cannot be simulated on a finite numerical lattice with the usual procedures. We suggest a method that avoids these difficulties by using only a small numerical lattice and maintains the correspondence with the physical picture, in which the incident and scattered waves may be infinitely extended."

    "abstract": "A major challenge in open quantum dynamics is the inclusion of Matsubara-decay terms in the memory kernel, which arise from the quantum-Boltzmann delocalisation of the bath modes. This delocalisation can be quantified by the radius of gyration squared ${\\mathcal R}^2(ω)$ of the imaginary-time Feynman paths of the bath modes as a function of the frequency $ω$. In a Hierarchical Equations of Motion (HEOM) calculation with a Debye--Drude spectral density, ${\\mathcal R}^2(ω)$ is the only quantity that is treated approximately (assuming convergence with respect to hierarchy depth). Here, we show that the well-known Ishizaki--Tanimura correction is equivalent to separating smooth from `Brownian' contributions to ${\\mathcal R}^2(ω)$, and that modifying the correction leads to a more efficient HEOM in the case of fast baths. We also develop a simple `A4' adaptation of the `AAA' (Adaptive Antoulas--Anderson) algorithm in order to fit ${\\mathcal R}^2(ω)$ to a sum over poles, which results in an extremely efficient implementation of the standard HEOM method at low temperatures."

Classical machine-learning methods can struggle under these conditions, motivating the search for alternatives. In this work, we investigate quantum reservoir computing (QRC), using both noiseless emulation and hardware execution on the neutral-atom Rydberg processor \\textit{Aquila}. We evaluate performance with six classical machine-learning models and use SHAP to generate feature subsets. We find that models trained on emulated quantum features achieve mean test accuracies comparable to those trained on classical features, but have higher training accuracies and greater variability over data splits, consistent with overfitting. When comparing hardware execution of QRC to noiseless emulation, the models are more robust over different data splits and often exhibit statistically significant improvements in mean test accuracy. This combination of improved accuracy and increased stability is suggestive of a regularising effect induced by hardware execution. To investigate the origin of this behaviour, we examine the statistical differences between hardware and emulated quantum feature distributions. We find that hardware execution applies a structured, time-dependent transformation characterised by compression toward the mean and a progressive reduction in mutual information relative to emulation."

A finitary coding formalizes how a random field with nontrivial dependence, such as the Ising model, can be generated from an i.i.d.\\ source by a shift-equivariant map that determines each output spin from a finite, configuration-dependent window of the input. Gaussian concentration yields uniform sub-Gaussian fluctuation bounds for all local observables. Our main abstract result shows that Gaussian concentration is preserved under finitary codings of i.i.d.\\ fields provided the coding volume has finite second moment. The proof relies on a refinement of the classical worst-case bounded-differences inequality of Talagrand and Marton, allowing us to exploit configuration-dependent bounds. Under an additional structural condition that we call the short-range factorization property, satisfied in particular by codings constructed via coupling-from-the-past algorithms, finite first moment of the coding volume already suffices. These moment conditions are sharp. Applications include Gibbs measures and Markov random fields on $\\mathbb Z^d$, probabilistic cellular automata, and one-dimensional stochastic processes. For classical lattice models such as the Ising, Potts, and random-cluster models, we obtain sharp criteria for Gaussian concentration coinciding with uniqueness regimes. For countable-state Markov chains, we derive equivalent characterizations, including geometric ergodicity, exponential return-time tails, and the existence of finitary i.i.d.\\ codings with exponential tails."

    "abstract": "With the advent of nonrelativistic spin splitting in collinear compensated antiferromagnets, several candidate materials have also been proposed, among which the family of transition-metal difluorides stands out as a prominent example. Within this family, most members exhibit planar $d$-wave spin splitting, whereas CuF$_2$ shows bulk $d$-wave splitting with an explicit $k_z$ dependence. In this work, we show that this transition from planar to bulk $d$-wave splitting in CuF$_2$ is primarily driven by the antipolar displacements of the F ions, which are absent in the tetragonal rutile structure of the other family members. Our calculations reveal that these additional structural distortions introduce an extra plane of anisotropic magnetization density, giving rise to an additional totally symmetric component of the magnetic octupole tensor. The $k$-space representation of this octupole component, consequently, dictates an additional direction of spin splitting, thereby transforming the $d$-wave spin splitting pattern from planar to bulk-like. We further analyze the effect of spin-orbit coupling on the magnetic octupoles and the resulting spin splitting in the band structure. Our work highlights the possibility of controlling the pattern of nonrelativistic spin splitting through structural modifications, for example, via the application of external pressure."

To combat this lethal opioid crisis, graph learning methods have emerged as a promising paradigm for modeling complex drug-related phenomena. However, a significant gap remains: there is no comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating these methods across real-world opioid crisis scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce OPBench, the first comprehensive opioid benchmark comprising five datasets across three critical application domains: opioid overdose detection from healthcare claims, illicit drug trafficking detection from digital platforms, and drug misuse prediction from dietary patterns. Specifically, OPBench incorporates diverse graph structures, including heterogeneous graphs and hypergraphs, to preserve the rich and complex relational information among drug-related data. To address data scarcity, we collaborate with domain experts and authoritative institutions to curate and annotate datasets while adhering to privacy and ethical guidelines. Furthermore, we establish a unified evaluation framework with standardized protocols, predefined data splits, and reproducible baselines to facilitate fair and systematic comparison among graph learning methods. Through extensive experiments, we analyze the strengths and limitations of existing graph learning methods, thereby providing actionable insights for future research in combating the opioid crisis.

    "abstract": "Many real-world control problems, ranging from finance to robotics, evolve in continuous time with non-uniform, event-driven decisions. Standard discrete-time reinforcement learning (RL), based on fixed-step Bellman updates, struggles in this setting: as time gaps shrink, the $Q$-function collapses to the value function $V$, eliminating action ranking. Existing continuous-time methods reintroduce action information via an advantage-rate function $q$. However, they enforce optimality through complicated martingale losses or orthogonality constraints, which are sensitive to the choice of test processes. These approaches entangle $V$ and $q$ into a large, complex optimization problem that is difficult to train reliably. To address these limitations, we propose a novel decoupled continuous-time actor-critic algorithm with alternating updates: $q$ is learned from diffusion generators on $V$, and $V$ is updated via a Hamiltonian-based value flow that remains informative under infinitesimal time steps, where standard max/softmax backups fail. Theoretically, we prove rigorous convergence via new probabilistic arguments, sidestepping the challenge that generator-based Hamiltonians lack Bellman-style contraction under the sup-norm. Empirically, our method outperforms prior continuous-time and leading discrete-time baselines across challenging continuous-control benchmarks and a real-world trading task, achieving 21% profit over a single quarter$-$nearly doubling the second-best method."

In particular, edges appear and disappear over time depending on the states of the two connected vertices, on how long they have been infected, and on the total density of susceptible and infected vertices. Our main results establish functional laws of large numbers for the densities of susceptible, infected, and recovered vertices, jointly with the underlying evolving random graphs in the graphon space. Our results are supported by simulations, which characterize the limiting size of the epidemics, i.e., the limiting density of susceptible vertices, and how the peak of the epidemics depends on the rate of the evolution of the underlying graph. The proofs of our main results rely on the careful construction of a mimicking process, obtained by approximating the two-way feedback interaction between vertex and edge dynamics with a mean-field type interaction, acting only as one-way feedback, that remains sufficiently close to the original co-evolutionary process. To treat the more general setting in which edge dynamics are affected by the proportions of susceptible and infected individuals, we introduce a methodological extension of existing techniques. We thus show that our model exhibits multiple epidemic peaks -- a phenomenon observed in real-world epidemics -- which can emerge in models that incorporate mutual feedback between vertex and edge dynamics."

To realistically model the snap-fit assembly process, we develop and evaluate two types of joining models: analytical models based on beam theory and rigid-body models implemented in the MuJoCo physics engine. These models enable accurate simulation of interaction forces, essential for training DRL agents. The robot skills are structured using the pitasc framework, allowing modular, reusable control strategies. Training is conducted in simulation using Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithms. Domain randomization is applied to improve robustness. The trained policies are transferred to a physical UR10e robot system without additional tuning. Experimental results demonstrate high success rates (up to 100%) in both simulation and real-world settings, even under significant positional and rotational deviations. The system generalizes well to new terminal types and positions, significantly reducing manual programming effort.

    "abstract": "Despite legal mandates for the right to be forgotten, AI operators routinely fail to comply with data deletion requests. While machine unlearning (MU) provides a technical solution to remove personal data's influence from trained models, ensuring compliance remains challenging due to the fundamental gap between MU's technical feasibility and regulatory implementation. In this paper, we introduce the first economic framework for auditing MU compliance, by integrating certified unlearning theory with regulatory enforcement. We first characterize MU's inherent verification uncertainty using a hypothesis-testing interpretation of certified unlearning to derive the auditor's detection capability, and then propose a game-theoretic model to capture the strategic interactions between the auditor and the operator. A key technical challenge arises from MU-specific nonlinearities inherent in the model utility and the detection probability, which create complex strategic couplings that traditional auditing frameworks do not address and that also preclude closed-form solutions. We address this by transforming the complex bivariate nonlinear fixed-point problem into a tractable univariate auxiliary problem, enabling us to decouple the system and establish the equilibrium existence, uniqueness, and structural properties without relying on explicit solutions. Counterintuitively, our analysis reveals that the auditor can optimally reduce the inspection intensity as deletion requests increase, since the operator's weakened unlearning makes non-compliance easier to detect. This is consistent with recent auditing reductions in China despite growing deletion requests. Moreover, we prove that although undisclosed auditing offers informational advantages for the auditor, it paradoxically reduces the regulatory cost-effectiveness relative to disclosed auditing."

This flux induces azimuthal density modulations in the condensate, whose periodicity is uniquely determined by the quantized toroidal magnetic flux-a hallmark of the Hall torus geometry. By varying the relative phase between the couplings across repeated experimental runs, we control the location of the density extrema, emulating the behavior of Thouless charge pump in a toroidal geometry. We further investigate the onset of these modulations as the system transitions from a cylindrical to a toroidal topology.

To further enhance inference, we introduce Chain-of-Motion (CoM), a test-time reasoning method that enables step-by-step planning and reflection. We also construct two large-scale CoT datasets, MoUnd-CoT-140K and MoGen-CoT-140K, to align motion sequences with reasoning traces and action descriptions. Experiments on HumanML3D and KIT-ML show that MoRL achieves significant gains over state-of-the-art baselines. Code: https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/MoRL.

    "abstract": "A model-agnostic description of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature in redshift space requires a number of ingredients. Physically, one must describe the impact of cosmological bulk flows which progressively and anisotropically smear out the feature over time. One must also model the effects of the scale dependence of tracer bias and the mode coupling between short and long scales. All of these can be incorporated using the Zel'dovich approximation alone, without reference to any particular cosmological model. On the technical front, one needs a robust, complete and cosmology-independent basis to describe the shape of the real space BAO feature in linear theory, which can then be propagated to the nonlinearly evolved, measured feature in redshift space. In this work, we describe how these ingredients -- which we have systematically constructed in recent work -- come together in an accurate framework capable of describing the BAO-scale pairwise measurements of state-of-the-art galaxy surveys. Using mock observations and $N$-body simulations, we show that our template-free framework can produce unbiased and precise cosmological constraints for samples with realistic levels of nonlinearity. This work represents one of the final steps in constructing a data-ready analysis framework for model-agnostic cosmological inference from the BAO feature."

Addressing the scarcity of parallel corpora that map between styles, the study employs roundtrip translation to synthesize such parallel datasets from monolingual corpora. This approach creates 'neutralized' text devoid of stylistic attributes, essentially creating a shared input style at training-time and inference-time. Experimental results demonstrate consistent superiority of this method over zero-shot prompting and fewshot ICL techniques measured by BLEU scores and style accuracy scores across four investigated domains. Furthermore, the integration of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for terminology and name knowledge enhances robustness and stylistic consistency."

    "abstract": "Many robot tasks require attending to the history of past observations. For example, finding an item in a room requires remembering which places have already been searched. However, the best-performing robot policies typically condition only on the current observation, limiting their applicability to such tasks. Naively conditioning on past observations often fails due to spurious correlations: policies latch onto incidental features of training histories that do not generalize to out-of-distribution trajectories upon deployment. We analyze why policies latch onto these spurious correlations and find that this problem stems from limited coverage over the space of possible histories during training, which grows exponentially with horizon. Existing regularization techniques provide inconsistent benefits across tasks, as they do not fundamentally address this coverage problem. Motivated by these findings, we propose Big Picture Policies (BPP), an approach that conditions on a minimal set of meaningful keyframes detected by a vision-language model. By projecting diverse rollouts onto a compact set of task-relevant events, BPP substantially reduces distribution shift between training and deployment, without sacrificing expressivity. We evaluate BPP on four challenging real-world manipulation tasks and three simulation tasks, all requiring history conditioning. BPP achieves 70% higher success rates than the best comparison on real-world evaluations."

The onset of HD is marked by severe motor impairment, which may be predicted by prior cognitive decline and, in turn, exacerbate cognitive deficits. Clinical data, however, are often collected at discrete time points, so the timing of disease onset is subject to interval censoring. To address the challenges posed by such data, we develop a joint model for multivariate longitudinal biomarkers with a change point anchored at an interval-censored event time. The model simultaneously assesses the effects of longitudinal biomarkers on the event time and the changes in biomarker trajectories following the event. We conduct a comprehensive simulation study to demonstrate the finite-sample performance of the proposed method for causal inference. Finally, we apply the method to PREDICT-HD, a multisite observational cohort study of prodromal HD individuals, to ascertain how cognitive impairment and motor dysfunction interact during disease progression."

In our approach, we propose to capture a system's (stochastic) behavior using interval Hidden Markov Models (iHMMs). The monitor then uses this learned iHMM to derive risk estimates for potential safety violations. The paper makes three key contributions: (1) it provides a formalization of the problem of learning robust runtime monitors, (2) introduces a novel framework that uses conformance-testing-based refinement for learning robust iHMMs with convergence guarantees, and (3) presents an efficient monitoring algorithm for computing risk estimates over iHMMs. Our empirical results demonstrate the efficacy of monitors learned using our approach, particularly when compared to model-free monitoring approaches that rely solely on collected data without access to a system model."

    "abstract": "Quantum electrodynamics (QED), the first relativistic quantum field theory, describes light-matter interactions at a fundamental level and is one of the pillars of the Standard Model (SM). Through the extraordinary precision of QED, the SM predicts the energy levels of simple systems such as the hydrogen atom with up to 13 significant digits, making hydrogen spectroscopy an ideal test bed. The consistency of physical constants extracted from different transitions in hydrogen using QED, such as the proton charge radius $r_\\mathrm{p}$, constitutes a test of the theory. However, values of $r_\\mathrm{p}$ from recent measurements of atomic hydrogen are partly discrepant with each other and with a more precise value from spectroscopy of muonic hydrogen. This prevents a test of QED at the level of experimental uncertainties. Here we present a measurement of the 2S-6P transition in atomic hydrogen with sufficient precision to distinguish between the discrepant values of $r_\\mathrm{p}$ and enable rigorous testing of QED and the SM overall. Our result $ν^{}_{\\text{2S-6P}}$ = 730,690,248,610.79(48) kHz gives a value of $r_\\mathrm{p}$ = 0.8406(15) fm at least 2.5-fold more precise than from other atomic hydrogen determinations and in excellent agreement with the muonic value. The SM prediction of the transition frequency (730,690,248,610.79(23) kHz) is in excellent agreement with our result, testing the SM to 0.7 parts per trillion (ppt) and, specifically, bound-state QED corrections to 0.5 parts per million (ppm), their most precise test so far."

Despite their chemical value, they remain underexplored in generative modeling, likely owing to their scarcity in public datasets and the challenges of enforcing topological constraints in standard deep generative models. We introduce MacroGuide: Topological Guidance for Macrocycle Generation, a diffusion guidance mechanism that uses Persistent Homology to steer the sampling of pretrained molecular generative models toward the generation of macrocycles, in both unconditional and conditional (protein pocket) settings. At each denoising step, MacroGuide constructs a Vietoris-Rips complex from atomic positions and promotes ring formation by optimizing persistent homology features. Empirically, applying MacroGuide to pretrained diffusion models increases macrocycle generation rates from 1% to 99%, while matching or exceeding state-of-the-art performance on key quality metrics such as chemical validity, diversity, and PoseBusters checks."

However, as the center of the energy window goes to infinity, black hole physics predicts that these states become orthogonal to every state with a finite number of particles. Given that the spectral measure in energy is determined by Poincare invariance, the S-matrix cannot be a unitary operator in Fock space, despite having finite matrix elements in Fock space, and satisfying perturbative unitarity, to all orders in string perturbation theory. We identify regimes in the BFSS matrix model\\cite{bfss} and the definition of the S-matrix as the limit of CFT correlators\\cite{polchsuss}, which point to the same conclusion. We review a scattering theory based on the quantum mechanics of a finite number of fermionic oscillators, whose algebra formally converges to the Super-Poincare covariant Awada-Gibbons-Shaw\\cite{ags} algebra, and argue that a certain class of limiting states on that algebra satisfy all the properties required by physical unitarity in the algebraic formulation of quantum mechanics. The only missing ingredient for a consistent theory is a proof that the S matrix amplitudes themselves are Poincare invariant. We provide suggestive arguments, but no real proof, that this is so."

    "abstract": "The results of interferometric observations of the star-forming region S255IR in the frequency range 210--250 GHz are presented. The observations were carried out with the antenna array SMA (Hawaii, USA). Fifty-three molecules were detected, including complex organic molecules (COMs) such as CH$_3$CHO, CH$_3$CN, CH$_3$CH$_2$CN, and many others. Typical rotational temperatures in the hot core SMA1 fall in the range 100--200 K. Optical depths in the lines of methanol and some other molecules in the cores SMA1 and SMA2 were estimated. In SMA1, the optical depth of one of the strongest methanol lines, $5_{-1}-4_{-1}E$, proved to be $23.8 \\pm 1.5$. Based on this value, one can assume that the lines of other oxygen-containing COMs, such as CH$_3$OCHO, CH$_3$OCH$_3$, CH$_3$CH$_2$OH, which are typically much less abundant in hot cores than methanol, are optically thin in SMA1. Most of the detected molecules can be roughly divided into two groups. The molecules of the first group emit exclusively toward the hot core SMA1, while some or all lines of the molecules of the second group, in addition to SMA1, can be seen toward a ring-like structure to the west of SMA1. This structure is most likely associated with the walls of a cavity formed by high-velocity outflows driven by young stellar objects (YSOs) in molecular cores SMA1, SMA2, and possibly SMA3. The gas temperature and density in the cavity walls were estimated using methanol lines. The temperature was found to be about 50--60 K, and the density about $10^7-10^8$ cm$^{-3}$. The column density of methanol near the brightness peaks in the lines of this molecule is about $5\\times 10^{15}$~cm$^{-2}$. The column densities of other COMs in the ring-like structure will be determined in future studies with increased sensitivity achieved by spectral line stacking."

To address this, we introduce Gaussian Process Activations (GAPA), a post-hoc method that shifts Bayesian modeling from weights to activations. GAPA replaces standard nonlinearities with Gaussian-process activations whose posterior mean exactly matches the original activation, preserving the backbone's point predictions by construction while providing closed-form epistemic variances in activation space. To scale to modern architectures, we use a sparse variational inducing-point approximation over cached training activations, combined with local k-nearest-neighbor subset conditioning, enabling deterministic single-pass uncertainty propagation without sampling, backpropagation, or second-order information. Across regression, classification, image segmentation, and language modeling, GAPA matches or outperforms strong post-hoc baselines in calibration and out-of-distribution detection while remaining efficient at test time."

While several candidate chromophores have been proposed, no clear conclusions have been reached regarding its nature, evolution, or relationship to atmospheric dynamics. In this work, we perform microphysical simulations of the reddish haze over the GRS and quantify the production rates and timescales required to sustain it. Matching the previously reported chromophore column mass and effective radius in the GRS requires column-integrated injection fluxes in the range $1\\times10^{-12}$-$7\\times10^{-12}$ kg m$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, under low upwelling velocities in the upper troposphere ($v_{\\mathrm{trop}}\\lesssim 1.5\\times10^{-4}$ m s$^{-1}$) and particle charges of at least 20 electrons per $μ$m. Such rates exceed the mass flux that standard photochemical models of Jupiter currently supply via NH$_3$-C$_2$H$_2$ photochemistry at 0.1-0.2 bar, the most popular chromophore pathway in recent literature. We find a lower limit of 7 years on the haze formation time. We also assess commonly used size and vertical distribution parameterisations for the chromophore haze, finding that eddy diffusion prevents the long-term confinement of a thin layer and that the extinction is dominated by particles that can be represented by a single log-normal size distribution."

A PBH-style framework for functional system properties is developed, providing necessary and sufficient spectral characterisations. The results apply uniformly to diagonalizable and non-diagonalizable systems and recover the classical PBH tests as special cases. Two new intrinsic notions are introduced: intrinsic functional controllability, and intrinsic functional stabilizability. These intrinsic properties are formulated directly in terms of invariant subspaces associated with the functional and provide verifiable conditions for the existence of admissible augmentations required for functional controller design and observer-based functional controller design. The intrinsic framework enables the generalized separation principle at the functional level, establishing that functional controllers and functional observers can be designed independently. Illustrative examples demonstrate the theory and highlight situations where functional control and estimation are possible despite lack of full-state controllability or observability."

    "abstract": "The dynamics of many of Antarctica's glaciers are modulated by a hydrological system at the base of the ice. Sedimentary basins beneath the ice bed contribute to the water budget in this hydrological system by discharging or taking up water. However, sedimentary basins are not included in most current models of ice dynamics, and little is known about their effect. In this paper we develop an idealised model of a glacier whose sliding is coupled to a subglacial hydrological system, which includes a sedimentary basin. We find that groundwater discharge (exfiltration) and recharge (infiltration) are controlled by the shape of the ice sheet and of the sedimentary basin, and that exfiltration promotes sliding whereas infiltration hinders it. Overall, the presence of a sedimentary basin leads to thicker and slower-flowing ice in the steady state. We also find that, when the ice sheet is undergoing retreating, groundwater exfiltration can lead to a positive feedback which accelerates this retreat. Our results shed light on the potential role and importance of Antarctic sedimentary basins, and how these might be incorporated into existing models of ice and subglacial hydrology."

While the resemblance to human-like reasoning is undeniable, the driving forces underpinning the success of CoT reasoning still remain largely unclear. In this work, we perform an in-depth analysis of CoT traces originating from competition-level mathematics questions, with the aim of better understanding how, and which parts of CoT actually contribute to the final answer. To this end, we introduce the notion of a potential, quantifying how much a given part of CoT increases the likelihood of a correct completion. Upon examination of reasoning traces through the lens of the potential, we identify surprising patterns including (1) its often strong non-monotonicity (due to reasoning tangents), (2) very sharp but sometimes tough to interpret spikes (reasoning insights and jumps) as well as (3) at times lucky guesses, where the model arrives at the correct answer without providing any relevant justifications before. While some of the behaviours of the potential are readily interpretable and align with human intuition (such as insights and tangents), others remain difficult to understand from a human perspective. To further quantify the reliance of LLMs on reasoning insights, we investigate the notion of CoT transferability, where we measure the potential of a weaker model under the partial CoT from another, stronger model. Indeed aligning with our previous results, we find that as little as 20% of partial CoT can ``unlock'' the performance of the weaker model on problems that were previously unsolvable for it, highlighting that a large part of the mechanics underpinning CoT are transferable."

As a result, for any given query, agents must reliably select the right specialist model from a heterogeneous pool of tool candidates. To this end, we introduce ToolSelect, which adaptively learns model selection for tools by minimizing a population risk over sampled specialist tool candidates using a consistent surrogate of the task-conditional selection loss. Concretely, we propose an Attentive Neural Process-based selector conditioned on the query and per-model behavioral summaries to choose among the specialist models. Motivated by the absence of any established testbed, we, for the first time, introduce an agentic Chest X-ray environment equipped with a diverse suite of task-specialized models (17 disease detection, 19 report generation, 6 visual grounding, and 13 VQA) and develop ToolSelectBench, a benchmark of 1448 queries.

We compute synthetic spectra for late-type M giants and identify systematic discrepancies in the wavelength range 5810-5850 A. To investigate the origin of these discrepancies, we analyse experimental TiO absorption cross-sections. We report the detection of a molecular band of the singlet system $^{1}Π$-a$^{1}Δ$ of the TiO, with an R-head located at 5814.8 A, overlapping the 1-3 band of the C$^3Δ$-X$^3Δ$ system. The lower state of the band is identified as the a$^1Δ$ v\"=0 state, while the upper state is most likely the $^1Π$ in its ground vibrational state. The empirical band intensity is derived by comparing the relative strengths of neighbouring bands from the C$^3Δ$-X$^3Δ$ and B$^3Π$-X$^3Δ$ systems in the experimental cross-section. The band intensity is further validated by synthetic spectrum calculations for the late-type giant 30 Her (M6 III) and comparison with its observed spectrum from the MELCHIORS library. The newly identified band is sufficiently strong to affect the flux distribution in the spectra of cool stars."

Assuming that $M^{n}$ satisfies suitable curvature constraints, we investigate rigidity results for such submanifolds. By combining a Simons-type formula for spacelike submanifolds with analytic techniques involving the Cheng-Yau modified operator $\\mathcal{L}$, we establish sharp inequalities relating the traceless second fundamental form and the gradient of the mean curvature. As applications, we obtain several characterization results showing that $M^{n}$ must be either totally umbilical or isoparametric. More precisely, we derive rigidity results under three distinct frameworks: via the Omori-Yau maximum principle, via the $\\mathcal{L}$-parabolicity of the underlying manifold, and under an integrability condition on the gradient of the mean curvature. These results generalize and unify known classification theorems for spacelike submanifolds satisfying linear Weingarten relations in semi-Riemannian ambient spaces."

Within this same inner radius, the surface brightness and density of the ICM is sharply peaked, and the cooling time falls to $t_\\mathrm{cool}=280^{+150}_{-120}$ Myr. A novel forward-modeling analysis of the XMM data extends imaging and spectroscopic measurements of this system out to $r_{500}$, constraining the redshift to $z=1.50\\pm0.03$, with a mean temperature of $kT = 7.3\\pm1.1$ keV and an emission-weighted mean metallicity of $Z/Z_\\odot = 0.43^{+0.46}_{-0.25}$. We also utilize the limited optical/IR photometric coverage of the cluster to characterize the properties of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), which is coincident with the X-ray peak. Despite the high redshift and strong cool core, the BCG exhibits no signs of recent or ongoing star formation, suggesting AGN feedback has been acting persistently to stem star formation since $z\\sim 2.5$.

The continuum is treated in terms of quasi-atoms of different size, comprising composite medium. The parameters of interaction potential between the quasi-atoms are optimized to match elastic properties of the composite medium to those of the atomic one. The optimization method coincides conceptually with the online Machine Learning (ML) methods, making it computationally very efficient. Such an approach allows a straightforward application of standard software packages for molecular dynamics (MD), supplemented by the ML-based optimizer. The new method is applied to model systems with a simple, pairwise Lennard-Jones potential, as well with multi-body Tersoff potential, describing covalent bonds. Using LAMMPS software we simulate collision of particles of different size. Comparing simulation results, obtained by the novel method, with full-atomic simulations, we demonstrate its accuracy, validity and overwhelming superiority in computational speed. Furthermore, we compare our method with other hybrid methods, specifically, with the closest one -- AtC (Atomic to Continuum) method. We demonstrate a significant superiority of our approach in computational speed and implementation convenience. Finally, we discuss a possible extension of the method for modeling other phenomena."

To analyze typical behavior in the large-strategy limit, we develop a nested replica framework for this relaxation.

In this work, we present a method to improve the performance of STA predictions. Our contributions are two-fold: 1 We propose STAformer and STAformer plus plus, two novel attention-based architectures integrating frame-guided temporal pooling, dual image-video attention, and multiscale feature fusion to support STA predictions from an image-input video pair; 2 We introduce two novel modules to ground STA predictions on human behavior by modeling affordances. First, we integrate an environment affordance model which acts as a persistent memory of interactions that can take place in a given physical scene. We explore how to integrate environment affordances via simple late fusion and with an approach which adaptively learns how to best fuse affordances with end-to-end predictions. Second, we predict interaction hotspots from the observation of hands and object trajectories, increasing confidence in STA predictions localized around the hotspot. Our results show significant improvements on Overall Top-5 mAP, with gain up to +23p.p on Ego4D and +31p.p on a novel set of curated EPIC-Kitchens STA labels.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) and multimodal models have become powerful general-purpose reasoning systems. However, radio-frequency (RF) signals, which underpin wireless systems, are still not natively supported by these models. Existing LLM-based approaches for telecom focus mainly on text and structured data, while conventional RF deep-learning models are built separately for specific signal-processing tasks, highlighting a clear gap between RF perception and high-level reasoning. To bridge this gap, we introduce RF-GPT, a radio-frequency language model (RFLM) that utilizes the visual encoders of multimodal LLMs to process and understand RF spectrograms. In this framework, complex in-phase/quadrature (IQ) waveforms are mapped to time-frequency spectrograms and then passed to pretrained visual encoders. The resulting representations are injected as RF tokens into a decoder-only LLM, which generates RF-grounded answers, explanations, and structured outputs. To train RF-GPT, we perform supervised instruction fine-tuning of a pretrained multimodal LLM using a fully synthetic RF corpus. Standards-compliant waveform generators produce wideband scenes for six wireless technologies, from which we derive time-frequency spectrograms, exact configuration metadata, and dense captions. A text-only LLM then converts these captions into RF-grounded instruction-answer pairs, yielding roughly 12,000 RF scenes and 0.625 million instruction examples without any manual labeling. Across benchmarks for wideband modulation classification, overlap analysis, wireless-technology recognition, WLAN user counting, and 5G NR information extraction, RF-GPT achieves strong multi-task performance, whereas general-purpose VLMs with no RF grounding largely fail."

In 2023, Xu et al. introduced a construction framework for 3-dimensional linear codes parameterized by two functions, which has demonstrated considerable success in generating infinite families of optimal linear codes. Motivated by this approach, we propose a construction that extends the framework to three functions, thereby enhancing the flexibility of the parameters. Additionally, we introduce a vectorial setting by allowing vector-valued functions, expanding the construction space and the set of achievable structural properties. We analyze both scalar and vectorial frameworks, employing Bent and s-Plateaued functions, including Almost Bent, to define the code generators. By exploiting the properties of the Walsh transform, we determine the explicit parameters and weight distributions of these codes and their punctured versions. A key result of this study is that the constructed codes have few weights, and their duals are distance and dimensionally optimal with respect to both the Sphere Packing and Griesmer bounds. Furthermore, we establish a theoretical connection between our vectorial approach and the classical first generic construction of linear codes, providing sufficient conditions for the resulting codes to be minimal and self-orthogonal. Finally, we investigate applications to quantum coding theory within the Calderbank-Shor-Steane framework."

By using consensus based parameter updates, and a local Hessian based descent direction at the individual nodes with gradient tracking, we first explicitly characterize a global linear convergence rate for Network-GIANT, which can be computed as the spectral radius of a $3 \\times 3$ matrix dependent on the Lipschitz continuity ($L$) and strong convexity ($μ$) parameters of the objective functions, and the spectral norm ($σ$) of the underlying undirected graph represented by a doubly stochastic consensus matrix. We provide an explicit bound on the step size parameter $η$, below which this spectral radius is guaranteed to be less than $1$. Furthermore, we derive a mixed linear-quadratic inequality based upper bound for the optimality gap norm, which allows us to conclude that, under small step size values, asymptotically, as the algorithm approaches the global optimum, it achieves a locally linear convergence rate of $1-η(1 -\\fracγμ)$ for Network-GIANT, provided the Hessian approximation error $γ$ (between the harmonic mean of the local Hessians and the global hessian (the arithmetic mean of the local Hessians) is smaller than $μ$. This asymptotically linear convergence rate of $\\approx 1-η$ explains the faster convergence rate of Network-GIANT for the first time. Numerical experiments are carried out with a reduced CovType dataset for binary logistic regression over a variety of graphs to illustrate the above theoretical results."

In this work, we study how uncertainties in the binary formation channel affect the predicted cross-correlation signal for both current-generation and next-generation networks of detectors. We generate five mock GW catalogues for which we vary the progenitor-to-remnant mass-transfer function and the time-delay probability distribution between progenitor and remnant. We then cross-correlate these catalogues with galaxy samples modelled on the 2MASS Photometric Redshift catalogue (2MPZ) and the Gaia-unWISE quasar catalogue (Quaia). We find that the mass-transfer function has negligible effect on the cross-correlation signal, with differences remaining within redshift uncertainties. In contrast, the time-delay distribution dramatically affects the redshift distribution of the GW events and, with it, the cross-correlation signal, particularly for shallow galaxy catalogues. In particular, current-generation facilities can achieve significant detections only for the longest time delays when cross-correlated with 2MPZ, whilst all cross-correlations with the deeper Quaia catalogue are marginally detectable or consistent with zero. Our exploratory results thus demonstrate that forecasts on cosmological or astrophysical parameters derived from GW-galaxy cross-correlations are, as expected, strongly sensitive to the assumed binary formation history."

This is achieved by combining a frequency-domain-based homogenization technique with the harmonic balance FE method. The simulation results for the magnetic flux density along the axis of the FC magnets as a function of frequency and the resulting integrated transfer function (ITF) are compared to Hall probe and search coil measurements of the first prototype FC magnet for PETRA IV.

Comprehensive knowledge of a defect's electronic structure is essential for interpreting spin-optical dynamics and for the reliable design and optimization of defect-based quantum devices. Despite extensive study, our knowledge of the electronic structure of $\\mathrm{V_{Si}^{-}}$\\ is limited since key excited-state manifolds have remained inaccessible to conventional steady-state spectroscopy. In this study, transient absorption spectroscopy is utilized to probe non-equilibrium electronic transitions of $\\mathrm{V_{Si}^{-}}$\\ and to uncover previously unobserved excited states. The first direct observation of the elusive V2' quartet transition is presented, with its broad spectral signature attributed to nonadiabatic vibronic coupling. Within the spin-doublet manifold, which is central to optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) but has remained unresolved spectroscopically, multiple optical transitions are identified. The complete electronic level structure in the relevant energy range is elucidated by combining polarization-resolved spectroscopy, group-theoretical analysis, quantum embedding calculations and first-principles optical lineshape modeling. Collectively, these results provide a microscopic understanding of the $\\mathrm{V_{Si}^{-}}$\\ electronic structure.

Vertices carry i.i.d. weights $(W_x)$ and, conditionally on the vertex set and the weights, edges are present independently with probability $p_{xy}=1-\\exp\\{-λW_xW_y/|x-y|^α\\}$. Assuming Pareto-type weight tails with index $β>0$ and working in parameter ranges where degrees are almost surely finite, we study extremes and peaks over thresholds (POT) of edge lengths in a growing observation window. Our focus is the precise impact of the presence of (large) weights on edge lengths, captured through explicit scaling regimes and conditional POT limit theorems. Our main results identify a three-phase behavior governed by the weight-tail parameter $β$. We both deduce Fréchet-type limits for the maximum edge length itself and we reveal POT structures under a hub conditioning by proving a POT limit theorem. In the finite-mean regime $β>1$, the leading scaling agrees with the unweighted model up to a constant. By contrast, for $β\\le 1$ the weights have a macroscopic effect on extreme edge lengths: for $β< 1$ the scaling changes, and the borderline case $β=1$ exhibits additional logarithmic corrections. The proofs combine Stein-type Poisson approximation via a Palm-coupling approach with a refined treatment of the dependence created by the conditioning event."

    "abstract": "A central problem in multiagent systems is the fair assignment of objects to agents. In this paper, we initiate the analysis of classic majoritarian social choice functions in assignment. Exploiting the special structure of the assignment domain, we show a number of surprising results with no counterparts in general social choice. In particular, we establish a near one-to-one correspondence between preference profiles and majority graphs. This correspondence implies that key properties of assignments -- such as Pareto-optimality, least unpopularity, and mixed popularity -- can be determined solely by the associated majority graph. We further show that all Pareto-optimal assignments are semi-popular and belong to the top cycle. Elements of the top cycle can thus easily be found via serial dictatorships. Our main result is a complete characterization of the top cycle, which implies the top cycle can only consist of one, two, all but two, all but one, or all assignments. By contrast, we find that the uncovered set contains only very few assignments."

    "abstract": "Motivated by autobidding systems in online advertising, we study revenue maximization in markets with divisible goods and budget-constrained buyers with linear valuations. Our aim is to compute a single price for each good and an allocation that maximizes total revenue. We show that the First-Price Pacing Equilibrium (FPPE) guarantees at least half of the optimal revenue, even when compared to the maximal revenue of buyer-specific prices. This guarantee is particularly striking in light of our hardness result: we prove that revenue maximization under individual rationality and single-price-per-good constraints is APX-hard. We further extend our analysis in two directions: first, we introduce an online analogue of FPPE and show that it achieves a constant-factor revenue guarantee, specifically a $1/4$-approximation; second, we consider buyers with concave valuation functions, characterizing an FPPE-type outcome as the solution to an Eisenberg-Gale-style convex program and showing that the revenue approximation degrades gracefully with the degree of nonlinearity of the valuations."

    "abstract": "We introduce a renormalization-group invariant observable, the symmetry strength parameter $κ_{AB}$, for the quantitative characterization of symmetry breaking in QCD. As a first application, we employ $κ_{AB}$ to investigate the relative strength of $SU(2)_L \\times SU(2)_R$ chiral symmetry and $U(1)_A$ axial symmetry breaking in $N_f=2+1+1$ lattice QCD using optimal domain-wall fermions at the physical point. Our study covers three lattice spacings and twelve temperatures in the range 164-385~MeV. We examine three independent symmetry-breaking channels in the nonsinglet sector with connected correlators: the $U(1)_A$-sensitive scalar-pseudoscalar channel ($κ_{PS}$), probing the $π$-$δ$ system; the $SU(2)_L \\times SU(2)_R$-sensitive vector--axial-vector channel ($κ_{VA}$), probing the $ρ$-$a_1$ system; and an additional $U(1)_A$-sensitive tensor--axial-tensor channel ($κ_{TX}$), probing the $ρ$-$b_1$ system. At finite lattice spacing, we observe a clear hierarchy $κ_{PS} > κ_{TX} \\sim κ_{VA}$. A controlled continuum extrapolation reveals that this hierarchy collapses, with all three symmetry-breaking strengths becoming statistically indistinguishable within our precision. This result provides a new, model-independent benchmark from a chirally symmetric lattice action. Our findings indicate that the effective restoration scales for $SU(2)_L \\times SU(2)_R$ and $U(1)_A$ in the nonsinglet sector converge closely near the chiral crossover, placing stringent quantitative constraints on the temperature window for chiral and axial symmetry manifestation in connected channels. These results support a two-stage restoration scenario, in which full symmetry restoration -- including the singlet sector -- occurs only at significantly higher temperatures once topological fluctuations are suppressed."

Within this framework, closed-form expressions for the degree of freedom (DoF) and power scaling law of the proposed C-PASS are first derived. These theoretical results reveal that the achievable DoF scales linearly with the number of input ports, $M$, and the number of receive antennas, $K$. Furthermore, the derived power scaling laws demonstrate that the C-PASS achieves a power gain of order $\\mathcal{O}(P_T M)$, where $P_T$ denotes the transmit power. Based on the proposed C-PASS modeling, a sum-rate maximization problem for the joint optimization of transmit and pinching beamforming is then formulated. To solve this highly coupled non-convex problem, an efficient alternating optimization algorithm is developed. More particularly, the transmit precoding and power splitting ratios are updated via derived closed-form solutions, while the pinching antenna positions and radiation coefficients are optimized using block coordinate descent (BCD) methods. Finally, our numerical results reveal that the single-waveguide C-PASS: 1) achieves superior DoF and power scaling laws compared to the single-waveguide PASS; and 2) outperforms the multi-waveguide PASS in high-attenuation regimes, yielding a substantial gain exceeding $10$ dB."

    "abstract": "Optoacoustic imaging technologies still rely on the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) as the preferred method for essential signal conditioning operations. The long-standing success of the DFT is largely due to the limited generalizability of data-driven alternatives (e.g., deep neural networks) and the inconsistent accuracy of other analytical transforms (e.g., wavelet transforms). However, the DFT is a 'general-purpose' algorithm whose building blocks, when considered individually, are not directly related to the physics of optoacoustic signal generation. As a result, its accuracy can be limited. Moreover, the computational complexity of its modern algorithmic form imposes a hard limit on execution speed. This limitation may be particularly pronounced in advanced spectral systems that produce large data sets, preventing their adoption. Importantly, optoacoustic imaging technologies are increasingly impacting biological research while standing on the brink of widespread clinical adoption. We have devised a new transform whose building blocks are directly inspired by the physics of optoacoustic signal generation. We have compared its performance with the DFT and other classical transforms on typical signal processing tasks using both simulations and experimental data sets. Our results indicate that the proposed transform not only establishes a new lower bound in computational complexity relative to the DFT, but also strongly outperforms the classical transforms for basic signal processing operations in terms of accuracy metrics. We expect our new transform to catalyze the general adoption of optoacoustic methods."

These square roots give a natural $q$-deformation of the Markov numbers that has not previously occurred in the literature. We call them mirror Markov numbers. We prove a characterization of mirror Markov numbers and discover a mutation rule, mirror mutation, to generate them all. We also prove a geometric realization of the corresponding mirror mutation on a once-punctured sphere with three orbifold points. Our mirror deformation leads to deformations of Fibonacci and Pell branches for which we give precise formulas. Furthermore, the deformed squared Markov equation specializes to many other very well known generalized Markov equations. We also obtain the super Markov numbers from a specialization of the deformed squared Markov numbers, which we use to prove a conjecture of Musiker."

We formalize this as a structural overthinking attack, distinguishable from token-level verbosity, and implement 14 malicious tools across three servers that trigger repetition, forced refinement, and distraction. Across heterogeneous registries and multiple tool-capable models, the attack causes severe resource amplification (up to $142.4\\times$ tokens) and can degrade task outcomes. Finally, we find that decoding-time concision controls do not reliably prevent loop induction, suggesting defenses should reason about tool-call structure rather than tokens alone."

Existing methods have evolved by leveraging the vision information into the language tokens. To more effectively exploit visual contexts for fine-grained segmentation, we propose a novel Visual Informative Part Attention (VIPA) framework for referring image segmentation. VIPA leverages the informative parts of visual contexts, called a visual expression, which can effectively provide the structural and semantic visual target information to the network. This design reduces high-variance cross-modal projection and enhances semantic consistency in an attention mechanism of the referring image segmentation. We also design a visual expression generator (VEG) module, which retrieves informative visual tokens via local-global linguistic context cues and refines the retrieved tokens for reducing noise information and sharing informative visual attributes. This module allows the visual expression to consider comprehensive contexts and capture semantic visual contexts of informative regions. In this way, our framework enables the network's attention to robustly align with the fine-grained regions of interest. Extensive experiments and visual analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our VIPA outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods on four public RIS benchmarks."

    "abstract": "Valley splitting in strained Si/SiGe quantum wells is a central parameter for silicon spin qubits and is commonly described with envelope-function and effective-mass theories. These models provide a computationally efficient continuum description and have been shown to agree well with atomistic approaches when the confinement potential is slowly varying on the lattice scale. In modern Si/SiGe heterostructures with atomically sharp interfaces and engineered Ge concentration profiles, however, the slowly varying potential approximation underlying conventional (local) envelope-function theory is challenged. We formulate an exact multi-valley envelope-function model by combining Burt-Foreman-type envelope-function theory, which does not rely on the assumption of a slowly varying potential, with a valley-sector decomposition of the Brillouin zone. This construction enforces band-limited envelopes, which satisfy a set of coupled integro-differential equations with a non-local potential energy operator. Using degenerate perturbation theory, we derive the intervalley coupling matrix element within this non-local model and prove that it is strictly invariant under global shifts of the confinement potential (choice of reference energy). We then show that the conventional local envelope model generically violates this invariance due to spectral leakage between valley sectors, leading to an unphysical energy-reference dependence of the intervalley coupling. The resulting ambiguity is quantified by numerical simulations of various engineered Si/SiGe heterostructures. Finally, we propose a simple spectrally filtered local approximation that restores the energy-reference invariance exactly and provides a good approximation to the exact non-local theory."

The challenge arises due to the limited availability of a MOS-labeled training dataset comprising multi-rate speech samples. While self-supervised learning (SSL) models have been widely adopted in SQA to boost performance, a key limitation is that they are pretrained on 16 kHz speech and therefore discard high-frequency information present in higher sampling rates. To address this issue, we propose a spectrogram-augmented SSL method that incorporates high-frequency features (up to 48 kHz sampling rate) through a parallel-branch architecture. We further introduce a two-step training scheme: the model is first pre-trained on a large 48 kHz dataset and then fine-tuned on a smaller multi-rate dataset. Experimental results show that leveraging high-frequency information overlooked by SSL features is crucial for accurate multi-rate SQA, and that the proposed two-step training substantially improves generalization when multi-rate data is limited."

However, existing approaches assume similar acquisition views (e.g., vehicle-mounted) and struggle in cross-view scenarios, where observations differ substantially due to viewpoint-dependent structural incompleteness and non-uniform point density. Accordingly, we formulate cross-view domain generalization for LiDAR semantic segmentation and propose a novel framework, termed CVGC (Cross-View Geometric Consistency). Specifically, we introduce a cross-view geometric augmentation module that models viewpoint-induced variations in visibility and sampling density, generating multiple cross-view observations of the same scene. Subsequently, a geometric consistency module enforces consistent semantic and occupancy predictions across geometrically augmented point clouds of the same scene. Extensive experiments on six public LiDAR datasets establish the first systematic evaluation of cross-view domain generalization for LiDAR semantic segmentation, demonstrating that CVGC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods when generalizing from a single source domain to multiple target domains with heterogeneous acquisition viewpoints.

However, this raises hurdles for serving LLMs under prefill-decode (PD) disaggregation, a widely adopted paradigm that separates the compute-bound prefill phase and memory-bound decode phase onto individual resources. Specifically, existing systems overlook the interleaved prefill-decode workload pattern in multi-round inference, leading to sub-optimal handling of the incremental prefill workloads and model deployment for the two phases. In this work, we present AMPD, a brand new disaggregated serving framework for multi-round LLM inference. The core of AMPD is to coordinate the prefill workloads based on real-time workloads by adaptively determining where to carry out these workloads and how they are scheduled, in order to maximize service level objective (SLO) attainment. In addition, we tailor a planning algorithm for our scenario, facilitating the deduction of optimal resource allocation and parallel strategies for the two phases. Empirical results demonstrate that AMPD substantially improves SLO attainment compared to state-of-the-art baselines."

Recently, structure-preserving methods have achieved promising results in conditional image generation by using a base model for prompt conditioning and an adapter for structure input, such as sketches or depth maps. These approaches are highly inefficient and sometimes require equal parameters in the adapter compared to the base architecture. It is not always possible to train the model since the diffusion model is itself costly, and doubling the parameter is highly inefficient. In these approaches, the adapter is not aware of the input prompt; therefore, it is optimal only for the structural input but not for the input prompt. To overcome the above challenges, we proposed two efficient adapters, Nexus Prime and Slim, which are guided by prompts and structural inputs. Each Nexus Block incorporates cross-attention mechanisms to enable rich multimodal conditioning. Therefore, the proposed adapter has a better understanding of the input prompt while preserving the structure. We conducted extensive experiments on the proposed models and demonstrated that the Nexus Prime adapter significantly enhances performance, requiring only 8M additional parameters compared to the baseline, T2I-Adapter. Furthermore, we also introduced a lightweight Nexus Slim adapter with 18M fewer parameters than the T2I-Adapter, which still achieved state-of-the-art results.

GLUs have piecewise quadratic functional forms that are sufficient to exhibit quadratic order of approximation. Our key contribution is to demonstrate that the $L(P)$ scaling slope is $L(P)\\propto P^{-3}$ for GLUs but only $L(P)=P^{-2}$ for MLPs on function reconstruction problems. We provide a parameter construction and empirical verification of these slopes for 1D function approximation. From the first principles we discover, we make one stride and propose the ``Gated Quadratic Unit'' which has an even steeper $L(P)$ slope than the GLU and MLP.

We establish a theoretical model for the atom-laser interaction and detail the implementation of the Krotov method to optimize the temporal shape of the pulse's amplitude and phase. Numerical simulations indicate that, compared to standard pulses, the optimized pulses maintain high atomic manipulation fidelity over an extended range of laser frequency detunings and intensity fluctuations. Furthermore, in simulations of a full interferometer sequence, this robustness translates to a significant enhancement in the final fringe contrast under a systematic detuning.

However, these links are more vulnerable to cross-modal coupling that significantly impacts their overall performance. This study presents a technique aimed at minimizing the coupling of energy into higher-order modes within weakly coupled rectangular dielectric waveguides that are excited by a linear taper. The approach involves wrapping the waveguide with a material of a higher dielectric constant than both the core and the cladding of the waveguide. The added material significantly improves the modal confinement factor of the fundamental mode to the core, leading to a much smaller coupling to the parasitic higher-order cladding modes. The new waveguide with the additional material cladding is analyzed, and semi-analytical approximate expressions are derived to predict the mode profiles and cutoffs. Design equations are given to choose the thickness of the wrapping material. The waveguide is fabricated and compared against a similar cross-section waveguide without the additional wrapping material. Unlike the unwrapped waveguide, the group delay (GD) results of the proposed (wrapped) waveguide closely match the EM-simulated GD of the fundamental mode, confirming the significant isolation of higher-order modes. The measured GD of the proposed DWG is 50 ps/m, while the expected fundamental mode GD from EM simulations is 35 ps/m. On the contrary, the unwrapped DWG shows a measured GD of 200 ps/m with significant oscillations, while the expected fundamental mode GD from EM simulations is 25 ps/m, demonstrating that wrapping the waveguide significantly improves the GD by reducing the higher-order mode propagation."

Beyond dataset creation, we examine whether IR datasets from other low-resource languages can be effectively reused through one-hop machine translation. Using LLM-based translation across multiple language pairs, we experimented on meaning preservation and task validity between source and translated datasets. Our experiment reveal substantial variation across languages, reflecting language-dependent biases and inconsistent semantic preservation that directly affect the reliability of cross-lingual dataset reuse. Overall, this study highlights both the potential and limitations of LLM-assisted dataset creation for low-resource IR. It provides empirical evidence of the risks associated with cross-lingual dataset reuse and offers practical guidance for constructing more reliable benchmarks and evaluation pipelines in low-resource language settings."

    "abstract": "We study the problem of selecting large language models (LLMs) for user queries in settings where multiple LLM providers submit the cost of solving a query. From the users' perspective, choosing an optimal model is a sequential, query-dependent decision problem: high-capacity models offer more reliable outputs but are costlier, while lightweight models are faster and cheaper. We formalize this interaction as a reverse auction design problem with contextual online learning, where the user adaptively discovers which model performs best while eliciting costs from competing LLM providers. Existing multi-armed bandit (MAB) mechanisms focus on forward auctions and social welfare, leaving open the challenges of reverse auctions, provider-optimal outcomes, and contextual adaptation. We address these gaps by designing a resampling-based procedure that generalizes truthful forward MAB mechanisms to reverse auctions and prove that any monotone allocation rule with this procedure is truthful. Using this, we propose a contextual MAB algorithm that learns query-dependent model quality with sublinear regret. Our framework unifies mechanism design and adaptive learning, enabling efficient, truthful, and query-aware LLM selection."

    "abstract": "Microscale transport often relies on ubiquitous yet intrinsically random thermal fluctuations. Understanding how such fluctuations can be biased into directed motion has long been a central theme of nonequilibrium physics. Here, we introduce self-viscophoresis, a mechanism of autonomous motion based on the rectification of thermal fluctuations in a self-generated nonequilibrium viscosity field. Asymmetric colloidal particles dispersed in a thermoresponsive polymer solution induce local heating under uniform illumination, producing a spatially asymmetric viscosity profile around the particle and resulting in persistent directed motion. To elucidate the physical origin of this behavior, we develop a minimal Langevin model coupling isotropic thermal fluctuations to a dynamically updating temperature-viscosity field. The model shows that viscosity asymmetry anisotropically damps stochastic dynamics, effectively biasing thermal fluctuations into a net drift. It thus reproduces the observed directed motion without invoking deterministic propulsion terms associated with effective potentials or environmental fluid flows. Our results distinguish self-viscophoresis from conventional self-propulsion mechanisms and establish it as a general framework enabling reversible control of both the direction and dimensionality of motion."

We derive a kernel-agnostic regret bound expressed in terms of the information gain parameter $γ_t$ and the posterior contraction rate $ε_t$, and identify conditions on the Gaussian process prior under which $ε_t$ can be controlled. As special cases of our general bound, we recover regret of order $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(T^{\\frac{1}{2}})$ for the squared exponential kernel, $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(T^{\\frac{2ν+3d}{2(2ν+d)}} )$ for the Matérn-$ν$ kernel, and a bound of order $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(T^{\\frac{2ν+3d}{2(2ν+d)}})$ for the rational quadratic kernel. Overall, our analysis provides a unified and discretization-free regret framework for GP-TS that applies broadly across kernel classes."

    "abstract": "Many real-world decisions rely on information search, where people sample evidence and decide when to stop under uncertainty. The uncertainty in the environment, particularly how diagnostic evidence is distributed, causes complexities in information search, further leading to suboptimal decision-making outcomes. Yet AI decision support often targets outcome optimization, and less is known about how to scaffold search without increasing cognitive load. We introduce SERA, an LLM-based assistant that provides either gist or verbatim feedback during search. Across two experiments (N1=54, N2=54), we examined decision-making outcomes and information search in SERA-Gist, SERA-Verbatim, and a no-feedback baseline across three environments varying in uncertainty. The uncertainty in environment is operationalized by the perceived gain of information across the course of sampling, which individuals may experience diminishing return of information gain (decremental; low-uncertainty), or a local drop of information gain (local optimum; medium-uncertainty), or no patterns in information gain (high-uncertainty), as they search more. Individuals show more accurate decision outcomes and are more confident with SERA support, especially under higher uncertainty. Gist feedback was associated with more efficient integration and showed a descriptive pattern of reduced oversampling, while verbatim feedback promoted more extensive exploration. These findings establish feedback representation as a design lever when search matters, motivating adaptive systems that match feedback granularity to uncertainty."

The identification of quantum uncertainties with actual stochastic fluctuations, a standard aspect of the current physical account for the emergence of the cosmic structure, is called into question. This opens the door for novel aspects of physics that are needed in order to provide a satisfactory account that is both conceptually clear and does not conflict with the use of quantum theory in other settings."

While existing methods have made great strides, most of them operate at global level but overlook region-wise and even pixel-wise semantic correspondence. To address this, we propose CoCoDiff, a novel training-free and low-cost style transfer framework that leverages pretrained latent diffusion models to achieve fine-grained, semantically consistent stylization. We identify that correspondence cues within generative diffusion models are under-explored and that content consistency across semantically matched regions is often neglected. CoCoDiff introduces a pixel-wise semantic correspondence module that mines intermediate diffusion features to construct a dense alignment map between content and style images. Furthermore, a cycle-consistency module then enforces structural and perceptual alignment across iterations, yielding object and region level stylization that preserves geometry and detail. Despite requiring no additional training or supervision, CoCoDiff delivers state-of-the-art visual quality and strong quantitative results, outperforming methods that rely on extra training or annotations."

For uncontrolled AI R\\&D, we focus on the ``mis-evolution'' of agents as they autonomously expand their memory substrates and toolsets. Besides, we also monitor and evaluate the safety performance of OpenClaw during the interaction on the Moltbook. For self-replication, we introduce a new resource-constrained scenario.

    "abstract": "Lattice simulations of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) enable one to calculate the low-energy properties of the strong interaction among quarks and gluons based on the first principle. The most time-consuming part of the numerical simulations of lattice QCD is typically solving a linear equation for the quark matrix. In particular, a discretized quark formulation called the domain-wall fermion operator requires a high numerical cost, while retaining the lattice version of the chiral symmetry to good precision. The domain-wall operator is defined on a five-dimensional (5D) space extending the four-dimensional (4D) spacetime with an extra fifth coordinate. After solving the linear equation in 5D space, the result vector is projected onto the original 4D space. There is a variant of the domain-wall operator that improves the convergence of the 5D linear equation while unchanging the 4D solution vector. In this paper, we examine how this variant of the domain-wall operator accelerates the iterative linear equation solver in practical setups. We also measure the eigenvalues of the operator and compare the condition number with the convergence of the solver. We use a generic lattice QCD code set Bridge++ that is planned to be released including the improved form of the domain-wall operator examined in this work with code for the GPU."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) offer strong capabilities but incur high inference costs due to dense computation and memory access. Training-free activation sparsity is a promising approach for efficient LLM inference, yet existing methods often rely solely on activation information and uniform sparsity ratios. This overlooks the critical interplay with weights and inter-block sensitivity variation, leading to suboptimal performance. We identify two key phenomena in modern LLMs: 1) less significant activations may align with highly important weights, and 2) sparsity sensitivity varies non-monotonically across model blocks. We propose Weight-aware Mixed-Granularity Training-free Activation Sparsity (WiSparse), which leverages both activation and weight information for adaptive sparsity allocation. Specifically, we introduce a weight-aware mechanism integrating activation magnitudes with precomputed weight norms to accurately identify salient channels. This is combined with a mixed-granularity allocation scheme: a global budget is distributed across blocks via evolutionary search to protect sensitive regions, then refined within blocks to minimize reconstruction error. We improve sparse kernels and demonstrate effectiveness on three representative models. Notably, at 50% sparsity, WiSparse preserves 97% of Llama3.1's dense performance, surpassing the strongest baseline by 2.23 percentage points while achieving a 21.4% acceleration in end-to-end inference speed. Our research advances the limits of training-free approaches for efficient LLM inference, pushing the boundaries of achievable speedup without training."

Inspired by human reasoning patterns where people solve new problems by leveraging past related cases to constrain search spaces and reduce trial-and-error, we propose Precedent Informed Reasoning (PIR) transforming LRMs'reasoning paradigm from exhaustive self-exploration to guided learning from precedents. PIR addresses two key challenges: what precedents to adopt and how to utilize them. First, Adaptive Precedent Selection (APS) constructs, for each question and LRM, a compact set of precedents that are both semantically related and informative for the model. It ranks examples by a joint score with semantic similarity and model perplexity, then adapts the amount of precedents to maximize perplexity reduction. Second, Test-time Experience Internalization (TEI) is treated as the test-time learning on precedent-informed instruction, updating lightweight adapters to internalize solution patterns and use them as a prior during subsequent reasoning. Experiments across mathematical reasoning, scientific QA, and code generation demonstrate that PIR consistently shortens reasoning traces while maintaining or improving final accuracy across LLMs, yielding outstanding accuracy-efficiency trade-offs."

CLAW provides large 6-degree-of-freedom deformation (40mm lateral, 20mm vertical), anisotropic stiffness that is tunable across three distinct modes, while maintaining lightweight construction (330g) at low cost ($550). Experimental evaluations using imitation learning demonstrate that CLAW achieves 76% success rate in benchmark peg-insertion tasks, outperforming both the Fin Ray gripper (43%) and rigid gripper alternatives (36%). CLAW successfully handles diverse contact-rich scenarios, including precision assembly with tight tolerances and delicate object manipulation, demonstrating its potential to enable robust robot learning in contact-rich domains.

Two widely used methods for determining these efficiencies are based on ferromagnetic resonance (FMR), spin pumping FMR for the inverse effect, and spin-torque FMR for the direct effect. A key parameter to achieve accurate quantification, especially for spin-pumping FMR, is the RF field strength, $h_{\\mathrm{RF}}$. We present a comprehensive theoretical model and experimental protocol that allow a correct quantification of $h_{\\mathrm{RF}}$. It was validated by extensive experimental results and it was rigorously tested across various antennas geometries and ferromagnetic systems. We demonstrate that odd-symmetric Lorentzian voltages-which perfectly mimic spin-pumping or spin-torque FMR signals-can arise purely from rectification effects (due to anisotropic magnetoresistance) when $h_{\\mathrm{RF}}$ orientation is parallel to the ferromagnetic surface. Through a systematic study of various 10-nm-thick ferromagnetic layers, such as Ni, NiFe, Fe, and CoFeB, we find that while Fe and CoFeB exhibit minimal rectification, Ni and NiFe generate strong rectified signals that must be corrected. We further demonstrate that these rectification effects become negligible for ferromagnetic thicknesses $\\leq$ 6 nm, as validated in NiFe/Pt bilayers, providing an important guideline for the design of future heterostructures."

We propose an LLM-assisted distillation framework specifically designed for temporal knowledge graph reasoning. Beyond a conventional high-capacity temporal teacher, we incorporate a large language model as an auxiliary instructor to provide enriched supervision. The LLM supplies broad background knowledge and temporally informed signals, enabling a lightweight student to better model event dynamics without increasing inference-time complexity. Training is conducted by jointly optimizing supervised and distillation objectives, using a staged alignment strategy to progressively integrate guidance from both teachers. Extensive experiments on multiple public TKG benchmarks with diverse backbone architectures demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently improves link prediction performance over strong distillation baselines, while maintaining a compact and efficient student model. The results highlight the potential of large language models as effective teachers for transferring temporal reasoning capability to resource-efficient TKG systems."

A primary challenge w.r.t AU detection is the effective learning of discriminative and generalizable AU representations under conditions of limited annotated data. To address this, we propose a Hierarchical Vision-language Interaction for AU Understanding (HiVA) method, which leverages textual AU descriptions as semantic priors to guide and enhance AU detection. Specifically, HiVA employs a large language model to generate diverse and contextually rich AU descriptions to strengthen language-based representation learning. To capture both fine-grained and holistic vision-language associations, HiVA introduces an AU-aware dynamic graph module that facilitates the learning of AU-specific visual representations. These features are further integrated within a hierarchical cross-modal attention architecture comprising two complementary mechanisms: Disentangled Dual Cross-Attention (DDCA), which establishes fine-grained, AU-specific interactions between visual and textual features, and Contextual Dual Cross-Attention (CDCA), which models global inter-AU dependencies. This collaborative, cross-modal learning paradigm enables HiVA to leverage multi-grained vision-based AU features in conjunction with refined language-based AU details, culminating in robust and semantically enriched AU detection capabilities. Extensive experiments show that HiVA consistently surpasses state-of-the-art approaches. Besides, qualitative analyses reveal that HiVA produces semantically meaningful activation patterns, highlighting its efficacy in learning robust and interpretable cross-modal correspondences for comprehensive facial behavior analysis."

Subsequently, we formulate the target localization problem as a non-linear least squares optimization, using the coarse estimates to initialize the target's position coordinates. To solve this efficiently, we introduce a fast iterative refinement algorithm tailored for RIS-aided ISAC environments. Recognizing that the signal model involves both linear path gains and non-linear geometric dependencies, we exploit the separable least-squares structure to decouple these parameters. Furthermore, we propose a modified Levenberg algorithm with an approximation strategy, which enables low-cost parameter updates without necessitating repeated evaluations of the full non-linear model. Simulation results show that the proposed refinement method achieves accuracy comparable to conventional approaches, while significantly reducing algorithmic complexity."

Anonymous quantum sensing keeps it secret by estimating amplitudes of the magnetic fields without disclosing the positions of non-zero magnetic fields. In this paper, we propose an anonymous quantum sensing protocol that is robust against any independent noise in state preparations. To this end, we devise a quantum state verification protocol for a superposition of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger and Dicke states and combine it with the original protocol of anonymous quantum sensing. Our verification protocol can decide whether the fidelity between the ideal and actual states is high or low more efficiently than the direct fidelity estimation.

    "abstract": "Several applications of medical ultrasound can benefit from a larger imaging field of view (FOV). This study is aimed at increasing the FOV of linear array probes by increasing the element size rather than the element count. To investigate larger FOV, this study used coupled elements to imitate a larger element size. The effects of coupling on array beam patterns are examined with Fourier transforms of elements. The effects of coupling on resolution, contrast, and speckle signal-to-noise ratio are examined through phantom images and in-vivo images of a rabbit tumor reconstructed with plane-wave compounding. Furthermore, a positioning system was used to acquire data from a virtual large aperture with 120 mm FOV and 128 elements, collected in sections with a single probe. This study also investigates the Null Subtraction Imaging (NSI), Sign Coherence Factor (SCF), and Minimum Variance (MV) beamformers for regaining resolution lost by an increased F-number with large elements. The MV beamformer, while the most computationally expensive, was best for improving resolution without increasing speckle variance, decreasing Full-Width at Half-Max (FWHM) estimates of wire targets from 0.78 mm with DAS on a 2.5 wavelength element size to 0.54 mm with MV on a 5 wavelength element size."

To investigate this, we focus on the class of semisymmetric graphs, which are regular, edge-transitive, but not vertex-transitive. In this paper, it will be shown that every connected semisymmetric graph of order $2pq$, where $p$ and $q$ are two distinct primes contains a Hamilton cycle and that every connected cubic semisymmetric graph of order less than 3000 contains a Hamilton cycle too. Based on these observations, the following question is posed: construct a connected semisymmetric graph which has no Hamilton cycle."

The hybrid gain structure ensures bounded control effort while retaining finite time convergence, and the incorporation of PPFs enables explicit enforcement of transient performance requirements. Theoretical guarantees are first established for first order systems, characterizing finite time convergence, disturbance rejection, and residual bounds. The approach is then extended to second order dynamics, where a sliding manifold is designed using PPF constraints to facilitate controlled shaping of position and velocity transients. Simulation studies illustrate the proposed design under matched peak control conditions. Comparative results for second-order systems demonstrate that, while a well tuned non-PPF hybrid gain controller achieves competitive tracking performance, the PPF-aware formulation strictly enforces prescribed transient constraints and yields consistent reductions of approximately 9 to 12 percent in integral error and control energy metrics without increasing peak actuation effort."

    "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by systemic joint inflammation. Early diagnosis and tight follow-up are essential to the management of RA, as ongoing inflammation can cause irreversible joint damage. The detection of arthritis is important for diagnosis and assessment of disease activity; however, it often takes a long time for patients to receive appropriate specialist care. Therefore, there is a strong need to develop systems that can detect joint inflammation easily using RGB images captured at home. Consequently, we tackle the task of RA inflammation detection from RGB hand images. This task is highly challenging due to general issues in medical imaging, such as the scarcity of positive samples, data imbalance, and the inherent difficulty of the task itself. However, to the best of our knowledge, no existing work has explicitly addressed these challenges in RGB-based RA inflammation detection. This paper quantitatively demonstrates the difficulty of visually detecting inflammation by constructing a dedicated dataset, and we propose a inflammation detection framework with global local encoder that combines self-supervised pretraining on large-scale healthy hand images with imbalance-aware training to detect RA-related joint inflammation from RGB hand images. Our experiments demonstrated that the proposed approach improves F1-score by 0.2 points and Gmean by 0.25 points compared with the baseline model."

Our first contribution is to characterize the phase transition threshold $K_{c}$ by comparing it to the linear stability threshold $K_\\# = \\min (1, m^{-1})$ of the uniform distribution. When $m \\leq 1/2,$ $K_{c}=1$, coinciding with that of the Kuramoto model. On the other hand, for $m \\geq 2$, we show $K_c= m^{-1}$. We also classify the regimes in which the phase transition is continuous or discontinuous. Our second contribution is to analyze the linear stability of a global minimizer $q$ (the ``ordered phase'') of the mean-field free energy in the supercritical regime $K>1$. This stationary solution of the Kuramoto-Daido equation is unique up to translation invariance and distinct from the uniform distribution (the ``disordered phase''). Our approach extends the Dirichlet form method of Bertini et al. from the unimodal to bimodal setting. In particular, for $m \\leq 1.590 \\times 10^{-4}$ and $K>1$, we show an explicit lower bound on the spectral gap of the linearized McKean-Vlasov operator at $q$.

While various quantum double models with non-chiral topological order have been theoretically investigated and experimentally implemented, the realization and characterization of chiral topological phases have remained less explored. Here we show that chiral topological phases in spin systems, i.e., chiral spin liquids, can be prepared in quantum circuits using the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) framework. On top of the VQE ground state, signatures of the chiral topological order are revealed using the recently proposed tangent space excitation ansatz for quantum circuits. We show that, both topological ground state degeneracy and the chiral edge mode can be faithfully captured by this approach. We demonstrate our approach using the Kitaev honeycomb model, finding excellent agreement of low-energy excitation spectrum on quantum circuits with exact solution in all topological sectors. Further applying this approach to a non-exactly solvable chiral spin liquid model on square lattice, the results suggest this approach works well even when the topological sectors are not exactly known."

While closed-source models typically rely on external defenses, open-weight models must primarily depend on internal safeguards to mitigate harmful behavior. Prior red-teaming research has largely focused on input-based jailbreaking and parameter-level manipulations. However, open-weight models also natively support prefilling, which allows an attacker to predefine initial response tokens before generation begins. Despite its potential, this attack vector has received little systematic attention. We present the largest empirical study to date of prefill attacks, evaluating over 20 existing and novel strategies across multiple model families and state-of-the-art open-weight models. Our results show that prefill attacks are consistently effective against all major contemporary open-weight models, revealing a critical and previously underexplored vulnerability with significant implications for deployment. While certain large reasoning models exhibit some robustness against generic prefilling, they remain vulnerable to tailored, model-specific strategies. Our findings underscore the urgent need for model developers to prioritize defenses against prefill attacks in open-weight LLMs."

The longitudinal energy gain or loss encoded in $f(z)=[E_0-V(z)]^2-m^2$ generates an effective gain or damping rate $\\widetildeγ(z)=\\partial_z f(z)/[2f(z)]$ and a $z$-dependent oscillator frequency $\\widetildeω(z)=p_0Ω(z)/\\sqrt{f(z)}$.

The transverse evolution is controlled by a single scaling function $b(z)$ that satisfies a generalized Ermakov--Pinney equation with coefficients determined by $E_z(z)$ and $B_z(z)$. In the limiting cases of uniform acceleration with $B_z=0$ and of solenoid focusing with negligible acceleration, our solution reduces to previously known analytic results, providing a direct bridge to established models."

    "abstract": "Many generative tasks in chemistry and science involve distributions invariant to group symmetries (e.g., permutation and rotation). A common strategy enforces invariance and equivariance through architectural constraints such as equivariant denoisers and invariant priors. In this paper, we challenge this tradition through the alternative canonicalization perspective: first map each sample to an orbit representative with a canonical pose or order, train an unconstrained (non-equivariant) diffusion or flow model on the canonical slice, and finally recover the invariant distribution by sampling a random symmetry transform at generation time. Building on a formal quotient-space perspective, our work provides a comprehensive theory of canonical diffusion by proving: (i) the correctness, universality and superior expressivity of canonical generative models over invariant targets; (ii) canonicalization accelerates training by removing diffusion score complexity induced by group mixtures and reducing conditional variance in flow matching. We then show that aligned priors and optimal transport act complementarily with canonicalization and further improves training efficiency. We instantiate the framework for molecular graph generation under $S_n \\times SE(3)$ symmetries. By leveraging geometric spectra-based canonicalization and mild positional encodings, canonical diffusion significantly outperforms equivariant baselines in 3D molecule generation tasks, with similar or even less computation. Moreover, with a novel architecture Canon, CanonFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging GEOM-DRUG dataset, and the advantage remains large in few-step generation."

Our analysis demonstrates that AFQMC systematically corrects the lack of long-range screening in MP2 and the missing higher-order exchange in RPA. We identify RPA as the optimal reference method due to the rapid convergence of the remaining short-range correlations with respect to supercell size.

In this work, we empirically localize this input-output alignment shift in pretrained LLMs, using decoding trajectories over tied embedding spaces and similarity-based metrics. Our experiments reveal that the hidden token representations switch from input alignment to output alignment deep within the network. Motivated by this observation, we propose a lightweight residual-path mitigation based on residual attenuation, implemented either as a fixed-layer intervention or as a learnable gating mechanism.

We show that bulk plasmons dominate decoherence in Al and Au, while electronic excitations above the band gap, supplemented by weaker coupling to phononic and guided modes, are the primary channels in ionic insulators such as LiF. A thermal population of electromagnetic modes leads to a divergence in the energy-loss probability at low frequencies, which in turn produces a pronounced temperature dependence. We show that this effect can be exploited for nanoscale thermometry, predicting that optimized energy-filtered holography enables $\\sim0.1\\%$ changes in fringe visibility for physically viable temperature variations in metals.

While there has been some progress in researching backdoor attacks against FL, data backdoor attacks are easily mitigated in federated environments, and model backdoor attacks are susceptible to detection by defense mechanisms. Therefore, we propose a refined backdoor attack method tailored for FL under the image classification task. Our method involves the collaborative operation of three key modules. Firstly, the parameter importance analysis module identifies parameters with minimal impact on model performance, and creates parameter importance masks to provide precise targets for subsequent operations. Subsequently, the activation difference computation module calculates the activation differences between backdoor samples and benign samples to locate trigger-sensitive parameters. Our method implants the backdoor by flipping and zeroing the precisely located layer parameters, while maintaining the model's classification performance on benign samples. Experimental results show that our method is feasible to achieve an average attack success rate more than 99% across the three victim models. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in FL environments and its robustness against various FL defense mechanisms."

    "abstract": "This paper presents an HLS-based algorithm-hardware co-design methodology and complete FPGA hardware accelerator for multi-user massive MIMO-OFDM receivers operating in contested tactical environments with jamming suppression capabilities. We develop a systematic bi-directional co-design methodology using high-level synthesis (HLS) where algorithms provide functional verification constraints while hardware synthesis feedback drives algorithmic complexity reduction, enabling efficient transformation from signal processing algorithms to optimized circuit implementations on the Xilinx ZCU111 radio frequency system-on-chip (RFSoC) platform. The primary contributions include: 1) hardware architecture innovations featuring QR decomposition-based synchronization achieving 330 MHz post-route operation and optimized frequency-domain minimum mean square error (FD-MMSE) equalization with systematic loop restructuring for data dependency removal in substitution modules, reducing hardware resources by 56% lookup tables (LUTs), 58% flip-flops (FFs), and 67% digital signal processing (DSP) blocks while maintaining real-time throughput; 2) systematic HLS-based co-design framework enabling automated architecture exploration with hardware-oriented algorithm adaptations including silent-period frame structure and Cholesky-based decision-feedback equalization; 3) complete system integration validated through field trials demonstrating 8 dB jamming suppression improvement with reliable spatial division multiple access (SDMA) communications. The presented methodology provides insights applicable to broader signal processing systems with stringent real-time constraints."

    "abstract": "While the existing type I or II first-order Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy classifiers generally take an additive type I or II first-order rule space followed by a non-additive defuzzification without or with type-reduction, this study enriches their family by opening a reverse thinking about a non-additive type I or II first-order rule space, followed by a simple additive defuzzification with the avoidance of explicit type-reduction calculation. Towards this end, the novel Types I & II Partition-based first-order TSK Fuzzy Classifiers (TIP-FC and TIIP-FC) and their training methods are developed for first-order linearity of consequent of each rule on all the fuzzy partitions themselves or their simple variants rather than each original feature, thereby having their distinct values in the sense of enhanced interpretability, smaller output variance, and/or denoising capability. Extensive experimental results on the adopted benchmark datasets indicate that both TIP-FC and TIIP-FC keep at least comparable to and even superior over the comparative methods in the sense of interpretability, classification performance, and/or denoising capability."

    "abstract": "Ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) is a pivotal technology in future 6G networks, demanding stringent quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees characterized by high reliability and hard delay constraints. To efficiently support uRLLC over time-varying wireless channels, there have been some emerging technologies such as finite blocklength (FBL) coding, adaptive modulation and coding (AMC), hybrid automatic repeat request with incremental redundancy (HARQ-IR), and massive multiple input multiple output MIMO (mMIMO)-enabled cell-free architectures. However, integrating these techniques into a unified framework that ensures statistical QoS guarantees for delay- and reliability-constrained uRLLC remains an open problem. A key difficulty is the joint optimization of queuing and transmission processes, which involves managing the delay budget between the queuing and transmission processes and the reliability budget among queuing delay violation probability (QDVP), block error probability (BLEP), and transmission failure probability. In this paper, we investigate a cell-free network architecture and derive the signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR) distribution using a moment-matching approach. We further present a tractable effective capacity (EC) framework and derive closed-form expressions for the maximum allowable service rate (MASR) with only AMC or HARQ schemes. Furthermore, we propose a joint optimization framework that co-designs AMC thresholds and HARQ parameters to optimally trade off delay and reliability between queuing and transmission processes. Extensive simulations validate the accuracy of the theoretical derivations and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimization strategies across diverse network scenarios."

    "abstract": "Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) adopts a flexible, open, and virtualized architecture with standardized interfaces, reducing dependency on a single supplier. O-RAN hosts many intelligent applications known as eXtended Applications (xApps). xApps are applications deployed at the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) that leverage advanced Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) algorithms to make dynamic decisions for network optimization. Each application operates with distinct optimization objectives and is managed by independent operators while accessing shared network resources. Conflicts in this context occur when a deployed xApp's objective interferes with another xApp, resulting in incompatible actions or decisions that may negatively impact network performance. The lack of a unified mechanism to coordinate and prioritize the actions of different applications can create three types of conflicts (direct, indirect, and implicit). Conflict prediction in O-RAN refers to the proactive analytical process through which potential interactions or behaviors that may lead to conflicts between network applications are identified in advance, prior to their manifestation within the operational system. In our paper, we introduce a novel data-driven Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)-based method called GRAPH-based Intelligent xApp Conflict Prediction and Analysis (GRAPHICA). It predicts three types of conflicts (direct, indirect, and implicit) and pinpoints the root causes (xApps). GRAPHICA captures the complex and hidden dependencies among the xApps, controlled parameters, and key performance indicators (KPIs) in O-RAN to predict possible conflicts. Then, it identifies the root causes (xApps) contributing to the predicted conflicts. The proposed method is evaluated using highly imbalanced synthetic datasets, in which conflict instances constitute between 40% and merely 10% of the data. This evaluation setting is designed to reflect realistic operational environments where conflicts are infrequent, thereby enabling a comprehensive assessment of the model's performance under real-world conditions. Experimental results demonstrate a high F1-score over 98% for the synthesized datasets with different levels of class imbalance."

    "abstract": "Myoelectric prostheses offer functional restoration for people living with upper limb loss or differences, but mastery requires intensive, often monotonous training, leading to high abandonment rates. Virtual Reality (VR) presents a promising solution for engaging and motivating training. However, existing work in VR-based prosthesis training is still focused on research purposes only. This paper details the user-centred co-design, development, clinical implementation, and commercial translation of Myo-Hand XP. Myo-Hand XP is the first commercial immersive VR intervention formyoelectric prosthesis training, which was registered in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) and brought to market in 2023. The development followed an iterative process, beginning with problem-idea validation through stakeholder interviews. This informed the creation of a Proof of Concept (PoC) prototype, which gathered initial user feedback. Subsequent development of a more advanced Research Prototype, incorporating feedback on hardware and software, underwent further user testing. This iterative co-design, involving continuous feedback from 60 multinational stakeholders across various stages, was central to refining Myo-Hand XP. Following regulatory approval, clinical pilots in prosthetic clinics with 20 people living with limb loss and 6 clinicians demonstrated increased patient motivation and confidence, and the value of early functional training. Key challenges identified included setup complexity and sensor ergonomics. The commercially released Myo-Hand XP incorporates expanded sensor compatibility and refined activities. Ongoing user-centred development continues to address feedback, focusing on usability, expanded features like progress reporting and prosthetic elbow support, and further clinical validation to optimize this VR rehabilitation tool. This paper shares insights into translating research into a clinically viable and commercially available product."

Simulations show that the combined functions of each part of the circuit can emulate the spike-timing-dependent plasticity of biological neural synapses. When integrated with existing superconducting single-flux-quantum circuits, it successfully models the “winner-takes-all” behavior of the biological brain. Embedding this synaptic circuit into superconducting integrated circuits could be an important step towards the future development of brain-inspired superconducting computational systems."

To address these challenges, this paper proposes a hybrid model integrating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers, tailored for High-Speed Railway (HSR) environments. The proposed hybrid model is evaluated using both public datasets and a real-world HSR dataset collected through empirical field measurements, it not only achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) predictive accuracy, reducing root mean square error by 4.7% over strong baselines in the challenging HSR environment, but also delivers this performance with superior computational efficiency, achieving over 3.6 times lower inference latency than leading SOTA models. This establishes an optimal performance-to-cost ratio, demonstrating its practical value for real-time HSR systems."

    "abstract": "Blockchain decentralization refers to the characteristics of blockchain systems in which data storage, transaction verification, and ledger state updates are performed and maintained by distributed nodes, rather than relying on the servers of centralized institutions or organizational entities. It is one of the core features of blockchain systems to ensure security, anti-censorship, and system robustness. Quantifying the degree of blockchain decentralization helps identify potential centralization risks and evaluate the fairness of system architectures and governance mechanisms, and provides an important basis for the optimization design for improving consensus efficiency and resource allocation, as well as for evaluating the credibility and understanding the future development trends of blockchain systems in terms of scalability, application domains, and regulatory adaptability. Existing blockchain decentralization measurement methods rely on one or two dimensions, ignore trend analysis of the degree of decentralization, and lack standardized quantitative approaches, such as the consistent application of methods like the coefficient of variation or the information entropy, to enable objective and comparable assessments across different systems. Given that blockchain systems are composed of participating nodes, we adopt a node-centric perspective, and propose a Node-based Blockchain Decentralization Measurement Model (NBDMM). NBDMM uses ten key indicators extracted from three dimensions, node distribution, transaction-network centralization, and node reliability, to measure the degree of decentralization. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed NBDMM effectively quantifies the level of decentralization across blockchain systems with varying consensus mechanisms. Moreover, findings indicate a trend toward increasing centralization in both Bitcoin and Ethereum, suggesting a gradual erosion of their originally decentralized nature."

    "abstract": "Internet-wide scanning is integral to network measurement and security analysis, but the expansive address space of IPv6 limits existing approaches in achieving efficient global-scale scans. This study introduces HMap, an innovative IPv6 scanner that markedly improves scan efficiency and coverage through the implementation of a dynamic search (DS) technique, relying solely on IPv6 routeable BGP prefixes. DS employs a dynamic feedback-driven probing strategy that uses information from previous replies to prioritize more promising address regions in subsequent scans. In Internet-wide scans over IPv6, encompassing both ping-like and traceroute-like scans with DS, HMap has demonstrated its capability to discover 2.29 million non-alias active target addresses, 0.13 million peripheries/middleboxes, and 1.61 million router interfaces, using only million-scale probes. This represents a noteworthy improvement of 1.91 times, 1.63 times, and 12.38 times, respectively, compared to current state-of-the-art alternatives. Additionally, by utilizing an efficient target generation algorithm (TGA) that more effectively leverages seed addresses, HMap expands the non-alias active address count to 44.05 million. This coverage spans 18.97 thousand ASes with a one-hour scan at a limited probing speed of 100 Kpps. The volume of active IPv6 addresses is 4.88 times larger than the currently disclosed largest IPv6 hitlists, providing a more diverse set of IPv6 networks. Unlike prior IPv6 scan studies that preclude their use for Internet-scale security analysis, we also conduct the Internet-wide security scans of IPv6 networks, focusing on the exposed internal IPv6 devices and security-sensitive services in IPv6 routers."

This paper proposes a unified load flow (ULF) model that captures the spatio-temporal evolution of charging behavior, incorporating EV arrival and departure dynamics as boundary conditions. A classical point optimization physics-informed neural network (PoPINN) is used to solve the ULF model, with a novel boundary condition design that ensures physical consistency during training. To enhance model consistency and robustness under stochastic and data-sparse conditions, a boundary-aware region-optimized PINN (RoPINN) is developed. This approach incorporates boundary information into regional optimization, enforcing arrival–departure consistency within local spatiotemporal regions and enabling reliable learning from incomplete data. The proposed framework provides a coherent data–physics integration strategy for modeling uncertain and incomplete EV charging information, enabling accurate prediction of charging power and load flow evolution. Simulation results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the robustness, accuracy, and practical applicability of the proposed method for large-scale EV charging optimization and smart grid management."

    "abstract": "Accurate identification of rice leaf diseases is essential to securing agricultural productivity and mitigating crop losses. Manual approaches are often inefficient and unreliable, particularly in large-scale farming. Although deep convolutional neural networks such as DenseNet have been applied to this task, their default configurations may not fully capture fine-grained disease features. This study aims to develop a series of enhanced DenseNet models that incorporate architectural improvements and optimized learning parameters to achieve highly reliable classification of rice leaf pathologies. We implemented baseline and modified versions of DenseNet121, DenseNet169, and DenseNet201, integrating Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks to enhance channel-wise feature calibration. The proposed approach is evaluated on a publicly available dataset comprising 3,829 rice leaf images distributed across six classes, including Brown Spot, Sheath Blight, Leaf Scald, Bacterial Leaf Blight, Leaf Blast, and Healthy rice leaves. To improve generalization and convergence, the modelswere fine-tuned usingKeras Tuner with a focus on optimizing the number of dense units, dropout rates, and learning rates. The proposed hybrid framework combines Squeeze-and-Excitation–enhanced DenseNet architectures withKerasTuner-based hyperparameter optimization, enabling joint feature refinement and systematic model optimization, which distinguishes it from existing DenseNet-based rice leaf disease detection approaches. The evaluation framework included dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, t-SNE) and various statistical plots (histogram, KDE, box, and violin). Model performance was assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, area under the ROC curve, and Cohen’s Kappa coefficient. All evaluated DenseNet-based models achieved consistently high performance, with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score values close to 0.99, while the Modified DenseNet-201 model yielded the highest overall results across all metrics. Its predictions exhibited strong confidence with minimal uncertainty, as evidenced by clear bimodal probability distributions and minimal misclassification in confusion matrices. The training history indicated smooth convergence with no significant overfitting. Notably, the Cohen’s Kappa score reached 0.9937, confirming excellent consistency beyond chance. The inclusion of SE blocks was especially effective in disambiguating diseases with similar visual traits. The proposed modifications to DenseNet architectures, supported by targeted hyperparameter tuning, significantly elevate performance in rice leaf disease classification. The models developed in this work demonstrate robust accuracy, strong interpretability, and practical viability for deployment in precision agriculture systems aimed at early disease detection."

In such systems, the access point (AP) plays a key role in forwarding user requests to a server based on its latest received service information. This paper considers a single-source, single-destination system and introduces a PPO–based reinforcement learning framework for efficient information updating, guided by a newly designed reward metric called Age-and-Value-Aware (AVA). Unlike traditional freshness-based metrics, AVA explicitly incorporates variations in server-side service capacity and AP’s forwarding decisions, allowing more context-aware update evaluation. Under this reward structure, the PPO agent autonomously learns when to trigger service information updates, achieving a dynamic balance between communication cost and decision accuracy. Extensive simulations under diverse user request patterns and varying service capacities demonstrate that AVA reduces the update frequency by over 90% on average compared to baselines, with reductions reaching 98% in certain configurations. This reduction is achieved without compromising the quality of decision making."

    "abstract": "Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a key enabler for next-generation wireless networks, providing a unified framework for spectrum-efficient data transmission and environmental sensing. This paper presents a joint beamforming strategy for a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted ISAC system. We jointly optimize the active beamforming at the base station and the passive beamforming at the RIS to serve legitimate unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) while detecting potential unauthorized UAVs. The goal is to maximize the average sum-rate of all legitimate UAVs under constraints on radar sensing signal-to-noise ratio, the transmit power, and the reflection coefficients of the RIS. To address the non-convex optimization problem, we develop an efficient low-complexity solution based on fractional programming and alternating optimization. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the data rate compared with benchmarks, validating the effectiveness of RIS in harmonizing communication and target sensing functionalities for low-altitude networks."

This architecture introduces a novel integration of multimodal features and residual learning structures, enhancing both prediction accuracy and consistent prediction performance.

    "abstract": "The remarkable natural language understanding, reasoning, and generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have made them attractive for application to video understanding, utilizing video tokens as contextual input. However, employing LLMs for long video understanding presents significant challenges. The extensive number of video tokens leads to considerable computational costs for LLMs while using aggregated tokens results in loss of vision details. Moreover, the presence of abundant question-irrelevant tokens introduces noise to the video reasoning process. To address these issues, we introduce a simple yet effective learnable retrieval-based video-language model (R-VLM) for efficient long video understanding. Specifically, given a question and a long video, our model identifies the most relevant <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$K$</tex-math></inline-formula> video chunks and uses their associated visual tokens to serve as context for the LLM inference. This effectively reduces the number of video tokens, eliminates noise interference, and enhances system performance. We achieve this by incorporating a learnable lightweight MLP block to facilitate the efficient retrieval of question-relevant chunks, through the end-to-end training of our video-language model with a proposed soft matching loss. Experimental results on multiple zero-shot video question answering datasets validate the effectiveness of our framework for comprehending long videos."

    "abstract": "CLIP has promoted miscellaneous models and downstream applications, creating a great family in the deep learning community. Recently, the security of CLIP has become an increasingly popular research topic, where backdoor attacks show potential devastation by injecting a covert backdoor to manipulate the output features. Existing backdoor attacks typically bind the target class with large-scale poisonous data to pre-train or finetune the target CLIP model. Such a paradigm lacks transferability and flexibility since it needs retraining when applied to another target class or target CLIP model. In this paper, we propose a novel Transferable Backdoor Attack (TBA) paradigm for transferring backdoor attacks on any CLIP model with any target class, reducing time costs from conventional days or hours to seconds. First, we propose a multimodal hack network pre-training step, where the visual and textual hack networks are pre-trained to recognize the triggers in multimodal inputs robustly. Second, we propose a few-shot training-free backdoor transfer step, where the hack networks are efficiently fused into the target CLIP model with few samples of the target class. In experiments, our Transferable Hack Network (THNet) consistently achieves <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$&gt;99$</tex-math></inline-formula>% attack success rate while making minimum impact for clean input on various TBA settings and two downstream tasks. We hope this work can contribute a new perspective on the security vulnerability of CLIP and its downstream applications."

It can be interpreted as a 50/60 Hz-shifted VSM running in the stationary frame. We further modify the nonlinear block of the VOC, hence linear voltage droop and better voltage supporting can be achieved. Since VOC is highly nonlinear, the conventional discretization methods generate considerable errors in digital implementation, especially for high-power rated converter working at low switching frequency. Two discretization techniques are investigated: The forward-backward Euler method and the complex repetitive controller approach. The proposed algorithm is verified by experiments both in grid-connected and island modes."

    "abstract": "A computationally secure physical-layer obfuscation framework for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems based on space shift keying (SSK) is proposed in this letter, while accounting for imperfect channel estimation and spatial channel correlation. The obfuscation principle relies on exploiting channel reciprocity in time-division duplexing (TDD), whereby the transmitter and the legitimate receiver independently estimate per-antenna fading powers and construct an identical permutation vector to reorder the transmit constellation in each coherence interval. For an SSK system with <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N<sub>t</sub></i> transmit antennas, the permutation is derived from the relative ordering of per-antenna channel powers. This design allows for refreshed key that avoids explicit key exchange with negligible signaling overhead. At the same time, an eavesdropper observing an independent or partially correlated channel is forced to decode using a mismatched constellation. Consequently, decoding ambiguity is significantly increased, enlarging the brute-force search space to the order of <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N<sub>t</sub></i>!, which render blind constellation recovery computationally infeasible. Results demonstrate that channel estimation errors and spatial correlation impairments introduce only modest performance degradation at the legitimate receiver while strongly suppressing the eavesdropper’s achievable information rate. Performance is investigated in terms of average bit error rate (ABER), mutual information (MI), generalized mutual information (GMI), equivocation, and information leakage."

To better understand their attenuation behavior, this study employed low-energy pulsed discharges in transformer oil using a needle-to-needle electrode configuration. Pressure waveforms were recorded by PVDF sensors under different voltage–capacitance combinations. Results show that peak pressure attenuates in a power-exponential manner with increasing propagation distance, with attenuation coefficients ranging from 0.747 to 0.803. At constant capacitance, higher charging voltage increased both the peak pressure and the attenuation coefficient, while capacitance variation under fixed voltage had little influence on attenuation. These findings provide experimental evidence for the dependence of pressure wave attenuation on discharge conditions, offering insights into electrohydraulic effects in transformer oil and their implications for transformer safety."

This paper proposes a day-ahead load forecasting method for building energy consumption that combines multi-scale convolution with a multi-head attention mechanism, aiming to capture the complex temporal features in building energy consumption data. Specifically, multi-scale convolution with a pyramid structure is used to extract multi-level spatial features ranging from fine-grained to coarse-grained; subsequently, the multi-head attention mechanism is employed to dynamically fuse features of different time scales, enhancing adaptability to short-term fluctuations and long-term periodic trends; finally, an LSTM layer is utilized to accurately capture long-term dependencies and output high-precision prediction results. Experimental results show that the prediction model based on CNNP3-MultiHead-Lstm significantly outperforms traditional models in terms of accuracy and robustness."

However, existing deep learning approaches often require substantial computational resources, limiting deployment on resource-constrained platforms. This paper proposes a lightweight transfer learning framework based on MobileNetV2 for efficient land cover classification from Sentinel-2 RGB imagery. Our approach integrates three key innovations: depth-wise separable convolutions for parameter-efficient feature extraction, an adaptive fine-tuning strategy with progressive layer unfreezing to bridge the domain gap between ImageNet and satellite imagery, and a regularized classification head with attention-based pooling. Extensive experiments on the EuroSAT dataset demonstrate that our method achieves 91.2% classification accuracy while maintaining only 2.59M parameters, enabling real-time inference (15.2 ms/image) on CPU with training convergence in 40 epochs using Adam optimizer (batch size 64, learning rate 1e-3 for head and 1e-4 for backbone). The proposed framework exhibits superior performance across ten land cover categories including annual crops, forests, residential areas, and water bodies, with robust generalization under varying spatial resolutions and spectral conditions."

So as to tackle these sorts of issues, we present a dual-channel registration algorithm based on GAN. For the infrared branch, a light weight GAN does a super resolution reconstruction so that the shape of the land stays intact. On the contrary, the visible branch uses various sized picture features extracted from the improved main structure, and then aligns them with the opposite side by means of an enhanced cross attention part, so as to achieve correct correspondence. By means of a blend of Gaofen-2 and Landsat-8 images, it is shown via experiment that the suggested framework has better matching precision than SIFT, ORB, and D2-Net. It gives a dependable answer to cross-modal infrared-visible remote sensing registration."

The electromagnetic interference, lack of scalability and power consumption are some of the constraints that accompany traditional wireless monitoring systems. The Internet of Things (IoT)-based optical sensor network (OSN) model of monitoring infrastructure in realtime in warehouses are suggested in the paper to address the mentioned constraints. This system operates on distributed fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors, optical wireless communication (OWC) channel and internet of things (IoT) gateways to deliver low-latency and high-bandwidth data communication, as well as being immune to interference. A mathematical model is developed to estimate the attenuation and latency of power used when deploying one of the warehouses. The results of simulation confirm that the proposed OSN is a far superior option over the existing RF-based internet of things (IoT) networks in terms of latency, energy consumption, and scalability and can be used in more sophisticated applications, such as predictive maintenance and fire detection. The solution is highly secure as well as cost effective as far as tracking smart infrastructure is concerned."

The hybrid system dynamically between LiFi and WiFi depending on the availability of LOS, projected conditions of handover, and real-time signal measurements. An extensive mathematical model is created to simulate optical and RF channels and then vehicular mobility situations are simulated. Findings indicate that the hybrid architecture uplifts the throughput, loss by 40 percent, and reliability of the handover over standalone communication systems by up to 65 percent. The work gives a basis on how to incorporate optical wireless communication in future vehicular networks with the 6G ecosystem of ITS."

Accurate retrieval of PWV is therefore essential in hydrology and meteorology. This study proposes an applied machine learning framework, termed PWV-ML, to enhance PWV estimation. Three machine learning methods, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Random Forest (RF), were evaluated using data from Radiosonde and GNSS observation stations between 2019 and 2023 across the United States and Canada. The models incorporated multiple auxiliary variables derived from AMSR2 brightness temperature data, MODIS products (MOD21A1N, MOD13A2), and seven ERA5 reanalysis variables. Results show that PWV-ML substantially outperforms traditional Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). Among the tested methods, RF achieved slightly superior accuracy. Variable selection proved critical, with dewpoint temperature (Td) and total column water vapor (TCWV) from ERA5 providing the strongest contributions. An optimized minimal input configuration, consisting of BT89V, cloud liquid water (CLW), the microwave atmospheric water vapor index (MAWVI), altitude, and Td, yielded strong agreement with ground observations (R = 0.92; RMSE = 4.77 mm; KGE = 0.87 for Radiosonde, and R = 0.91; RMSE = 2.82 mm; KGE = 0.76 for GNSS). Incorporating additional ERA5 variables further improved performance, achieving near-perfect correlations (R = 0.99). These findings demonstrate that the PWV-ML framework can retrieve PWV with high accuracy under diverse climatic conditions."

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides abundant spectral information for fine-grained target analysis, yet anomaly detection of camouflaged objects in UAV-based HSI remains challenging due to strong background similarity, spectral redundancy, and complex spatial variations across different observation scales. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Hierarchical Attentional Fusion (HAF) framework for hyperspectral camouflage target anomaly detection. The proposed model integrates a spectral–spatial self-attention mechanism to capture long-range dependencies among highly correlated spectral bands and spatial contexts, together with a hierarchical multi-scale feature fusion module to enhance robustness against target scale variations caused by different UAV flight altitudes. Specifically, the self attention module sequentially models spectral correlation and spatial dependency, while a triple-branch convolutional structure with 1×1, 3×3, and 5×5 kernels adaptively aggregates multi-scale contextual information. A composite loss function combining re construction loss, orthogonal constraint, and attention regularization is further employed to stabilize feature learning and improve anomaly separability. Experiments are conducted on real-scene UAV hyperspectral datasets containing four types of military standard camouflage nets acquired at multiple flight heights. The results demonstrate that the proposed HAF framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art hyperspectral anomaly detection methods, achieving superior AUC performance and robust generalization under complex background conditions. These findings indicate that HAF provides an effective and practical solution for UAV-based hyperspectral camouflage target detection."

Studies have demonstrated that microgels recapitulating tissues’ stiffness facilitate the observation of cellular behavior in vitro. However, encapsulating single cells in microgels with composable stiffness gradients to understand cellular responses at microscale interfaces remains challenging. Here, we propose a versatile fabrication method that integrates an enhanced vision model with time-discrete bioprinting to encapsulate single cells in microgels featuring composable stiffness. An enhanced deep learning algorithm was developed to localize single cells in microscopic images, integrating traditional image processing algorithms for improved precision. By combining single-cell positioning data with a time-discrete array based on a digital micromirror device, dynamic digital masks can be generated to control each micromirror in real time. Using these masks, MDA-MB-231 cells were encapsulated in Gelatin methacrylate microgels with tunable stiffness ranging from 1.42 to 11.42 kPa. Experimental results indicated that when the microgel stiffness gradient exceeded 2 kPa, MDA-MB-231 cells exhibited a significant response, extending toward the softer regions of the microgels. These findings illustrate that our approach provides a valuable biofabrication strategy for investigating single-cell behaviors in microgels, showing great potential for applications in 3-D single-cell research."

    "abstract": "Layer jamming brakes exhibit variable stiffness with vacuum pressure, allowing them to restrict relative motion between two points. These devices hold significant potential for wearable applications due to their lightweight nature and ability to generate substantial linear tension for load transfer or selective movement restriction. However, the challenge of integrating displacement sensors within their structure has not yet been solved. In this article, we introduce a layer jamming system with resistive sensing jamming layers. The proposed mechanism leverages the relative motion of internal overlapping sensing jamming layers to produce a variation in resistance which can inform the user about their relative displacement while also producing frictional forces. This sensing approach is inherently synergistic with the mechanism of the device as it simultaneously generates friction and enables real-time displacement measurement without altering the shape of the device. The proposed device can generate a tensile force of up to 1017 N, can sense displacements over the entire range of operation of jamming layer brakes (up to 82% displacement) with a gauge factor of 1.15 and a linearity error within 1%. We demonstrate its application as a wearable device with a controllable braking point algorithm and as an upper-arm support system."

    "abstract": "Transformers have achieved remarkable success in satellite pansharpening by effectively modeling non-local similarity. Self-attention focuses on modeling the global dependency among all token pairs, typically pixel pairs for pansharpening. Representative tokens with rich information are often ignored. This leads to redundant computation, especially for similar tokens. Instead, non-similar regions share the weights to aggregate features in a Feed-Forward Network (FFN), leading to suboptimal performance. To address these limitations, we propose ProtoFormer, a novel transformer architecture that introduces learnable prototype tokens to capture and leverage representative image structures, featuring two key contributions: 1) Shared Prototype Attention (SPA): it exploits the high redundancy and symmetry of attention maps by computing a single shared attention map between image and prototype tokens, enabling bidirectional exchange of global self-similarity information while reducing self-attention complexity from quadratic to linear; 2) Prototype-guided Content-Aadaptive FFN (PCAFN): it addresses the limitation of standard FFNs that use shared weights for all positions by leveraging prototype tokens to partition image tokens into similar-content regions, then applying region-specific content-adaptive convolution and a soft mask gate, thereby enhancing spatially adaptive feature aggregation and preserving fine edges. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art fusion methods through both qualitative and quantitative assessments on multiple test sets. Our code will be released upon acceptance."

    "abstract": "Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have emerged as an energy-efficient solution for increasing the capacity of existing wireless networks. However, recent research suggests that RIS-assisted systems require either large surfaces or reflection amplifiers connected to each element to combat the double path-loss in the reflected links, resulting in higher power consumption. In this work, we consider hybrid RIS (H-RIS) with discrete phase shifts to assist the downlink communication in a hardware-impaired massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. We aim to maximize the energy efficiency (EE) of the considered system by jointly optimizing the transmit and reflect beamformers. The considered problem is shown to be non-convex and thus challenging to solve. To address this, we use fractional programming theory to reformulate the objective and, subsequently, solve it using an alternating optimization approach. We also provide a closed-form expression for the transmit beamformer, which significantly improves the runtime of the proposed algorithm. Simulation results show that, with the proposed algorithm, H-RIS aided massive MIMO system achieves a higher EE performance under hardware impairment and perfect hardware scenarios."

Although many optimization-based methods, such as Model Predictive Control (MPC), have been proposed, most rely on exact disturbance knowledge. Moreover, existing methods typically handle only open-loop uncertainty, leading to uncontrolled state covariance and overly conservative paths. This work presents a Data-driven Stochastic MPC (DSMPC) for vehicle path planning amid obstacles and unknown unbounded disturbances. DSMPC explicitly bounds failure probability, ensures recursive feasibility under weak noise assumptions, and addresses implementation via convex optimization. It controls the full state distribution, steering it from initial to target, while handling nonconvex constraints via convex reconstruction. For unknown Gaussian noise with finite variance, we derive a confidence upper-bound from samples, avoiding performance degradation due to prior knowledge deviations. We also provide a cost reduction property, asymptotic performance bound, and recursive feasibility conditions for independent and identically distributed zero-mean and bounded-variance disturbances. Simulations show DSMPC's effectiveness in obstacle-rich cases."

To address these limitations, we introduce CE2EPlan, a controllable end-to-end topology- and geometryenhanced diffusion model, that removes restrictions on the generative process of AI design tools. Instead, it enables the model to learn how to design floor plans directly from data, capturing a wide range of solution paths from input boundaries to complete layouts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses all existing approaches using the multi-step pipeline, delivering higher-quality results with enhanced user control and greater diversity in output, bringing AI design tools closer to the versatility of human designers."

    "abstract": "4D millimeter-wave radar, as a fundamental sensor for 3D object detection, has gained increasing attention in autonomous driving due to its robustness and additional elevation information. However, the sparsity and noisiness of 4D radar point clouds hinder its broader application. Fusing camera with 4D millimeter-wave radar provides an affordable and robust solution. In this paper, a fast and effective framework HP-C4D for camera and 4D radar fusion is proposed. Three key modules are proposed in HP-C4D. Firstly, we innovatively propose the Height BEVPool to predict the height of each BEV grid with negligible delay increase during the height compression. The predicted height information is incorporated into the final object height prediction. Secondly, Perceptive View Heatmap Guidance (PVHG) is proposed to suppress background noise's generation in image BEV and assist the Height BEVPool for better height prediction. Thirdly, Interactive Guidance Fusion (IGF) is proposed to efficiently fuse image BEV and 4D radar BEV. Extensive experiments on the View-of-Delft (VoD) and TJ4DRadset datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and advance of our proposed method. It is worth highlighting that the 3D mean average precision of our proposed method is 0.71% and 3.85% higher than the latest baseline method LXL (LiDAR-Excluded-Lean) on the VoD and TJ4DRadset datasets, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, HP-C4D is the fastest method for camera and 4D radar fusion in 3D object detection on the VoD dataset, achieving 21.4 FPS on single NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU.

    "abstract": "Gait recognition provides a crucial biometric identification technique for intelligent security since it is long-range and nonintrusive. Previous methods have generally focused on gait recognition within a single modality, but with the constant advancement of multimedia sensors, there is a growing requirement for the development of multimodal and cross-modal gait recognition. The various modalities are aligned directly in a hard manner by current cross-modal approaches, which could result in class collapse caused by imbalanced learning and make learning discriminative representations difficult for the weaker modality. To overcome these limitations, we propose a unified cross-modal gait recognition framework, UniCrossGait. Specifically, we employ the knowledge distillation paradigm to transfer the knowledge of a fused multimodal teacher network, Exist Methods UniCrossGait(Ours) Figure 1: Illustration of comparison between exist methods and which serves as a shared intermediate representation, to unimodal student networks, which enables them to learn modality-invariant representations. To perform knowledge distillation effectively, we design the Direction-level Feature Imitation loss and Intra&Inter sample Correlation loss. Furthermore, we construct the Warm up operator and Distillation Balancing operator to prevent the network from falling into suboptimal solutions due to pure imitation and imbalanced distillation. Our method achieves state of-the-art (SOTA) results on cross-modal gait recognition datasets, and extensive ablation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed paradigm and modules.

This paper proposes an online monitoring method for galloping through the induced current or voltage in the ground wires, which is based on the periodic variation of mutual inductance between conductors and ground wires. The monitoring device of this method is convenient to install and maintain, and the monitoring effect is not influenced by bad weather such as fog and snow. In order to detect galloping information, a calculation model for the induced signals in the ground wires during galloping is firstly studied. Then the dynamic response of induced signals in the ground wires under different galloping conditions is analyzed. An inverse deduction method for galloping characteristics is then proposed based on the frequency features of the induced signals in the ground wires. A scaled test is conducted to verify the feasibility of the proposed method. The accuracy of deduced results is acceptable and the study offers new possibilities for overhead transmission line condition monitoring."

    "abstract": "Matrix placement machines improve production efficiency of printed circuit board assembly (PCBA), addressing critical needs for flexible and intelligent electronics manufacturing. However, their complex head structure renders solutions for traditional beam-head placement machines inefficient for matrix placement machines. This article proposes a phased hybrid algorithm with adaptive hyper-nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) for PCBA optimization. A bidirectional search mechanism is applied to derive feeder distributions and nozzle configurations, and iteratively tighten the solution space using priority-based search strategies. The softmax, max greatest common divisor, and max matching mechanisms are proposed for placement and pickup sequences, which facilitates construction of solution pools. Initial solutions are extracted from the pool and, subsequently, hyperheuristic mechanisms dynamically adjust genetic operators within NSGA-II to minimize placement, pickup, and recognition times with better convergence speed. Experimental validation with real-world production data demonstrates that the proposed algorithm achieves 6.05%–38.18% performance improvements compared to state-of-the-art solutions."

Then, we propose a new game-based algorithm by combining temporal difference method in reinforcement learning, that is, the temporal-difference(λ)- based game algorithm (TD(λ)-GA), which can achieve a balance between the running time and the solution quality. Finally, we perform numerical simulations to demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can find a high-quality solution within reasonable runtime by comparing it with other representative optimization algorithms."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Feedforward control is essential for precise output tracking in non-minimum phase systems, and stable inversion has been proposed to address input instability caused by unstable internal dynamics. However, this approach demands an accurate mathematical model, limiting its effectiveness in the presence of model uncertainties and especially in cases without a model. While data-driven control can enhance performance in these scenarios, it often fails to achieve precise tracking under input stabilitty conditions. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a unified feedforward control framework using the Koopman-type inverse operator for output tracking for disturbed non-minimum phase systems. This framework extends the applicability of the stable inversion method from model-available scenarios to model-unavailable scenarios. Besides other data-driven control approaches, it enables precise output tracking while ensuring the stability of the input, without necessitating additional design constraints. It features two novel algorithms that maintain a consistent controller structure while varying only in parameter determination methods. The convergence properties of the proposed algorithms are rigorously analyzed, and their effectiveness is verified through piezoelectric ceramic positioning experiments."

    "abstract": "Clustered-object environments challenge robotic grasp planning and implementation mainly for two reasons: (i) the limited inter-object clearance leaves insufficient space for conventional gripper fingers to approach and wrap the target object without collisions, and (ii) perception-induced position uncertainty makes it difficult to place the fingers precisely into such narrow spaces. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel robotic finger based on pin-array mechanisms to passively adapt to object clearance between adjacent objects and tolerate pose uncertainty. The tiny pins can be inserted into constrained spaces and thus construct stable grasping pairs. Unlike conventional pin-array mechanisms used in gripper design, the proposed approach utilizes the pin-array for finger design, enabling a gripper equipped with a pair of these fingers to pick objects in significantly narrower spaces than conventional grippers. This gripper also inherits the advantages of the pin-array mechanisms to facilitate shape and error adaptation. Furthermore, we conducted finite element analysis (FEA) to validate the structural design and explore the miniaturization limit, and explain the planning method for autonomous operation. The experiments quantitatively explored the adaptable clearance and validated the feasibility and robustness in real scenarios."

    "abstract": "This study presents a novel control framework for climbing robots that utilizes both rope and leg mechanisms. The proposed robot ascends steep slopes using two ropes while maintaining its balance and adapting its pose to uneven surfaces through its four legs. The robot's overall movement on the slopes is managed by an ascender module, while leg motions are governed by a reinforcement learning (RL) policy trained to sustain local stability under unpredictable disturbances from rope tensions and varying slopes. To enhance stability under partial observability, the policy integrates a latent context vector with a learned Tumble Stability Margin (TSM) for proactive instability detection. Furthermore, to recover from instability in challenging conditions such as slipping or edge hooking, the framework enables dynamic body height adaptation based on stability feedback. Validated via sim-to-real transfer, the system demonstrates that the rope-driven climbing robot maintains consistent locomotion stability across various slope environments and effectively responds to hazardous situations using its learned stability awareness."

The system combines rule-based negation detection, dependency parsing, and lexicon-driven keyword matching with contextual expansion powered by Groq’s LLM. On an expanded CheXpert-derived cohort of 2 020 reports (1 020 real and 1 000 augmented samples), MedInsight Pro achieved an average macro F1-score of 89.7%, with overall precision of 91.8%, recall of 89.4%, and negation detection accuracy of 95.1%. These results surpass keyword-only, LLM-only, and CheXpert labeler baselines. Deployed via a Streamlit interface, the system also offers explainability through clause heatmaps, radar charts, robustness visualizations under synthetic domain shift, and a clinical Q&A interface. The findings highlight the practicality of hybrid NLP–LLM pipelines as scalable, transparent decision-support tools for radiologists in real-world clinical settings. The system demonstrates strong performance in structured label extraction and offers interpretability through visualization modules and an LLM-assisted reasoning laye."

    "abstract": "Pancreatic tumor segmentation from computed tomography (CT) images remains a challenging task due to limited annotated datasets, pronounced anatomical variability, and the high computational demands of state-of-the-art deep learning models, which collectively hinder their routine clinical adoption. This study proposes a clinically oriented end-to-end framework that bridges methodological advances in deep learning with practical deployment by enabling adaptive segmentation under realistic data growth scenarios. Rather than introducing a novel segmentation architecture, the framework integrates existing convolutional and transformer-based models within a lightweight graphical user interface (GUI) and employs a recursive augmentation strategy as a simulation mechanism to emulate the incremental availability of annotated clinical data over time. Multiple candidate architectures were first evaluated using cross-validation, after which representative lightweight and high-capacity models were selected for recursive augmentation. The framework was subsequently evaluated using both CNN-based architectures, such as 3D U-Net, and transformer-based models, such as VT-UNet-B, on multiple large-scale public datasets. Across all experiments, the proposed recursive augmentation consistently improved segmentation performance relative to baseline training, yielding relative Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) gains in the range of approximately 4–11% before reaching architecture-dependent saturation. Lightweight CNNs exhibited earlier saturation with smaller but consistent improvements, whereas transformer-based models benefited more substantially from incremental data expansion. By embedding segmentation models into an interactive GUI that supports real-time visualization and expert-driven refinement, the proposed framework emphasizes deployment feasibility, adaptability, and continuous performance improvement. The results outline a practical pre-clinical pathway toward resource-aware pancreatic tumor segmentation in real-world healthcare environments."

However, routing performance suffers due to dynamic topology changes, unpredictable contact patterns, and resource constraints including limited energy and buffer capacity. These challenges compromise delivery reliability, increase latency, and reduce node longevity in highly dynamic environments. This paper proposes Cluster-based Routing using Deep Reinforcement Learning (CR-DRL), an adaptive routing approach that integrates an Actor-Critic learning framework with a heuristic function. CR-DRL enables real-time optimal relay selection and dynamic cluster overlap adjustment to maintain connectivity while minimizing redundant transmissions and enhancing routing efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines. CR-DRL extends node lifetimes by up to 21%, overall energy use is reduced by 17%, and nodes remain active for 15% longer. Communication performance also improves, with up to 10% higher delivery ratio, 28.5% lower delay, 7% higher throughput, and data requiring 30% fewer transmission steps across the network."

While prior studies suggest differences in self-awareness and motor practice when using a Controller versus a data Glove (Glove) to manipulate an avatar hand, it remains unclear whether corticospinal excitability (CSE) varies by manipulation type. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), we examined CSE before and after short-term performance change of a VR ball-catching task with a Controller or Glove. Twenty healthy adults in short-term performance change with both devices on separate days. Participants unimanually controlled an avatar hand in VR to catch a ball. We assessed changes in MI vividness, self-awareness, motor performance, and surface electromyography (EMG) with practice. Single-pulse TMS was delivered before and after practice over the contralateral motor cortex to evaluate CSE in task-related muscles at rest and during Action Observation during Motor Imagery (AOMI). MI vividness increased with practice for both devices, with no between-device differences in self-awareness. Agonist EMG decreased only with Glove practice, while CSE (motor-evoked potential amplitude) increased after Glove practice but not after Controller practice. Correlation analyses showed significant associations between EMG and motor-evoked potentials (MEP), and between ownership and MEP, after practice. These findings indicate that short-term performance change modulates CSE in a device-dependent, muscle-specific manner in a VR ball-catching task, with CSE changes linked to the sense of body ownership in VR."

In spite of these strengths, LoRa based networks are still prone to a networking range of security threats because of open wireless channels and unlicensed spectrum. The topic of the study is the improvement in data security in the context of LoRa networks that transmit the data.

This paper proposes a unified Energy Management System (EMS) framework that brings together several established methods into one conceptual platform. The first component is a neural network-based forecasting module for photovoltaic (PV) generation and load demand, which supports a two-stage storage management strategy, day-ahead mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) scheduling, and intraday model predictive control (MPC) corrections, for the coordinated operation of battery energy storage systems (BESS) and hydrogen energy storage systems (HESS). The second component is a sensitivity-based voltage control layer, implemented using a multi-agent system (MAS) to coordinate voltage regulators and inverter reactive power in real time. While the forecasting-based storage management and the decentralized voltage control operate as separate modules in the current study, the proposed framework outlines how they could be combined in future work. Each algorithm is validated individually through simulations on benchmark distribution test feeders, demonstrating reduced voltage deviations, minimized tap changes, improved energy scheduling, and enhanced state-of-charge (SOC) and level-of-hydrogen (LOH) tracking."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a sensorless control method for submersible motors based on a physics-informed neural network (PINN). The proposed model predicts the stator currents and rotor angular speed directly from voltage control inputs, eliminating the need for traditional sensors. To evaluate its effectiveness, a standard data-driven neural network (NN) was trained under identical conditions for comparison. Simulation results demonstrate that the PINN achieves faster and smoother loss convergence on training data, and exhibits superior generalization on unseen operating conditions with different loads and target speeds. These findings confirm that embedding the motor's physical dynamics into the learning process effectively improves model stability, data efficiency, and robustness for submersible motor control."

Firstly, the mathematical model of the AFFSPMM under MFPCC is established. Then, the ultra-local model and the extended state observer are designed to enable online estimation and compensation of lumped disturbances. Finally, the control system simulation model and experimental platform are developed to validate the proposed control strategy. The simulation and experimental results demonstrate that, compared with traditional model predictive current control (MPCC), the proposed strategy improves the stability and robustness of control system."

However, traditional diagnostic methods perform poorly under dynamic microgrid topology conditions. This paper proposes a graph neural network-based fault diagnosis method for AC microgrids, leveraging the advantages of a multi-perspective feature extraction module, a feature coordination attention mechanism, and a fault feature generation module. First, the microgrid topology graph is constructed, and the multi-perspective feature extraction module is employed to capture high-level semantic features and shallow features of nodes. Subsequently, the feature coordination attention mechanism dynamically allocates feature weights to enhance useful information. Finally, the Transformer encoder and fault feature extraction attention mechanism in the fault feature generation module achieve accurate discrimination of three-phase faults. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits high diagnostic accuracy and adaptability under circuit breaker state changes and line impedance fluctuations."

This paper presents an AI-powered cybersecurity framework that uses machine learning to detect unusual behavior, connect threat patterns in real time, and respond automatically with minimal human effort.Experiments using real datasets and enterprise logs show strong improvements—detection accuracy up to 96.8%, fewer false alerts, and a 96% faster incident response.

A local webcam captures live video streams processed at the edge by a Flask-Based server, integrating YOLOv8 object detection, HMM-based behavior anomaly detection, and facial recognition for identity verification. To guarantee uninterrupted operation without network connectivity, we also implement a fully offline face-recognition mode on the ESP32-CAM enabling the door to unlock locally under 100 ms. In parallel, a retrainable cloud-based Azure Custom Vision model detected object identities, assessed risk levels dynamically triggering local actions such as door control and real-time email alerts with contextual evidence. When risk levels exceed predefined thresholds, the system autonomously captures critical frames and sends alert or action-required notifications with attached visual evidence, using risk-specific visual theming. To address edge computing limitations in complex cases, recorded videos are analyzed by AWS Rekognition for comprehensive label detection. A responsive web interface provides live monitoring, event logging, OTP-based visitor access, and remote door operation, enhanced by dynamic UI feedback based on threat severity. This work demonstrates an integrated, scalable, and cost-efficient approach to edge-assisted smart security systems, laying a foundation for future improvements in multi-camera coordination ensuring the embedded firmware remains lightweight and easily updatable."

Less attention has been given to the conceptual foundations of how AI systems process financial information and support decision-making. This paper introduces a conceptual framework for stock forecasting grounded in Information Processing Theory (IPT). We adapt IPT stages of attention, encoding, storage, and retrieval to describe how a forecasting pipeline can be structured around three layers: a Data Layer for OHLCV time series and engineered indicators, a Machine Learning Layer using BiLSTM-based modeling, and an AI Analyst Layer that communicates structured outputs for decision support. By aligning this architecture with IPT, we argue that AI forecasting systems can be understood as structured information processors that parallel aspects of human reasoning while contributing to, rather than replacing, analyst expertise. The framework provides a theoretical basis for considering issues such as transparency, interpretability, and reliance, and establishes a foundation for future empirical investigations of AI applications in finance."

    "abstract": "Orthogonal Time-Frequency Space (OTFS) modulation technology has garnered significant attention in the field of wireless communications in recent years, particularly demonstrating inherent advantages in high-speed mobile scenarios. In OTFS modulation systems, the fractional Doppler effect has emerged as one of the core challenges in channel estimation under high-mobility environments such as vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks, high-speed rail, and 6G communications. OTFS effectively mitigates the impact of time-varying channels by transforming signals into the delayed Doppler (DD) domain. However, fractional Doppler disrupts the sparsity of the channel, leading to modeling errors and performance degradation in traditional grid-based sampling methods. This, in turn, results in inaccurate channel estimation, high equalization complexity, and insufficient system robustness. To address this, this paper proposes a novel network architecture based on the Unet framework with residual attention fusion (AR-Unet), specifically designed for fractional Doppler channel estimation in OTFS systems. The model is built on the Unet learning framework, enhancing nonlinear feature fitting capabilities and training stability through deep stacked residual modules. It combines a channel attention mechanism to achieve adaptive modeling of key path gain features, effectively capturing the energy structure in the delay-Doppler domain. The encoder consists of multi-scale residual stacks, performing layer-wise feature compression to significantly enhance the model’s representational capacity, while the decoder incorporates an upsampling mechanism to reconstruct high-dimensional channel structures. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to traditional deep learning methods (e.g., deep neural networks (DNN)/convolutional neural networks (CNN)) and the DRANet network, it exhibits outstanding estimation accuracy and generalization capabilities. This fully validates its application potential in complex high-mobility scenarios."

This study examines knowledge forgetting in fragmented learning through a designed experiment. Participants' knowledge retention was evaluated based on response accuracy, while EEG signals were analyzed to assess cognitive load, relaxation, and attention states during forgetting episodes. The testing effect in fragmented learning was also explored. Key findings include: (1) Forgetting and the testing effect coexist in fragmented learning — while knowledge decay occurs, retrieval practice facilitates memory recovery; (2) Cognitive load remains stable during forgetting, whereas attention and relaxation exhibit an inverse relationship; (3) Maintaining moderately high cognitive load helps reduce forgetting, while attention fluctuations correlate with knowledge loss.This research provides insights into forgetting mechanisms in fragmented learning, linking behavioral performance with neurophysiological states. The findings have theoretical and practical implications for optimizing learning strategies through testing-based interventions."

One common, low-cost tactic is the hijacking of digital signatures and their attachment to malicious binaries, with the intent of deceiving both web browsers and operating systems. While code-signing certificates have traditionally served to verify the authenticity and integrity of software, adversaries now exploit these same certificates to evade detection mechanisms and facilitate the propagation of malicious code. This study seeks to empirically evaluate how modern web browsers respond to untrusted code by analyzing their reactions to signed malicious binaries. Our analysis shows that browsers’ responses to certificate abuses may differ significantly, and the operating system may respond ineffectively potentially leaving end-users vulnerable to straightforward adversarial tactics. We also show that it is possible to significantly reduce the attack surface against certificate abuse with the use of a browser extension."

This model is extended by considering phase type distributed and possible correlated arrivals, delays and services combined with load dependent behavior. Load dependent behavior is important to model overload situations at processing devices in a realistic way. It is shown that the resulting model describes a Quasi Birth Death Process (QBD) without state dependent rates for the delays and a Level Dependent Quasi Birth Death Process (LDQBD) with state dependent rates for the delays. We present an approach based on the recursive computation of QBDs or LDQBDs which can be applied if the number of states remains moderate. Larger models can be solved by a block iteration method. Finally, we show how the population in the system can be minimized by choosing an appropriate delay rate or vector of delay rates."

    "abstract": "Secure neural network inference (SNNI) enables the use of deep neural networks in scenarios involving multiple stakeholders, protecting the confidentiality of client data and of the neural network’s parameters. The cryptographic techniques used introduce high computational overhead, leading to significant energy consumption. Reducing the energy consumption of SNNI is thus an important objective. A prerequisite for energy optimization is the ability to profile the energy consumption of SNNI. However, this is challenging due to the complexity of the cryptographic techniques, neural networks, and technical setup involved. This paper is the first to propose an energy profiling approach for SNNI. Our approach measures the energy consumption for securely processing individual layers of the neural network, thus providing fine-grained insights into the energy profile of SNNI. We evaluate our approach using the ResNet50 neural network and the Cheetah SNNI framework. Our results show that we can reliably measure the energy consumption of individual layers. By introducing short periods of inactivity between layers to disentangle them, we achieve high correlation between execution time and energy consumption, suggesting that, under appropriate conditions, execution time may be used as a proxy for energy consumption. Our approach and insights can foster the design of more energy-efficient SNNI protocols."

    "abstract": "Current designs of multimodal tracking networks primarily focus on spatial feature interaction within the backbone and lack the exploitation of temporal information. Although some approaches incorporate temporal cues by introducing sequential information from adjacent frames or employ updated temporal features during the feature extraction stage, they struggle to capture dynamic object variations and motion information in complex scenarios. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a Spatiotemporal Memory-Driven Unified Multimodal Tracking Framework (SMMTrack). Unlike existing works relying on feature interaction paradigms within the backbone network, this study innovatively introduces a decoupled backbone feature extraction framework. It deploys parallel, independent Vision Transformer (ViT) networks dedicated to extracting information from RGB and X modalities (RGB-T, RGB-D, RGB-E), abandoning the conventional intra-backbone feature interaction. Furthermore, we introduce a memory mechanism during the feature extraction stage to enable long-term object modeling. In addition, a Long-term Memory storage and retrieval module is designed to dynamically update the Memory-list, thereby allowing the model to capture object appearance variations and motion trends comprehensively. SMMTrack is a unified framework across three tasks (RGB-T, RGB-D, and RGB-E tracking). Experimental results demonstrate that SMMTrack outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, achieving outstanding performance in diverse multimodal tracking scenarios. Codes and results are released on https://github.com/qfxb/SMMTrack."

    "abstract": "The rapid iteration of artificial intelligence (AI) and 5G technologies has created essential foundations for Metaverse, easing bottlenecks in content generation, real-time interaction, and large-scale deployment. Integrating unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with semantic communication (SemCom) further provides a lightweight sensing and uplink solution, but semantic compression and bias may degrade fidelity. Generative AI (GAI), with powerful contextual modeling and generation capabilities, helps mitigate these issues. Based on this, this paper proposes a GAI-aided SemCom architecture and evaluates the feasibility of applying it to low-altitude internet of things (IoT) networks. We build evaluation models for representative image compression and GAI-aided SemCom techniques, replacing traditional task assumptions with realistic cases. Then, taking UAV networks as an example, we design a path planning and two task allocation schemes. Specifically, the UAV path planning strategy together with a greedy task allocation scheme improves the Metaverse update frequency and ensures the data freshness, while a parametrized deep Q-network (PDQN) task allocation scheme jointly optimizes Metaverse fidelity and freshness through mixed action selection, i.e., preprocessing methods (discrete) and compression size (continuous). Extensive analysis and numerical results corroborate that GAI-aided SemCom technology has practical significance in low-altitude IoT networks. Through the collaboration of multiple data processing schemes and the rational resource allocation, the fidelity and freshness of Metaverse can be greatly improved."

    "abstract": "Robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) is central to modern surgery, driving the need for intelligent systems with accurate scene understanding. Most existing surgical AI methods rely on isolated, task-specific models, leading to fragmented pipelines with limited interpretability and no unified understanding of RAS scene. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer strong zero-shot reasoning, but struggle with hallucinations, domain gaps and weak task-interdependency modeling. To address the lack of unified data for RAS scene understanding, we introduce <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">SurgCoTBench</b>, the first reasoning-focused benchmark in RAS, covering 14256 QA pairs with frame-level annotations across five major surgical tasks. Building on SurgCoTBench, we propose <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">SurgRAW</b>, a clinically aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) driven agentic workflow for zero-shot multi-task reasoning in surgery. SurgRAW employs a hierarchical reasoning workflow where an orchestrator divides surgical scene understanding into two reasoning streams and directs specialized agents to generate task-level reasoning, while higher-level agents capture workflow interdependencies or ground output clinically. Specifically, we propose a panel discussion mechanism to ensure task-specific agents collaborate synergistically and leverage on task interdependencies. Similarly, we incorporate a retrieval-augmented generation module to enrich agents with surgical knowledge and alleviate domain gaps in general VLMs. We design task-specific CoT prompts grounded in surgical domain to ensure clinically aligned reasoning, reduce hallucinations and enhance interpretability. Extensive experiments show that SurgRAW surpasses mainstream VLMs and agentic systems and outperforms a supervised model by 14.61% accuracy.

A heterogeneity-aware LoRA adaptation strategy ensures efficient edge deployment across diverse hardware, and a logit-level fusion mechanism enables real-time coordination between edge and cloud models.

The simplest and most widely used model for stability analysis for such networks is the single-inverter single- bus (SISB) equivalent model. Although quite insightful, SISB models with an L-filter for the inverter suffer from implementation difficulties due to algebraic loops. This paper develops a closed-form SISB model for grid-following (GFL) and grid-forming (GFM) inverters and derives symbolic formulation for the linearized system, which resolves algebraic loops and obtains fast results with uncompromised precision. This model is then used in an N-Dimensional Stability Boundary Tracking (ND-SBT) algorithm, which identifies the stability boundary for GFL and GFM inverters. This is the first method to infer the stability region for an arbitrary number of dimensions in a computationally efficient and software-agnostic manner while preserving accuracy. A detailed sensitivity analysis yields useful findings on the stability impact of individual parameters, while the results are validated using the IEEE 14- bus system."

    "abstract": "This work involves the development of intelligent and security-oriented Device-to-Device (D2D) routing protocols specifically designed to handle dynamic, heterogeneous, and latency-critical communications in the emerging wireless communication environment, particularly for 6G setups. For instance, conventional routing solutions based on classical deep reinforcement learning and static optimization methodologies commonly fail to scale, adapt in real-time to dynamically changing topologies, and remain robust against security threats; thus, limiting their efficacy in the architectural frame of future 6G. However, this work focuses on introducing Quantum-Meta Learning Fusion with Graph Attention Transformer Networks for low-latency and secure D2D routing in 6G. The proposed framework is formed of three critical methodologies: (i) Quantum Meta Reinforcement Learning (QMRL), (ii) Graph Attention Transformer Network (GATN), and (iii) Evolutionary Graph Neural Network (EGNN). QMRL uses the parameterized quantum circuits to better balance the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Additionally, a meta-learning module enables rapid adaptation to changing network conditions generated by gradient-based updates during end-to-end training. GATN combines graph attention mechanisms with transformer-based self-attention to capture spatial-temporal dependencies in network graphs; thus, the network will also be resilient to adversarial attacks. EGNN incorporates evolutionary approaches to enhance both node embeddings and routing policies, ensuring that traffic dynamics diversify over time and that link failures are appropriately addressed. Empirical analysis reveals that the proposed system will ultimately reduce latency by approximately 35-40%, improve the packet delivery ratio by 20%, and increase energy efficiency by 30-35% compared to classical models. Additionally, it increases resilience to jamming attacks by approximately 40%. Hence, these results substantiate the effectiveness of the fusion model in offering secure, adaptive, and low-latency routing solutions, making her a worthy candidate for future deployment in 6G D2D communications frameworks."

    "abstract": "With the accelerating advancement of electric vehicles, electric aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles, and artificial intelligence, the demand for innovative liquid-cooling-based thermal management systems for high-power-density electric and electronic systems is paramount. Conventional cooling systems, typically designed separately from the circuitry, result in inefficiencies, bulky configurations, high acoustic noise, and reliability concerns associated with rotary pumps. This work introduces an integrated design paradigm that unifies electrical and cooling systems by employing circuit components as both functional elements of the electric circuit and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) pumps for liquid metal, such as the non-toxic gallium alloy. This approach substantially enhances cooling efficiency, delivers load based self-adaptive cooling performance, and eliminates noisy and often unreliable rotary pumps. Moreover, the exceptional thermal conductivity of liquid metal relaxes the design requirements for cold plates and radiators. Prototypes of the proposed approach have demonstrated that remarkable power density can be achieved in a three-phase inverter with a self-adaptive and highly efficient integrated liquid cooling system. These innovations not only improve performance but also streamline the design process, potentially transforming cooling strategies for electric circuits across multiple industries."

Each session is represented as a node in a graph, with edges indicating the degree of resource contention between sessions. By defining a comprehensive resource demand function that accounts for CPU time, memory usage, and input/output operations, the problem is formulated as a graph partitioning task aimed at optimally distributing sessions to minimize overlap and enhance resource utilization. The paper outlines the implementation of the QAOA algorithm using Cirq, including the construction of the quantum circuit, the optimization of parameters, and the measurement of results. The results are visualized through graphs and heatmaps that illustrate the division of sessions and the reduction in resource contention. As its main contribution, the paper demonstrates the practical application of quantum algorithms to resource allocation in database systems, indicating a promising approach for improving system performance and mitigating resource conflicts."

However, its practical adoption is challenged by privacy risks and unsustainable incentive structures that inadequately compensate for workers' inherent participation costs, leading to diminished motivation, sparse task coverage, and reduced data availability. Existing approaches either provide limited and utility-degrading privacy protection or design incentive mechanisms that incur substantial costs, even under the Nash equilibrium. To bridge this gap, we propose C-PRISM (Compre hensive Privacy-preserving and Behavioral-Incentive Sustainable crowdsensing Mechanism), an integrated framework that seamlessly combines privacy-preserving techniques with behavioral economic incentive design. Specifically, C-PRISM employs ran domized matrix perturbation for fine-grained location protection and a two-phase proxy re-encryption protocol to secure task details and sensing data across evaluation, recruitment, and transmission. Building upon this secure foundation, behavioral economic incentives grounded in prospect theory, the Aronson effect, and a dual reference-point model are introduced to promote sustained worker participation at sub-Nash-equilibrium costs. Rigorous theoretical analysis validates C-PRISM's security and individual rationality. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that C-PRISM increases data collection efficiency by 7.42%-193.75%, improves worker retention by 2.53%-69.78%, and effectively maintains overall system utility."

Therefore, the development of an efficient Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled low-altitude surveillance network has become an urgent necessity. This paper proposes a new deployment optimization approach for low-altitude airspace surveillance network (LASN). A detector signal-UAV accessibility strategy is proposed to explicitly account for urban structural characteristics.

A number of different quadratic constraints are established for the magnitude nonlinearity and then used to derive stability criteria based on quadratic and Lurie-type Lyapunov functions. The new stability criteria are cast as matrix inequalities and in some cases solved using semi-definite programming. Connections are made between the magnitude nonlinearity and neural network activation functions, such as the rectified linear unit (ReLU) and leaky ReLU, effectively allowing the stability criteria derived here to be used to analyse interconnections of dynamical systems and neural networks. Using the positive homogeneity property, shared by the (leaky) ReLU and magnitude functions, mild conditions are also established to show that the existence of a unique equilibrium point is sufficient for local and global stability to be equivalent. Finally, the new global stability criteria are tested on several numerical examples, including a Hopfield network with 100 states and neurons, and compare favourably with competing criteria from the literature."

Compared to conventional mud- and electromagnetic (EM)-pulse methods which are susceptible to interference and exhibit significant attenuation due to high-temperature circumstances, fiber optic communication is able to resolve these issues thanks to its high-speed and EM interference immunity in electro-optical coupling. There already exists high-temperature fibers which can serve in underground scenarios, but the transmitter which can be integrated into a tubing pup joint and operates at >150°C faces technical challenge and has limited report from literature. In this work, a pure analog electro-optical conversion (EOC) module (analog driver) supporting measurement and digital data transmission for downhole drilling up to 6 km has been developed. A thermal compensation modality was proposed for diodes rectification, which allows optical data transmission within a dynamic temperature range from 25°C to 175°C. The EOC module enables OOK modulation and is compatible to TTL/RS-485 digital signal with a wide frequency range. Validated by experiments, this EOC module can achieve mW-level optical power output within the designed temperature range. By counting the losses in 1550 nm fiber, the system still reaches 115200 bps Baud rate of serial communication which is more than 4-order higher than the mud-pulse in transmitting measured data in the downhole."

Initially centered on designing and enhancing sports equipment and devices, the discipline has transitioned into a more interdisciplinary domain referred to as Intelligent Sports Engineering. This study seeks to examine the status quo of Intelligent Sports Engineering programs by analyzing data from two universities’ official websites. A novel blended learning (BL) framework for an Intelligent Sports Engineering Program is proposed, emphasizing: (1) an integration of online and in-person coursework, augmented by virtual laboratories and practical, hands-on training in on-site laboratories, and industry partnerships; (2) a dynamic and customizable curriculum tailored to meet the needs of diverse groups, including college students and the general public; and (3) artificial intelligence-driven personalization to optimize learning pathways for individual learner. The envisioned program aims to equip learners with cutting-edge technologies and methodologies to foster a sustainable sports ecosystem, i.e. to enhance elite athlete performance, promote public health, prevent injuries, and minimize environmental impact through advanced protective gear and injury mitigation strategies. Achieving these objectives necessitates a robust interdisciplinary approach, requiring the collaboration of highly skilled faculty, engineers, practitioners, and administrators across academic institutions, research centers, and sports organizations worldwide.

A joint operation strategy based on the collaborative control of photovoltaic systems, diesel generators, and energy storage systems is proposed. By constructing five operational modes, the strategy achieves dynamic source-load matching and ensures stable system operation. The backup power mode guarantees rapid response during main grid failures, the load balancing mode optimizes energy distribution under low-load conditions, the peak shaving mode collaboratively handles load peaks, the fuel-saving mode reduces fuel consumption through the economic load rate of diesel generators, and the fast power balancing mode suppresses sudden power fluctuations. Simulation results based on MATLAB/Simulink demonstrate that the proposed strategy effectively enhances system stability and economic performance, supports smooth grid-connected/islanded transitions, and meets power demand under various operating conditions. The research findings provide a theoretical foundation and technical reference for microgrid systems with high penetration of renewable energy, contributing significantly to the advancement of clean energy applications and the sustainable development of power systems."

Traditional GPU virtualization approaches typically rely on time slicing and spatial partitioning to allocate resources. However, these methods often suffer from inefficiencies such as heavy GPU context switching and unbalanced warp scheduling. In this work, we propose and implement a novel resource scheduling algorithm called KernelPID, which dynamically adjusts the dispatch of GPU kernel functions for fine-grained control over computing resources. By closely managing kernel function distribution, KernelPID minimizes performance overhead and enhances resource utilization. To further accelerate the convergence of resource control, we introduce an auxiliary algorithm: kTune, an adaptive hyperparameter tuning method. These techniques enhance the responsiveness and precision of the KernelPID scheduler by providing internal parameter optimization based on real-time workload characteristics. Together, this suite of algorithms enables an efficient and scalable GPU virtualization framework that significantly improves performance isolation and resource efficiency in multi-tenant GPU environments."

Empirical spacing rules secure coverage yet do not guarantee reconstruction accuracy in complex terrain, whereas optimization-based siting often lacks an interpretable sampling scale and a unified evaluation. We present a physics- and data-driven framework that couples an empirically estimated correlation scale with constrained global optimization, semivariograms from historical records define a maximum interstation spacing used as a hard coverage constraint, then a genetic algorithm minimizes weighted-interpolation error subject to right-of-way, accessibility, and minimum-separation constraints and is benchmarked under a unified protocol against uniform and terrain-weighted layouts. In a real UHV corridor, the framework achieves full coverage with a maximum spacing of about 8 km and reduces wind-speed reconstruction error relative to uniform placement—RMSE from 2.41 to 2.10 m/s, MAE from 2.14 to 1.88 m/s, and MAPE from 26.93% to 23.82% —while improving network compactness. By linking an interpretable correlation scale with global optimization, the approach provides a practical basis for planning, staged densification, and rapid emergency deployment of corridor monitoring networks."

Second, we employ Space-to-Depth Convolution (SPDConv) in the network’s downsampling operations to preserve spatial information that would otherwise be lost with traditional strided convolutions. Third, we extend the detection capability by incorporating a P2-level detection head operating at 160×160 resolution, specifically targeting objects as small as 4×4 pixels. Extensive experiments on the challenging VisDrone dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves 26.7% mAP@0.5:0.95 with only an 11% increase in parameters compared to baseline YOLOv8n, showing particular improvements in detecting pedestrians, vehicles, and other small objects in complex aerial scenes."

However, the refined numerical models have the problems of complex modeling and low computational efficiency, which are difficult to meet the requirements of rapid simulation in engineering practice. Therefore, this study proposes a simplified method based on thermal parameter equivalence, aiming to improve the reliability and speed of numerical calculation of transformer temperature fluid field. According to the structure of the transformer winding, the equivalent thermal parameters method is used to derive the equivalent thermal conductivity and equivalent specific heat capacity in the radial and axial directions. Then, a two-dimensional fine model considering the winding details and a two-dimensional simplified model using equivalent thermal parameters are established respectively, and the temperature fluid field simulation is carried out under the same boundary and load conditions. The comparison results show that the overall temperature field distribution characteristics obtained by the simplified model based on thermal parameter equivalence and the fine model are highly consistent, with the simulation error of the hot spot temperature not exceeding 1℃. The total number of grids is reduced by 86.41%, and the calculation time is shortened by 71.43%. The equivalent model greatly reduces the difficulty and number of grid division, and the computational efficiency is improved by an order of magnitude."

To address these challenges, we present a Targetless LiDAR–Camera Calibration (TLC-Calib) that jointly optimizes sensor poses with a neural Gaussian–based scene representation. Reliable LiDAR points are frozen as anchor Gaussians to preserve global structure, while auxiliary Gaussians prevent local overfitting under noisy initialization. Our fully differentiable pipeline with photometric and geometric regularization achieves robust and generalizable calibration, consistently outperforming existing targetless methods on the KITTI-360, WAYMO, and FAST-LIVO2 datasets.

    "abstract": "Intelligent acoustic emission-based pipeline leak detection technology plays a critical role in Internet of Things structural health monitoring for offshore platforms. However, traditional deep networks possess large parameter counts and high computational complexity, making them infeasible for deployment on resource-constrained edge nodes, while lightweight methods universally adopt single-scale feature extraction and cannot simultaneously capture short-duration burst and long-range attenuation characteristics of acoustic emission signals, resulting in insufficient discriminative capability for adjacent valves. To address this, this paper proposes Tiny Leak Sense Net (TinyLSN), a novel lightweight leak localization framework specifically designed for Internet of Things edge nodes. TinyLSN achieves optimal balance between computational efficiency and detection performance through three innovative components we designed including the Inverted Residual Block (IRB), Multi-Scale Dilated Perception Module (MSDPM), and Large Kernel Feed-Forward Network (LK-FFN), which respectively enhance cross-channel interactions, capture multi-scale temporal features, and extract global attenuation patterns. On our self-constructed experimental dataset simulating real offshore platform operational pipeline leakage, TinyLSN achieved detection accuracy of 97.11% to 97.45% and an extremely low false positive rate of 0.27% to 0.32%, significantly outperforming lightweight baseline methods. Validation on publicly available benchmark datasets further confirmed its generalization capability. When deployed on the STM32H7B3I-DK microcontroller, TinyLSN requires only 267.16 KiB Flash memory and achieves 3.417 ms inference latency. Furthermore, TinyLSN maintains over 90% accuracy under strong noise and achieves 94.83% accuracy with only 10% training samples, fully validating its reliability in harsh industrial environments and providing an efficient and feasible solution for offshore platform Internet of Things edge intelligence."

    "abstract": "To reduce the computational cost of finite element analysis for rapid optimal motor design, surrogate modeling techniques have been widely studied. While conventional surrogate models mainly predict scalar performance metrics, propulsion motors must be evaluated over a wide operating range, requiring the prediction of high-dimensional outputs such as efficiency maps. Owing to the large dimensional gap between design variables and efficiency maps, conventional neural networks often suffer from limited accuracy and unstable convergence. This paper proposes a Tandem Variational Autoencoder (TD-VAE) that directly predicts high-dimensional efficiency maps from motor design variables. The model employs a tandem architecture in which a variational autoencoder compresses and reconstructs efficiency maps, while an auxiliary autoencoder reconstructs the design variables to enforce latent consistency. This structure enables stable training and allows previously collected simulation data to be used without modification. The TD-VAE is further extended to predict physically interpretable loss components, including copper and iron losses. The model performance is evaluated using mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and the coefficient of determination (R²), and predictive uncertainty is analyzed through pixel-wise confidence and prediction intervals. When applied to an interior permanent magnet synchronous motor, the proposed TD-VAE achieves a maximum MAPE of 0.18% compared with finite element analysis, demonstrating accurate prediction, stable convergence, and significantly reduced design iteration time."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel specified-time adaptive output-feedback control scheme for microelectromechanical system (MEMS) gyroscopes subjected to sampling constraint. The primary contribution of this study lies in the development of a computationally efficient Unknown System Dynamics Estimator (USDE) based on the invariant manifold principle, which accurately estimates total system uncertainty with minimal computational cost. To overcome the potential corruption of velocity signals due to measurement noise and the inherent resource limitations of MEMS gyroscope platforms, we integrate a variable-threshold event-triggered state observer into the USDE. This innovative architecture replaces actual velocity measurements with their estimated values, ensuring high estimation accuracy while minimizing computational burden. Additionally, to meet the stringent response speed requirements of MEMS gyroscopes in practical applications, we introduce a Specified-Time Funnel Control (STFC) scheme. This control approach guarantees that the displacement error converges to the desired value within a predefined time, simultaneously constraining the error bounds, which results in superior transient and steady-state performance of the system. The novelty of this work lies in the combination of the USDE with the event-triggered observer and STFC, providing a robust solution for MEMS gyroscope control under stringent resource constraints. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method are rigorously validated through both theoretical stability analysis using Lyapunov methods and extensive simulation and experimental results, demonstrating its significant improvement over existing approaches."

    "abstract": "Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) has emerged as promising candidates for self-powered systems due to their ability to harvest mechanical energy and serve as active sensors. In this work, we report the fabrication of a barium titanate nanowire (BTOnws)-doped poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) composite TENG, designed to enhance mechanical robustness and electrical output. The optimized TENG exhibits stable and superior output performance including open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 280 V, short-circuit current (ISC) of 12 μA, and power density of 1.45 W/m2. The effects of device structural on output performance are systematically investigated. Environmental stability tests reveal that the TENG maintained stable voltage and current outputs across a wide temperature/humidity range and over 10,000 contact–separation cycles and that the output attenuation of this TENG is superior to that of the previously reported PVDF-based TENG. Furthermore, we verify its power supply capability by lighting up 52 LEDs and fabricated a new TENG-integrated table tennis bat for wireless position detection. The sensing system utilize a two-stage amplification circuit to overcome the high output impedance of TENGs, achieving accurate localization of ball impacts with only nine sensing units. This study not only provides insights into optimizing TENG structural and environmental resilience but also highlights their potential in electronic devices, sports analytics, and intelligent sensing networks."

    "abstract": "Objects in remotesensing imagery are often unevenly distributed and densely clustered, making foreground selection particularly challenging. In two-stage detectors, the Region Proposal Network (RPN) is pivotal, yet proposals from conventional RPNs can be imprecise and redundant, hurting recall and inflating computation.We introduce GaussFocus, a density-guided two-stage detector that builds a unified Gaussian foreground prior from rotated annotations and injects it into proposal generation, feature sampling, and RoI score calibration. Specifically, we derive an image-level Gaussian foreground density map and train a lightweight density branch inside the RPN, where MDeformConv uses regression-guided offsets and density-aware gating to produce features that better align with object geometry and foreground regions. A Gauss Guided Selector further leverages the predicted density map to retain proposals concentrated in foreground-dense areas, reducing background clutter and second-stage computation. In addition, an inference-only Gauss-Guided RoI logit shift calibrates RoI classification scores using the same density prior without retraining, leading to more reliable foreground–background separation and ranking. Across four challenging datasets (including DOTA-v1.0, DOTA-v2.0, and HRSC2016), GaussFocus consistently improves proposal quality and detection accuracy over strong baselines while reducing redundant RoIs and computation."

    "abstract": "Contemporary resonant DC-link inverter (RDCLI) designs predominantly maintain soft-switching operation exclusively during unidirectional power flow from the DC source to the load. However, under reverse power transfer conditions where energy flows from the load back to the DC bus, the auxiliary circuits fail to enable zero-voltage or zero-current switching for the main power devices. This limitation results in conventional hard-switching operation during regenerative modes, consequently compromising the system's overall energy recovery efficiency. This paper proposes a novel RDCLI incorporating two structurally symmetrical auxiliary resonant circuits at the DC interface. These complementary circuits operate alternately according to the direction of power flow, enabling consistent soft-switching performance during bidirectional energy transfer. Furthermore, in the event of an open-circuit fault within either auxiliary set, the inverter maintains soft-switching capability along one power flow direction while experiencing performance degradation only in the opposite direction. This fault-tolerant characteristic prevents complete loss of soft-switching functionality across both power transfer directions during auxiliary device failures. This work presents a systematic analysis of the auxiliary network's operational mechanisms under bidirectional power flow conditions, coupled with the development of a complete parametric design framework. Experimental results verify that the auxiliary circuit maintains all theoretically derived operating modes during both power flow directions, with all semiconductor devices successfully achieving soft-switching transitions throughout the operational range. The measured peak efficiencies of 98.1% in forward operation and 96.7% in reverse operation at rated power establish the distinct advantage of the proposed bidirectional architecture over conventional unidirectional soft-switching alternatives. These findings validate the topology's considerable potential to advance the performance envelope and practical implementation of resonant DC-link solutions in high-frequency bidirectional power conversion systems."

    "abstract": "Flat wire winding has some advantages, such as a high slot fill factor and low vibration noise, which is a mainstream technology solution for vehicle drive motors. However, when the motors operate at high-speeds, high-frequency AC losses of the flat wire winding are prominent, which directly limit the improvement of motor efficiency and power density. To reduce high-frequency AC losses, this article proposed a scheme based on end transposed winding (ETW). The conductors near the slot openings use ETW, whereas those in the other layers are flat wire windings. Firstly, based on the distribution of AC losses in the flat wire winding (FWW), the ETW scheme is proposed. Then, the stator winding slot shape and conductor size parameters are optimized to determine the structural dimensions. Finally, the AC losses and efficiency of ETW and the original FWW are calculated and compared, as well as the impact on efficiency under the China Light-duty vehicle Test Cycle (CLTC) driving conditions. The effectiveness of the proposed ETW prototype in suppressing AC loss is verified experimentally. The results indicate that, compared with the FWW, the AC loss of the proposed ETW is reduced by 21.2% at the 24000r/min."

    "abstract": "Some smart contracts violate decentralization principles by defining privileged accounts that manage other users' assets without permission, introducing centralized risks that have caused financial losses. Existing methods, however, face challenges in accurately detecting diverse centralized risks due to their dependence on predefined behavior patterns. In this paper, we propose JANUS, an automated analyzer for Solidity smart contracts that detects financial centralized risks independently of their specific behaviors. JANUS identifies differences between states reached by privileged and ordinary accounts, and analyzes whether these differences are finance-related. Focusing on the impact of risks rather than behaviors, JANUS achieves improved accuracy compared to existing tools and can uncover centralized risks with unknown patterns. To evaluate JANUS's performance, we compare it with other tools using a dataset of 540 contracts. Our evaluation demonstrates that JANUS outperforms representative tools in terms of detection accuracy for financial centralized risks. Additionally, we evaluate JANUS on a real-world dataset of 33,151 contracts, successfully identifying two types of risks that other tools fail to detect. We also prove that the state traversal method and variable summaries, which are used in JANUS to reduce the number of states to be compared, do not introduce false alarms or omissions in detection."

Additionally, existing CSLR datasets are collected in controlled settings, which restricts their effectiveness in building robust real-world CSLR systems. To address these limitations, we present Isharah, a large multi-scene dataset for CSLR. It is the first dataset of its type and size, collected in an unconstrained environment using signers' smartphones. This setup resulted in high variations of recording settings, camera distances, angles, and resolutions. This variation helps with developing sign language understanding models capable of handling the variability and complexity of real-world scenarios. The dataset consists of 30,000 video clips performed by 18 deaf and professional signers. Additionally, the dataset is linguistically rich as it provides a gloss-level annotation for all dataset's videos, making it useful for developing CSLR and sign language translation (SLT) systems. This paper also introduces multiple sign language understanding benchmarks, including signer-independent and unseen-sentence CSLR, along with gloss-based and gloss-free SLT."

    "abstract": "Code LLMs (CLLMs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where semantically identical code mutations mislead models into incorrect predictions. To address this, adversarial training has been proposed, retraining models with adversarial examples generated by attack methods. Among various attack approaches, black-box methods have attracted increasing attention due to their flexibility and applicability. However, existing black-box attack methods face two key challenges: 1) vast mutation spaces limit attack efficiency and effectiveness, and 2) resource-intensive model queries constrain scalability. These challenges hinder the practicality of black-box attacks, especially under resource constraints, prompting the critical question: <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Can we enhance the efficiency of existing attack methods without compromising their effectiveness?</i> To answer this, we conduct an empirical study using Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to investigate differences between adversarial and non-adversarial (failure) examples. After analyzing state-of-the-art attack methods against two CLLMs, we introduce the concept of <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">model attention deviation</i>, which quantifies differences in the model’s focus between unmutated (original) and mutated code. Our findings reveal that adversarial examples exhibit significant attention deviations, with the direction of deviation critically affecting attack success. Building on these insights, we propose ADVSEL, an efficient adversarial attack framework comprising two proxy components: the Attention Proxy Model (APM), which quickly estimates attention deviations to filter unpromising mutations, and the Deviation Direction Proxy Model (DDPM), which assesses whether attention shifts lead toward incorrect predictions. By integrating these proxy models with existing attack methods, A<sc xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">DV</small>S<sc xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">EL</small> effectively prioritizes promising mutations, significantly improving attack efficiency. Experimental evaluations across five CLLMs, four downstream tasks, and three attack methods demonstrate that ADVSEL maintains comparable attack success rates (a slight ASR reduction of 0.62%–0.70%) while significantly reducing model queries (by 34.98%–42.91%) and runtime (by 20.84%–21.45%). Under resource constraints, ADVSEL consistently outperforms baselines, highlighting its practical advantage in cost-effective adversarial evaluation."

A WCGAN-GP model is constructed by integrating Wasserstein distance with conditional generative adversarial learning to achieve high-quality augmentation of small-sample data. An improved Residual Network (ResNet) and an enhanced Densely Connected Network (DenseNet) are employed to perform deep feature extraction from multimodal data. A Multi-Layer Cross-Attention (MLCA) mechanism is introduced within the network to fuse deep multimodal features, enabling early fault diagnosis of transformers. Finally, the proposed intelligent diagnosis method is validated using both simulation data and dynamic model test data, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving diagnostic accuracy."

To overcome the communication bottlenecks of traditional federated learning, OTA-FedTransformer employs analog over-the-air aggregation, significantly reducing uplink communication overhead while preserving model convergence integrity. The framework incorporates model compression techniques, including attention-head pruning and quantized transformer weights, to ensure deployment feasibility across heterogeneous and resource-constrained edge clients. Experimental evaluation on a synthetic 6G slicing dataset demonstrates that OTA-FedTransformer achieves a ~9.2% improvement in accuracy and a 62% reduction in convergence time compared to FedAvg and OTA-FL baselines. Moreover, it maintains stable performance under non-IID data and wireless noise conditions, demonstrating its robustness and scalability.

We develop a GIS-based multi-criteria risk model using publicly available data sources including census tract boundaries from NJOGIS and the U.S. Census Bureau, internet-exposed Industrial Control System (ICS) devices identified via Shodan passive scanning, FEMA Digital Flood Insurance Rate Maps, and CDC Social Vulnerability Index data at the census-tract level. Risk scores are generated via weighted linear combination with equal weights applied to each component (33% each) to provide a balanced, transparent assessment. Preliminary analysis reveals exposed ICS devices concentrated in Newark and elevated social vulnerability scores in 62% of Essex County tracts, suggesting non-trivial spatial overlap of vulnerability factors. Final outputs include a composite risk map and statistically significant hotspots identified via Moran’s I spatial autocorrelation and Getis-Ord Gi* analysis. This work demonstrates how open-source geospatial analytics can bridge academic research, utility operations, and state energy policy, enhancing grid resilience where it matters most."

    "abstract": "The excitation controller is the core component for regulating the excitation current and controlling the output voltage of a generator. By employing wide-band gap power devices (such as SiC and GaN), the excitation controller achieves the advantages of low losses and high switching frequency. However, parasitic capacitance in the circuit can significantly affect the switching performance of power devices, increase switching losses, and introduce oscillations and electromagnetic interference. Among these, the parasitic capacitance of the excitation winding is a critical part of the excitation control circuit, and reducing its value can effectively enhance the controller’s performance. For multi-layer, multi-turn annular windings, the calculation of the equivalent total parasitic capacitance C<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</inf> becomes particularly complex due to strict slot-width constraints. In practical applications, mismatches between conductor diameter and fixed slot width often cause coil displacement, leading to a non-uniform winding distribution, which makes the traditional uniform-winding assumption no longer applicable. To address this, this paper proposes an analytical modeling method for non-uniform annular windings. The winding is conceptually divided into a uniformly distributed Region I and a slot-constrained nonuniform Region II. Analytical expressions of inter-turn capacitance C<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">tt</inf> and inter-layer capacitance C<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ll</inf> between adjacent circular conductors are derived.

The total parasitic capacitance C<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</inf> is then calculated using the principle of energy conservation, by equating the electrostatic energy stored in the equivalent network with that stored in the actual winding. Finally, finite element simulations are conducted to validate the proposed analytical model, demonstrating its accuracy and effectiveness."

With the rapid development of AI technology, educational assessment theory has undergone four iterations and has now entered the fifth generation, which is characterized by \"intelligence.\" Human-AI collaborative assessment has become an inevitable trend. This paper analyzes the policy basis and theoretical foundation for constructing the new assessment system, proposes the elements of the AI-empowered English assessment system in primary and secondary schools, and provides a detailed analysis and interpretation from seven aspects: the fundamental assessment goal of cultivating virtue and talent, the multi-dimensional assessment subjects of human-computer collaboration, the multiple assessment contents focusing on core literacy, the indepth multi-dimensional assessment standards, the scientific and intelligent assessment tools, the diverse assessment methods focusing on process and value-added, and the instant and multimodal assessment feedback. It is expected to provide references for future research."

    "abstract": "To address transient overvoltage (TOV) and steady-state instability risks in high-penetration wind power DC-transmission systems, as well as the response mismatch issues from independent control of synchronous condensers (SCs) and energy storage systems (ESSs), this paper proposes a SC–ESS coordinated control strategy leveraging functional complementarity. By analyzing the mechanisms of TOV formation, a \" voltage–frequency double closed-loop\" control architecture is designed: The inner frequency loop adopts droop control for fast ESS active power compensation to suppress frequency fluctuations, while the outer voltage loop employs PI control to coordinate reactive power allocation—with SCs as the primary provider and ESSs as auxiliary regulators. Power coordination between the two is achieved through a dynamic division-of-labor mechanism based on voltage deviation thresholds, resolving response mismatches and functional overlaps in traditional single-device or independent control strategies. Simulations on a DC transmission system model demonstrate that the proposed strategy effectively suppresses TOV, significantly improves system power characteristics, enhances transient stability, and provides a feasible solution for the secure operation of high-penetration wind power systems."

The application of localization systems based on the radio frequencies is characterized by the problems of multi-pathing, congestion of the spectrum, and the consumption of even more energy in highdensity indoor areas. In this paper, a proposal is made to design an energy efficient LiFi based localization system with indoor coverage based on a current LED lighting system that offers high accuracy positions to users at very low power overhead cost. There is the development of a received signal strength (RSS)based localization model using the economic channel qualities, and an energy consumption model is created to measure system efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate sub-meter localization accuracy with up to 40% lower energy consumption compared to WiFi-based indoor positioning systems, making the proposed approach suitable for sustainable smart campus deployments."

We use Sentinel-1 A/B SAR and hydrography data acquired in Fram Strait and near Svalbard in summer 2018. Amplitudes of ISWs are obtained using nonlinear phase speed of ISWs derived from sequential SAR observations and linear phase speed of first mode internal waves theoretically predicted from vertical density profiles within a two-layer KdV model. Comparison of SAR-based phase speeds of ISWs with theoretical predictions generally shows the best correspondence when the time lag between satellite and in situ data is shortest. The range of predicted ISW amplitudes is from 2 to 56 m, in agreement with in situ records made in the study region. The proposed methodology gives promising results for detection of large-amplitude ISWs and quantify their energetics in the Arctic Ocean."

However, these policies remain highly sensitive to domain shifts stemming from background or robot embodiment changes, which limits their generalization capabilities. In this paper, we present ARRO, a novel visual representation that leverages zero-shot open-vocabulary segmentation and object detection models to efficiently mask out task-irrelevant regions of the scene in real time without requiring additional training, modeling of the setup, or camera calibration. By filtering visual distractors and overlaying virtual guides during both training and inference, ARRO improves robustness to scene variations and reduces the need for additional data collection. We extensively evaluate ARRO with Diffusion Policy on a range of tabletop manipulation tasks in both simulation and real-world environments, and further demonstrate its compatibility and effectiveness with generalist robot policies, such as Octo, OpenVLA and <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\pi _{0}$</tex-math></inline-formula>. Across all settings in our evaluation, ARRO yields consistent performance gains, allows for selective masking to choose between different objects, and shows robustness even to challenging segmentation conditions.

Then, the novel neural-adaptive distributed FTCT protocol and actuator attack estimation protocol are designed based on the radial basis function neural network estimation method. The sliding mode control with a partitioning strategy is adopted for the FTCT problem analysis of singular multiagent systems. The sufficient conditions and solving strategies of FTCT for singular multiagent systems over the whole finite-time interval are provided. Finally, the validity of FTCT for singular multiagent systems is verified by simulation examples."

We find existing frequencybased SR methods cannot balance the reconstruction of overall structures and high-frequency parts. Meanwhile, these methods are inefficient for handling frequency features and unsuitable for lightweight SR. In this paper, we show introducing both wavelet and Fourier information allows our model to consider both highfrequency features and overall SR structure reconstruction while reducing costs. Specifically, we propose a Dual-domain Modulation Network that integrates both wavelet and Fourier information for enhanced frequency modeling. Unlike existing methods that rely on a single frequency representation, our design combines wavelet-domain modulation via a Wavelet-domain Modulation Transformer (WMT) with global Fourier supervision, enabling complementary spectral learning well-suited for lightweight SR. Experimental results show that our method achieves a comparable PSNR of SRFormer [1] and MambaIR [2] while with less than 50% and 60% of their FLOPs and achieving inference speeds 15.4× and 5.4× faster, respectively, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method on SR quality and lightweight."

    "abstract": "Many images and videos are primarily processed by computer vision algorithms, involving only occasional human inspection. When this content requires compression before processing, e.g., in distributed applications, coding methods must optimize for both visual quality and downstream task performance. We first show that, given the features obtained from the original and the decoded images, an approach to reduce the effect of compression on a task loss is to perform rate-distortion optimization (RDO) using the distance between features as a distortion metric. However, optimizing directly such a rate-distortion trade-off requires an iterative workflow of encoding, decoding, and feature evaluation for each coding parameter, which is computationally impractical. We address this problem by simplifying the RDO formulation to make the distortion term computable using block-based encoders. We first apply Taylor's expansion to the feature extractor, recasting the feature distance as a quadratic metric with the Jacobian matrix of the neural network. Then, we replace the linearized metric with a block-wise approximation, which we call input-dependent squared error (IDSE). To reduce computational complexity, we approximate IDSE using Jacobian sketches. The resulting loss can be evaluated block-wise in the transform domain and combined with the sum of squared errors (SSE) to address both visual quality and computer vision performance. Simulations with AVC across multiple feature extractors and downstream neural networks show up to 10% bit-rate savings for the same computer vision accuracy compared to RDO based on SSE, with no decoder complexity overhead and just a 7% encoder complexity increase."

    "abstract": "Depression is a common mental illness that can greatly impact an individual's ability to function when the condition is severe. With the proliferation of social media platforms, more and more studies have started to analyze users' social media data to detect their depression. However, most of the existing studies ignore information about users' cognitive distortions. In addition, these studies focus only on the semantic information of users' posts and ignore a variety of user-level information related to depression. To address these weaknesses, we propose a depression detection model fusing cognitive distortions and user-level information. On the one hand, the model captures potential multi-granularity cognitive distortion in formation in user text via a cognitive distortion encoder trained by a multi-granularity cognitive distortion learning method. In addition, we propose a post-level distortion aware mechanism to identify key cognitive distortion in formation related to the subjective cognition of users. On the other hand, the model fuses user-level information that is highly correlated with depression symptoms. It also dynamically identifies key post-level fusion information and multiple user-level information for different users through a multi-feature adaptive weighting method, which reduces noise from data irregularities. The results of the experiments show that the model achieves state-of-the-art performance on a public dataset. In addition, we discuss the impact of different cognitive distortion learning strategies and the importance of different user-level information in detecting depression through various experiments."

    "abstract": "The growing proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has intensified the need for sustainable energy solutions, particularly in resource-constrained deployments where non-rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors are the primary energy sources. Green IoT (G-IoT) frameworks address this challenge by combining energy-saving techniques with energy harvesting from ambient sources such as solar power. However, the intermittent nature of renewable energy and the non-ideal behavior of energy storage systems-such as energy leakage and capacity degradation-complicate reliable energy provisioning. This paper presents a novel Markovian framework for modelling the coupled dynamics of time-varying solar energy harvesting, time-dependent energy consumption, and state-dependent energy leakage in G-IoT systems. Unlike traditional steady-state models, our approach uses Discrete-Time Markov Chains (DTMCs) to capture the stochastic variability in both energy harvesting and consumption processes. We also introduce a refined leakage model in which the leakage rate is dynamically dependent on the stored energy level, enabling a more realistic characterization of energy losses due to energy leakage. Through extensive analytical evaluation, we examine how key parameters-such as storage capacity, leakage rate coefficient, and energy harvesting and consumption patterns-affect critical performance metrics, including the mean stored energy and energy-related service outage probability. Furthermore, we propose a parameter tuning strategy to optimize energy reliability and storage efficiency. The proposed model provides valuable insights for the design and optimization of robust, energy-aware IoT systems powered by renewable energy sources."

The proposed approach integrates the Nesterov accelerated gradient method with FxT concurrent learning to achieve rapid convergence while ensuring optimal performance. Actor-critic neural networks (NN) are employed to approximate the optimal value function and control policy, where the accelerated gradient mechanism introduces auxiliary variables to enhance learning efficiency. A FxT concurrent learning algorithm is developed to update the NN weights, guaranteeing convergence to bounded regions within fixed time independent of initial conditions. Lyapunov stability analysis proves that both the closed-loop system states and NN estimation errors are ultimately uniformly bounded with FxT NN weights convergence properties. Simulation results on a nonlinear system validate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme. Compared to the baseline methods like FxT-ADP, the proposed NAG-FxT-AC reduces the state convergence time by up to 12% and the weight convergence time by 84%, demonstrating superior learning efficiency."

    "abstract": "Missing data remain a critical challenge in data analysis, often leading to biased estimates and reduced reliability. Many imputation methods, operating under the assumption that similar instances share similar feature values, overlook the pivotal role of the feature associated with the missing value. Consequently, they apply uniform strategies to all missing values within an instance, often resulting in suboptimal neighbor sets and less accurate predictions. In this paper, we adopt a structural causal perspective to examine data imputation, revealing that once the target feature guides neighbor selection, it acts as a confounder and biases subsequent missing-value estimations. Building on this insight, we propose Structural Causal Imputation (SCImputation), a strategy that leverages both instance-level and feature-level information to refine neighbor selection, and applies a back-door adjustment formula that reweights local estimates with the global distribution, thereby mitigating the confounding introduced by the target feature. We integrate SCImputation with KNNimpute and LLSimpute, and evaluate the resulting variants on five datasets (NACC, three NCBI microarrays, and the Turkiye Student Evaluation) with ablation studies. In comparative evaluations against 12 baselines, SCImputation achieves 3.0%–4.6% gains in accuracy and 0.009–0.059 reductions in RMSE over the established approaches, and demonstrates competitive performance against leading deep learning baselines across diverse missingness mechanisms. These results suggest that SCImputation provides a causally grounded strategy for data imputation in both biomedical and general applications."

    "abstract": "Remote sensing image change captioning (RSICC) aims to generate natural-language descriptions of changes between bi-temporal satellite images. Existing studies, however, predominantly operate on RGB imagery and only partially exploit the richer cues available in multispectral data. Motivated by this gap, we focus on multispectral RSICC on the Sentinel-2-based MOSAIC-SEN2-CC dataset and investigate how explicit category guidance can be used to obtain more accurate and scene-consistent change descriptions. We propose a Category-Guided Change Captioning (CGCC) framework with a shared ResNet-101 backbone and a Transformer-based caption decoder. Within this framework, a lightweight category-guided encoder uses an auxiliary head to predict the scene category from fused multispectral features and maps this prediction to a learnable category embedding. An epoch-dependent interpolation between ground-truth and prediction-based embeddings is used to condition cross-temporal fusion on the scene type. Experiments on MOSAIC-SEN2-CC show that the proposed method consistently improves BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE-L, CIDEr-D, SPICE and the composite score $S_m^{\\ast}$ over strong ResNet-101-based baselines, particularly on changed scenes, while achieving high category classification accuracy across all semantic classes."

These challenges include excessive inter-group spacing, difficulties in arranging tower attachment points, uneven structural stress distribution, and installation deformation of hardware. A vertically layered arrangement for tension strings is proposed. By determining the mechanical strength, number of groups, arrangement type, number of attachment points, and optimal inter-group spacing of the tension string, the design requirements concerning electrical performance, mechanical offset, and ice-shedding jump for multi-group tension strings are systematically analyzed. The results indicate that adopting a vertically layered arrangement effectively mitigates the issues of excessive intergroup spacing and uneven force distribution inherent in horizontal arrangements. This configuration enhances the safety, stability, and economic efficiency of tension strings in severe ice regions and provides technical support for the subsequent engineering design of UHV transmission lines in extreme icing environments."

As soil in the fragmented Huang-Huai-Hai Plain is frquently covered by vegetation or crop residues, it is essential to develop a effective technique for accurate extraction of soil spectral information. In this study, we integrated two-dimensional bare-soil separation (TDBSS) based on computer pattern recognition with an ensemble machine learning algorithm (Random Forest) to develop an enhanced TDBSS-RF classifier for bare soil pixel extraction. The TDBSS algorithm was optimized by integrating multiple spectral index combinations (NDI5-DFI, NDI7-DFI, NBR2-NDI5, NBR2-NDI7, NBR2-NDVI, and NDVI-STI), achieving a bare soil extraction rate of 64%. Additionally, the RF classifier was refined through feature selection and classification optimization, the extraction rate was further improved from 72% to 76%. Validation using sample points in Google Earth Engine (GEE) and comparison with a multi-band soil map showed that 67% of the samples achieved an R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> greater than 0.8.

DL architectures, particularly convolutional long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM), further surpass traditional ML models by learning hierarchical features and temporal dependencies in the network traffic. To address the scarcity of real-world APT datasets, we constructed an APT-aware dataset from UNSW-NB15 and evaluated it across multiple learning paradigms. The results highlight improved adaptability to evolving APT tactics and bridge the gap between generic intrusion detection and specialized APT detection through life-cycle-aware modeling."

In the proposed framework, following sub-clustering of the distributed PV cluster, a deep learning model featuring an encoder-decoder architecture integrated with graph attention (GAT) and temporal pattern attention (TPA) mechanisms is applied to capture multi-site, multi-variable, and multi-time-step information, thereby improving forecasting accuracy. The method is validated using actual operational power output data from distributed PV clusters in East China.

    "abstract": "This paper presents the first multilingual cross-outbreak comparison of TikTok discourse, focusing on the early reactions of TikTok users related to two ongoing outbreaks: measles and chikungunya. The first few cases of the ongoing measles outbreak were recorded in 2024, and the first few cases of the ongoing chikungunya outbreak were recorded in 2025. To capture the early reactions, TikTok videos about measles posted between January and May 2024 and about chikungunya posted between January and May 2025 were collected, and their descriptions were analyzed. A multilingual analytical framework was developed, incorporating advanced data preprocessing, outlier detection and removal, language detection, zero-shot natural language inference for fear and anxiety detection, deep learning models for toxicity and identity-attack detection, and correlation analysis. The findings showed that descriptions of TikTok videos about both outbreaks were consistently associated with a high level of fear and anxiety, and there were no significant differences in the trends of fear or anxiety across both outbreaks. The toxicity analysis revealed a difference between the two outbreaks. The average toxicity score per month in descriptions of TikTok videos about measles was consistently higher than that of descriptions of TikTok videos about the chikungunya outbreak. In addition to analyzing the average toxicity per outbreak per month, this was confirmed by performing the Mann–Whitney U test, which resulted in Cliff’s δ ≈ 0.36, favoring measles. Furthermore, the top-decile analysis showed that measles video descriptions were almost twice as likely as Chikungunya video descriptions to occur in the upper 10% of video-description toxicity scores (10.3% vs. 5.5%). Across both outbreaks, instances of identity attack in video descriptions were rare, and when they occurred, they were more common in descriptions of videos related to chikungunya. This finding was also supported by the Mann– Whitney U test (p ≈ 0.01) and the top decile analysis, which showed that descriptions of videos about Chikungunya were more likely to fall in the highest 10% of identity-attack scores than those about Measles. Finally, the results of the correlation analysis showed statistically significant correlations across toxicity and identity attacks for both outbreaks."

    "abstract": "The YOLO series of algorithms, leveraging a single-stage, end-to-end detection paradigm, achieves an effective balance between speed and accuracy, and has been widely deployed in applications such as autonomous driving, security surveillance, and remote sensing identification. However, in drone-based wildlife detection scenarios where targets are small-scale and densely distributed, challenges such as insufficient feature extraction capability, low target response, and inadequate representation of small objects remain, leading to elevated rates of missed and false detections. To address these limitations, this paper introduces EGSOD-YOLOv8, a lightweight improved algorithm. The proposed approach integrates re-parameterization techniques to simplify the GFPN structure and strengthens multi-layer feature fusion through cross-layer skip connections and cross-scale feature interaction. In addition, a multi-scale EMA attention mechanism is embedded into the C2f module, enabling adaptive modeling of feature importance and enhancing the representation of contour features for small objects. Furthermore, during the bounding box regression stage, the Shape-Nwd loss is employed to replace CIoU, which utilizes Wasserstein distance to measure the similarity between predicted and ground-truth boxes, thereby improving detection accuracy and stability. Experimental results show that the proposed method attains a mean average precision (mAP) of 98.6% and improves inference speed by approximately 17% over the baseline model. It significantly alleviates missed and false detections and effectively achieves an optimal balance between lightweight design and high accuracy in wildlife small object detection."

    "abstract": "The presented paper proposes a predictive bandwidth distribution model of 5G network slices that explicitly characterizes the long-range dependence (LRD) as it may be followed among the slice traffic. It starts with the characterization of the patterns of demand by Hurst exponent in an attempt to quantify long-memory demand. Based on these perceptions, the fractionalorder FARIMA and fGn model are used to produce correct multistep predictions of the traffic. These predictions are then fed into a constrained optimization assigner which proactively allocates bandwidth among slices with two goals; reducing SLA violations and enhancing overall utilization efficiency. It determines the evaluation by the synthetic LRD traces and the operator-like multi-slice workloads. It was found that the suggested approach is much better than ARIMA, EWMA and no movement strategies and would provide a better forecasting precision, lower SLA risk and bandwidth allocations more constant in dynamically changing conditions. The results emphasise the significance of LRD-conscious models in the efficient management of resources in the 5G and beyond networks in the future."

    "abstract": "Over the years, managing patient consent for sharing health data has remained a significant challenge due to a lack of transparency about how the data is shared with other systems and the absence of a verifiable audit trail. This paper introduces a new hybrid design that uses an industry-standard Open Authorization (OAuth) 2.0 authorization framework for detailed access grants, complemented by a decentralized, on-chain consent ledger built on the ERC-6551 blockchain standard, enabling digital assets (using Non Fungible Tokens) to act as independent accounts. The primary concept behind this paper is the utilization of the ERC-6551 Token Bound Account (TBA) as a patient-controlled on-chain portfolio of consent grant tokens, which are represented as semi-fungible tokens. We have solved the problem of converting the static, database-bound permissions into a dynamic, patient-owned digital system supported by timely-expiring JWT tokens. With the utilization of the OAuth 2.0 flow, short-lived JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) act as pointers to the durable, immutable consent records on the Blockchain. With our dual-validation approach, resource servers can verify both the off-chain time-based short-lived tokens and the granted access, along with on-chain consent status, to determine whether the patient has revoked the token. This provides a robust, auditable, and patient-sovereign system for managing healthcare data access. Finally, we present the complete design and architecture, along with data flows and cryptographic operations, which we used to analyze the security and performance characteristics and evaluate the outcomes of this implementation."

Building upon the standard PSO approach, cubic spline optimization transforms the path in simulation results from a polygonal line into a smooth curve, thereby achieving a smaller optimal distance value. Simultaneously, when interpolation points along the path collide with obstacles in the map, a substantial penalty is added to the optimal distance value, thereby achieving obstacle avoidance. Regarding the core formula of the PSO algorithm itself, the particle swarm algorithm is enhanced through dynamically adjusting the inertial weight. Four distinct strategies are employed to modify the inertial weight, yielding corresponding simulation results. Finally, simulation experiments were conducted using standard PSO and the four improved PSO algorithms for path planning. Based on the corresponding data, an evaluation system for the algorithms was established to determine the optimal path planning algorithm."

However, existing approaches still face challenges in efficiently generating and maintaining arbitrary geometric patterns in real time. Most current methods are limited to predefined formation types and lack the capability to track dynamically changing formations. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel formation control maneuver that achieves arbitrary pattern generation and real-time tracking by minimizing the image-domain error between the current and target formations. Through the mapping of robot positions into a complex-plane image representation, the proposed method enables each robot to adjust its position cooperatively to minimize global formation error. To further ensure real-time performance and convergence efficiency, a zeroing neural network (ZNN) model is incorporated into the control framework. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed control maneuver can generate arbitrary complex target formations from random initial position. The robots collectively converge toward the desired pattern \"IRAC2025\" from random initial postion. The results validate the effectiveness, real-time capability, the proposed formation control approach for complex and dynamic multi-robot systems."

    "abstract": "Dipolar ultra-low-field (ULF) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems, with compact size and open geometry, offer promise for portable MRI. However, the limited spatial distribution of the magnet constrains optimization toward high field homogeneity, thereby restricting imaging quality. This work presents a geometric optimization framework for dipolar magnets using a novel third-order Bézier radial parameterization (TBRP), which extends conventional single-radius designs to a multi-degree-of-freedom configuration, enhancing geometric flexibility. Optimizations of samarium–cobalt (SmCo) and neodymium–iron–boron (NdFeB) magnets are performed via a coupled Genetic Algorithm–Finite Element approach. A dual-material (DM) composite magnet is proposed to combine the advantages of both materials for improved field uniformity. Simulations show that, with the average main magnetic field maintained within the target range, the optimized SmCo- and NdFeB-based magnets achieve inhomogeneities of 1292 ppm and 3164 ppm, corresponding to improvements of approximately 20–30% over conventional disk designs, while the proposed DM magnet further reduces the inhomogeneity to 556 ppm, representing an improvement of nearly 60%. The analyses of magnetic thermal stability and engineering tolerances indicate that, although all magnet systems exhibit certain sensitivities to temperature variations and assembly deviations, the DM configuration demonstrates relatively better stability in maintaining field homogeneity. This study provides a scalable and cost-effective approach for the design of ULF MRI magnet systems."

The half hypercube Network has an excellent topology that can provide high network fault tolerance and communication efficiency while maintaining a low node degree. In this paper, we investigate efficient and reliable communication algorithms for half hypercube networks in distributed system. Firstly, we design a disjoint path construction algorithm for a half hypercube, which enables reliable communication of the optimal number of disjoint paths between any two nodes in the network. Secondly, we present a fault-tolerant path embedding algorithm for a half hypercube. When the number of faulty nodes does not exceed ⌈<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</i>/2⌉, this algorithm can obtain a fault-tolerant unicast path between any two non-faulty nodes in an <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</i>-dimensional half hypercube network. Finally, we evaluate the performance of communication algorithms through simulation experiments and real testbed. Experimental results demonstrate that the efficiency and buffer utilization rate of the proposed algorithms can be improved by at least 21.8% and 15.6%, respectively.

    "abstract": "We sought to develop a theoretical framework for understanding how different cortical areas are recruited in an orderly pattern following strokes of varying severity. In line with the theory of optimal control in arm movements, we propose that the brain maximizes motor performance despite anatomical constraints imposed by a lesion. This optimization is achieved through a reinforcement learning process in cortical neurons, which maximizes performance as a function of motor error and effort, and a homeostatic regulation process in spinal motor neurons, which facilitates information transfer. We simulated an isometric arm task with a 7-muscle planar arm controlled by a cortical network comprising three regions —primary motor (M1), premotor (PM), and contralesional motor cortex (CM1) —and spinal motor neurons (MNs). We simulated three lesion sizes: small (50% M1 lesion), medium (100% M1 lesion), and large (100% M1 and PM lesion). The model demonstrated systematic recruitment of the remaining regions, mirroring experimental observations. Key findings include the role of PM in the recovery of fine motor control; for large lesions, the role of CM1 in preventing paralysis and generating unusual synergies; and the role of homeoplasticity in motor neurons to enable force generation. Compensatory activity in PM and CM1 was more prominent in early than late recovery as the network minimized effort. These simulations indicate that the recruitment of compensatory areas following strokes of increasing size results from local plastic processes that maximize performance. Furthermore, our model makes testable predictions, including a plausible crucial role for dopamine in motor cortical reorganization post-stroke."

A multi-segment transformer facilitates a lower provided input impedance than a conventional transformer, enabling the PA to achieve a higher output power. The vertical multi-segment transformer also offers lower insertion loss than the conventional transformer owing to its high coupling factor. In addition, this work demonstrates that utilizing the compact parallel T-line with vertical multi-segment transformers, a low-loss characteristic can be achieved by providing an appropriately low input impedance for high output power. To achieve high efficiency in low-power region, the PA operates in dual-mode by applying discrete power control. The PA achieves 24.87-dBm saturated output power with 40.27% peak power-added efficiency (PAE) at 27 GHz. Furthermore, it achieves average output powers of 17.6 and 13.8 dBm with average PAEs of 14.02 and 12.31% in the high- and low-power modes, respectively, using 800 Msym/s of 5G OFDM using 64-QAM with –25 dB error vector magnitude."

This paper presents a joint design method for frequency diverse array (FDA) waveform and receive filter to enable simultaneous target detection and non-cooperative radar (NCR) electronic countermeasure (ECM). The considered scenario involves multiple airborne targets, noncooperative platforms, and signal-dependent interference sources distributed across different angular sectors. To ensure ECM compatibility, the FDA waveform is constrained to resemble the prescribed countermeasure waveforms, while waveform-and-angledependent receive filters are designed to enhance target detection and suppress interferences. The joint optimization problem is formulated to maximize the output signal-to-interference-plusnoise ratio (SINR) while minimizing the similarity between the FDA waveform and the predefined countermeasure waveforms, subject to practical constraints including transmit energy (TE) and constant modulus (CM). This non-convex problem is decomposed into tractable subproblems and solved iteratively using an alternating minimization (AM) framework. The convergence of the proposed algorithm is established through rigorous theoretical analysis. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

The core challenge lies in the joint optimization of UAV trajectory, beamforming vectors, and RIS phase shifts to maximize the average secrecy rate, which is a highly non-convex problem involving coupled continuous and discrete variables. To address this, we propose a Multi-Head Distributional Soft Actor-Critic (DSAC) framework that formulates the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and integrates continuous flight control variables including UAV position and beamforming and discrete communication variables which are RIS phase shifts into a unified reinforcement learning model. The proposed framework employs a multi-head actor network to handle mixed actions and distributional critic networks to enhance value estimation robustness. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed Multi-Head DSAC outperforms existing reinforcement learning algorithms in terms of average secrecy rate and convergence stability, validating its effectiveness in dynamic and hostile wireless environments."

    "abstract": "Achieving stable and energy-efficient locomotion is essential for humanoid robots to operate continuously in real-world applications. Existing model predictive control (MPC) and reinforcement learning (RL) approaches often rely on energy-related metrics embedded within a multi-objective optimization framework, which require extensive hyperparameter tuning and often result in suboptimal policies. To address these challenges, we propose ECO (Energy-Constrained Optimization), a constrained RL framework that separates energy-related metrics from rewards, reformulating them as explicit inequality constraints. This method provides a clear and interpretable physical representation of energy costs, enabling more efficient and intuitive hyperparameter tuning for improved energy efficiency. ECO introduces dedicated constraints for energy consumption and reference motion, enforced by the Lagrangian method, to achieve stable, symmetric, and energy-efficient walking for humanoid robots. We evaluated ECO against MPC, standard RL with reward shaping, and four state-of-the-art constrained RL methods. Experiments, including sim-to-sim and sim-to-real transfers on the kid-sized humanoid robot BRUCE, demonstrate that ECO significantly reduces energy consumption compared to baselines while maintaining robust walking performance. These results highlight a substantial advancement in energy-efficient humanoid locomotion.

    "abstract": "In real-world recommender systems, exposure bias, data sparsity, and latent confounding factors can substantially distort the authenticity of user–item interactions, leading to predictions that deviate from users’ true preferences. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a unified debiased recommendation framework, DiffCL, which integrates Matrix Factorization (MF), Identifiable Variational Autoencoders (iVAE), Diffusion Models, and Contrastive Learning. Specifically, MF is first employed to capture explicit collaborative signals, while iVAE is introduced to construct identifiable prior representations that encode users’ causal preferences. Subsequently, a diffusion-based denoising process is applied to the latent variables for fine-grained augmentation, enabling the model to obtain robust and high-quality hidden representations through multi-step generation and inversion. In addition, contrastive learning is incorporated as a regularization mechanism to enforce semantic consistency between user and item embeddings, further enhancing the discriminability and structural organization of the latent space. Extensive experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, particularly under highly biased and sparse settings, exhibiting stronger generalization capability and training stability. This study provides new insights into the integration of causal representation learning and diffusion-based generative modeling in recommender systems, and lays a solid foundation for building more reliable, fair, and robust recommendation models."

    "abstract": "The intelligent fusion of heterogeneous source data for presentation or subsequent processing, is a popular research topic in computer vision society. While in most of current researches, the intrinsic resolution distinction among diverse input sources is commonly ignored. But in fact, identical-resolution is a relatively harsh prerequisite for various hetero data collecting hardwares and rarely happens in real-world applications. At the same time, as a typical knowledge-underdetermined research topic, super-resolution (SR) is deeply trapped by the shortage of available source information. In order to simultaneously cope with both mentioned dilemmas, in this paper, we proposed F&S-Net, a novel generic dual mission integration and co-prosperity framework. It is a unified architecture that compactly and organically integrates both distinct input resolution hetero fusion and heterogeneous assisting super-resolution mission together. Besides the evident efficiency benefits gained through two-in-one architecture merging, this integration is mutually boosting and could achieve performance win-win: First, embedding SR mechanism could effectively alleviate resolution distinction challenge faced by generic hetero image fusion; Second, the enrolling of paired input sources could directly double the amount of available information for the source-thirsty SR mission; Third, the shared components could be co-trained by both missions' data to achieve further robustness promotion. As to the structural innovation, facing doubled data and mission complexity, we devised throughout dimension extension system and two-stage based organic integration architecture. Stage 1 is in charge of mission shared primal information analysis. While Stage 2 focuses on mission-specialized further knowledge understanding and merging. This structural layout could efficiently realize general mutual knowledge co-enhancement and individual-level exclusive concentration to each specific mission. Extensive experiments have been conducted on publicly available MSRS, M3FD, and Set5 dataset to verify the effectiveness. Source code will be available soon."

An optimized control method is designed to balance control effectiveness and energy consumption. With the use of command filters and auxiliary functions, the proposed optimized asymptotic tracking control method can ensure that the tracking errors and velocity errors asymptotically converge to zero.

    "abstract": "Rotation invariance is essential for precise object level segmentation in UAV aerial imagery, where targets can have arbitrary orientations and exhibit fine scale details. Conventional segmentation architectures like UNet rely on convolution operators that are not rotation-invariant, leading to degraded segmentation accuracy across varying viewpoints. Rotation invariance can be achieved by expanding the filter bank across multiple orientations; however, this significantly increases computational cost and memory requirement. In this paper, we introduce a GPU-optimized rotation-invariant convolution framework that eliminates the traditional data lowering (im2col) step required for matrix multiplication based convolution. By exploiting structured data sharing among symmetrically rotated filters, our method achieves multi-orientation convolution with greatly reduced memory requirements and computational redundancy. We further generalize the approach to accelerate convolution with arbitrary (non-symmetric) rotation angles. Integrated into a UNet segmentation model, the framework yields up to a 5.7% improvement in accuracy over the non-rotation-aware baseline. Across extensive benchmarks, the proposed convolution achieves 20–57% faster training and 15–45% lower energy consumption than cuDNN, while maintaining accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art rotation-invariant methods. Because the scatter-based operator greatly reduces intermediate feature dimensionality, the efficiency of our design also enables practical sixteen-orientation convolution and pooling, yielding further accuracy gains that are infeasible for conventional rotation-invariant implementations. Our sixteen-orientation approach achieves competitive accuracy on multiple datasets compared with state-of-the-art UAV segmentation networks. These results demonstrate that the proposed method provides an effective and efficient alternative to existing rotation-invariant convolution frameworks."

    "abstract": "A hybrid finite-element spectral-element domain decomposition method (FESE DDM) is proposed for time-domain acoustic cross-well sensing simulations involving elastic waves in boreholes with complex geometries. This method strategically combines the mesh flexibility of finite element (FE) discretization with the computational efficiency of spectral element (SE) discretization to solve the elastic wave equations. Intricate borehole structures, such as grooved drill collars, are discretized using tetrahedral (TET) meshes with second-order FE basis functions, while larger formations outside the boreholes are discretized using hexahedral (HEX) meshes with high-order SE basis functions. To ensure weak continuity of the solution across nonconformal interfaces between FE and SE subdomains, a generalized isotropic Riemann flux is employed, supported by a dual-domain projection algorithm that enables accurate Gauss quadrature at the interface. The implicit-explicit Newmark-β (IMEX-N) temporal discretization scheme is introduced to solve the large-scale FESE DDM system, where the explicit subsystem efficiently handles the SE subdomains, and the implicit subsystem manages the FE subdomains as well as the interfaces between different subdomains. Comprehensive numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed method achieves both high accuracy and computational efficiency."

    "abstract": "Distributed multi-energy flexible resources (DMEFR) can exploit the complementarity of electricity, gas, and heat to enhance power flexibility, demonstrating significant potential to promote renewable energy consumption and improve operational economics. An accurate model describing the aggregate feasible region (AFR) of DMEFR is essential for power systems to leverage this flexibility effectively. However, the time-coupling characteristic of DMEFR results in a prohibitive computational burden when computing the exact AFR. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel decomposition-based aggregate modeling method for DMEFR that features high computational efficiency and clear physical interpretation. First, we prove that the AFR of DMEFR is equivalent to the Minkowski sum of two decoupled components: a time-decoupled component capturing power boundaries via linear programming, and a time-coupled component (TCC) characterizing storage dynamics. Second, for the TCC, we develop an adjustable homothetic polytope (AHP)-based method that jointly optimizes the basic homothetic polytope, scaling factors, and translating factors, reducing the conservatism of fixed homothetic polytope-based methods. Third, we formulate the AHP optimization as a bilinear problem and propose a block coordinate descent algorithm with a convergence guarantee for it. Case studies validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "The integration of a high proportion of renewable energy sources (RES) poses severe challenges to the flexibility and frequency stability of power systems. More battery storage systems (BES) are essential for supporting RES integration, with the fast frequency response (FFR) of grid-forming BES being particularly crucial for frequency stability. However, incorporating frequency dynamics into planning models is challenging due to the complexity and difficulty in model tractability. To address these issues, a two-level “Planning-Validation-Adjustment” framework is proposed for grid-forming BES planning. The system frequency response model is integrated into the conventional planning model, and a frequency-dynamics feasibility-driven Benders-cut mechanism is developed to iteratively adjust BES planning decisions based on frequency response feedback. Specifically, the upper-level planning model optimizes the allocation and sizing of grid-forming BES under RES uncertainty scenarios. In the lower level, the FFR of grid-forming BES is incorporated into robust dynamic frequency constraints to ensure safety margins under uncertain power disturbances. When frequency violations are identified in the lower-level model, corresponding Benders-cuts are generated and fed back to the upper level to update planning decisions. To efficiently solve the proposed model, a Benders-Cut-based iterative solution algorithm embedded with progressive hedging algorithm (PHA) is developed. Simulation studies on the modified IEEE 39-bus system confirm the effectiveness of the proposed planning framework and solution approach."

Simulation results show that the proposed method achieves ultra-high reliability while maintaining high spectral efficiency under abrupt channel changes."

    "abstract": "Human mesh recovery (HMR) from the monocular RGB images has attracted a lot of attention from computer vision. Affected by the occlusion between joints and the fact that a 2D pose may match with multiple 3D poses, HMR remains a difficult task. Some mainstream neural network methods realize information exchange in the process of recovering key points extracted from images into meshes, enhance the perception of the vertices and improve the structural rationality of the estimation results. However, the information exchange of vertices without reasonable guidance of global semantic information lacks attention to the global rationality of the estimation results. In order to solve this problem, we propose Text-KeyPoint human representation, which augments key points with semi-structured textual information generated from manual rules to describe the human body at different levels, thus introducing global semantic information. Based on Text-KeyPoint human representation, we propose a novel semantic guided model, which fuses multi-level text features extracted from semi-structured text and multi-level geometric features pooled from key points to provide multi-level semantic guidance in the process of human recovery, thus improving the global rationality of results. Comprehensive experimental results on widely used HMR benchmarks H3.6M, 3DPW and SURREAL show that the proposed method achieves competitive performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods."

Additionally, we incorporate wavelet transform to amplify high-frequency details and we also design a Hybrid Shuffle Attention module to adaptively aggregate sequence and frequency features. Experiments conducted on the OSI-450a1 and AMSR2 datasets demonstrate that FH-Mamba achieves improved accuracy and generalization compared with state-of-the-art baselines. The results confirm the effectiveness of Hilbert scanning and frequency-aware attention in improving both temporal consistency and edge reconstruction for Arctic SIC forecasting.

These workflow-based applications comprise interdependent tasks that must be executed under stringent deadline, reliability, capability, memory, storage, and energy constraints. Given their critical nature, exact optimization is necessary to obtain optimal schedules that ensure dependable operation. Existing scheduling approaches, both exact and heuristic, fail to jointly address all these objectives and constraints. To this end, we propose an exact multi-objective and multi-constrained workflow scheduling approach for edge-hub-cloud cyber-physical systems, based on continuous-time mixed integer linear programming. The proposed formulation jointly optimizes latency, energy, and reliability, while holistically addressing timing and resource constraints. To enhance reliability while avoiding the overhead of unnecessary task replicas, it selectively employs task duplication. We evaluate our approach against a widely used heuristic, which we extend to ensure a fair and meaningful comparison, using a real-world IoT workflow and synthetic task graphs of varying sizes, across different system configurations and objective trade-offs. The proposed method consistently outperforms the heuristic, achieving up to 29.83%, 33.96%, and 28.49% average improvements in latency, energy, and reliability, respectively, while attaining practical runtimes. Overall, the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach under various system configurations and objective trade-offs, and show its practical scalability to task graphs of sizes relevant to the targeted applications and system architecture."

    "abstract": "The storage density of NAND flash memory has significantly increased due to multi-leveling and downscaling technologies. As a side effect of enhanced storage capacity, flash memory becomes vulnerable to circuit-level noise. To enhance data reliability, NAND flash memory employs error correction codes such as low-density parity-check (LDPC) code with soft-decision (SD) decoding based on log-likelihood ratio (LLR) information. Conventional SD read uses pre-defined uniform quantization, which is not optimized for varying threshold voltage distributions caused by physical noise, degradation, and process variation (PV). We propose an intelligent read framework employing a non-uniform quantizer that adjusts read reference voltages (RRVs) and LLR values according to the memory channel state. The optimization of RRVs and LLRs requires the information of threshold voltage distributions. To accurately estimate the threshold voltage distribution from limited channel information, we propose a machine learning-based estimation model. Moreover, we incorporate model-agnostic meta-learning, enabling precise estimation of threshold voltage distribution across different flash chips addressing PV. Numerical results demonstrate significant improvements in read performance, validating the effectiveness of the proposed framework."

    "abstract": "Currently, grid-forming technology is widely adopted for power conversion systems (PCS) in energy storage applications, enabling them to exhibit voltage source characteristics. This capability significantly enhances voltage and inertia support for renewable energy-integrated power systems. Virtual synchronous generator (VSG) control stands as the most prevalent method among grid-forming techniques. However, unlike synchronous generators, grid-forming PCS demonstrates lower tolerance to fault currents during grid-side voltage sags, making it susceptible to overcurrent-induced grid disconnection. Therefore, integrating current-limiting protection into grid-forming control becomes essential. To address the aforementioned issues, this paper proposes a grid-forming energy storage low-voltage ride-through strategy based on adaptive virtual impedance. This strategy enables dynamic adjustment of the virtual impedance value according to the severity of the voltage sag. By continuously monitoring the grid-side voltage sag level, a function with saturation characteristics is constructed and applied to the generated virtual internal electromotive force to modify its output, thereby indirectly adjusting the virtual impedance value. This approach achieves the implementation of an adaptive virtual impedance with saturation properties. As a result, the virtual impedance exhibits a low impedance value during mild voltage sags and a high impedance value during severe sags. This method simultaneously fulfills both the current-limiting requirements of the energy storage converter and the need for reactive power support during grid faults."

    "abstract": "Amid accelerating digital transformation, information technology (IT) education plays a pivotal role in cultivating students’ core competencies. This study investigates the impact of text-based adventure games (AVG) on enhancing high school students’ IT literacy and problem-solving ability. Grounded in constructivist and situated learning theories, an AVG-based instructional intervention was implemented in a compulsory IT course with 86 students, using a quasi-experimental design. Data were collected through pre- and post-tests, classroom observations, process records, and interviews. Findings show that AVG significantly improved IT literacy—especially computational thinking and social responsibility—and enhanced problem-solving skills across exploration, strategy formulation, execution, and reflection. Moreover, narrative-driven tasks and feedback mechanisms increased students’ motivation, engagement, and metacognitive regulation, promoting a shift from passive learning to active inquiry. Theoretically, the study validates the applicability of constructivist and situated learning in game-based environments. Practically, it highlights the value of integrating AVG to contextualize abstract IT concepts, diversify learning pathways, and support pedagogical innovation. Limitations include sample size, intervention duration, and game design, suggesting future research expand samples, conduct longitudinal studies, and refine adaptive mechanisms."

Evaluated on the NTU RGB+D 60 dataset, our model achieves competitive accuracy (79.45%) with a compact size (0.565M parameters).

    "abstract": "Public speaking can be quite stressful for many individuals, especially in a second language classroom where students are required to deliver speeches in a second foreign language. This often leads to heightened public speaking anxiety. This study aims to reduce public speaking anxiety among second language learners using a blended teaching model, assigning AI-assisted learning tasks via an AI-enhanced learning management system. In the experimental group, students completed the AI-assisted learning tasks on the learning management system before their classroom speaking performance. The classroom speech is evaluated by the teacher and peers. Conversely, no AI-assisted learning tasks in the control group were directly evaluated by the teacher and peers on their classroom speaking performance after two weeks. The results from the Public Speaking Anxiety Scale pre-test and post-test showed that, following two weeks of AI-assisted learning, the public speaking anxiety level of the second language students in the experimental group was lower than that of the control group. In addition, in a semi-structured interview with five randomly selected students, the students indicated that these tasks were effective in reducing their anxiety and felt useful. The results of this study contribute to the practice of AI-integrated learning management systems in actual teaching settings."

    "abstract": "As neurons are the basic structural and computational units of the nervous system, solving the problem of neuronal morphological classification is of great significance for in-depth understanding of neuronal characteristics and information transmission processes. In the interdisciplinary research field of neuroscience and computational biology, the current systematic research on neuronal morphological classification remains in a relatively scarce state. In this paper, we propose a neuronal morphological classification method based on Spiking Point Cloud Transformer, named SPCT. We use adaptive density sampling, which can accurately retain the subtle geometric features in the data and reduce redundant sampling points. Then, through our core module, the Transformer module, the local and global feature interaction of the point cloud is realized through its self-attention mechanism. Among them, the down-sampling module expands the receptive field and preserves the global geometric structure of the point cloud. In the experimental part, we verify the effectiveness of our method on two point cloud datasets, Celegans and zebrafish, analyze the impact of the number of sampling points and batch size on the classification accuracy, compare it with other deep learning methods, and conduct generalization experiments on imbalanced datasets. The experimental results show that our method can effectively conduct neuronal morphological classification, achieving accuracies of 84.42% and 86.51% on the two datasets."

    "abstract": "The central goal of education—to nurture each student as a unique individual—has entered a new, multifaceted paradigm with the rise of artificial intelligence. However, existing AI-based solutions in education present a stark contrast. While classical AI systems (intelligent tutoring systems) provide pedagogically sound instruction, they are typically inflexible and unable to solve open-ended, generative problems. Modern solutions based on large-scale language models (LLM), in contrast, offer unmatched opportunities for student interaction while maintaining a high degree of flexibility. However, they often lack a clear pedagogical foundation. Furthermore, they are frequently prone to factual errors and pose serious ethical challenges, as well as a threat to academic integrity in general. This article introduces EduGenius—a new multifaceted theoretical framework specifically designed to resolve this conflict. EduGenius harmonizes the strengths of both paradigms to achieve a deeper pedagogical impact. The platform is built on a three-layer architecture: a central knowledge layer that provides prestructured educational materials; a personalized learning module that dynamically adapts curricula through reinforcement learning; and a generative interaction layer that leverages optimized Master of Laws (LLM) programs to create personalized content and dialogues. The platform's most innovative aspect is monitoring, supported by ethical AI and an integrity core. The monitoring layer is carefully designed to actively detect bias, base generative outputs on factual knowledge, and—most importantly—translate cases of academic misconduct into educational opportunities for acquiring metacognitive skills. Our primary contribution is the development of a future-proof, sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) system that is simultaneously pedagogically sound, dynamically constructive, and inherently ethical. EduGenius paves the way for the creation of a true learning assistant that adapts to the learner, not the other way around, providing educators with the tools to develop their skills."

    "abstract": "The advent of Compute Express Link (CXL) enables SSDs to participate in the memory hierarchy as large-capacity, byte-addressable memory devices. These CXL-enabled SSDs (CXL-SSDs) offer a promising new tier between DRAM and traditional storage, combining NAND flash density with memory-like access semantics. However, evaluating the performance of CXLSSDs remains difficult due to the lack of hardware that natively supports the CXL.mem protocol on SSDs. As a result, most prior work relies on hybrid simulators combining CPU models augmented with CXL.mem semantics and SSD simulators that approximate internal flash behaviors. While effective for early-stage exploration, this approach cannot faithfully model firmware-level interactions and low-level storage dynamics critical to CXLSSD performance. In this paper, we present OpenCXD, a real-device-guided hybrid evaluation framework that bridges the gap between simulation and hardware. OpenCXD integrates a cycleaccurate CXL.mem simulator on the host side with a physical OpenSSD platform running real firmware. This enables in-situ firmware execution triggered by simulated memory requests. Through these contributions, OpenCXD reflects device-level phenomena unobservable in simulation-only setups, providing critical insights for future firmware design tailored to CXL-SSDs."

    "abstract": "Topographic roughness is a critical parameter in lunar exploration and scientific research due to its scale-dependent properties. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a powerful tool for characterizing lunar surface physical properties. This study investigates the centimeter-scale roughness characteristics of lunar terrain using S-band Mini-RF SAR data, including seven types of geological structures at the mid-latitude regions and permanently shadowed regions (PSRs) at the lunar poles. First, a novel roughness parameter, single scattering trace (SST), is proposed based on matrix trace statistics to quantify lunar surface and near-surface roughness from radar echoes. The effectiveness of SST is validated using high-resolution Narrow Angle Camera (NAC) Digital Terrain Model (DTM) data. Then, by comparing the radar observations, topographic roughness, topographic slopes, and rock abundance of different geological structures, we find that radar observations can reveal wavelength-scale textural variations of geological structures that are not apparent in larger-scale topographic roughness measurements. Furthermore, the roughness characteristics of PSRs and non-PSRs at the lunar polar regions are analyzed. Results show that PSRs exhibit slightly lower roughness than non-PSRs at the south pole, while the opposite trend is observed at the north pole. The inter-polar roughness differences can be attributed to the distinct roughness characteristics of non-PSRs rather than variations within PSRs. Overall, our results demonstrate that the proposed SST parameter is an effective metric for assessing lunar surface roughness."

    "abstract": "In short-distance high-capacity optical communication scenarios, space-division multiplexing technology based on multimode fiber enables large-capacity transmission at lower costs by efficiently utilizing mode resource, showing significant application potential. However, conventional multimode fibers are plagued by severe mode group (MG) crosstalk and significant differential mode delay (DMD), which severely undermine signal integrity and increase bit-error rates, thus limiting their practical use. This paper proposes a multi-mode-group-equalized fiber (MGEF) characterized by the equalization of crosstalk and DMD. Introducing the mode distribution figure of merit (MD-FOM) as a criterion, the MGEF is designed by integrating neural network and genetic algorithm (NN-GA) and adopting a complex multi-ring core structure for fiber design. MD-FOM guides NN-GA optimization, with larger values indicating better alignment with design requirements, enabling iterative refinement of fiber structure for desired mode separation and equalization performance. The MGEF can support over 100 modes, which are divided into 10 MGs according to effective refractive index (n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">eff</sub>), and the minimum difference of n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">eff</sub> (Δn<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">eff</sub>) between MGs is 1.52×10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-3</sup>. It exhibits excellent performance with inter-group crosstalk lower than -20 dB/km, maximum DMD under 15 ps/m, and the fabrication tolerance for the radius and refractive index difference of each layer in the multi-ring core is ±3%.

While existing approaches address function initialization and edge-cloud offloading, they often overlook the joint optimization of serverless concurrency and physical-layer resources, leading to potential service degradation and increased costs. To tackle this, we propose OPLA, a novel cross-layer framework for joint latency and concurrency optimization, designed to minimize end-to-end latency while optimizing concurrent serverless functions. OPLA models interactions between physical-layer resources (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">e.g</i>., bandwidth, transmission power, offloading ratios) and application-layer concurrency decisions. The formulated problem is a highly non-convex mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP), which we prove to be at least <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">NP</i>-complete in certain cases. To approximate its optimal solution efficiently, we propose an iterative exploration-exploitation procedure (EEP). The exploration phase, which is embarrassingly parallelizable, balances solution quality and efficiency with single parameter tuning. The exploitation phase is just a simple successive convex approximation to OPLA. Moreover, we also develop a presolve-postsolve heuristic with deterministic rounding to ensure feasibility for OPLA. Numerical results demonstrate that EEP consistently achieves solutions within a 6% optimality gap relative to a global solver across a wide range of network scales and workloads, confirming its effectiveness and scalability for real-world serverless edge deployments."

Towards this end, we have first collected field measurement data from an amphitheater located on the Malaysia Campus of the University of Nottingham at 900 MHz, 2.4 and 5.8 GHz. We have conducted the measurement campaign over the course of six months, with repeatability test done for each frequency for at least one cavea level to make sure the results are repeatable. These measurement data are plotted and analyzed before being fed to a ML model for training purposes. In particular, we have explored three options of the ML methods, namely, the Linear Regression method, the Random Forest method, and the Neural Network method; and finally settled on the Neural Network method for is superiority over the other two methods -it performs better when more input data were inserted to train continuously. In addition, we have run ray-tracing simulation to provide an extra layer of comparison to the ML-generated prediction results. Beyond this, we have expanded the ML model to account for a larger geometry of amphitheater. The output of this work is expected to enhance wireless communication reliability in amphitheaters, with potential benefits for event management, public safety, and entertainment industries."

    "abstract": "Stroke covers a number of critical abnormalities in cerebral hemodynamics that require prompt diagnosis and continuous monitoring to improve patient outcomes. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is an imaging technology that enables dynamic cerebral monitoring through electrical conductivity contrast. Traditionally, monitoring with EIT relies on time-difference measurements (hence, tdEIT), requiring prior measurement data from a healthy state, which is typically unavailable in clinical practice. Frequency-difference EIT (fdEIT) offers an alternative approach that eliminates this requirement. However, fdEIT presents greater challenges in image reconstruction because conductivity variations with frequency change occur for all head tissues, making reconstruction model accuracy more critical than in tdEIT. In this study, the effects of model accuracy, conductivity change restrictions, and noise tolerance are investigated for three fdEIT reconstruction methods. Simulations of intra-cerebral hemorrhage reveal that, unlike tdEIT, accurate model geometry and the inclusion of cerebrospinal fluid are necessary, and restricting conductivity change in the skull region is highly recommended. When accurate head geometry is available, the reference-weighted fdEIT method demonstrates markedly superior performance compared with standard fdEIT, and comparable to an ideal tdEIT case. On the other hand, when accurate head geometry is not available, the standard fdEIT method is recommended, though with limited performance. Regardless of the reconstruction method, ensuring a measurement signal-to-noise ratio of at least 50 dB is essential for reliable imaging."

Furthermore, a Semantic-Spatial Feature Refinement Module (SSFRM) is integrated into the skip connections, which leverages deep semantic features to guide the suppression of background noise in shallow feature maps across both channel and spatial dimensions, ensuring the decoder receives structurally accurate road representations. Experimental results on the remote sensing road datasets demonstrate that CRNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both segmentation accuracy and road connectivity.

    "abstract": "Abstractive summarization models have demonstrated impressive progress in producing fluent, concise, and human-like summaries. Nevertheless, they also face long-term difficulties, including factual inconsistencies, hallucinations, and misunderstandings of idiomatic expressions, which commonly lead to distortions of intended meanings and incorrect information. To improve the semantic reliability and factual consistency of generated summaries, this paper proposes a new hybrid framework, known as the Non-Idiomatic Abstractive Summarization Model (NIASM), which combines idiomatic substitution and masked named entity (MNE) modeling. We then train a BERT-based idiom detection system on a specifically designed Idiom and Literal Sentence Dataset and achieve accurate classification of idiomatic and literal expressions. Moreover, we present three domain-specific datasets, namely Non-idiomatic BBC, XSum, and CNN, in which the idiomatic phrases are substituted with literal ones in order to enhance the processing of figurative language. The framework improves named entity recognition and minimizes factual hallucinations in generation by training MNE models on large language models (LLMs) such as T5, BART, Hie-BART, and PEGASUS. This model was tested on three benchmark datasets - BBC News, XSum, and CNN/DailyMail with various metrics: ROUGE, which measures lexical overlap; BERTScore, which measures semantic similarity, comparing generated text and reference texts on deep contextual embeddings and cosine similarity; QA-Eval, FactCC, which measures factual consistency, and human evaluations. The results of the experiment indicate that the proposed NIASM framework consistently outperforms methods based on the baseline. For example, BART scored a QA-Eval of 0.7205 and a BERTScore of 0.8195 on XSum, and PEGASUS scored a FactCC of 0.898075 and a BERTScore-F1 of 0.8737, which represents factual and semantic coherence. Hie-BART outperforms other LLMs on the Readability metric, generating more readable summaries on the XSum, CNN, and BBC datasets. These results support the success of our NIASM strategy, which incorporates idiom substitution and MNE."

    "abstract": "The three-phase three-level (3-L) sparse neutral point clamped (SNPC) inverter features a reduced number of power semiconductor devices, compared to the classical 3-L NPC and T-type inverters, representing a promising alternative for industrial motor drives and electric vehicle traction systems. However, the switching losses of the 2-L inverter stage increase significantly under non-unity power factor condition when applying conventional sequences, resulting in reduced efficiency. To address this issue, a novel space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) method based on zero vector transitions is proposed in this article. The proposed sequence achieves zero voltage switching (ZVS) of the 2-L inverter stage devices. Thus, the switching losses of the 2-L inverter stage can be theoretically eliminated. Furthermore, the dwell-time calculation of the vectors is reconsidered, and an adjusting parameter is introduced, which influences the differential-mode (DM) and common-mode (CM) voltage-time area ripples. Finally, experimental validation on a 1.5-kVA hardware prototype demonstrates that the proposed method achieves higher efficiency over a wide power factor range, with a 0.3% increase at inductive load (PF = 0.7) and a 0.35% increase at capacitive load (PF = 0.65) compared with the conventional low-switching loss modulation method. Meanwhile, the proposed method generates lower CM voltage-time area ripple over a wide modulation index range, which is further verified by CM current measurements."

Evaluation on 1,222 drawings with expert reference analyses considers six controlled variants (A1–A6) across two axes: (i) semantic similarity to expert interpretations (cosine similarity, BERTScore, ROUGE-L F1) and (ii) coverage and robustness (content-unit precision/recall/F1, ROUGE-L recall, new-information rate, and negation mismatch). In addition to the CLIP/BLIP ablations (A1–A4), we benchmark two image-only multimodal VLM baselines (GPT-4o and LLaVA; A5–A6) and conduct a small blinded expert rating study on 20 randomly selected drawings to contextualize trade-offs. Results show that retrieval-grounded configurations improve coverage compared to non-retrieval baselines and, in the CLIP-based comparison (A3 vs. A4), reduce polarity (negation) mismatches while maintaining competitive semantic similarity. Although GPT-4o attains the strongest similarity and content-unit scores overall, it incurs substantially higher latency and does not provide retrieval-based evidence trails; LLaVA shows mixed gains with notably lower content recall. The proposed CLIP-based variant achieves a practical balance of faithfulness and efficiency for deployment, and is explicitly positioned as decision support rather than diagnosis, surfacing salient cues and transparent evidence trails for expert oversight. Overall, this work demonstrates that retrieval grounding can make AI-assisted interpretation of children’s drawings more consistent, transparent, and scalable in educational and clinical contexts."

    "abstract": "In car-following scenarios, trailing vehicles tend to fluctuate around the motion of the lead vehicle and gradually converge toward their preferred trajectories. With the large-scale integration of autonomous vehicles (AVs) into traffic streams, differences in desired trajectories among vehicles are amplified. This amplification intensifies fluctuation propagation and complicates platoon-level energy consumption mechanisms. This study addresses these dynamics through the development of a mixed-platoon energy consumption estimation model that accounts for gradually evolving traffic flows (MP-ECEMG), incorporating real-world data from light-duty human-driven vehicles (HVs) and AVs. Results indicate that the model leads to a broader range of energy consumption variation than conventional models due to complex vehicle interactions, while the transitions of energy consumption between vehicles are smoother than those predicted for theoretical AVs. For the three powertrains examined, potential energy savings at a 0.5 AV penetration rate (PR) are 11.4%, 18.1%, and 41.8% for internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs), recovery electric vehicles (EVs), and non-recovery EVs, respectively. In contrast, actual savings based on AV testing data in Apolloscope are 2.9%, 4.7%, and 11.5%. Regional energy performance is comparable between Apolloscope and Waymo, with both slightly outperforming A2D2. This study provides key insights into the effects of real-world AV technology on energy consumption."

    "abstract": "High-performance computing (HPC) applications exert substantial pressure on distributed storage systems, where backend latency, metadata overheads, and small-object amplification often limit I/O throughput. Caching is therefore critical to achieving scalable performance; however, the relative effectiveness of inbuilt distributed caching (IDC) such as Ceph tiering and external FUSE-based caching (EFC) such as Alluxio remains underexplored under realistic scientific workloads. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of three caching architectures—Ceph writeback/readonly tiering (IDC), Alluxio Tier-1 selective caching (EFC), and a Hybrid multi-tier design combining EFC with Ceph SSD caching—using 100 GB of real HACC-IO cosmology traces. Results reveal two dominant asymmetries. First, EFC-only achieves the highest Tier-1 read locality, reaching 59.5% T1 hits and requiring nearly 324 backend HDD block reads, compared to only 459 T1 hits and 341 promotions in the Hybrid setup. Second, for write-intensiveworkloads, Hybrid <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ASYNC_THROUGH</i> + writeback decisively outperforms all other configurations, reducing backend HDD activity by more than an order of magnitude. In read workloads, Hybrid narrows the performance gap with EFC by serving 332 read misses from SSD rather than HDD, lowering HDD fetches from 324 blocks (EFC) to only 9 blocks (Hybrid) with a 35× reduction in backend disk I/O. Overall, the findings demonstrate that while EFC maximizes pure read locality and IDC excels in write absorption, the Hybrid design delivers the most balanced and robust performance across mixed HPC workloads. By combining Alluxio’s selective promotion with Ceph’s SSD writeback tier, Hybrid caching achieves near-EFC read performance and superior write throughput while dramatically reducing HDD load. These insights provide a quantitative foundation for designing effective multi-tier caching strategies in modern distributed HPC storage systems."

    "abstract": "Vehicle re-identification is a crucial task in intelligent transportation systems and urban management, aiming to retrieve images of the same vehicle from different camera viewpoints. Prevailing solutions typically rely on computationally expensive modules or costly annotations, hindering their practical deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose the novel Multi-Stage Feature Fusion Network (MSFFNet), a lightweight and robust feature alignment framework. First, we design the Multi-Stage Fusion Head (MSFH) that generates robust feature representations by fusing multi-stage features based on the inherent hierarchical feature pyramid of CNNs. The resulting fusion features capture both the abstract semantics of high-level features and the fine-grained local details of low-level features. To alleviate the ineffective fusion caused by the varying distance distributions between features at different stages, we introduce the Graph Convolution-based Fusion Block (GCFB) to study the relationships between these features. Second, to mitigate the influence of irrelevant information during fusion, we introduce the Metadata Auxiliary Module (MAM) that injects easily available metadata, such as camera IDs and viewpoints, into fused features. This allows the model to focus on discriminative vehicle information. Our model produces compact feature representations, occupies less storage, and achieves faster retrieval speeds, with a computing time of 1.74 milliseconds per image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three widely used vehicle ReID benchmarks, establishing an optimal balance between speed and accuracy."

    "abstract": "With the extension of rail service life and the impact of surrounding environmental conditions, the running rail in the DC traction power supply system of urban rail transit is prone to insulation degradation, which can lead to ground faults. These types of faults can result in elevated rail potentials and excessive stray currents, which may induce electrochemical corrosion and compromise passenger safety. Consequently, effective diagnosis of grounding faults in urban rail systems is of critical importance. In this paper, an Enhanced Multi-Source Domain Adaptation Framework (EMDAF) is proposed to diagnose grounding faults under varying operating conditions. The proposed EMDAF comprises three key modules: a ResNet-based feature extractor, a domain discrepancy minimization module and a classifier alignment strategy to improve diagnostic performance. It is ultimately employed to achieve accurate ground fault identification across various zones and operating conditions. Experimental comparisons indicate that EMDAF outperforms existing methods in both transfer learning performance and ground fault diagnosis accuracy, confirming its robustness and overall superiority."

On the hardware side, spatial positioning is realized through optical communication technology, and a microcontroller is used to complete signal conversion and transmission; on the software side, a spatial analysis layer is built based on GIS, and the GTWR model is combined to solve the global optimal solution. Experimental sample data from typical regions were selected, and the performance was verified by comparing with traditional systems. The results show that the total value of the ecological benefits of the system meets expectations, the standard deviation of population density distribution is 28%-35% lower than that of traditional systems, and the calculation accuracy and layout rationality are significantly improved. This provides technical support for the spatial optimization of the ecological environment."

The design of the effective waveguides however remains a key issue as at THz propagation losses are high. Photonic crystal fibers (PCFs) and its special capacity to be able to engineer dispersion, birefringence, and confinement has been one of the promising ones in allowing terahertz-based 6G transmission. The given paper is a detailed characterization of a PCFs to THz communication taking into consideration factors such as the effective mode index, dispersion, confinement loss, and polarization factors. Simulations using Finite element method (FEM) have been conducted on hollowcore and solid-core PCFs over the frequency range of 0.1-1 THz. Findings indicate that the hollow-core PCFs with optimal designs attain confinement losses of less than 0.05 dB/m and almost zero dispersion over a large THz spectrum. These results indicate that alternative uses of PCFs as a viable transmission medium of 6G backhaul, short-range interconnects, and radio-over-fiber systems are possible. Other challenges that the study raises in the allocation of Ka-band spectrum, integration into the IoT ecosystems and coupling with reconfigurable intelligent surfaces are the exitsence and management interference."

Based on an empirical analysis of 80 cases in Zhejiang Province, the findings identify knowledge accumulation as a necessary condition for their development. Three distinct configurational pathways are revealed: a knowledge-and strategy-driven pathway, supported by aligned policies and emphasizing coordinated efforts; a knowledge-and environment-driven pathway, influenced by external conditions; and a technology-and organization-driven pathway, guided by policy structures. These pathways exhibit potential substitutive relationships. The study recommends strengthening the development ecosystem for service providers, enhancing demand-side traction from small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and promoting collaborative synergies to establish actionable strategies for the cultivation of industry-oriented digital transformation service providers."

Therefore,we propose HVS-Patroller (HFW-VDN-SUBPO-LSTM) for distribution shaping: The outer layer directly optimizes the long-term access distribution using the Frank–Wolfe method and provides a global direction; the inner layer approximates the linear sub - problem on the decentralized MDP using VDN-LSTM; on the behavior side, SUBPO is used to achieve exploration with low variance and first-visit priority. The experiments show that HVS-Patroller significantly improves the distribution uniformity and coverage advancement speed under various topologies and scales, and unify the global sense of direction in planning and the scalable adaptability in learning within the same framework, effectively compensating for the deficiencies of the existing three types of methods in terms of scale, stability, and dynamic robustness."

However, real-world deployments must bridge laboratory photonic devices and carrier-grade telecom infrastructure that carries high-power classical traffic over wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) fiber and sometimes free-space backhaul. This paper presents a practical architecture for hybrid photonic–telecom QKD that integrates integrated photonic transmitters/receivers, standard G.652 fiber with WDM coexistence, and metro aggregation toward core networks. We model loss, noise, and crosstalk introduced by in-band and out-of-band classical channels, characterize secret-key rate under decoy-state BB84 and measurement device-independent (MDI) variants, and include clock/synchronization constraints typical of carrier networks. A reference implementation with low-jitter timing, narrowband filtering, and probabilistic decoy intensities is analyzed. Simulation results indicate that, with 100GHz WDM spacing and filtering > 55dB, secure operation is feasible beyond 100km fiber or mixed 60km fiber + 1km free-space hops at QBER < 3%, with secret-key rates in the 1×10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup> −1×10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">5</sup> bps range depending on detector efficiency and gate width.

    "abstract": "To enhance the accuracy and efficiency of UAV-based aerial surveying in complex terrain environments, this paper proposes an automated UAV survey scheme that integrates passive bearing-only positioning with multi-beam detection. The proposed scheme addresses limitations inherent in traditional single-beam methods, such as positioning inaccuracy, suboptimal survey planning, and incomplete data acquisition. To mitigate positioning inaccuracies, a passive bearing-only positioning model is constructed, and its core algorithm is derived. For issues related to survey planning and data collection, a multi-beam detection algorithm is established, which determines the optimal survey direction by analyzing multi-beam data. For curved terrain, an innovative K-means clustering segmentation algorithm based on point cloud normal vectors is proposed, enabling precise slope division and efficient survey path planning. Finally, a simulation test platform is developed to validate the models. In a detection mission spanning a total area of 69.216833 million square meters, the missed area constituted merely 2.5% of the total, demonstrating the scheme's exceptional performance in handling complex terrain aerial surveys."

Currently, the widely adopted settlement method based on Locational Marginal Price (LMP) may, under specific conditions, result in a discrepancy between the settlement price and the pricing intentions of market entities, undermining the effectiveness of price signals and the interests of market entities. This paper first systematically analyzes the causes of settlement limitations. Subsequently, combined with economic theories, it explores the welfare losses and market distortions arising when the settlement price on the user side is higher than the quoted price and when that on the generation side is lower than the quoted price. Furthermore, this paper constructs typical calculation examples to verify the adverse impacts of special settlement scenarios on market entities and overall social welfare, and proposes improvement suggestions, including cost compensation for the generation side, factors influencing clearing price limits, and unified zonal settlement for the user side."

    "abstract": "As online learning has gained wide attention in K - 12 education, it is more important to identify students with academic risks as early and accurately as possible through early warning models to help teachers carry out personalized interventions and achieve joint efforts between schools and families to improve students' learning performance. Students' online learning behaviors are continuous and time-dependent. The early warning effect can be improved through the analysis of learning behavior patterns. This paper designs an early warning model AE-Local-AT that combines autoencoders and local attention mechanisms. The model eliminates noise in the data and extracts behavioral pattern features through autoencoders, and then captures the behavioral dependencies between adjacent time steps through the sliding window strategy of the local attention mechanism to focus on key features. The test results on K -12 dataset 1 show that AE-Local-AT achieves higher recall, F1-Score, and AUC than the baseline model and other attention mechanisms, and identifies 3/4 of at-risk students 2 units earlier than other models. While having higher prediction indicators, it can reserve more time for teachers and parents to intervene in teaching. This paper further verifies the above results on K -12 dataset 2."

The search for optimal pairs is then delegated to QAOA, whose superposition and entanglement resources explore the solution space far more compactly than any classical heuristic. An Improved-QAOA (I-QAOA) algorithm is also proposed, which dynamically adjusts user grouping based on channel state information, significantly enhancing spectral efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that I-QAOA achieves higher spectral efficiency compared to traditional channel-based and random pairing methods, even at low transmission power, and maintains superior performance at high power levels, offering a promising approach for optimizing smart grid communication networks."

Additionally, our approach accounts for Spring Festival impacts through appropriate modifications when necessary. We applied this technique to project monthly power consumption in one Jiangsu city spanning April 2020 through December 2022. The outcomes demonstrated an average deviation of merely 2.35%, representing substantial improvement over conventional approaches. These results confirm the superior precision and dependability of our methodology.

In this paper, the entrance equivalence of substation grounding grid is carried out from the perspective of theoretical modeling, which simplifies the stray current distribution model of large power grid, and puts forward the corresponding calculation method. Aiming at the problem of stray currents in 110kV and above voltage level power grids of Shaanxi Power Grid, this paper analyzes the propagation law, invasion path and impact on power grid equipment by establishing a model of stray current distribution, and combining with the actual distribution of 411 new energy sites in Shaanxi. The study shows that the incident stray current of new energy sites in Shaanxi power grid is small (<10A), and the average value of the stray current induced in the neutral point of the main transformer is 0.1454A, which has a small impact on the DC bias of the transformer and the corrosion of the grounding network; through the simplification of the model and the decoupling theory, the threshold value of the safe distance between new energy sites and transformer substations is verified (the stray current is <6A when it is >0.2km). The study provides theoretical and practical basis for the prevention and control of stray current in Shaanxi power grid."

Specifically, the model integrates slip and guess parameters estimated by the DINA model, combined with personalized parameters learned via neural networks, to improve the \"read process\" of learners’ knowledge states. In the \"write process\", the ZPD theory is utilized to jointly consider learners’ current and potential knowledge state when computing knowledge growth vectors. Furthermore, inspired by the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve, the LSTM models are introduced to capture individual forgetting rates across different knowledge, enabling more accurate updates of learners’ knowledge states. Experiments on both synthetic and CL datasets demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms the baseline DKVMN in terms of prediction accuracy and interpretability. The results validate the effectiveness of integrating educational theories into deep knowledge tracing, offering fine-grained insights into learners’ cognitive processes and knowledge evolution."

This paper conducts a systematic review of High-Throughput Event-Driven Architectures (EDAs) as the base design approach for developing flexible and responsive fulfillment systems with low latency. The research investigates core principles, including asynchronous communication, service decoupling, and event-carried state transfer, alongside advanced design patterns such as Event Sourcing, Saga orchestration, and Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS). Real-world case studies from Walmart, eBay, and Shopify demonstrate how EDA can enable sub-second order processing, dynamic inventory synchronization, and rapid elasticity. The review in this paper also evaluates cloud-native event brokers, serverless frameworks, and event meshes for their ability to support global and distributed deployments at scale. Additionally, the paper includes a section specific to implementation challenges faced while implementing EDAs in real-world scenarios and the resolution of those challenges through architectural best practices, which include idempotent consumers, versioned event contracts, and Dead Letter Queues for distributed debugging, schema evolution, and event ordering. The review establishes EDA as a strategic business enabler that delivers speed, fault tolerance, and competitive agility for e-commerce fulfillment operations. Towards the end, the paper identifies three future research areas, including adaptive event routing and observability in federated systems, as well as the integration of AI-driven decision-making within event streams."

By analyzing the dissimilarity of grid maps and the alignment features in overlapping regions, a fusion fitness function is designed. Leveraging the global search capability of the PSO algorithm, the optimal coordinate transformation matrix is solved. To address the shortcoming of traditional PSO algorithms stagnating at local minima, a particle age structure and a mutation mechanism are introduced: when a particle’s personal best position remains unchanged for a sustained period, a random position-velocity mutation is triggered to escape local optima, and the balance between exploration and exploitation capabilities is maintained by dynamically adjusting the number of mutation operations. Optimization experiments using CEC2017 datasets (IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation 2017) functions demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves improvements in both convergence accuracy and convergence speed compared to the standard PSO algorithm. Results from map fusion experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for the multi-robot map fusion problem."

This is achieved by formulating the OPP problem as a robust optimization problem that explicitly accounts for external harmonic distortions and incorporates explicit current and voltage harmonic constraints. The proposed framework can be applied under different levels of disturbance information: (i) full knowledge of harmonic amplitudes and phases, (ii) uncertain but bounded characteristics, and (iii) complete lack of knowledge during the OPP computation. Numerical results and experimental tests demonstrate that the proposed OPPs achieve significantly better compliance with harmonic grid standards compared with advanced modulation strategies such as selective harmonic elimination (SHE) and conventional OPPs."

    "abstract": "Edge computing deploys computing and storage resources at the network edge, thereby providing services closer to terminal users. However, in edge networks, the mobility of terminals, the diversity of requests, and the dynamic nature of wireless channels pose significant challenges for efficiently allocating limited wireless and caching resources among multiple terminal devices. To address the issues of unbalanced network load and high caching costs caused by resource allocation in edge networks, we propose a Distributed Online Joint Optimization Scheme (DOJS). Specifically, we design a joint optimization scheme, referred to as DOJS, which combines centralized user association at the cloud with distributed cache placement at the base stations. This scheme analyzes the impact of terminal device association policies on caching costs and develops a caching cost model that integrates the activity level and content request probability of terminal devices. Based on this model, the relationship between user association selection and caching costs is analyzed, and a Game Theory-based User Association (GTUA) selection algorithm is proposed. In order to adapt to the dynamic characteristics of terminal-user requests in mobile edge networks, we develop a dynamic cache update method LS-TD3, which combines Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient (TD3). Specifically, we integrate the LSTM layer into the policy model framework of reinforcement learning to better predict the content popularity from dynamic time data, thus improving the accuracy of cache decision making. To further reduce computational complexity and enhance overall system performance, we employ a distributed optimization strategy to improve the dynamic caching decision process. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm in achieving inter-node load balancing and minimizing caching costs."

    "abstract": "The accelerating deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) workloads, driven by recent advancements in AI technology, has significantly increased the demand for computing resources and supporting infrastructure. However, the physical and electrical capacity of data centers cannot scale at the same pace, which introduces a new challenge: accommodating rising compute demand under stringent power and space constraints. New high performance GPUs offer better power efficiency compared to previous generations, and liquid cooling systems are significantly more efficient than traditional air cooling. These advancements create an opportunity to upgrade data centers that accommodate more AI workloads with limitations in physical infrastructure and power availability.We propose CAPLAI, Capacity-Aware PLanning for AI infrastructure, an AI-assisted stochastic optimization framework for lifecycle planning in GPU data centers. Our method adopts large language models (llMs) to generate diverse and plausible future scenarios that capture demand growth, hardware efficiency decay, electricity prices, and resale market trends. These scenarios feed into a stochastic optimization model that determines GPU purchase, retirement, and cooling infrastructure upgrades. We evaluate our framework using real-world traces and constraints derived from a large-scale AI data center at Brookhaven National Lab. Compared to conventional threshold-based heuristics, our approach increases the effective GPU computing capacity within the same power limit by up to 36 % and reduces lifecycle operating cost by up to 32 %. Results demonstrate that capacityaware, AI-guided planning significantly enhances efficiency and robustness with the escalating demand and infrastructural limits."

One of the most promising solutions for situations involving obstructed-line-of-sight (OLoS) and multipath propagation is multipathbased simultaneous localization and mapping (MP-SLAM) that employs map features (MFs), such as virtual anchors. This paper presents an extended MP-SLAM method that is augmented with a global map feature (GMF) repository. This repository stores consistent MFs of high quality that are collected during prior traversals. We integrate these GMFs back into the MP-SLAM framework via a probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter, which propagates GMF intensity functions over time. Extensive simulations, together with a challenging real-world experiment using LTE RF signals in a dense urban scenario with severe multipath propagation and inter-cell interference, demonstrate that our framework achieves robust and accurate localization, thereby showcasing its effectiveness in realistic modern cellular networks such as 5G or future 6G networks. It outperforms conventional proprioceptive sensor-based localization and conventional MP-SLAM methods, and achieves reliable localization even under adverse signal conditions."

    "abstract": "With the increasing popularity of smart wearable devices, such as earbuds and smart watches, presents new challenges for seamless and secure user authentication due to their limited user interfaces. Conventional biometric methods, including voice, fingerprints, and facial recognition often face issues such as usability limitations, interference from noise, or vulnerability to spoofing attacks. This paper introduces a novel authentication system called BaroAuth, which utilizes the stable and unique Speech-aware Pressure Sequences (SPSs) patterns captured by a miniaturized MEMS barometer embedded in earbuds. The design of BaroAuth hinges on two important observations. First, the production of speech relies on the coordinated movements of articulatory organs, including the tongue, jaw, and soft palate. These organs, through the activity of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), alter the shape of the ear canal, thereby causing subtle pressure changes that encode the speaker's unique physiological characteristics and articulatory dynamics. Second, SPSs show significant intra-individual consistency and considerable inter-individual variability, which barometers can effectively measure. Meanwhile, we develop the BaroAuth prototype and carry out comprehensive experiments based on it. The experimental findings reveal that BaroAuth demonstrates a mean false-acceptance rate (FAR) of 0.41% and a false-rejection rate (FRR) of 1.23%, respectively, even under complex attack scenarios."

    "abstract": "This paper considers the challenge of detecting multiple targets in a radar scenario, where several point-like targets with distinct angles of arrival (AoAs) coexist within the same range bin. Traditional methods often experience performance degradation due to assumptions of identical AoAs or reliance on prior knowledge of the targets. To address these limitations, we propose an approach that combines a suitable clustering algorithm with sparsity-based reconstruction techniques. The former classifies the range bins with targets while adaptively estimating the interference covariance matrices and target amplitudes using maximum a posteriori criteria. Concurrently, the sparse recovery methods, which exploit sparsity-promoting priors, estimate AoAs without requiring precise steering vector information, thus enhancing the algorithm f lexibility in unknown environments. Remarkably, the proposed detection architectures eliminate the need for prior knowledge of the number or (angular and range) location of targets, enabling robust detection in scenarios with homogeneous interference. Performance analysis confirms the effectiveness of the proposed architecture, demonstrating its ability to accurately cluster multiple target signals and provide (at least rough) estimates of the AoAs."

    "abstract": "In Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), reliable Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication is critical for real-time traffic management, collision avoidance, and environmental monitoring in high-mobility urban scenarios. To support real-time intersection collision-warning and traffic-signal-priority in ITS, we propose an RIS-assisted index modulation scheme that simultaneously increases road-safety message reliability and reduces roadside unit deployment density, termed Reflection Modulation-Assisted Adaptive Space Shift Keying (RM-ASSK). The RM-ASSK scheme leverages reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology to enhance the efficiency and reliability of wireless communication within transportation systems. By integrating RIS with adaptive space shift keying, the scheme aims to improve spectral efficiency and reduce bit-error rate performance. Meanwhile, we present theoretical analyses of the scheme’s spectral efficiency, average BER upper bounds, detection complexity, and ergodic channel capacity lower bounds. These analyses demonstrate the RM-ASSK scheme’s superior performance in terms of spectral efficiency, reduced complexity, and improved BER. Besides, to further enhance the scheme’s effectiveness and flexibility, we propose a novel antenna-combination selection algorithm, mixture optimized antenna combination selection, and a reflection-element subset design. These innovations optimize BER performance while balancing the trade-off between performance and complexity. Simulations show that RM-ASSK reduces data error rates by up to 25% in Nakagami-<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$m$</tex-math> </inline-formula> and Rayleigh fading channels typical of urban V2I, enabling 15-20% faster dissemination of traffic alerts and improving vehicle throughput by supporting 30% more connected devices without spectral congestion."

    "abstract": "Low-altitude economy networking (LAENet) aims to deploy various aerial vehicles to support diverse services, where data collection from edge devices via unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is a critical task. The key challenge lies in jointly optimizing energy consumption and data freshness in spectrum-constrained and eavesdropping-prone low-altitude environments during the data collection process. Although deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has become a viable solution for UAV-assisted data collection, the RL agent still has limited ability to obtain and utilize informative feedback from complex low-altitude environments. In this paper, we propose a large language model (LLM)-enhanced DRL framework for secure data collection in the LAENet, where we leverage an LLM to process environmental feedback for the RL agent. Specifically, we employ the LLM as (i) a state processor to transform basic environmental observations into task-aligned representations, (ii) a reward designer to generate enriched reward signals that guide the agent's actions toward the optimization objective, and (iii) a simulator to construct a virtual LAENet environment for evaluating enhanced state-reward pairs before policy training. Theoretical analysis and numerical results demonstrate that the proposed LLM-enhanced DRL framework achieves faster convergence, improved training stability, and superior performance compared with state-of-the-art baselines."

However, detecting small underwater objects remains challenging due to degraded image quality, complex backgrounds, and computational constraints in embedded systems. This paper presents a lightweight and efficient underwater small object detection framework that achieves a balance between accuracy, inference speed, and deployability. The proposed network employs a partial convolution-based lightweight backbone to reduce redundant computation, an enhanced attention mechanism integrating statistical pooling and multi-scale convolution for refined texture perception, and a multi-branch auxiliary fusion network to preserve spatial and semantic information across scales. Evaluations on the URPC2021 dataset show that the framework attains 83.3% mAP@0.5, 86.4% recall, and 103 FPS with only 3.1M parameters and 7.5 GFLOPs, outperforming existing state-of-the-art lightweight detectors.

    "abstract": "In cellular communications markets, various stakeholders interact while considering regulatory policies enacted by governments to maximize social welfare. However, there remains an opportunity to develop new tools that support countries in making informed decisions regarding the adoption of strategies aimed at enhancing societal well-being. Accordingly, network economics and game theory offer a relevant framework for analyzing such policies. In this regard, the state-of-the-art lacks a market model for cellular communications that incorporates stakeholder interactions under a subsidization scheme designed to maximize the system’s social welfare. This paper introduces a novel subsidization scheme, formulated as a constrained optimization problem involving three stakeholders: the central planner, the cellular network operator, and the aggregate cellular data users. In this context, the central planner and the cellular network operator, acting as strategic players, optimize their respective payoff functions by incorporating benefit factors that represent their interactions, accounting for both attributes and behavioral aspects. Their decision variables include the subsidization factor, bandwidth allocation across the spectrum license, perceived service quality, and data plan pricing. Meanwhile, the aggregate cellular data users consume cellular data based on optimal pricing and perceived service quality. To capture the interactions among these players, a two-stage dynamic game is proposed, employing the backward induction method in combination with an algorithm to derive the subgame perfect equilibrium from the Nash equilibrium. A case study demonstrates a 46.35% increase in social welfare and a 24.10% in cellular network operator’s profit margin by comparing the results associated with the subsidization factor at its optimal value and when it is not optimal. Furthermore, the proposed model incorporates additional elements beyond those typically considered in the literature such as network infrastructure costs, the number of base stations, and the users-to-base-station ratio resulting in a more realistic and practically relevant model for decision-making in cellular communications markets."

To do this, we propose an open-source and pipelined selection-based optimization framework (PiSO) for preprocessed data and a deep learning (DL) model for arterial blood pressure (ABP) estimation, focusing on relatively underexplored Electrocardiogram (ECG)-only data (as well as Photoplethysmogram (PPG)-only and PPG+ECG data) and the recently released Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV dataset. Our end-to-end framework comprises a pipelined two selection phases: 1) First, for the preprocessed data selection (DS) phase, we evaluate open-sourced preprocessing (PP) techniques and toolkit(s) and select the best PP technique with the corresponding preprocessed datasets. 2) Second, in terms of DL model selection (MS) phase, we evaluate DL models of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), and Transformers, using the preprocessed data without an exhaustive feature engineering process. By combining the pipelined two selection phases in our reproducible and fairly evaluable framework (PiSO) using the MIMIC-IV database, we achieve the best mean absolute error (MAE) results of 4.46 <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">mmHg</i> (4.03 <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">mmHg</i>) for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 1.09 <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">mmHg</i> (1.09 <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">mmHg</i>) for diastolic blood pressure (DBP), both meeting Grade A standards according to the British Hypertension Society (BHS) standards, using ECG-only data (compared to PPG-only and PPG+ECG datasets) for intra-subject evaluation.

Various query optimization techniques have been proposed to enhance retrieval by decomposing the single query into multiple queries focusing on different aspects. This query optimization is to supplement the original query to increase the retrieval confidence from diverse aspects. Existing practices individually retrieve relevant texts based on the generated multi-aspect queries, aggregate these texts, and apply reranking methods to select the Top-<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$K$</tex-math></inline-formula> most relevant texts. Such existing individual retrieval and reranking mechanisms often overlook the connections between queries. Consequently, these methods fail to adequately capture the nuances introduced by distinct aspects in multiple queries, and may amplify retrievalinduced hallucinations when semantically fragmented evidence is presented to large models. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel Multi-Aspect Queries Retrieval (MAQ-Retrieval) method. It follows query optimization for multi-aspect queries, integrates a query-weighting mechanism, and leverages the concept of convex hull to perform joint retrieval of multi-aspect queries. In particular, the convex region we constructed can include the set of candidate texts that may be overlooked in traditional approaches, ensuring comprehensive coverage of relevant texts while suppressing inconsistent or noisy fragments that may contribute to model hallucinations. Extensive experiments on both multiplechoice and summarization tasks in either English or Chinese demonstrate that MAQ-Retrieval consistently outperforms four baselines, achieving up to an increased accuracy of 15.2% and the best F1 and ROUGE-Lsum scores across all evaluated datasets, confirming its advantages in RAG with multiple queries, highlighting its ability to enhance retrieval accuracy and mitigate hallucination propagation in large models."

Against this background, this paper proposes a speech and background sound separation method for low-bitrate environments, and extends the end-to-end neural audio codec framework HILCodec to the speech separation task. Not only does it retain the modeling advantages of the neural codec model under high compression ratios, but it also achieves collaborative modeling of compression and separation tasks through systematic optimization of internal modules (such as encoder architecture, discriminator design, and audio quantizer), significantly improving the separation quality and robustness under low-bitrate conditions. Compared with existing methods, this paper innovatively solves the problem of easy confusion between speech and background sound and limited feature expression under low-bitrate conditions, providing a more practical solution for application scenarios such as remote communication, speech recognition preprocessing, and hearing aid design."

Using CiteSpace 6.3.R1, we conducted an analysis of 354 core publications (2015-2025) sourced from the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), uncovering distinct patterns in research output, collaboration networks, and thematic evolution. The results indicate that the publication output in this field follows a three-phase growth trend, with a notable increase after 2020, reaching its peak at 78 publications in 2022. Beijing Normal University, as a leading research institution with 14 publications, has established a cross-institutional collaboration network; however, the overall author collaboration density remains relatively low (0.0079). Naiqing Song, with four publications, emerges as the most influential author. Research hotspots demonstrate patterns of diversified development: traditional domains such as teacher effectiveness assessment and school quality evaluation continue to evolve, while emerging areas—such as the application of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and vocational education evaluation—are advancing rapidly. Policy- driven research themes, including \"core competencies\" and \"Five Domains of Education,\" have gained increasing prominence. Notably, a significant paradigm shift occurred after 2020, with research focusing on the development of intelligent assessment models and reforms in policy-driven evaluation systems. The results systematically clarify the evolution of VAA research in China while offering key perspectives for innovating educational evaluation. These contributions prove valuable for enhancing China’s characteristic education assessment framework."

A GenAI-enhanced interactive system was developed to deliver feedback across four dimensions (structure, clarity and coherence, completeness, grammar and vocabulary) from GenAI and teacher feedback to 10 Chinese undergraduates, with eye-tracking capturing attention allocation. Results revealed no significant difference in attention allocation between GenAI and teacher feedback in the same dimensions. This suggests real-time attention allocation parity with teacher feedback when GenAI feedback quality is optimised through pedagogical constraints. However, learners exhibited different attention allocation in different dimensions: completeness, grammar, and vocabulary demanded more attention than structure, clarity and coherence, reflecting learners’ prioritisation based on immediate evaluative impacts. These findings highlight the critical role of feedback dimensions in cognitive load allocation. The study advocates strategic integration of AI-human feedback systems to address learners’ writing revision priorities."

First, the principles of conventional synthetic inertia (SI) control and secondary frequency drop (SFD) mechanisms are analyzed, revealing limitations of fixed SI parameters. Subsequently, to exploit wind power's frequency regulation potential and suppress SFD well, rotor speed and frequency variables are employed as fuzzy controller inputs to dynamically adjust SI droop and inertia coefficients. During rotor speed recovery, two methods redesign the recovery trajectory to mitigate SFD. Finally, for wind farm with speed difference, parameters are optimized via particle swarm optimization (PSO) at a base wind speed to minimize maximum frequency deviation. Validation on a modified three-machine nine-bus system demonstrates that the proposed method effectively supports system frequency, reduces SFD, and elevates the frequency nadir for wind farm considering wind speed difference."

The findings indicate that when simplifying texts intuitively, pre-service teachers employed strategies that differed significantly from those used by experts, highlighting their limited knowledge of text simplification strategies. Additionally, DeepSeek proved to be a useful tool in supporting their simplification efforts, but pre-service teachers demonstrated limited knowledge of prompting strategies and were unable to take a leading role when using DeepSeek for automatic text simplification. This study suggests that providing training for pre-service teachers on text simplification strategies and prompting strategies in using GenAI for text simplification is valuable for their professional development."

Fast and accurate fault location is crucial for the stable operation of the system. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel fault location method by combining complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD) and Hilbert transform (HT) algorithm. This method calculates the instantaneous frequency of the fault signal, identifies the fault moment by detecting its change points, and achieves fault location for the MMC-HVDC transmission line. This method has excellent time-frequency analysis capabilities, better noise robustness, and higher frequency resolution. Finally, use PSCAD/EMTDC to validate this method. The results show that this method accurately locates faults under different fault conditions, and has strong anti-noise ability and tolerance to large transition resistance."

    "abstract": "Learning Management Systems (LMS) provide new avenues for learning and instruction among students of various levels by facilitating education through different platforms. LMS’s effect on Student Academic Motivation (SAM) is crucial for institutions to promote growth mindsets in students through their learning initiatives. This study is anchored in the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) utilizing the factor on LMS acceptance Performance Expectancy (PE), Effort Expectancy (EE), Social Influence (SI), and Facilitating Conditions (FC) as predictors of determining and understanding its effect on SAM. Moreover, this study addressed the gap in understanding whether students’ degree program and year level mediate the effect of LMS acceptance towards SAM. 510 tertiary students from three-degree programs in the National Capital Region (NCR), Philippines were surveyed using a structured questionnaire. Findings revealed that students’ degree programs and year levels significantly mediate the effect of LMS acceptance and SAM with LMS acceptance exerting a direct positive effect on SAM. This study recommends that academic institutions assess each UTAUT factor influencing LMS use, not only to enhance students’ academic motivation but also to improve their perception and satisfaction with LMS platforms."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a hardware–software co-design methodology for accurate and energy-efficient DNN inference on capacitive processing-using-memory (PUM) systems. We investigate the fundamental algorithm–hardware interactions that limit analog accelerators, focusing on accumulator resolution and noise resilience. To eliminate impractical requirements for peripheral circuitry, we introduce a precision-aware training framework that minimizes the effective resolution of ADCs and enhances robustness to circuit-level non-idealities such as device variability and read-out noise. Leveraging bit-slicing and accumulator-aware optimizations, we show that ADC resolution can be reduced from 19 to 7 bits on ResNet18 without accuracy degradation. We further provide a system-level analysis linking neural network characteristics back to compute-cell parameters and ADC design constraints, establishing the operational limits of capacitive charge-domain inference. Finally, we present an energy model demonstrating how reduced ADC precision and improved charge-domain efficiency yield substantial system-level energy savings. Together, these results offer a blueprint for scalable, low-power analog DNN accelerators, pushing the boundaries of fully on-chip inference."

Aiming at the problem of limited prediction accuracy caused by insufficient and uneven distribution of industrial energy consumption data samples, this paper proposes a data augmentation method based on Variational AutoEncoder (VAE), and combines it with LightGBM algorithm to construct a high-precision industrial energy consumption prediction model VAE-LightGBM. Experiments on the steel industry data show that the prediction accuracy of the VAE enhancement method (MAPE=3.6%) is significantly better than that of GAN, noise injection, SMOTE and other comparison methods.

Based on the XGBoost regression prediction model, this paper designs a hybrid loss function incorporating physical consistency constraints. The optimized model confines prediction residuals within approximately ±0.003%.

Moreover, the factors affecting the transduction efficiency under high-temperature conditions are not fully solved. This study establishes a multi-physical finite element model for electromagnetic acoustic transducer at elevated temperatures (up to 500°C) to investigate the influence of various EMAT parameters on its transduction efficiency. The analysis identifies the reduction in excitation current amplitude at high temperatures as the predominant factor responsible for the efficiency degradation. Furthermore, a power synthesis method is proposed to compensate for this current reduction, offering a viable strategy for enhancing the transduction efficiency of EMAT operating at high temperatures."

The forward kinematic models of the landing points of the inner and outer wheels were established firstly. Based on the theoretical analysis, the phenomenon of foot pole slippage of the robot during continuous steering caused by the polygonal effect of the multi-foot wheels was studied. Then, taking the slippage distance as the steering stability indicator of the multi-legged wheel robot, the influence of structural parameters such as the body width and the radius of the star-shaped wheel, as well as operational parameters such as the steering angle and the traveling speed on slippage was studied. The conclusions drawn from this research can provide a theoretical basis for the control of this type of robot and its future promotion and application."

    "abstract": "LEO satellite constellations are becoming a feasible option as a means of global Internet of Things (IoT) due to their large coverage, lower latency, and flexibility in deployment to a wide range of scenarios. However, the sheer number of IoT devices is an insurmountable challenge to the continued flow of data, especially when the availability of feeder links cannot be ensured.We suggest an architecture that combines a store-and-forward (S&F) paradigm and dynamic channel management in an SDN-based LEO satellite IoT infrastructure in the present study. The S&F mechanism enables satellites to momentarily store packets in the event of feeder connections and then resend them on getting connection again; this alleviates the effect of intermittent connections whilst maintaining the reliability of deliveries. At the same time, the SDN controller dynamically assigns channel resources based on traffic demand and the priority level of the devices, thus, balancing access opportunities and reducing the number of collisions in the access process in case of random access.To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed system, we develop analytical models that concentrate on key performance indicators such as packet delivery success rate, delay, throughput, and energy consumption. Our architecture results in very high reliability and resource utilisation, as seen in simulations, and thus it makes a strong candidate to large-scale IoT deployments using satellite technology."

This quantitative descriptive study investigates the usage patterns and perceptions of AI tools among junior high school students in the Philippines, addressing a gap in K–12 educational technology research. Guided by the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the study explores how perceived usefulness and ease of use influence student engagement with AI platforms such as ChatGPT, Grammarly, and Canva AI. Data were gathered through a structured self-report survey from 107 students in Grades 7 to 10 at a university-affiliated laboratory high school. Participants were selected based on prior experience using AI tools for academic purposes. Results indicate that students frequently use AI tools for their clarity and time-saving benefits, but hold neutral attitudes toward their impact on critical thinking, learner autonomy, and emotional engagement. Ethical concerns such as data privacy and fears of teacher displacement were also noted. Peer influence, rather than teacher recommendation, emerged as the dominant factor driving AI tool use. The study recommends embedding AI literacy and ethics into the junior high curriculum and providing targeted professional development to support educators in guiding responsible, reflective AI integration in classrooms."

The integration of technologies into education has changed the ways of future talents training. However, existing research mainly focuses on interdisciplinary training policies at the macro level, with few empirical studies on students’ digital competence. In light of this, based on the EU digital competence framework, this study used a mixed-method approach, employing questionnaires and in-depth interviews, to investigate how undergraduate students develop digital competence. The findings indicate that teachers’ integration of technology, students’ application of technology, and students’ attitudes toward technology all significantly predict students’ level of digital competence. Teachers can help develop students’ digital competence through personal demonstration, resource sharing, and designing authentic tasks, while students can enhance their digital competence through self-study, peer work, etc. Furthermore, there is an interaction between students’ attitudes toward technology and their digital competence. The conclusion offers insights for digital transformation in education."

    "abstract": "Forests are vital ecosystems that support biodiversity and human life, while acting as natural carbon sinks that regulate climate and ecological balance. However, in recent years, wildfires have become increasingly frequent and intense, particularly in climate-sensitive regions such as the Mediterranean. Türkiye experienced a remarkable rise in wildfire events during the 2025 fire season, underlining the urgent need for rapid detection and reliable post-fire assessments. Remote sensing provides effective tools for wildfire monitoring, as satellite data enable the detection and mapping of burned areas, and evaluation of burn severity over large and inaccessible regions. In this study, the burned area detection performance of Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8/9 imagery was comparatively evaluated for the 15 largest wildfires in Türkiye during 2025. Pre- and post-fire mosaics were generated in Google Earth Engine, and three representative areas of interest Bilecik/Sakarya, İzmir/Seferihisar, and Karabük were analyzed in detail through severity maps. Spectral indices including dNBR, dNDVI, and dNDMI were computed to assess vegetation and moisture changes, and burn severity maps were produced using USGS thresholds. At the national scale, based on the 33 forest fire events, Sentinel-2 detected a total of 101503.99 hectares (ha) of burned area, while Landsat estimated 100058.78 ha, with differences generally below 5%. Intersection-over-Union (IoU) analysis further confirmed strong spatial agreement across severity classes, demonstrating the complementary strengths of Sentinel-2 and Landsat for wildfire assessment."

    "abstract": "Federated learning is an essential distributed model training technique. However, threats such as gradient inversion attacks and poisoning attacks pose significant risks to both privacy of training data and model correctness. We propose SMTFL, a novel approach for secure model training in federated learning. To safeguard gradients privacy against gradient inversion attacks, clients are dynamically grouped, allowing one client's gradient to be divided to obfuscate the gradients of other clients within the group. This method incorporates checks and balances to reduce the collusion for inferring specific client data. To detect poisoning attacks from malicious clients, we assess the impact of aggregated gradients on the global model's performance, enabling effective identification and exclusion of malicious clients. Each client's gradients are encrypted and stored, with decryption collectively managed by all clients. The detected poisoning gradients are invalidated from the global model through an unlearning method. Compared to related work, SMTFL does not rely on trusted participants, avoids the performance degradation caused with traditional noise-injection, and avoids complex homomorphic encryption during gradient aggregation. SMTFL is evaluated on five datasets, and these results demonstrate its effectiveness in defending against gradient inversion and poisoning attacks. The model accuracy is nearly restored to its pre-attack state when SMTFL is deployed. Furthermore, SMTFL achieves over 95% accuracy in identifying malicious clients while maintaining a false positive rate for honest clients within 5%, which is 6% lower than the latest methods."

Axions are candidate particles supposed to be a relevant component of cold dark matter. They can be detected through high-quality factor (Q) resonant microwave cavities named haloscopes. In order to reach high Q factor, conventional copper cavities can be coated with a superconducting layer. Materials with high irreversibility field such as rare-earth barium cuprates (REBCO) are able to increase the figure of merit B2Q of bare copper cavity at 4.2 K by an order of magnitude over a field range 3–10 T at 9 GHz and in the frequency range 1–100 GHz at 5 T. A simple way to obtain a coated resonator is soldering high-quality commercial REBCO tapes on a sector-shaped cavity. In this contribution, we tested the effect of a two-step method, which includes soldering and peeling, on the structural, morphological and superconducting properties of REBCO layer to be adopted for resonant cavity inner coating. Several REBCO tapes obtained from different producers were tested. Morphological and compositional analyses indicate that different tapes show a different behaviour as a consequence of the peeling process. Soldering and peeling tests point out that REBCO-buffer layer interface is critical to obtain a sector cavity with uniformly exposed REBCO film."

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in deep neural networks (DNNs) have exacerbated the data movement bottleneck inherent in traditional von Neumann architectures. Processing-in-memory (PIM) has emerged as a promising paradigm by integrating computation within memory to alleviate this challenge. However, the lack of versatile and cycle-accurate simulation frameworks significantly limits the evaluation and optimization of diverse PIM designs. Existing in-house PIM simulators tend to be narrowly tailored to specific architectures, lacking generality and extensibility across hybrid computing environments. In this paper, we introduce HyDRASim, a cycle-accurate and extensible PIM-CPU simulator designed to support a wide range of PIM architectural features. HyDRASim integrates ZSim for detailed CPU modeling with DRAMSim3 for accurate memory modeling to enable flexible simulation across CPU-only, PIM-only, and PIM-CPU hybrid configurations. Validation experiments using GEMV workloads of varying sizes demonstrate that HyDRASim achieves cycle-level fidelity, with average latency and power errors of just $5.92 \\%$ and $5.61 \\%$, respectively, compared to established in-house baselines. Furthermore, system-level performance evaluations with diverse DNN workloads reveal that transformer-based models achieve $2.21 \\times$ greater acceleration compared to convolutional neural networks under hybrid configurations modeled with HyDRASim. These results establish HyDRASim as a reliable and powerful tool for accurately modeling, evaluating, and optimizing emerging PIM-CPU hybrid architectures, providing critical insights into the future of memory-centric system design.

    "abstract": "Robot learning approaches such as behavior cloning and reinforcement learning have shown great promise in synthesizing robot skills from human demonstrations in specific environments. However, these approaches often struggle to generalize to unseen real-world settings because they rely on task-specific demonstrations or complex simulators. While foundation models (e.g., LLMs, VLMs) offer rich semantic understanding from internet-scale data, using this knowledge to enable robotic systems to understand the underlying dynamics of the world, generalize policies across different tasks, and adapt policies to new environments remains an open challenge. To alleviate these limitations, we propose an agentic framework for robot self-guidance and self-improvement that comprises a set of role-specialized conversational agents, including a high-level advisor, a grounding agent, a monitoring agent, and a robotic agent. Our framework iteratively grounds a base robot policy on relevant objects in the environment and uses visuomotor cues to shift the policy's action distribution toward more desirable states online, while remaining agnostic to the subjective configuration of a given robot hardware platform. We demonstrate that our approach can effectively guide manipulation policies to achieve significantly higher success rates, both in simulation and in real-world experiments, without the need for additional human demonstrations or extensive exploration."

    "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are widely used in various fields due to their flexibility and maneuverability. However, for UAV systems that rely solely on point features, weak-texture environments cause a decline in pose estimation accuracy, creating a severe localization challenge. The fusion of line and point features introduces more geometric constraints, enhancing system robustness and localization accuracy. This letter presents a lightweight monocular visual-inertial SLAM framework, WEMA-VINS (Weak-grid ELSED MIS-filtered and Angular-constrained VINS), designed for robust point-line fusion. It integrates weak-texture region elimination, ELSED line detection, Maximum Independent Set (MIS)-based pruning of redundant segments, and an angular-constrained line optimization module. Our proposed framework collectively improves point feature quality, preserves structural line information, and enhances robustness against endpoint drift and partial occlusion, leading to reliable point-line fusion and efficient state estimation. Extensive experiments on the KAIST VIO and EuRoC datasets demonstrate that WEMA-VINS significantly improves both localization accuracy and robustness, consistently achieving leading performance over recent point-line SLAM baselines while maintaining real-time efficiency."

In this paper, the capability of eliminating DC offsets and the stability of conventional HFO are analysed first. Although the conventional HFO with P controller has better stability at low speeds, the capability of eliminating DC offsets is poor, while HFO with PI controller are opposite. Considering the contradiction between the capability of eliminating DC offsets and the stability, an improved HFO with adaptive gain matrix is proposed to enhance stability. The capability of DC offset elimination is confirmed by frequency domain analyses and the stability of the whole system is proved according to the Popov's superstability theorem, and the guidelines for parameter design are also presented. The proposed HFO can operate at ultra-low speeds except for absolute zero speed while avoiding the influence of DC offsets. It is shown that the proposed observer has better performance on eliminating DC offsets than the conventional HFO with P controller and better stability than the conventional HFO with PI controller. The comparative experiments are carried out on a PMSM drive platform to validate the superiority of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "Manufacturing and assembly errors, long-term operation, and other factors may induce rotor static eccentricity (SE) in a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM), which is a key drivetrain component in electric vehicles and rail transport systems. Further, SE generates an unbalanced magnetic pull that degrades motor efficiency and operational longevity, posing reliability risks in electrified transportation applications. Hence, proactive eccentricity detection is essential to ensure functional safety and operational availability. Traditional SE diagnosis methods are normally based on current or vibration signals, susceptible to misdiagnosis due to interference from load variations or other mechanical faults. While magnetic flux density (MFD)- based SE diagnostic methods benefit from signal stability, their previous implementations relied solely on MFD amplitude variation. This approach is susceptible to various disturbances, e.g., Hall sensor misplacement, sensor gain drift, temperature variations, and such a susceptibility frequently leads to misdiagnosis on SE. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a SE diagnosis method using embedded linear Hall sensors for in-situ flux monitoring. Firstly, the amplitude-phase dual modulation effect of SE on MFD at antipodal Hall sensing points is revealed. Then, an initial calibration approach to enhance the diagnostic accuracy is put forward by decoupling interference sources and compensating for component-level errors. Thirdly, an amplitude-phase dual diagnostic indicator is proposed, and a combined online monitoring and offline quantification framework is implemented, which enables simultaneous quantification of SE magnitude and directional orientation. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through finite-element analysis and experimental tests."

    "abstract": "Accurate synchronization of distributed sensor measurements is essential for reliable vibration-based structural health monitoring (SHM). Wireless Internet of Things (IoT) systems, while attractive for large-scale SHM deployments, inevitably introduce unknown time lags arising from clock drift and communication delays. Conventional frequency-domain (FD) estimators and feature-based machine-learning (ML) models struggle to handle such asynchronous measurements, especially when delays are smaller than the sampling interval. To address these limitations, this paper proposed a learning-based synchronization framework that integrates a time-lag convolutional neural network with attention (TLCA) to directly estimate continuous-valued time lags from raw vibration signals, together with a resampling-based alignment strategy to correct non-integer delays. The proposed framework was validated using both simulated structural responses and field data from a wireless SHM system deployed on the Jindo Bridge. By directly learning time relationships from raw vibration signal pairs, TLCA achieves sub-millisecond accuracy and consistently outperforms conventional frequency-domain and feature-based learning methods, with about an order-of-magnitude improvement in precision. It also maintained strong robustness under increased noise and modal coupling. With efficient data-level alignment and low computational complexity of the overall framework, it can enable accurate and real-time synchronization for practical IoT-based SHM applications."

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a key distributed intelligence paradigm in modern computer networks, enabling model training across massive edge devices without exposing raw data. Nevertheless, the nature of FL — continuous sharing of local model updates — may result in privacy exposures over network interactions. To address this limitation, Local Differential Privacy Federated Learning (LDP-FL), a variant that strengthens privacy by injecting noise on each client, was proposed. However, the noise accumulates in the model through the two-phase indivisible sequential process of LDP, thereby bringing the well-recognized privacy-utility trade-off challenge. In this paper, to investigate whether the LDP framework has achieved a favorable trade-off, we propose an ideal interaction mode, Ideal Differential Privacy Federated Learning (IDP-FL), which allows for independent protection in the uplink and downlink phases. Through a comparative analysis of noise accumulation in IDP-FL and LDP-FL, we discover and theoretically prove that LDP-FL suffers from inherent noise redundancy, i.e. noise accumulation in uplink exceeds privacy requirements in downlink. To avoid this defect, we propose a novel framework, Noise Annihilation Differential Privacy Federated Learning (NADP-FL), which can be regarded as an instantiation of IDP-FL. In this framework, a portion of noises are distributedly generated in pairs, thereby mutually canceling each other out during aggregation and not appearing in the downlink phase. As a result, NADP realizes independent protection for both phases, eliminating unnecessary noise accumulation, achieving a more favorable privacy-utility trade-off and enhance protection in a way that incurs theoretically no further utility loss. We validate the superior utility, scalability and robustness of our framework through extensive experiments."

    "abstract": "This article presents a novel vascular interventional guidewire and catheter manipulator based on purely compliant mechanisms, adopting a technical approach different from that of existing surgical robots. Inspired by human manual manipulation of guidewires and catheters, the proposed manipulator adopts a biomimetic operation paradigm, enabling axial and rotational actuation while simultaneously measuring the interaction force and torque in real time. By employing purely compliant mechanisms, the design is highly simplified, with integrally manufactured core components and no rigid kinematic pairs. A symmetric architecture is adopted to enable a modular design, facilitating assembly and maintenance. Experimental results validate the performance of the proposed biomimetic compliant manipulator, and operational safety is demonstrated through a force-limiting control strategy based on the integrated force-sensing capability. The proposed design concept provides guidance for the development of vascular interventional surgical robots and is potentially applicable to mechanical systems requiring multiaxis manipulation and sensing."

    "abstract": "To facilitate cross-platform access and convenient sharing of personal photos, an increasing number of consumers are uploading such content to cloud storage via various electronic devices. However, these practices notably amplify the risk of privacy breaches. Reversible data hiding in encrypted images (RDH-EI) emerges as a promising solution that secures both the original image content and the concealed secret data. This paper proposes a high-capacity RDH-EI method based on pixel prediction and entropy encoding. A key limitation of regression-based predictors is their sensitivity to outliers, which impairs parameter estimation and reduces predictive performance. Nevertheless, most existing predictors lack targeted mechanisms to mitigate this issue. To address this gap, we propose a robust regression-based predictor that effectively suppresses the adverse impact of outliers. We introduce two optimization techniques, prediction error grouping and intra-group transformation, to improve the efficiency of entropy encoding. First, a pre-trained neural network model is exploited to extract multi-channel deep features from the original image. Next, we propose a novel entropy-based channel selection mechanism to identify the most informative channels, which are then fused into a comprehensive feature. Based on this feature, prediction errors are partitioned into blocks, which are then clustered into multiple groups. Intra-group transformations, including non-negative and radix-remainder transformations, are then applied to these groups to concentrate their data distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves extremely high embedding rates across diverse test images and benchmark datasets, such as <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">BOSSBase</i>, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">BOWS2</i>, the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">BrainTumor</i> medical image dataset, and the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">USC-SIPI</i> texture image dataset, outperforming a range of state-of-the-art methods."

    "abstract": "Quadrotors hold significant promise for several applications such as agriculture, search-and-rescue, and infrastructure inspection. Achieving autonomous operation requires systems to navigate safely through complex and unfamiliar environments. This level of autonomy is particularly challenging due to the complexity of such environments. This is complicated by size, weight, and power (SWaP) constraints on the aerial platform, which limits flight time and precludes the use of bulky sensors like Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) for mapping. Furthermore, computing globally optimal, collision-free paths and translating them into time-optimized, safe trajectories in real time adds significant computational complexity. To address these challenges, we present a fully onboard, real-time navigation system that relies solely on lightweight onboard sensors. Our system constructs a dense 3D map of the environment using a novel visual depth estimation approach that fuses stereo and monocular learning-based depth, yielding longer-range, denser, and less noisy depth maps than conventional stereo methods. Building on this map, we introduce a novel planning and trajectory generation framework capable of rapidly computing time-optimal global trajectories. As the map is incrementally updated with new depth information, our system continuously refines the trajectory to maintain safety and optimality. Both our planner and trajectory generator outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of computational efficiency and guarantee obstacle-free trajectories. We validate our system through autonomous flight experiments in diverse indoor and outdoor environments, demonstrating its effectiveness for safe navigation in previously unknown settings."

It focuses on three components of digital literacy: information, technological, and computer literacy. The study aims to examine the relationship between digital literacy and ChatGPT use in educational contexts. Using a quantitative descriptive-comparative design, data were collected from 367 SHS students across grade level, academic tracks, and socio-economic class. Findings showed no significant differences in digital literacy based on these variables. Moreover, a very weak, statistically non-significant positive relationship was found between digital literacy components and ChatGPT use. These findings suggest that while digital literacy contributes to students’ ability to engage with digital tools, external factors such as teacher guidance, classroom integration, and task relevance are more influential in driving ChatGPT use. The study highlights the need to strengthen both digital literacy and instructional support to optimize AI tool integration in education."

Current cryptographic solutions, which rely on software libraries or dedicated hardware accelerators, are fundamentally limited by the performance and energy costs of data movement between memory and processing units. This paper introduces CryptoSRAM, an in-SRAM computing architecture that performs cryptographic operations directly within the MCU’s standard SRAM array. By repurposing the memory array into a massively parallel processing fabric, CryptoSRAM eliminates the data movement bottleneck. This approach is well-suited to MCUs, which utilize physical addressing and Direct Memory Access (DMA) to manage SRAM, allowing for seamless integration with minimal hardware overhead. Our analysis shows that for common cryptographic kernels, CryptoSRAM achieves throughput improvements of up to 74 × and 67 × for AES and SHA3, respectively, compared to a software implementation. Furthermore, our solution delivers up to 6 × higher throughput than existing hardware accelerators for AES. CryptoSRAM demonstrates a viable and efficient architecture for secure communication in next-generation loT systems."

When the signal is strong, BDS/IMU integrated positioning is adopted, while T265 visual-inertial odometry is used under weak signal conditions. The switching mechanism takes the Position Dilution of Precision (PDOP) and illumination intensity as the main decision factors, combined with a counting threshold judgment method to realize localization mode switching. This approach ultimately ensures seamless localization of the inspection vehicle in structured farmland environments where signal strength alternates between strong and weak regions. Building upon this, the combination of global coverage path planning and local A*-based obstacle avoidance enables highly efficient and exhaustive field traversal within regular farmland blocks, while also providing the capability to handle dynamic obstacles."

However, during operation, the system may experience an open-circuit (OC) or short-circuit (SC) fault, resulting in an interruption of power supply to the load. To reduce the frequency of such interruptions, this study proposes an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based technique to support the restoration of continuous operation in the event of a fault. The proposed controller manages two conventionally designed VSI circuits connected in parallel, enabling the system to switch power supply to the alternate circuit in the event of an OC or SC fault in the primary circuit. The design incorporates two additional switches between the inverter output lines to prevent backflow of current within the system. A simulation analysis was performed using MATLAB/Simulink to evaluate the performance of the proposed system. Simulation results demonstrate the system's capability to restore continuous power supply from the DC source to the load during an OC or SC fault in either circuit. The proposed approach can be extended to other categories of VSI to improve the efficiency and reliability of power delivery from source to load."

To address this, the correlation between PV forecasting errors and their influencing factors under complex environmental conditions is analyzed, and a forecasting error modeling approach on the basis of numerical characteristic clustering is proposed. Classify the overall forecasting errors using a density matrix–based adaptive K-means clustering algorithm, then partition them according to the amplitude and variation characteristics of the predicted output. For each partition, the PV forecasting error is modeled by a confidence interval–based fuzzy set construction method (CIAS). By integrating the confidence interval fuzzy set considering error characteristics with the information gap theory (IGDT), named data-driven IGDT (DIGDT), a hybrid decision model for power plants is constructed to achieve intelligent operation optimization under varying meteorological conditions and different prediction levels. Based on the historical prediction of PV and meteorological data from Elia and NASA, the results demonstrate that the proposed error model effectively captures the distributional skewness of PV outputs in complex environments, and the intelligent operation model achieves superior economic performance."

Traditional RF-based solutions of IEEE 802.11p and C-V2X may face congestion, interference, and changing latency in high traffic conditions that may compromise the delivery of event notifications in a timely manner in critical situations. In this paper, a photonic communication model to achieve the augmentation of VANET safety messages through an intensitymodulation/direct-detection (IM/DD) optical medium and embedded into conventional vehicular communication stacks is presented. The suggested architecture includes a scaled photonic transmitter-receiver device, a mobility conscious framework of optical paths and a hybrid RF-photonic framework of receiving messages. A hybrid simulation system of optical modeling with MATLAB, mobility generation with SUMO and network evaluation with NS-3 are created to test the performance in conditions of real urban traffic. The findings indicate that photonic connection greatly minimizes the end-to-end latency and increases the packet delivery ratio compared to RF baselines, especially in dense environments. Seamless hybrid operation is also supported in the model and guarantees reliable transmission of messages even when the line-of-sight is constrained dynamically. These results suggest that the photonic communication can become an efficient supplementary technology in augmenting safety critical communication to intelligent transportation systems in the future."

To address this challenge, there is ongoing research into grid-forming (GFM). The prevalent inverter control method, known as the grid-following (GFL), is susceptible to faults and does not have the ability to maintain voltage and frequency. However, grid-forming inverters (GFMIs) overcome these shortcomings. Nevertheless, due to its ability to autonomously generate voltage and frequency, there is difficult to detect unintentional islanding, and there is a potential risk of encountering a Non-Detection Zone (NDZ) may occur. This paper analyzes the response characteristics of GFMIs when the reference values of voltage and reactive power injected into the GFMI are changed using PSCAD/EMTDC. Furthermore, it proposes a innovative unintentional islanding detection method (IDM) applicable to GFMIs, which is based on the rate of change voltage and reactive power before and after the reference adjustment."

    "abstract": "The structural integrity of the aluminum sheath of high-voltage cables is crucial for the safety of the power system, so the detection of its defects is particularly important. However, the selection of ultrasonic guided wave modes and frequencies directly affects the detection results. Based on finite element simulation and introducing Floquet-Bloch boundary conditions, the dispersion curve of the aluminum sheath guided wave is calculated, and compared with the SAFE method. The maximum error is only 0.16%, verifying the reliability of the method. On this basis, the influence of asphalt layer and polyvinyl chloride outer sheath material parameters on the phase velocity and cutoff frequency is analyzed. The results show that the covering layer has a significant effect on the dispersion characteristics, especially in the high-frequency region. The research results suggest that the low-frequency axial mode should be prioritized to reduce the interference caused by the instability of the outer covering layer. This paper provides a theoretical basis for the selection of excitation parameters in guided wave detection of high-voltage cables and is of great significance for improving the defect identification accuracy in engineering applications."

    "abstract": "While significant advances have been made in fact-checking systems, many AI models still struggle to understand the multi-granular relationships between claims and evidence. The inability of such models to assess the internal consistency of evidence or gaps or contradictions in evidence often leads to them arriving at wrong or misleading conclusions that are provided to the user without any warning. To counter such challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework that is able to acquire representations of multi-granular relationships between claims and evidence. This representation allows more nuanced, context-aware logical reasoning. Our framework can also summarize evidence, providing transparent, interpretable chains for verifying claims. Architecturally, our framework uses a multi-encoder and a decoder. It is able to extract appropriate features from the evidence making sure that each feature is considered individually and in relation to the broader context. Additionally, we leverage Multi-Task Learning (MTL) for improved efficiency and performance by simultaneously training the model on both claim classification and evidence summarization tasks. This approach helps achieve better accuracy and trustworthiness of fact-checking systems, especially in complex scenarios with ambiguous or conflicting evidence."

WiFi offers strong non-style of sight coverage but suffers in congestion and fluctuating lag in a busy traffic whereas LiFi offers full bandwidth, interference free links under both line-of-sight and dense traffic situations but is vulnerable to mobility and obstruction. The present paper includes a performance optimization framework of heterogeneous WiFiLiFi networks, specifically in autonomous platoons. A resource distribution and handover approach of mobility-awareness makes use of dynamic process of selecting the most appropriate communication interface according to forecasted link quality, vehicle geometry and latency needs. The model separates the mission-critical control traffic and highbandwidth sensor traffic. Comparison of the simulation results of WiFi-only, LiFi-only and hybrid deployments reveal that the proposed heterogeneous deployment method is significantly minimizing the control latency and enhancing the throughput. These results indicate that integrated WiFiLiFi systems are effective at satisfying very high communication requirements of autonomous vehicle platooning of the next generation."

However, with the integration of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT-4, it remains unclear whether these models can recognize learner emotions and generate adaptive responses that promote meaningful interaction. To address this gap, we collected 895 rounds of math-related dialogue between learners and ChatGPT-4, annotated with seven emotions. Further, we evaluated ChatGPT-4’s emotion recognition accuracy and analyzed the linguistic diversity of its responses across emotional contexts. Experimental results show that it achieved 78.7% accuracy in classifying learning emotions. Meanwhile responses to positive emotions displayed higher lexical, syntactic, and semantic diversity, while negative-emotion responses were simpler and more homogeneous. Importantly, variability in syntactic and semantic structures correlated positively with engagement metrics like interaction frequency and message complexity. These findings suggest that emotion-sensitive language adaptation by ChatGPT-4 can foster learner engagement and inform the design of emotionally intelligent educational agents."

However, most existing research predominantly focus on non-occluded gait data, whereas real-world scenarios often involve occlusions caused by various factors, such as carried objects or pedestrian interactions. Due to the lack of occluded gait datasets, research on occluded gait recognition (OGR) remains limited. To address this issue, we propose an Occluded Gait Synthesis (OGS) framework that generates occluded gait sequences by introducing multiple types of synthetic occlusions into clean, publicly available gait datasets, thereby simulating real-world conditions. Building on OGS, we further introduce a novel codebook-based framework for gait reconstruction and recognition. VQ-Gait learns a discrete code-book of gait patterns and employs an attention-based decoder to recover missing information, enabling realistic and temporally consistent reconstruction of occluded sequences. The completed gait sequences are then fed into a downstream recognition model, yielding robust identification. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively restores occluded silhouettes and significantly enhances recognition performance across various occlusion scenarios."

However, the high diversity of land cover categories and complex spatial structures in high-resolution images continue to pose considerable challenges. While parameter-efficient tuning techniques such as LoRA allow large foundation models to be adapted effectively, they still face limitations in representing the strong spectral and spatial variations found in remote sensing data. This paper introduces a task-oriented MoELoRA framework that combines a mixture-of-experts structure with LoRA, encouraging individual experts to specialize implicitly in different land cover types. We design a routing network that uses global context to assign features dynamically to the most suitable experts. Without predefined expert domains, our approach accurately models varied geographical characteristics. Evaluations on the LoveDA remote sensing dataset show the proposed method achieves higher segmentation accuracy than standard LoRA and other parameter-efficient tuning baselines, providing an efficient and practical option for deploying large vision models in remote sensing."

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of renewable energy, especially solar and wind, has reshaped modern power systems. Unlike conventional synchronous generators, inverter-based resources (IBRs) supply only limited fault current, respond rapidly to disturbances, and often produce non-standard waveforms. These characteristics challenge traditional protection schemes, which were built on the assumptions of strong and predictable fault signatures. As a result, utilities are reporting more frequent false trips, delayed clearance, and undetected faults in renewable-dominated grids. This paper examines the shortcomings of conventional methods and emerging solutions for modern grids. It first outlines classical overcurrent, voltage, and distance protection, whose simplicity, low cost, and reliability remain valuable, but whose fixed settings and impedance assumptions no longer suit high-IBR networks. Next, it explores adaptive protection strategies that update relay settings in real time using dynamic thresholds, online calibration, and wide-area measurements. These methods enhance relay performance but rely on reliable data and communication. The review also considers hybrid approaches that combine advanced pattern recognition with adaptive logic, offering adaptability but facing challenges related to data, interpretability, and computation. The paper concludes by identifying key evaluation factors—accuracy, speed, robustness, and trustworthiness—and highlighting hybrid frameworks as a promising path forward. Together, adaptive and AI-based approaches represent the most viable direction for future protection in renewable-rich power systems."

However, modern large language models, such as Qwen2, utilize Grouped Query Attention and SwiGLU activation functions to shift the density of model parameters toward feedforward networks. This paper systematically evaluates adaptation methods focusing on attention, feedforward networks, and all linear layers within the Qwen2-7B architecture, revealing a fundamental shift in the focus of fine-tuning efficiency. Our experimental results show that adaptation targeting feedforward networks is crucial for inference tasks. Compared to the baseline model using only the attention mechanism, the full linear adaptive strategy achieves a relative improvement of 9.1% in accuracy on abstract algebra tasks. While a cost-benefit analysis shows that this approach increases the number of trainable parameters by a factor of eight, the absolute memory overhead is still small at about 80 MB. Based on this, we advocate adapting all linear layers as the optimal configuration to balance logical reasoning ability and hardware efficiency in modern large language models."

Each polished surface is coated with a 35 nm thin film of Gold (Au) to induce plasmonic effects. The proposed sensor is analysed using the finite element method (FEM) with perfectly matched layer (PML) boundary conditions, and mode analysis is carried out to optimize the sensing performance parameters. The maximum wavelength sensitivity achieved by the proposed sensor is 2000 nm/RIU to 5000 nm/RIU for a range of refractive index 1.33 to 1.41 of the sample, meanwhile the sensor distinguishes between healthy and cancer-affected liquid samples by detecting resonance wavelength shifts (ReWSs) corresponding to differences in refractive indices. A high sensitivity of 3571.43 nm/RIU is achieved for two types of breast cancer cells.

    "abstract": "The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) interconnects medical devices and sensors to enable continuous monitoring and improved patient care. While this connectivity offers significant benefits, it also introduces critical security risks, as resource-constrained devices are highly vulnerable to cyberattacks. Anomaly detection in such environments remains difficult because many existing approaches fail to jointly capture the structural relationships among devices and the dynamic temporal patterns of network behavior. To address this gap, we propose a hybrid anomaly detection framework that integrates GraphSAGE based Graph Neural Networks for structural feature extraction with a Performer Transformer for efficient temporal modeling. Experimental evaluations on four benchmark datasets, CICIoMT2024, WUSTL-EHMS-2020, ECU-IoHT, and IoT Healthcare Security, demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves consistently high detection accuracy, robust generalization, and adaptability across diverse IoMT and healthcare network scenarios."

    "abstract": "Forest cover serves as a critical indicator of ecosystem stability and carbon balance. This study investigated the spatio-temporal dynamics and driving mechanisms of forest fractional cover (FFC) in Northeast China from 2000 to 2021. A machine learning framework integrating Landsat time-series imagery with spectral and phenological features—notably the spectral angle at the NIR band (ANIR) and harmonic characteristics (amplitude and phase) of time-series NDVI—was implemented using a Random Forest classifier to enhance FFC estimation accuracy. The results indicate that during the period from 2001 to 2021, the OA of the generated forest maps varied between 80.0% and 95.4%, while the F-score ranged from 75.0% to 95.3%. Attribution analysis using the CatBoost-SHAP model revealed that precipitation was the dominant driver, contributing 42% to forest loss and 31% to forest gain, while temperature, human activities, and soil properties exerted secondary effects. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of combining spectral–phenological features with machine learning for accurate FFC estimation."

This application was deployed on OPS-SAT-1, an ESA satellite in orbit until May 2024 which served as a powerful, reconfigurable flying laboratory for experiments. However, the experiment could not be executed on OPS-SAT-1 due to a malfunction in the I2C bus. The main advantage of the presented application is its adaptability for use on any satellite with a similar pointing strategy implementing the Nanosat Mission Operations Framework, which is the Service Oriented architecture that ESA will use in future nanosatellite missions. The experiment design could thus be reused in another satellite. The application incorporates two control algorithms for comparison: an experimental fuzzy controller and an experimental PID controller. However, it can be used to test any type of controller and the general objective of this work is to contribute to the advancement of in-orbit testing and validation of new spacecraft attitude control algorithms."

    "abstract": "Given the high cost associated with directly measuring the Traffic Matrix (TM), researchers have devoted efforts to devising methods for estimating the complete TM from low-cost link loads by solving a set of heavily ill-posed linear equations. Today’s increasingly intricate networks present an even greater challenge: as adaptive and dynamically changing routing strategies are gradually replacing traditional fixed routing schemes, the routing matrix within these equations can no longer be deemed reliable. In our previous work, we pioneered a flow-based generative model, FlowTM, which estimated the TM by establishing an invertible correlation between the TM and link loads without relying on the routing matrix. We demonstrated that the missing information in the ill-posed equations can be decoupled from the TM and learned jointly with the invertible mapping. Considering that acquiring a complete training set for FlowTM is often impractical in many real-world networks, we further propose an enhanced model, FlowTM+, in this extended work. It incorporates an <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Inspector</i> module to mine deeper latent structures from the partially observed TM data and link load measurements. This new technique effectively compensates for unobservable information in the training data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlowTM improves the performance of the best baseline by 38%–58% when the actual routing matrix is absent. Remarkably, with only 2% of the training data, FlowTM+ achieves an estimation accuracy comparable to that of state-of-the-art baselines trained with full routing knowledge and complete training data."

    "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) environments generate large volumes of heterogeneous sensor data that remain difficult to exploit for process mining due to the absence of structured event logs with explicit case identifiers, activity labels, and semantic annotations. Bridging the gap between continuous sensor streams and process-level representations remains a major challenge for IoT-aware business process analysis. This paper introduces PRISMA (Physically-aware Reasoning and Intelligent Semantic Mining Architecture), an end-to-end framework for automatically discovering physically realistic business processes from raw IoT sensor data. PRISMA integrates three complementary components: (i) a neural transformation pipeline that converts heterogeneous sensor streams into structured event logs through adaptive parsing, temporal segmentation, activity recognition, and case identification; (ii) a semantic enrichment engine that augments events with IoT-aware business semantics using domain ontologies and neural language models; and (iii) a physics-aware discovery stage that enforces temporal, causal, and resource constraints during process model construction. PRISMA is evaluated on three real-world IoT datasets comprising 7.2 million events collected from 270 sensors across different application domains. Experimental results demonstrate that PRISMA achieves X% completeness, Y% semantic accuracy, and Z violations, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. These results show that PRISMA provides a <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">promising</b> unified approach for end-to-end IoT-aware process mining, with <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">future work needed to address deployment challenges</b> such as streaming scalability and concept drift."

However, those CD models are carefully designed for a specific fundamental task (BCD or SCD) and cannot achieve impressive progress in both BCD and SCD tasks simultaneously. In this paper, we designed a generalized architecture for both BCD and SCD tasks by investigating the common characteristics of these two tasks. In the feature extraction stage, a Multi-scale Attention Enhanced Encoder (MSAE) is introduced to extract global context and capture fine-grained features, which is beneficial for both BCD and SCD. In the training stage, a Change Detection Contrastive Learning Module (CDCL) is proposed to optimize feature distribution, improving the discriminative ability in distinguishing change regions and categories. To mitigate class imbalance issues in both BCD and SCD, we introduce Dynamic Rare-Aware Sampling for Change Detection (DRAS-CD), which dynamically prioritizes rare categories and enhances model robustness. Additionally, we collect the Yellow River Basin Semantic Change Detection dataset (YRSCD), which includes 13 change categories across diverse scenes with broad spatial and temporal coverage. Extensive experimental results on four public datasets (WHU-CD, LEVIR-CD, SECOND, Landsat-SCD) and YRSCD have shown superior performance in comparison to other state-of-the-art approaches, especially those based on the visual fundamental model, offering a generalized solution for both BCD and SCD tasks."

    "abstract": "Humans possess an innate ability to seamlessly coordinate movement across multiple limbs, whether driving a motor vehicle, playing a musical instrument, or performing other daily tasks. Here, supplemental sensory information, such as haptic feedback, can enhance this coordination in applications ranging from controlling teleoperated robots to prosthetic limbs and collaborative robotics. Yet, a critical gap remains in our understanding of how visual and haptic information are integrated within sensorimotor feedback systems, as well as the extent to which these sensory channels may serve as substitutes for one another. To address this gap, we conducted an experiment investigating how sensory feedback can be incorporated in a multi-limb coordination task. To determine the degree to which visual or haptic feedback dominates in multi-limb coordination, 25 participants performed a virtual cursor-to-target task using both upper limbs (via a joystick controller) and one lower limb (via a foot pedal controller). Throughout the task, we systematically manipulated visual and haptic feedback, using a vibrotactile haptic feedback algorithm that delivered task-relevant information to all three limbs. We assessed participants' task performance measures relating to trial success rates, completion times, ability to move their limbs in coordination, and overall movement efficiency. Additionally, participants completed a cognitive workload questionnaire to evaluate their perceived task difficulty level and cognitive demands. Our findings indicate that haptic feedback can effectively substitute for one degree of visual information (cursor movement along one axis). We found no significant difference between conditions where all visual cues were presented in the task and the condition where one aspect of visual feedback was replaced by haptic feedback. These results suggest that haptic feedback can, to an extent, serve as a viable alternative to visual feedback in multi-limb coordination tasks."

To address this challenge, we propose WiSACL, a novel Wi-Fi-based gesture recognition framework that integrates innovative CSI signal processing with advanced subdomain adaptation techniques. We propose a novel Wi-Fi CSI phase difference representation that suppresses the environmental noise and highlights the motion features via phase ratio computation, wavelet denoising, and temporal differencing, which are then encoded into discriminative image representations for enhanced gesture recognition. Building upon this robust signal representation, we develop an Adaptive Distributioncalibrated Pseudo-Label (ADPL) module that progressively refines target labels through subdomain distribution alignment and confidence-aware selection. To fully exploit these pseudo-labels while mitigating the adverse effects of domain shift and label noise, we further introduce a contrastive learning (CL) model that explicitly enhances intra-class compactness and inter-class separation in the feature space. Extensive experiments on the Widar3.0 dataset demonstrate that WiSACL achieves an average accuracy of 98.62% across cross-location, cross-orientation, and cross-environment scenarios, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods and validating the effectiveness of our approach for robust cross-domain wireless gesture recognition."

    "abstract": "Elevator systems require robust operation monitoring to ensure safety, performance, and effective fault detection, particularly in environments where sensor configurations may evolve over time. Traditional approaches often rely heavily on expert knowledge and rule-based systems, limiting scalability and responsiveness. With the advent of IoT technologies, real-time data collection and intelligent fault analysis have become both feasible and effective. To address these limitations, we present ElevatorTalk-M, an IoT-based elevator operation monitoring system that introduces a novel finite state machine (FSM)-based framework capable of dynamically generating operational models for arbitrary sensor configurations. Building on the earlier ElevatorTalk platform, ElevatorTalk-M enables sensors to be added or removed transparently while maintaining accurate and consistent operational modeling, a capability that is not available in existing smart elevator solutions and is particularly beneficial for legacy elevators. Experimental results show that all door obstruction events are successfully detected with an average detection time of 0.1 seconds. We further provide a formal correctness proof of the proposed fault detection algorithm. By integrating an auxiliary vibration sensor, the system can significantly enhance detection reliability, reducing the detection error from 0.18% to 0.0054%. These results demonstrate that ElevatorTalk-M offers a scalable, interpretable, and resilient solution that reduces reliance on domain experts while improving real-time elevator operation monitoring."

    "abstract": "Semantic communication is a paradigm shift in wireless systems that transmits semantic information, such as intent, context, and meaning, instead of raw data to reduce redundant data. At its core, semantic knowledge bases (SKBs) store and organize the contextual knowledge required for accurate encoding, decoding, and reasoning over semantic information. Recently, large language models (LLMs), pretrained on massive and diverse text corpora, have been integrated into SKBs to generate high-quality semantic embeddings, enable zero-shot retrieval of relevant knowledge, and support complex inference tasks across a wide range of domains. However, since the training corpus of LLM may include outdated, malicious, or privacy-sensitive content, LLM-enabled SKBs should be updated efficiently and verifiably to remove specific data without retraining from scratch. In this article, we first conduct a survey on related works and then propose a model-agnostic proof of unlearning framework for LLM-driven SKBs in semantic communications. Specifically, we track the evolution of the unlearning process by measuring drifts in the LoRA adapter subspace. We then execute successive reverse steps and generate the proof trace that a verifier can compare to provide a quantitative and verifiable unlearning guarantee. Finally, experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework."

    "abstract": "As automated classification systems become increasingly prevalent, concerns have emerged over their potential to reinforce and amplify existing societal biases. In the light of this issue, many methods have been proposed to enhance the fairness guarantees of classifiers. Most of the existing interventions assume access to group information for all instances, a requirement rarely met in practice. Fairness without access to demographic information has often been approached through robust optimization techniques, which target worst-case outcomes over a set of plausible distributions known as the uncertainty set. However, their effectiveness is strongly influenced by the chosen uncertainty set. In fact, existing approaches often overemphasize outliers or overly pessimistic scenarios, compromising both overall performance and fairness. To overcome these limitations, we introduce <monospace xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">SPECTRE</monospace>, a minimax-fair method that adjusts the spectrum of a simple Fourier feature mapping and constrains the extent to which the worst-case distribution can deviate from the empirical distribution. We perform extensive experiments on the American Community Survey datasets involving 20 states. The safeness of <monospace xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">SPECTRE</monospace> comes as it provides the highest average values on fairness guarantees together with the smallest interquartile range in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches, even compared to those with access to demographic group information. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis that derives computable bounds on the worst-case error for both individual groups and the overall population, as well as characterizes the worst-case distributions responsible for these extremal performances."

    "abstract": "Transfer-based adversarial attacks are key for evaluating the robustness of deep neural networks (DNNs) in black-box settings, yet their effectiveness is often constrained by limited cross-model transferability. Existing feature-level approaches typically rely on single-layer attention guidance or static perturbation patterns, which restrict adaptability across diverse architectures. In this work, we introduce a unified adversarial framework, named Multi-layer Attention-guided Spatial Transformations (MAT), to exploit class-discriminative cues from multiple feature layers to craft highly transferable adversarial examples. MAT integrates Multi-layer Attention Fusion (MAF) to capture complementary low-level and high-level semantics from multiple intermediate layers, Attention-guided Augmentation (AGA) to selectively perturb non-critical regions while preserving semantic integrity, and Spatial Random Transformation (SRT) to introduce stochastic spatial augmentations to diversify patterns during optimization. Unlike prior methods that use static or layer-specific attention, MAT dynamically adapts feature guidance to the architecture and task, which enhances generalization. We evaluate MAT against eleven state-of-the-art (SOTA) transfer-based attacks across nine CNN-based and Transformer-based architectures on ImageNet. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MAT consistently outperforms eleven state-of-the-art transfer-based attacks in both white-box and black-box settings, including against adversarially trained and input preprocessing-based defensive models, while maintaining higher semantic similarity to the original inputs. It highlights the superior adversarial robustness and excellent adaptability of MAT in adversarial machine learning.

    "abstract": "Coverage path planning is a critical problem in multi-UAV systems for daily inspection and patrol missions, requiring coordinated movements of UAVs along predetermined trajectories to cover the entire map. Existing methods are often inadequate in considering both workload balance and motion efficiency during task assignment, resulting in imbalanced coverage areas or unnecessary turning maneuvers. To address these limitations, this paper presents a hierarchical structure that integrates spatial decomposition, balanced task assignment through graph partitioning, and turn-aware trajectory planning. The approach follows three key steps: first, spatial decomposition partitions the map into subregions; second, the partitioned map is transformed into a weighted graph, where task assignment distribution is optimized by iteratively migrating and swapping nodes among subgraphs while preserving connectivity, ensuring a balanced workload distribution across UAVs. Finally, trajectory planning incorporates turn optimization to reduce completion time. The results show that our method ensures even task assignment among UAVs, fewer turns, faster task completion, and lower computation time compared to other popular algorithms."

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving technology, ensuring vehicle safety and robust perception in real time, particularly for obstacle detection under adverse conditions such as fog or haze, has become increasingly imperative. In this paper, we propose a Lightweight Adaptive Camera–Radar Fusion (LACRF) framework for context-aware obstacle detection, which enhances the detection of small and long-range objects in fog–haze environments while remaining effective under clean weather conditions. LACRF employs GhostNetV2 as a lightweight backbone and incorporates a Gated Attention Fusion (GAF) mechanism to adaptively regulate modality dependencies through pre-gate and post-gate strategies. This design effectively suppresses noise from low-quality sensor inputs and enhances overall robustness. Furthermore, we introduce a Dynamic Routing Defogging (DRD) module that adapts to changing environmental conditions by selectively activating or bypassing the defogging process based on predicted haze scores, thereby reducing unnecessary computation and inference latency in clear-weather scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 92.8% on the DENSE dataset and 96.3% on the self-constructed Foggy Dataset with real-time inference speed. This enhancement in performance, when compared with conventional methodologies, offers a robust and efficient solution for context-aware obstacle detection in adverse weather conditions."

Despite remarkable progress, most sensor-based HAR models struggle with subject variability, sensor orientation shifts, and limited computational resources on wearable devices. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel HAR framework that combines a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) for adaptive refinement of channel-wise and temporal representations, a light Mamba-based state-space module for efficient modeling of long-range temporal dependencies, and a context-aware prototype classifier. The classifier dynamically adjusts class prototypes according to the input context, yielding adaptive classifications with prototype-based interpretability. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets—UCI-HAR, WISDM, PAMAP2, USC-HAD, and MHEALTH—demonstrate competitive performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods, particularly excelling in efficiency. Our method achieves 99.3% accuracy with 0.48M parameters and approximately 4.6 ms inference latency, demonstrating a superior accuracy–efficiency trade-off compared to recent CNN-, Transformer-, and Mamba-based approaches. We further validate real-time on-device feasibility via Raspberry Pi deployment, confirming practicality on resource-constrained edge platforms. These findings indicate that the proposed model is computationally efficient, robust to inter-subject variability, and well-suited for real-world IoT applications requiring reliable and explainable activity recognition."

    "abstract": "This study investigates the identification of leakage in mineral air-supply pipelines using vibration signals. To address the issue of severe environmental noise and high signal dimensionality, a unified framework integrating joint denoising, feature selection, and leakage-type identification is proposed. First, the dung beetle optimization (DBO) algorithm adaptively tunes the parameters of variational mode decomposition (VMD) to achieve effective signal decomposition. The resulting modes are grouped by energy and kurtosis into transient leakage modes and major/minor sustained-leakage modes. An improved wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) is then applied to denoise the minor modes, which are reconstructed with the remaining modes to obtain a clean signal. Next, a wrapper feature selection method based on an improved binary DBO (IBDBO) is introduced. The Bernoulli map and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) are used to initialize an elite population, and a grey wolf optimization mechanism is incorporated to avoid premature convergence. Finally, the selected features are fed into a random forest to identify the types of leakage. Experiments show that the proposed method achieves an average accuracy of 95.68% with only 4.35 selected features on average, effectively improving leakage identification while reducing the number of features."

By leveraging the ultra-fast code-switching capability of information metasurfaces, we formulate the video imaging problem as a joint multi-frame super-resolution reconstruction task. Furthermore, by exploiting the temporal correlation of the background and the sparsity of dynamic variation across multiple frames, we introduce a low-rank and sparse decomposition with inter-frame smoothness model for the super-resolution reconstruction. An effective algorithm based on the proximal gradient method is developed to solve the proposed model, enabling high-resolution imaging of dynamic and non-sparse scenes.

In almost electric vehicles, a bidirectional DC–DC converter is employed to regulate the high-voltage DC bus at a constant level. In this study, a bidirectional buck–boost converter is used to maintain the high-voltage DC bus voltage at 800 V. Two controller design approaches are investigated: the conventional method and an AI-based optimization using the adaptive Tabu search (ATS) algorithm. In the proposed ATS framework, a control signal penalty condition is integrated into the objective function to ensure that the designed controller parameters can be implemented in practice without control signal saturation. After the optimal controller parameters are obtained, the system performance is evaluated through simulations using SimPowerSystems® and Hardware-in-Loop testing. The results can confirm that the ATS-based controller achieves better overall performance compared with the conventionally designed controller. Furthermore, additional simulation scenarios not used during the ATS optimization process verify that the proposed controller maintains the high-voltage DC bus compliance with ISO 21498-1 and ISO 21498-2 standards."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel path-tracking controller for vehicle–trailer systems that adapts to variations in trailer specifications and loading conditions without relying on trailer-side sensors. The proposed controller determines the desired steering angle using a yaw-rate-gain adaptive scheme that estimates the steering-to-yaw dynamics of the towing vehicle in real time. To account for trailer-induced effects, a disturbance observer estimates the lateral hitch force using only the vehicle’s yaw rate and speed, while incorporating real-time trailer mass estimation and rear-tire cornering-stiffness scheduling. The estimated hitch force is then used to generate a compensatory steering input that suppresses sway-induced yaw motion, which is selectively activated based on a yaw-rate safety boundary derived from phase-plane analysis and implemented through a finite-state-machine logic. Co-simulation experiments using CarMaker and MATLAB/Simulink demonstrate that the proposed controller achieves accurate and stable path tracking across diverse trailer conditions, including different payloads and driving speeds. The adaptive structure enables robust performance without prior trailer information, while the selective sway suppression strategy effectively mitigates oscillatory yaw responses without degrading path-tracking accuracy."

Recently, some MMIF methods incorporate frequency domain information to enhance spatial features. However, these methods typically rely on simple serial or parallel spatial-frequency fusion without interaction. In this paper, we propose a novel Interactive Spatial-Frequency Fusion Mamba (ISFM) framework for MMIF. Specifically, we begin with a Modality-Specific Extractor (MSE) to extract features from different modalities. It models long-range dependencies across the image with linear computational complexity. To effectively leverage frequency information, we then propose a Multi-scale Frequency Fusion (MFF). It adaptively integrates low-frequency and high-frequency components across multiple scales, enabling robust representations of frequency features. More importantly, we further propose an Interactive Spatial-Frequency Fusion (ISF). It incorporates frequency features to guide spatial features across modalities, enhancing complementary representations. Extensive experiments are conducted on six MMIF datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our ISFM can achieve better performances than other state-of-the-art methods. The source code is available at https://github.com/Namn23/ISFM."

However, the integrated collaboration of perception, communication, and computation within V2I system remains a critical challenge. To address it, we propose a Software-Defined Network (SDN)-based collaborative approach for Autonomous Vehicle and Road Infrastructure Network (AVRIN). The architecture designates road infrastructures as road nodes and autonomous vehicles as dynamic vehicle nodes, establishing AVRIN through SDN. The control plane dynamically maintains global network topology and distributed flow tables by continuously evaluating node accessibility, while the forwarding plane is responsible for packet transmission via the OpenFlow protocol. In the perception module, road nodes divide the perception range into spatial units, whereas vehicle nodes dynamically align these units with their drivable areas across temporal sequences. Through coordinated communication and computation modules, road nodes strategically allocate dedicated bandwidth and computational resources. Building on this approach, we develop a particle swarm-based multi-objective optimization algorithm to achieve balanced co-optimization across perception, communication, and computation. Experimental validation demonstrates its superior collaborative Bird's Eye View (BEV) detection performance on the V2X-Sim 2.0 dataset, outperforming existing approaches by 10.37% in mean Average Precision. Furthermore, evaluations on the newly collected Jiading dataset, from a real-world urban roadway, confirm the approach's robustness with 1.823-second computation time under dynamic network conditions."

Nevertheless, these systems are also very prone to various impairments which include laser phase noise, polarization mode dispersion and nonlinear impairments, and proper fault detection is therefore an important activity in ensuring reliable transmission. Conventional methods of monitoring are based on optical performance monitoring(OPM) parameters or on a modelbased approach that may fail in non-linear or dynamical operating features. The proposed paper introduces using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as an artificial intelligence (AI)-based system fault detector of coherent optical systems. The presented approach makes use of eye diagrams, constellation diagrams, and time-series as the inputs to CNNs which allows automatic extraction of features and classification of the fault states. In simulation experiments with different signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), modulation formats and fiber impairments, the proposed CNNbased fault detection is shown to have over 96 percent classification accuracy, which is better than support vector machines (SVMs) and shallow neural networks. The findings indicate that deep learning can be used to facilitate intelligent fault-tolerant coherent systems, which establishes the path to autonomous optical networks (AONs)."

This paper revisits the problem from a unified electromagnetic–hydrodynamic perspective. We first recall the local Drude picture and its gated/ungated dispersions. We then couple a hydrodynamic 2DEG to the device electrostatics, obtaining a closed dispersion that includes drift, relaxation, pressure, and viscosity. Time-domain simulations with DS boundary conditions confirm growth above a drift threshold and clarify why the fundamental cavity frequency decreases with drift even though the forward eigen-branch hardens.

    "abstract": "To address the problems of localization drift and unstable flight performance of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in GPS-denied environments, this paper proposes an autonomous navigation framework based on Adaptive-Weighted Extended Kalman Filtering (AW-EKF) and tightly coupled LiDAR–IMU fusion. The system employs an open-source Pixhawk flight controller and a Livox Mid-360 LiDAR, and establishes a real-time perception–fusion–control loop through sensor clock synchronization, point-cloud distortion compensation, sliding-window feature optimization, and adaptive gain feedforward control. The proposed AW-EKF introduces a time-varying covariance adjustment mechanism that dynamically adapts to changes in feature availability and IMU noise, significantly enhancing robustness in complex indoor environments with low illumination, strong reflections, and sparse textures. Meanwhile, the adaptive feedforward controller adjusts control gains based on error energy, enabling improved attitude stability and smoother transitions under nonlinear disturbances. Experiments conducted in a 10 × 8 × 3 m indoor environment demonstrate centimeter-level navigation performance, achieving an average hovering error of 0.0341 m, a path deviation of 0.0346 m, and a closed-loop mapping error below 0.05 m. The results indicate that the AW-EKF and LiDAR–IMU tight-coupling framework ensures highly reliable localization, stable flight control, and strong environmental adaptability.

Addressing the insufficient treatment of load-imbalance effects in existing data-driven methods and the limitations of using three- phase currents as inputs, this paper proposes an online detection method for unbalanced loads based on an Isolation Forest. The method takes the q-axis current, q-axis current reference, and rotor speed as inputs, and builds a cascaded feature-extraction pipeline. Frequency-domain features are obtained from the q-axis current and its tracking error, an Isolation Forest model is trained offline, and the model is validated with both normal and abnormal samples. Finally, online tests on a laboratory platform under normal operation and multiple levels of load imbalance demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

Taking electrochemical energy storage projects as the empirical subject, the study first employs the Best-Worst Method (BWM) to identify critical risk factors, establishing a risk assessment indicator system encompassing four dimensions: commercial, policy, technical, and operational. Subsequently, precise quantitative formulas are innovatively designed for each risk indicator to calculate its impact level. Combined with the probability of risk occurrence, a comprehensive risk rating is ultimately determined through the risk matrix. Empirical analysis indicates the project's comprehensive risk value stands at ¥ 54.717 million, categorised as ‘low risk’. Key risks identified include capacity leasing revenue, revenue recovery from curtailed wind and solar power, and capacity tariff risks.

Data were simultaneously collected from 15 healthy participants using the wet g.Nautilus fNIRS-8 Research Headset during controlled taste sessions.The dataset was formed from 100 trials, each lasting 10 seconds, segmented into overlapping windows, resulting in 544 segments of 1000 time steps by 16 channels. Labels were one- hot encoded for classification. The preprocessed data were used to train and evaluate two deep learning models— a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network and a Transformer encoder—designed to capture temporal and contextual features in the brain signals. Experimental results showed the Transformer model achieving 88% validation accuracy, while the BiLSTM reached 72%, demonstrating the power of deep sequence learning for BCI-based taste classification.

    "abstract": "With the growing integration of renewable energy into power systems, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of energy data has become increasingly crucial. However, deviations and limit violations in time-series data, such as those in solar power generation, can adversely affect grid stability and reduce forecasting accuracy. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel hybrid method for correcting limit-violating data in renewable energy time-series prediction. The approach combines Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and the Informer model to enhance prediction accuracy and identify anomalous data points. Specifically, both models are employed to capture long-term dependencies, with the attention mechanism in Informer improving the efficiency and precision of long-sequence prediction. By lever-aging the complementary strengths of LSTM and Informer, the proposed framework achieves superior predictive performance. A data correction mechanism is then applied to adjust values that applied to ajust values exceeding predefined thresholds, ensuring compliance with operational constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that the LSTM-Informer hybrid model outperforms individual models in prediction accuracy and effectively corrects limit-violating data points. This approach provides a reliable solution for enhancing the quality of renewable energy data, supporting better grid management and decision-making."

Empirical studies on benchmark wind-power datasets show that DTrans significantly outperforms mainstream baselines in MAE, RMSE and R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> and achieves a 38.27% relative improvement in trend-consistency metrics, thereby offering a theoretically grounded and practically deployable solution to this enduring problem in renewable-energy forecasting."

    "abstract": "Visual odometry (VO) is a critical component of autonomous robot systems, enabling precise pose estimation from visual inputs. Learning-based VO methods are increasingly recognized for their robustness in challenging scenarios, including dynamic environments, motion blur, and low-light conditions. However, their performance is constrained by both the diversity of the data and its utilization rate. To overcome these limitations, we propose an end-to-end monocular VO system incorporating a novel learning-based end-to-end VO framework and multiple analogy augmentation strategies. We introduce the Context Attention Uncertainty-aware VO Network (CUVO), which prioritizes semantically rich regions and mitigating interference from high-uncertainty areas to enhance attentional focus and pose estimation accuracy. Furthermore, our analogy augmentation methods—temporal reversal, random rotation, and geometric mirroring—enhance image pairs and compute corresponding true pose transformations, significantly increasing training data quantity and diversity. Simultaneously, an analogous loss is applied to ensure consistency between the original and augmented data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CUVO significantly enhances VO performance, outperforming previous end-to-end VO methods on TartanAir and KITTI datasets. By leveraging analogy augmentation strategy to expand training data under limited data conditions (27k), zero-shot capability of CUVO degrades by up to 29.5% on TartanAir and 23.3% on KITTI. Our work introduces the first image-to-pose data augmentation method tailored for VO and establishes CUVO as a robust system for advancing learning-based visual odometry."

    "abstract": "While conventional optical fiber humidity sensors offer high sensitivity and stability, their size limits their application in narrow spaces. To overcome the limitation, this paper presents an ultra-compact fiber humidity sensor fabricated via 3D printing. It integrates a monolithic dual Fabry–Perot (F–P) microcavity structure at the tip of a twin-core fiber (TCF). The sensor utilizes a low humidity-sensitive photopolymer to form the structural frame and the reference cavity(A) and utilizes a humidity-sensitive hydrogel to act as the sensing layer in the sensing cavity(B). Humidity changes cause significant deformation of the hydrogel, resulting in a much greater change in the cavity length of cavity B compared to cavity A. By precisely controlling the cavity lengths to 43 μm (Cavity A) and 39.5 μm (Cavity B), the sensor can harness the Vernier effect to achieve a significant sensitivity enhancement. Experimental results demonstrate a high sensitivity of -4.056 nm/%RH over a relative humidity (RH) range of 32.8% to 85.1%. Furthermore, the sensor also exhibits a temperature sensitivity of -0.35 nm/°C, with response times of 508 ms and 583 ms during humidification and dehumidification processes, respectively. This work provides a practical solution for high-sensitivity gaseous humidity detection in narrow and confined spaces."

    "abstract": "Hamilton-Jacobi reachability (HJR) provides a value function that encodes the set of states from which a system with bounded control inputs can reach or avoid a target despite any bounded disturbance, and the corresponding robust, optimal control policy. Though powerful, traditional methods for HJR rely on dynamic programming (DP) and suffer from exponential computation growth with respect to state dimension. The recently favored Hopf formula mitigates this “curse of dimensionality” by providing an efficient and pointwise approach for solving the reachability problem. However, the Hopf formula can only be applied to linear time-varying systems. To overcome this limitation, we show that the error between a nonlinear system and a linear model can be transformed into an adversarial bounded artificial disturbance. One may then solve the dimension-robust generalized Hopf formula for a linear game with this “antagonistic error” to perform guaranteed conservative reachability analysis and control synthesis of nonlinear systems; this can be done for problem formulations in which no other HJR method is both computationally feasible and guaranteed. In addition, we offer several technical methods for reducing conservativeness in the analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our results through one illustrative example (the controlled Van der Pol system) that can be compared to standard DP, and one higher-dimensional 15D example (a 5-agent pursuit-evasion game with Dubins cars)."

After analyzing system behavior under such attacks based on discrete event systems, we focus on identifying malicious modifications on each event. In particular, we formalize the concept of modification identifiability under attacks, which indicates whether any modification can be uniquely identified in finite observations. Its verification problem is addressed by developing a novel state estimator."

    "abstract": "The integration of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) and simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) present a promising solution for sustainable and efficient wireless communications in large-scale IoT networks, especially within energy-constrained smart agriculture applications. However, most existing works assume ideal energy harvesting (EH) models and continuous RIS phase shifts that limit their practical relevance. This paper addresses these limitations by proposing a total transmit power minimization framework for a multi-user RIS-assisted MISO power-splitting (PS) SWIPT system. First, a practical logistic non-linear energy harvesting (NL-EH) model is adopted to better reflect the realistic behavior of RF energy conversion circuits. Second, a discrete phase shift (DPS) model with finite quantization levels is employed to account for practical RIS hardware constraints. Third, an alternating optimization algorithm is developed for the resulting non-convex optimization problem through joint optimization of the base station’s beamforming vectors, RIS reflection matrix, and PS ratio. Techniques such as Zero-Forcing (ZF), Semidefinite Relaxation (SDR), and Gaussian randomization (GR) are leveraged to address the associated sub-problems, while an alternate one-dimensional search strategy is used for RIS phase shift optimization. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to validate the proposed framework in terms of performance and convergence. The results demonstrate robustness under imperfect channel state information (ICSI) and varying system parameters for next-generation IoT-enabled smart farming use-case."

    "abstract": "As mobile communication networks continue to scale, energy-saving optimization for base stations is increasingly constrained by the need for fine-grained, timely decision-making under complex and dynamic operating conditions. In practical deployments, the effectiveness and stability of existing energy-saving strategies are primarily limited by two factors: (i) the lack of high-precision and frequently updated base station scene labels that accurately reflect heterogeneous service environments, and (ii) the prohibitive computational cost of modeling complete annual traffic patterns for large-scale networks, which forces most solutions to rely on short-term or sampled data, thereby weakening their ability to capture long-term traffic regularities. The combination of these issues restricts achievable energy-saving depth and undermines operational stability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a scenario-aware energy-saving optimization framework that integrates semantic scene perception with long-term spatio-temporal traffic modeling. First, fine-grained and dynamically updated scene labels are generated through the fusion of natural language processing on configuration texts and cloud-based geographic map image recognition, enabling accurate characterization of base station service environments without manual annotation. Second, a GeoAutoformer-Transformer model is developed by embedding geographic-aware graph attention into a decompositionbased Transformer architecture, allowing the model to efficiently learn long-term temporal patterns and spatial dependencies among neighboring base stations while remaining computationally tractable for large-scale deployments. In addition, a masking mechanism is introduced to explicitly distinguish between normal zero-traffic intervals caused by energy-saving shutdowns and abnormal zero values resulting from data loss or transmission failures, thereby improving the robustness and reliability of traffic prediction and subsequent energy-saving decisions. Through jointly extending effective energy-saving durations and recommending more suitable energy-saving strategies for eligible base stations, the proposed framework achieves a 17–19% improvement in overall energy-saving efficiency. At the same time, more accurate scene perception and comprehensive traffic modeling contribute to more stable network excellence rates and reduced negative feedback, indicating improved operational reliability. Extensive experiments conducted on a large-scale real-world dataset comprising approximately 50,000 base stations from a nationwide commercial network demonstrate the effectiveness and general applicability of the proposed framework across diverse geographic regions and service scenarios."

    "abstract": "Short-term forecasting of traffic speeds is a foundational requirement for adaptive signal control, congestion mitigation, and emerging real-time digital twin infrastructures. Despite substantial progress, many deep learning approaches continue to experience difficulties in capturing long-range temporal behavior, handling non-stationary traffic conditions, and producing reliable measures of predictive uncertainty. To address these challenges, this work develops a four-stage hybrid spatio-temporal framework consisting of: (i) a graph-attention spatial encoder, (ii) a temporal Transformer module, (iii) a variational quantum fusion layer, and (iv) a conformal calibration component for uncertainty adjustment. In all our experiments we used the METR-LA benchmark which we did in order to maintain the like conditions for method and empiric study. In the put forth pipeline the Transformer which we introduced in Phase 2 does the best job in terms of point forecast accuracy, we see Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values of 3.46, 3.68, and 3.76 for the 5, 10 and 15 minute prediction horizons which is a 50% or greater improvement over the Spatial-Temporal Graph Attention Network (ST-GAT) base. In Phase 3 we looked at the quantumaugmented version which did see a small improvement at the short term horizon but as the time horizon increased we saw a slight drop in performance which we note is a common issue in present variational quantum circuits. Conformal calibration for uncertainty estimation produces prediction intervals with empirical coverage of 92.8%, significantly outperforming ensemble-based and Monte Carlo Dropout (MC-Dropout) methods. On an RTX-class Graphical Processing Unit (GPU), end-to-end inference takes about 150-250 ms, which is compatible with real-time operational requirements in intelligent transportation systems. A configuration with four attention heads, a one-hour historical input window, and a thirty-minute model update interval provides a workable trade-off between accuracy and computational cost, according to sensitivity analyses based on MAE and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) combined with latency monitoring. Overall, the findings show that the suggested framework facilitates accurate traffic speed forecasting with calibrated uncertainty, allowing for more timely and informed decision-making in urban mobility applications."

    "abstract": "While recent advancements have demonstrated remarkable progress in general 3D shape generation, the challenge of automatically generating wearable 3D assets remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we present BAG — a Body aligned Asset Generation method that produces 3D wearable assets which can be automatically fitted onto given 3D human bodies. This is achieved by controlling the 3D generation process using human body shape and pose information. Specifically, we first construct a general single-image-to-consistent-multi-view diffusion model, and train it on the large-scale Objaverse dataset to ensure diversity and generalizability. We then train a body conditioned multi-view ControlNet to guide the generator toward producing body-aligned multi-view images. The control signal leverages multi-view 2D projections of the target human body, where pixel values represent the XYZ coordinates of the body surface in a canonical space. The resulting body-conditioned multi-view diffusion outputs body-aligned images, which are subsequently fed into a native 3D diffusion model to reconstruct the 3D shape of the asset. Finally, we recover the similarity trans formation using multi-view silhouette supervision and mitigate asset-body penetration using physics-based simulation, ensuring accurate asset fitting onto the target body. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of prompt adherence, shape diversity, and shape quality."

    "abstract": "high precision servo systems, phase-locked loops (PLLs) with feedforward compensation can simultaneously ensure dynamic performance and steady-state accuracy in extracting the information of angular position and speed from sinusoidal signals. However, these composite PLLs can not effectively suppress the effect of measurement noise on the estimated speed and the estimation accuracy may be seriously deteriorated. In this paper, a noise reduction composite PLL is proposed for resolver-to-digital converters (RDCs) to prevent the measurement noise from polluting the estimated speed with higher comprehensive accuracy. The proposed method consists of two tracking loops. The main loop adopts a noise reduction PLL (NRPLL) to track the angular position in resolver signals and output angular speed with enhanced noise immunity and high steady-state accuracy. The secondary loop adopts an angle-tracking observer (ATO) to generate feedforward speed since it can effectively suppress measurement noise in estimating speed. Thus, the proposed method combines the advantages of NRPLL and ATO in noise reduction and also can improve dynamic performance and steady-state accuracy by using feedforward. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "Prediction accuracy of a kinematic model is critical for offline compensation of volumetric errors of a six-axis robotic manipulator. Numerous scholars have employed kinematic models incorporating Denavit-Hartenberg (D-H) errors for offline compensation, and some have studied their enhancements by integrating stiffness parameters of rotary axes. However, previous works primarily focused on predicting deviations resulting from posture changes within the rotary plane. This article proposes a novel modeling scheme capable of capturing deviations both within and outside the rotary plane. A key idea is that, instead of explicitly measuring the 6 DOF stiffness parameters, the end effector trajectory is measured to quantify the position and orientation of the rotary axis average line, varied due to the posture of downstream axes, which are parameterized as posture-dependent D-H errors and posture-dependent angular positioning deviations. Measurement for the calibration of posture-dependent errors can be completed within one hour. A case study shows that the proposed posture-dependent kinematic model can significantly improve the prediction accuracy by over 36%, highlighting the importance of including posture-dependent errors."

Therefore, a comprehensive energy optimization scheduling method for carbon neutral energy storage based on time series is proposed. The integrated energy system includes energy input, conversion, and energy storage equipment. Under the assumption of steady state and without considering line losses, an energy hub state model is constructed. Using time series linear analysis to process data, calculate the slope of the characteristic curve to obtain the frequency change, and then analyze the frequency modulation characteristics. Construct an optimization scheduling model with the optimization objectives of meeting user electricity and heat load demands, achieving carbon emission reduction targets, and minimizing total system operating costs. The experimental results show that the proposed method has a large actual output of wind power during low load periods (such as 01:00-05:00), with a total cost of 2157209 yuan, achieving zero wind and solar power curtailment, and the fluctuation rate of interconnection line interaction power is less than 5%. And through energy storage, peak shaving, valley filling, and full absorption of wind and solar energy, fossil energy consumption can be reduced, system carbon emissions can be lowered, and technical support can be provided for the transformation of comprehensive energy systems towards carbon neutrality."

Behavioral sequence analysis provides a new way to overcome the limits of static assessments. It captures how technology is used dynamically in smart classrooms and how it supports students' core competencies. This method is particularly well-suited for the in-depth inquiry required in the high school physics curriculum. This study utilizes LSA to analyze five video recordings of high school physics lessons from the Zhejiang Provincial Teaching and Research Network. By constructing an event-reason graph of technological application behaviors, the research aims to unveil the dynamic logic of teacher-student interactions and evaluate teachers' information technology application competence. The findings indicate that while teachers demonstrate strong capabilities in the knowledge transmission phase, deficiencies exist in the cultivation of core competencies. Specifically, the analysis reveals: a disconnect between the introduction of technology and the stimulation of students' problem-awareness; an imbalance between collaborative support and the depth of inquiry; a gap between knowledge integration and interactive thinking; and a rupture between contextual application and innovative practice. In response to the issues mentioned above, this study further proposes the specific teaching strategies of problem-based inquiry, inquiry scaffolding, thinking visualization, and project-based practice. This research reveals the intrinsic connections between the sequences of technology-supported behaviors, specific teaching stages, and the development of student competencies. It provides empirical support for guiding high school physics teachers toward more profound instructional design, thereby transforming technology from a mere tool into a foundational support for student competency development."

    "abstract": "Space motor windings commonly utilize polyimide (PI) as an insulating material. In the extreme conditions of space, continuous exposure to reactive species can degrade the insulating properties of polyimide, potentially leading to insulation failures in space motors. Currently, research into the failure mechanisms and mitigation strategies of polyimide under atomic oxygen (AO) erosion in extreme space environments remains insufficiently explored. To investigate the degradation mechanisms of polyimide solid insulation materials under the bombardment of atomic oxygen in the presence of an electric field, molecular dynamics simulations were employed to model the erosion process of polyimide subjected to AO.This study, utilizing molecular dynamics, examines the degradation characteristics of polyimide at the nanoscale under atomic oxygen erosion. Simulations were conducted using Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS) in conjunction with the ReaxFF reactive force field, where AO with an energy of 5 eV was directed at the polyimide. Based on the oxidation reaction mechanisms, the reaction processes and changes in material mass were analyzed. The erosion results indicate that the polyimide undergoes rapid cleavage during the AO erosion process, leading to a significant decrease in molecular mass and a deterioration of its insulating properties. Furthermore, the study reveals that the extent of damage to polyimide increases with higher electric field strengths, resulting in greater mass loss and a more severe reduction in breakdown field strength."

    "abstract": "Remote sensing of objects in remote locations with poor geographical topography entails the need to employ credible, high capacity, information exchange as well as employing communication infrastructure using energy efficient network equipment. This paper suggests a hybrid network design that will utilize both free as well as space optical (FSO) communications and satellite networks to eliminate these constraints. The hybrid architecture takes advantage of fast FSO network and satellite fragments in order to form a large communication area in different unfavorable weather conditions so that the transmission and reception of communication signals can remain stable at a distance throughout the entire chain during remote monitoring. Performance indicators were used to test the reliability of the proposal and these include channel bandwidth, communication-signal delay time, packet delivery rate, bit error rate, and signal-to-noise ratio. The SNR or BER model was used to evaluate the state of communication channel (fading, FSPL and AWGN) of each packet transmitted and the likelihood of a successful delivery of a packet based on the simulation study results conducted using Matlab."

    "abstract": "Against the backdrop of a high proportion of new energy sources being connected and the widespread application of flexible loads, the volatility in low-voltage distribution substation areas has significantly increased, posing new challenges to the stability of the power grid. To address this issue, this study proposes an enhancement strategy for the supply capability of transformer substations based on mobile resources, aiming to enhance the resilience of the distribution system. Firstly, a road network mobility model considering road connectivity and traffic congestion conditions was constructed. Subsequently, detailed constraints were applied to the energy characteristics of diversified mobile modular equipment, such as mobile energy storage systems and electric vehicles. Furthermore, by synergistically optimizing the mobile device movement model within the road network and the power grid flow model, a novel distribution system resilience enhancement model has been developed. This model aims to effectively utilize mobile resources to enhance the supply capacity of substations. The verification results demonstrate that through the collaborative optimization of multiple mobile modular devices, the resilience of the distribution system is significantly enhanced, effectively alleviating the overload pressure on substations caused by distribution line faults and substantially reducing post-disaster recovery time."

    "abstract": "Modern information systems face persistent threats wherein adversaries often remain undetected for extended periods, with average breach costs exceeding USD 4.88 million and containment times surpassing 200 days across industries [1], [2]. Existing Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), and Security Orchestration, Automation and Response (SOAR) solutions improve visibility yet exhibit weak linkage between detection and mitigation, prolonging dwell time. This paper presents the Detection-to-Action (D2A) Framework, a concept-based architecture that integrates hybrid detection—signatures for known threats and anomaly analysis for unknown behaviors—with tiered, default-safe mitigation playbooks and a continuous feedback loop. Evaluation in a simulated enterprise environment of 200 users and 20 servers demonstrated 92% detection accuracy, a 35% reduction in false positives, and containment time improvement from over 200 minutes to approximately 10 minutes. By bridging detection and response within existing infrastructures, D2A enables measurable reductions in dwell time and establishes a scalable, auditable path toward proactive cybersecurity operations [3], [4]."

    "abstract": "The use of adaptive technology to support and promote teaching and learning has always been a concern in modern educational research and practice. The update of curriculum standards oriented by core competences in disciplines and the development of digital intelligent technology provide reasons and opportunities for the design update and technological upgrade of adaptive systems in educational applications, and also make their application effects more scientific, dynamic, and humanized. To further explore the teaching effectiveness of the new intelligent adaptive system, this study applied it to primary school mathematics teaching. It analyzed the changes in students' mathematics scores and core competences in mathematics through experimental comparison. 170 fifth-grade students participated in the one-year research project. The study adopted a quasi-experimental method with two groups to observe the impact of the intelligent adaptive system on students' mathematics scores. And it used an interrupted time-series method to test its effectiveness on students' core competences in mathematics. The results show that: (1) the application of the intelligent adaptive system can improve the mathematics scores of middle - level students, t(115) = - 2.284, p<0.05; (2) after using the intelligent adaptive system, the change in students' core competences in mathematics is significant, in which the system usage time in the first semester can explain the variance by 21.5% (R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> = 0.215, F(1,232) = 63.375, p<0.001), and the system usage time in the second semester can explain the variance by 89.7% (R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> = 0.897, F(1,233) = 2021.555, p<0.001). The study provides empirical support for the promotion of the intelligent adaptive system in mathematics teaching and an operational framework for its practical application, which is of great practical significance and value for promoting the digital and intelligent transformation of education."

This situation renders traditional fault location methods less effective. Therefore, regarding the issue of fault section location in distribution networks containing DG, this paper puts forward a fault location method based on an improved binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) algorithm. A mathematical model of the fault section in the distribution network is constructed. Moreover, simulations are carried out in the IEEE 33 - node system for scenarios including single faults, multiple faults, and cases where location information is distorted in distribution lines. These simulations verify the rapidity and accuracy of the proposed algorithm."

The analysis examines ultrasonic propagation under varying axial stress states. A 7-bit Barker-coded sinusoid is used as the electromagnetic ultrasonic excitation current, and the echoes are processed by pulse compression. Compared with windowed-sine excitation, the method increases the signal-to-noise ratio by 10 dB and enables rapid, non-contact stress measurement in bolts."

This paper offers a comprehensive analysis that links blockchain’s foundational attributes—pseudonymity, immutability, and global accessibility—to observable misuse patterns, organizes the principal threat modes with empirical evidence, and evaluates mitigation across regulatory controls, technological advances, decentralized countermeasures, and industry practices. Building on comparative insights from federated learning, decentralized identity, and distributed storage, the paper then introduces the Cross-Domain Adaptive Mitigation Framework (CDAMF), a layered, privacy-preserving approach that combines reputation-backed accountability, anomaly-driven adaptive guardrails, and parametric backstops with community adjudication, with a feedback loop that updates reputations, thresholds, and models over time. An integrated architecture and event-time algorithm are presented to operationalize CDAMF while preserving decentralization. Together, the survey and framework provide a practical pathway to balance innovation, privacy, and security, strengthening trust, interoperability, and resilience in cryptocurrency ecosystems."

    "abstract": "This systematic review synthesizes evidence on the characteristics and effectiveness of adaptive learning systems in K-12 education. A total of 30 peer-reviewed empirical studies published between 2018 and 2024 were analyzed following PRISMA guidelines. Findings indicate that most research focuses on secondary education, particularly mathematics. Methodologically, quantitative or quasi-experimental methods are prioritized to measure students' academic achievement, engagement, and skills development. However, while adaptive learning technologies show positive effects, significant gaps include lacking sufficient research in early childhood education and interpretive subjects such as the arts or humanities. Additionally, few studies critically examine the design principles, algorithmic transparency, or ethical considerations of adaptive systems. From the theoretical perspective, constructivism, sociocultural theory, and self-determination theory are applied to reveal why older students in STEM domains may benefit more from adaptive learning systems. This review also highlights the need for more diverse and context-sensitive studies, particularly in under-resourced educational settings and creative disciplines. Therefore, future research should analyze how adaptive learning systems support equitable and student-centered learning experiences in varied K-12 contexts."

    "abstract": "We present HyperSolver, a unified hypergraph neural network framework for solving NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems using a single neural network architecture. Traditional approaches require different algorithms for each problem, while HyperSolver uses the same architecture across multiple minimization and maximization problems, including set cover, hitting set, subset sum, hypergraph max cut, and hypergraph multiway cut. We represent each problem instance as a hypergraph, where hyperedges can connect multiple nodes simultaneously to capture multi-element relationships directly. HyperSolver learns through unsupervised training using problem-specific loss functions without requiring pre-computed solutions or labeled training data. We evaluated HyperSolver on synthetic benchmark datasets with controlled structural parameters and compared its performance to commercial solvers, traditional heuristics, and existing hypergraph neural network methods. HyperSolver consistently computes high-quality solutions with significant speedups over exact methods, traditional heuristics, and competing neural approaches. The framework demonstrates effective knowledge transfer across problem types, where models trained on one problem accelerate training on different problems while maintaining solution quality. These results establish HyperSolver as a practical unified alternative to problem-specific solvers for large-scale combinatorial optimization."

The traditional RF-based V2X systems are usually limited because of spectrum congestion, interference and variability in latency that makes them less applicable to safety-critical vehicular services. With the proposed architecture, modulation bandwidth, a relationship between reliability and responsiveness at the link, and dynamic mobility are improved under the dynamic mobility requirements, and influenced by high-speed photonic modulators and visible-light communication channel. The system model is thoroughly designed which involves the behavior of the optical channel and the mobility restrictions of the vehicle in addition to an optimized system of handover which fits rapidly moving conditions. Findings of the simulations show that end-to-end latency is under one milliseconds, and both throughput is enhanced, and the performance is stable irrespective of how crowded the traffic is. The results support the idea that photonics-aided LiFi can be used as the complementary technology to current RF systems and provide the next-generation intelligent transportation, cooperative driving, and situational awareness."

SliceMon deploys lightweight machine learning models in the data plane to locally infer potential SLA violations, while the controller aggregates these inferences using ensemble methods and activates detailed telemetry collection only when necessary. We evaluate SliceMon under delay-based SLAs using datasets gathered via emulation with Mininet and BMv2. Results demonstrate that SliceMon maintains high detection accuracy while significantly reducing monitoring overhead and improving responsiveness compared to traditional periodic telemetry approaches."

    "abstract": "The integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and high-altitude platform (HAP) in hierarchical aerial computing presents a promising paradigm for delivering supplementary computational services to mobile IoT devices. Despite the great potential, this system faces the challenge of timescale. Specifically, the dynamic nature of IoT devices and their corresponding task generations may initialize the frequent adjustment of UAVs-HAP task delegation for fullfiling their needs in small-timescale, but UAVs' trajectory planning and replacement can only operate in large-timescale because of the severe overhead in high-speed maneuvers, motivating the multi-timescale asynchronous decision making which may further complicate the system. To this end, we propose a two-timescale optimization framework, aiming to maximize the system energy efficiency of the hierarchical aerial computing. We formulate the problem as two coupled multi-agent stochastic games, capturing UAV-HAP interactions and system uncertainties, and prove the existence of a Nash Equilibrium (NE). A reinforcement learning-based algorithm, UAV trajectory planning, replacement, task delegation and resource allocation (UTRTD), is developed to achieve the NE. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed UTRTD over counterparts."

This method combines improved particle swarm optimization and differential evolution (IPSO-DE) method with a gradient-based dynamic optimization method, which can simultaneously obtain the global optimal solution, i.e., optimal control input, optimal switching instants, and optimal switching sequences. First, control vector parameterization (CVP), switching time parameterization (STP), and switching sequence smoothing techniques are employed to transform the original problem into a continuous finite-dimensional dynamic one. Second, the path constraints are discretized into a finite number of point constraints, and the IPSO-DE algorithm is proposed to search for the global optimal solution of the continuous dynamic problem with discretized constraints. Then, the obtained optimal solution serves as the initial point to calculate the gradients of the objective function with respect to control input, switching instants, and switching sequences. Third, the gradient-based deterministic method is applied to obtain the global optimal solution that satisfies the first-order optimality condition. Fourth, the finite termination of the hybrid intelligent optimization method is proven. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through three numerical examples."

    "abstract": "At present, most existing Infrared Moving Small Target Detection (IMSTD) methods are usually based on both static and task-dependent training. They often require that the available training set is acquired all at once, and each detection model is dedicated to a single task. In some specific scenarios where only few-shot samples are available and training data arrives sequentially, these methods lose their effectiveness. To address this issue, incremental few-shot learning schemes are considered as one of the most promising solutions. However, existing incremental few-shot approaches are mainly for general object detection, with the unsatisfactory performance on specialized IMSTD. In view of this, this paper proposes a Text-guided Iterative Polymerization with Prototyping (TIPP) framework for incremental few-shot IMSTD. In detail, it leverages text features to generate modulation factors to iteratively guide the polymerization of spatio-temporal features. Furthermore, by using statistical features, it can learn one unique prototype to identify one task. The experiments on three datasets (IRDST, DAUB, and ITSDT) demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our TIPP. It consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in both incremental few-shot learning and IMSTD. Source codes are available at https://github.com/UESTC-nnLab/TIPP."

    "abstract": "One-third of food produced for human consumption is wasted, with households in high-income countries responsible for nearly half of this total. This study examines user engagement with three major UK food waste reduction campaigns on X (formerly Twitter), analyzing more than 50,000 tweets collected over seven years. Using sentiment analysis, topic modelling, and feature importance classification (Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, Naïve Bayes, Gradient Boosting), the study identifies the content attributes that are most strongly associated with higher engagement. Practical advice (e.g., food storage tips), community mobilization, and food sharing consistently generate the highest levels of interaction, while strategic use of hashtags, mentions, and influencer endorsements amplifies reach. The paper makes three theoretical contributions. First, it advances agenda-setting theory by demonstrating how long-term digital campaigns curate content to elevate food waste as a salient public issue, with distinct strategies (aligning messages with organizational vision, offering actionable tips, and promoting food sharing) driving engagement. Second, it extends framing theory by showing how platform-native tools associate with interaction, with tweets using either hashtags or mentions (but not both) achieving greater resonance, suggesting that simplified framing may be more effective in crowded digital spaces. Third, it offers a methodological contribution by integrating feature importance analysis with sentiment and topic modelling, moving beyond descriptive metrics to predictive insights into which tweet attributes are most strongly associated with higher engagement. For practitioners, the study provides a cost-effective framework for dynamically adapting campaign content, equipping engineering managers and policy makers to design more impactful, scalable, and sustainable digital interventions that promote public engagement and behavioural change."

    "abstract": "This paper considers a challenging maritime low altitude surveillance issue, in which, a legitimate monitor UAV intends to overhear a suspicious UAV-vessel link with the help of a jammer UAV. Both the suspicious receiver has the jamming detection ability and the jammer UAV is energy-constrained. To address these challenges, we propose a novel UAV-mounted reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted approach, where the RIS is deployed on the jammer UAV to create an additional surveillance channel towards the legitimate UAV. Furthermore, the jammer UAV can also intelligently adjust its power allocation and flight trajectory to covertly disturb the suspicious transmission with the detection thresholds and the energy budgets. In such a setup, we consider a sum eavesdropping rate maximization problem of the legitimate UAV during all time slots. This formulated problem is solved by jointly optimizing the three dimensional (3D) trajectory of the legitimate UAV, the reflecting phase shifts of the RIS, as well as the 3D trajectory and jamming power of the jammer UAV under the mobility, covertness, and power limitation constraints. We decompose the non-convex design problem into three subproblems and propose an iterative algorithm to find its approximated optimal solution by using the block coordinate descent method. In eachiteration, we utilize the successive convex approximation and phase alignment techniques to handle these subproblems. Numerical simulation results are provided to validate the effectiveness and tremendous potential of UAV-mounted RIS in the maritime low-altitude surveillance."

The UAV acts as a semantic-aware aerial Base Station (aBS) that extracts and encodes high-level semantic features before mapping them onto the SCMA factor graph. A state-optimization module designs the semantic projection and energy-mapping matrices to preserve semantic fidelity under power and sparsity constraints. On top of this structure, a Lyapunov-constrained DRL controller adapts the UAV’s transmit-power policy based on instantaneous semantic reliability, channel dynamics, and network conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed Lyapunov-guided learning approach significantly improves energy efficiency and long-term stability while maintaining semantic reliability above the required threshold, with negligible throughput degradation compared to unconstrained SCMA-based learning schemes."

    "abstract": "Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) seeks to enhance recommendation accuracy in a target domain by utilizing user–item interactions from a source domain, especially in cold-start scenarios. In conventional CDR approaches, user-specific bridge functions generated using only the user’s high-rated interaction history in the source domain are used to map user embeddings from the source domain to the target domain. As a result, these methods cannot effectively leverage both positive and negative feedback. To address this limitation, we propose DUPGT-CDR, a new framework that encodes high (ratings 4–5) and low (ratings 1–3) feedback separately, and then adaptively fuses these signals using a gating network. This gating mechanism enables fine-grained control over transferring high and low feedback. Experiments on three real-world domain pairs with varying overlap ratios demonstrate that DUPGT-CDR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods (EMCDR, PTUPCDR, DPTUPCDR, MIMNET), achieving up to <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">17.9%</b> lower MAE and <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">20.9%</b> lower RMSE, thereby confirming its robustness across different data partition settings.

While hybrid architecture reduces hardware cost by limiting the number of RF chains, it also introduces challenges in jointly optimizing analog and digital beamformers under constant-modulus constraints in the analog domain. To overcome these challenges, we propose an alternating optimization framework that combines a Riemannian augmented Lagrangian method for analog beamforming and a minimum variance distortionless response approach for digital beamforming. Unlike conventional approachs that approximate hybrid beamformers by minimizing the Euclidean distance to a fully digital solution, our approach directly solves the original problem, thereby achieving deep interference nulls and accurate beam pointing. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves performance close to fully digital beamforming while significantly outperforming existing hybrid baselines."

In this context, this paper proposes a Model Predictive Control (MPC) based power management designed to mitigate Li-ion battery degradation while improving the overall system efficiency. To validate this proposal, extensive experimental results are presented. The proposed formulation aims to minimize battery stress by smoothing the current profile and reducing cycling effects. The performance of the MPC power management is verified through a comparative experimental analysis of four distinct strategies: rule-based, frequency-filtering, a benchmark MPC, and the proposed MPC. Evaluation is based on four key metrics: RMS current, total power losses, Equivalent Full Cycles (EFC), and State of Health variation (ΔSOH). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the compared strategies across all evaluated criteria, significantly reducing battery stress in terms of cycling and current distribution. Furthermore, long-term simulations corroborate these findings, showing a substantial reduction in battery degradation compared to other established methods. These results confirm that the proposed method, provides a robust solution for mitigating battery degradation in hybrid inverter applications."

The system integrates seamlessly into semiconductor manufacturing pipelines, supporting real-time process monitoring, adaptive parameter tuning, and predictive maintenance.

The trade-off among resolution, dynamic range, and real-time capability in conventional spectral demodulation algorithms, however, constrains their achievable performance in practice. In this paper, a real-time, high-resolution and wide-dynamic-range demodulation algorithm for FPI sensors is proposed within a discrete Fourier transform (DFT)-based spectral demodulation framework. A modified frequency estimation method is introduced to extend the effective dynamic range, and a refined phase reconstruction strategy is employed to suppress the phase jumps under different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. The proposed algorithm realizes a cavity-length resolution of 0.086 nm at a spectral SNR of 29.4 dB, and maintains stable and continuous demodulation over a cavity-length variation exceeding 195 μm. In the experimental system, the demodulation rate is limited to 33 kHz by the sampling rate of the spectrometer, whereas demodulation speed analysis indicates that the proposed algorithm is capable of supporting rates exceeding 100 kHz. In addition, the pressure sensing experiment further confirms its applicability in practical sensing scenarios. The proposed algorithm is expected to provide an effective demodulation solution for high-resolution and real-time FPI sensing applications."

    "abstract": "Vehicle positioning technology is essential for intelligent vehicles, supporting applications such as path planning, route guidance and autonomous parking. High-precision road topology network information is also crucial for vehicle positioning and navigation. However, approaches that generate road topology from remote sensing images are limited by viewing angle and resolution, often missing road segments and generating only road-level topology. Ground mapping vehicle systems such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) based methods struggle to directly obtain road centerlines and are rarely used directly for topology generation, while deep learning-based methods can dynamically produce lane-level topology but often lack global consistency and interpretability, suffering from redundant misconnections and high perception cost. In this paper, we present a geometry-driven framework for automatic lane-level topology generation from a monocular front-view camera, with global map alignment supported by external localization. Unlike purely deep learning-based approaches, our approach leverages existing high-precision ground vehicle mapping algorithms to extract road geometry constraints and incorporates semantic cues to ensure interpretable and globally connected topology generation, combining interpretability with strong geometric supervision. Specifically, we introduce a lane semantic information based lane enhancement strategy to fill topological gaps, a DBSCAN based three-stage pipeline to denoise and regularize lane center nodes, and a virtual-node representation to simplify complex intersections. Our approach has been experimentally validated in real-world urban areas and compared to existing mainstream deep learning-based topology generation methods. The results indicate that our method achieves higher topological accuracy and completeness within the same front-view camera field of view, demonstrating its effectiveness for lane-level topology construction."

To address the limitations of conventional converters regarding voltage gain and component stress, the system utilizes a Mirrored SEPIC front-stage integrated with a Dual Active Bridge (DAB) post-stage. This hybrid topology features a high theoretical voltage gain and low hardware complexity. A hierarchical control strategy coordinates photovoltaic (PV) generation, energy storage, direct current (DC) loads, and grid interaction across four distinct energy flow modes. Furthermore, a rigorous small-signal impedance model is derived, and a stability criterion based on the Forbidden Region concept is introduced to guide parameter tuning for the cascaded system. Experimental validation on a 10kW prototype confirms the performance of the system. It achieves a stable 500V DC bus output from an 80V input, corresponding to a voltage conversion ratio of 6.25, while maintaining a low normalized complexity of 1.25 switches per port. During dynamic transitions including 50% load step changes and grid power reversals, the DC bus voltage fluctuation is limited to 3% with a settling time of less than 80ms. The proposed solution provides a scalable, cost-effective, and highly stable platform for residential renewable energy integration."

Ultrasound image data are then fused with real time probe poses and mapped into 3D space. The proposed method runs online over a continuously updated perception map, selecting the next path segment in real time by maximizing motion efficiency and information gain. Phantom experiments demonstrate that the proposed method effectively avoids bone obstruction, while human experiments confirm its clinical feasibility. On average across the kidney and spleen experiments, the proposed system achieved 87.69% of ultrasound physician performance while requiring only 1.22 times the scanning time, demonstrating strong potential for clinical application."

However, for UAV systems that rely solely on point features, weak-texture environments cause a decline in pose estimation accuracy, creating a severe localization challenge. The fusion of line and point features introduces more geometric constraints, enhancing system robustness and localization accuracy. This letter presents a lightweight monocular visual-inertial SLAM framework, WEMA-VINS (Weak-grid ELSED MIS-filtered and Angular-constrained VINS), designed for robust point-line fusion. It integrates weak-texture region elimination, ELSED line detection, Maximum Independent Set (MIS)-based pruning of redundant segments, and an angular-constrained line optimization module. Our proposed framework collectively improves point feature quality, preserves structural line information, and enhances robustness against endpoint drift and partial occlusion, leading to reliable point-line fusion and efficient state estimation. Extensive experiments on the KAIST VIO and EuRoC datasets demonstrate that WEMA-VINS significantly improves both localization accuracy and robustness, consistently achieving leading performance over recent point-line SLAM baselines while maintaining real-time efficiency."

    "abstract": "Accurate extrinsic parameters are critical for fusing heterogeneous data from cameras and Lidars. To solve the problems of incomplete feature extraction, poor scene adaptability and unstable parameter convergence in conventional automatic calibration methods, this paper proposed an online extrinsic calibration method using object-oriented semantic features, which consisted of a coarse-calibration based on trajectory-consistency and a fine-calibration based on feature-consistency. With the initial parameters from the coarse-calibration, fine-calibration pictorialized the sparse point cloud to obtain its depth, intensity and class attributes simultaneously. Then, the SAM network was used to process both the visual image and the point cloud pseudo-image to extract consistent object-oriented features. To enhance the stability and adaptability of extrinsic calibration to various scenes, an observability-based IoU was proposed to perform the camera-Lidar feature matching. In addition, we designed an adaptability function to evaluate the quality of scene features, thereby ensuring the effectiveness of extrinsic calibration. Results of testing on KITTI dataset and real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively obtain accurate extrinsic parameters in multiple scenes.

This paper introduces two threshold memristor models to mimic neuronal autapses, constructing a novel dual memristor-coupled unidirectional ring neural network (DMCURNN). Benefiting from the dual memristor-based autapse emulation, the DMCURNN enriches diverse hidden firing dynamics that are absent in conventional unidirectional ring neural networks, and the richness and complexity of these hidden firing dynamics are highly sensitive to the memristive coupling strengths. Numerical simulations indicate that the DMCURNN is able to generate various hidden firing activities, pattern transitions, homogeneous firing multistability of infinite coexisting homogeneous firing patterns and heterogeneous firing multistability of seven heterogeneous firing patterns. Furthermore, through adjusting the coupling parameters along with the external current intensity, the regulatory mechanisms of hidden firing patterns and their amplitude and frequency regulation are revealed. Subsequently, the hidden firing dynamics of this network are verified on an FPGA hardware platform. Finally, Using the hidden firing multistability characteristic of the DMCURNN, a novel bitstream-based hardware image encryption scheme with a dynamic key update mechanism is designed. Performance evaluations demonstrate that the proposed scheme exhibits exceptional robustness and high efficiency for IoT security applications."

    "abstract": "Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) has emerged as a key paradigm for delivering personalized AI services across diverse clients. While prior research has primarily focused on handling data heterogeneity, recent studies have additionally targeted noise and communication efficiency. However, most approaches exchange knowledge only at the logit or prototype level, which limits representation sharing and struggles to mitigate both data heterogeneity and noise. Moreover, communication overhead accumulated over hundreds of training rounds still imposes substantial bandwidth costs, and fixed personalization ratios hinder effective optimization to non-IID data. To address these challenges, we propose Personalization via Adaptive Gradient Filtering in Federated Learning (PAG-FL), a communication-efficient and robust PFL framework. PAG-FL reduces communication costs by collecting only class-wise average embeddings and local prediction heads from clients. It further alleviates embedding bias through L2 normalization and a projection layer, while optimizing personalization ratios using thresholds derived from the interquartile range (IQR) of gradients. Extensive experiments on Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that PAG-FL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, under label noise and non-IID conditions, PAG-FL achieves accuracy improvements of up to 19% and F1 Score gains of up to 17% compared to the best baselines. In fixed and subset user scenarios, it maintains this robustness, yielding substantial accuracy gains of approximately 19%. Furthermore, PAG-FL significantly accelerates convergence, reducing communication rounds by up to 96% and communication overhead by up to 1,700×."

Traditional metrics like Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and Video Multi-Method Assessment Fusion (VMAF) were designed for two-dimensional video and lack good correspondence to the human perceptual judgment in the immersive media world. In the current work, we perform a systematic assessment of conventional, perceptual and AI-driven metrics using 4K, 8K and holographic xr test sequences with various compression ratios and network noise conditions. Subjective Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) were collected from 30 participants and these were then compared with objective metric outputs to evaluate the validity of each measurement method.Experimental results show a correlation with a percentage of more than 90% with mean opinion scores (MOS), with AI-driven hybrid models * perceptual depth cues, which are much more accurate than conventional approaches at the cost of a high computational cost. In order to counteract the issue of latency, the paper examines the use of edge computing architectures and can therefore demonstrate improved scalability for real-time extended reality (XR) broadcasting. These findings imply that hybrid AI-perceptual approaches represent a future-proof methodology for assessing the objective quality of video content, providing robust and reliable solutions able to cope with the needs of immersive broadcasting ecosystems predicted to occur in 2026 onwards."

To address the high training costs associated with cross-domain adaptation in multi-disciplinary entity extraction, this study proposes a hybrid framework that integrates a universal information extraction framework(UIE) with a context-aware large language model (LLM). Leveraging the ERNIE-UIE model's transfer learning capabilities, our framework achieves few-shot learning optimization through efficient fine-tuning with minimal manually annotated curriculum texts, thereby significantly reducing model training overhead. Notably, the LLM functions as a semantic enhancement module to validate and augment UIE's extraction outputs. Experimental results demonstrate a 5.61% improvement in precision for knowledge point entity extraction through this collaborative approach."

Traditional deep learning models typically train on the entire available historical dataset without explicitly considering temporal similarities across different days. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel forecasting framework that integrates similar-period selection into a CNN-BiLSTM-Attention model to improve predictive performance. First, the autocorrelation function (ACF) is utilized to determine the optimal length of similar historical periods. Then, Shape Dynamic Time Warping (ShapeDTW) is employed to identify the most similar historical sequences. These selected periods are processed by convolutional layers to extract local features, followed by a BiLSTM-Attention model that captures bidirectional dependencies and highlights key temporal patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms models without similarity-based preprocessing and those using similarity based clustering based on weather conditions, achieving higher forecasting accuracy."

In this study, simulation experiments were conducted using ground-based spectral sampling data to simulate sampling outcomes across various scales. The absolute relative deviation between the ground-based sampling results and the actual reflectance of the simulated field was employed as an indicator of representativeness error. A mathematical model was then constructed to establish the relationship between the sampling scale and data representativeness. The experimental results demonstrate that the coefficient of determination (R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>) for the fitted model is 0.9306. Furthermore, calculations based on the model indicate that for an absolute relative deviation of less than 5%, the ground-based spectral sampling scale must be at least six times the side length of the layout unit. This study provides a theoretical basis and a practical reference for rationally determining the ground-based spectral sampling scale during authenticity validation."

Traditional methods of manual tracking limit the level of accountability to provide an accurate reflection of participation. This research fills a vital gap in the real-time tracking of community participation by constructing a Web-based application system that tracks participants' locations, login/logout times, and service hours for community extension programs. By employing the Design Science Research methodology, the study passed six stages: Problem Identification and Motivation, Definition of Solution Objectives, Design and Development, Demonstration, Evaluation, and Communication. The system used HTML5 Geolocation API, OpenStreetMap’s Nominatim Service for reverse geocoding, and Google Sheets as the backend database to offer automatic attendance taking with location verification based on GPS. The system is organized around four main modules: a frontend application, a data collection module that makes use of the user's geolocation, an integration layer for handling information input using the Google Forms API, and a cloud-based data persistence service. The app is DPA-compliant and gives you both real-time monitoring and comprehensive reporting. The evaluation process included 71 participants who answered the System Usability Scale questionnaire and whose feedback was assessed by Spearman's Rank Correlation as well as by sentiment analysis. The results show a high degree of user satisfaction, with 85.10% as a positive response and a significant relationship between usability factors, with a correlation coefficient greater than 0.55. Ease of navigation was the most important factor (correlation: 0.72), followed by the site's loading speed (0.70). Location tracking was considered the most useful functionality (84.20%), with which no one wanted more help. The study provides a technological intervention to bridge the gap in monitoring community extension services through better accountability, proper resource allocation, and effectiveness of the program for institutions of higher learning. The prototype has shown the feasibility of how attendance records can be recorded automatically in a non-invasive manner that respects data integrity and user privacy."

    "abstract": "Machine learning and neural networks experience growing usage in resource-constrained devices. However, moving neural networks to small devices also brings new requirements regarding the reliability and security of the networks and their hardware. In many areas, such as autonomous driving, the device must detect possible errors during execution to ensure safe functionality. Moreover, an adversary can gain physical access to the device, opening the door for hardware attacks like fault injections that target misclassification or parameter retrieval. This work proposes a fault detection mechanism for software implementations of neural networks running on a microcontroller to increase the reliability and security of the neural network. Our technique uses AN-codes, a type of error-detecting code, to detect errors in calculations within the neural network without any implications on the accuracy of protected networks. In addition, signature checking ensures the integrity of the control flow. Simulations and real-world testing show that our mechanism successfully detects faults in all possible locations in the neural network’s program code. Despite the robustness of our fault detection mechanism, it has an overhead in code size of only about 10%, independent of the implemented network. The memory usage increases by at most 232 bytes independently of the neural network size, ensuring that the mechanism is not overly burdensome for the memory."

Measurement of Optical Signal-to-Noise Ratio (OSNR) is now an urgent problem in contemporary coherent optical communication systems with high speed (e.g. polarization multiplexing (Pol-Mux)). The recent trends of tight channel separation, strong spectral filtering and complex modulation schemes at frequencies up to 400 Gbps mean that conventional OSNR measurement methods based on out of band spectral analysis are no more. The study will overcome these shortcomings by experimentally testing the operation of Viavi Pol-Mux OSA-710 a modern optical spectrum analyzer that employs Spectral Correlation Method (SCorM). The suggested solution allows to measure the in-band OSNR correctly, without disruption of the service delivery, independent of the dispersion impairments and modulation format. It has been experimentally shown that the SCorM-based OSNR estimation is precise within a range of ±0.5 dB with regard to conventional OSA methods, and stable under the conditions of different polarizations and filtering. Their results support the Pol-Mux OSA-710 as an effective and stable solution to the real-time OSNR monitoring of the coherent DWDM systems, enhancing the quality of the network performance measurement and lowering the cost of the operational process of the installation and maintenance phases."

    "abstract": "Ship detection in optical remote sensing images plays a critical role in maritime surveillance and safety. However, in real-world scenarios, optical remote sensing satellites are susceptible to adverse weather conditions such as clouds and fog, leading to issues in the acquired images such as severely reduced contrast, blurred target edges, and occlusion of features on small ships. This, in turn, causes a sharp decline in the performance of generic detectors (like YOLOv8), resulting in significantly higher missed detections and false alarm rates. To address this severe challenge, this paper proposes a novel DS-YOLO network, a Dual-Domain Background Suppression and Superpixel-Guided Attention network designed for ship detection in natural cloudy and foggy scenes. First, we designed the Dual-domain Background Suppression (DBS) module to mitigate cloud and fog interference via parallel collaborative processing in both the spatial and frequency domains. Specifically, the spatial branch utilizes Large Kernel Attention (LKA) and Pixel Attention to enhance the structural features of ship targets. Concurrently, the frequency branch employs the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to selectively suppress low-frequency background noise inherent in foggy scenes while preserving the high-frequency details of the targets. Second, inspired by superpixel segmentation, we integrated the Superpixel-Guided Attention (SGA) module into the network's Backbone to enhance the P4 feature layer. By simulating superpixel region aggregation, this module dynamically fuses original pixel features with reconstructed regional contexts, leveraging effective information from unoccluded areas to accurately repair ship features obscured by clouds and fog. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we collected and annotated a ship detection dataset from Google Earth under real-world cloudy and foggy scenarios, named CFS. Extensive experiments on the CFS dataset demonstrate that our proposed DS-YOLO significantly outperforms the baseline YOLOv8 and other state-of-the-art detection models in key metrics including mAP, Recall, and mAP50-95, demonstrating its strong potential for robust ship detection under adverse weather conditions."

To enhance computational efficiency, the model employed simplifications, such as reducing radiator fin count while maintaining equivalent heat transfer via adjusted convection coefficients. Field-circuit coupling simulations based on Dyn11 connection schemes were conducted, and results were validated against experimental measurements, showing <5% deviation in loss predictions. The study provides key insights into flux distribution, loss mechanisms, and thermal management in power transformers, offering a validated approach for optimizing transformer design and operational reliability."

These scams exploit prolonged, trust-building conversations to deceive victims into sharing sensitive information or funds. While machine learning, especially deep learning, has advanced phishing detection through pattern recognition and contextual analysis, existing models primarily focus on individual messages and struggle to classify entire conversations due to challenges like token limits and the delayed emergence of malicious intent. To address this, we propose SafeChat, an innovative system that dynamically assesses the risk of financial scams in SMS conversations by assigning cumulative risk scores to each message, displayed in real-time within the chat interface. SafeChat leverages a curated dataset of real and smishing conversations, identifying scam phases and weighting them by frequency and impact. Users can contribute anonymized conversation data to enhance model accuracy, with robust PII filtering using tools like Presidio and blockchain-based integrity verification via smart contracts to ensure privacy and trust. By integrating SMS APIs (e.g., Twilio), automation platforms (e.g., Zapier), and blockchain (e.g., Hyperledger), SafeChat empowers users with transparent, actionable insights to mitigate evolving scam threats. Experimental results show that SafeChat effectively identifies and scores scam-related content in chat conversations, making it a practical solution for real-time spam risk assessment in messaging applications."

This paper proposes a multi-scale spatio-temporal deep learning model that models the long-term dependencies within nodes and the short-term correlations between nodes. In the temporal dimension, a Periodic Decomposition Module is introduced to decompose historical sequences into periodic and disturbance components, which are then modeled and fused through a dual-branch Temporal Fusion Transformer to obtain long-term predictions. In the spatial dimension, multi-scale features are extracted based on geographical maps, similarity maps, and weather maps, dynamically fused through an Inter-Graph External Attention Mechanism, and time dependencies are captured through LSTM to obtain short-term predictions. Finally, the block adaptively integrates long-term and short-term results, simultaneously outputting single-day and single-week predictions. On the NYISO dataset, the MAPE for single-day and single-week predictions is 2.05% and 2.33%, respectively, which significantly outperforms existing methods, validating the model's high accuracy and multiscale adaptability."

Given the complex characteristics of electricity price fluctuations, which are influenced by a variety of factors such as load demand, fuel prices, renewable energy output, and policy adjustments, an innovative multimodal time-series decomposition framework (MM-TDF) is proposed. This framework enhances the signal-to-noise ratio of features through hybrid signal processing, dynamically integrates multi-source heterogeneous data such as electricity prices and fuel prices by utilizing a conditional LSTMT-ransformer interaction mechanism, and adopts a dynamic weight joint training strategy to optimize multi-task balance. Experiments show that in typical markets such as PJM and Nord Pool, MM-TDF achieves an accuracy rate improvement during peak hours improvement over LSTM, and exhibits strong robustness to data missingness.

Based on the advances in blockchain-controlled trust schemes, self-powered IoT, and sustainable hydroponics surveillance schemes, we introduce a hybrid design that combines quantum key distribution (QKD) with the photonic channels and consensus-based access control. Photonic technologies used to date in agronomy in sensor and control technologies are already being applied to secure communication. Findings indicate that there are better-secure key generation with channel noise, low chances of leakage, and protection against future quantum attacks. The publication is an outline to the next generation Agri-IoT systems in which quantum photonics will guarantee confidentiality, authenticity, and sustainability."

As the pivotal technology for coordinating multi-stakeholder interests and coping with renewable-energy uncertainties, IES still confront a constellation of challenges in responding to user demand: a fractured supply– demand architecture, decoupling from social policies, metric-based evaluation biases, and deficient quantification of uncertainties. This paper dissects these impediments in depth and proposes corresponding optimization pathways, aiming to propel IES toward an efficient, flexible, and multi-dimensionally coordinated paradigm, thereby furnishing a systematic reference for IES optimization under high-penetration renewable-energy scenarios."

    "abstract": "This paper is an experiment study on how effective digital image resizing is using the different interpolation techniques. The emergence of digital broadcasting and used television triggered a significant increment in the need to broadcast high definition (HD) and ultra high definition (UHD) television programs, which has caused a considerable increase in the amount of video data. The trend brings about the issue of the possible deterioration of visual quality when bulk amounts of data are transferred in real time through the available communication channels.One of the main tasks of video processing is that images need to be scaled-both up (upscaling) and down (downscaling) in the transcoding process in order to ensure compatibility across different resolutions. Additionally, the transmission of video streams with a lower resolution followed by the expansion back to the original dimensions allows significant traffic savings. Therefore, the ability to resize an image adaptively, without changing its visual fidelity, is of significant practical and scientific importance.The research examined and experimentally tested commonly used interpolation techniques for image resizing, namely Bicubic, B-Spline, Mitchell and Lanczos. The experimental protocol involved reducing the sizes of test images successively by one half followed by restoration to the original size using the same interpolator. The quality and fidelity of the reconstructed images were assessed quantitatively through visual inspection of the images and quantitatively through mean square error (MSE). The article presents results which show the relative effectiveness of each of the interpolators investigated in the reduction and restoration operations."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the generation and evolution of nonlinear internal waves. Early studies show the presence of both an intense internal tide in this region and the propagation of a large amplitude of short-period internal waves. Our analysis demonstrates the presence of several mechanisms for generating short-period structures. In situ investigations conducted in 2021 and 2023 confirm the presence of at least 3 different mechanisms here. These mechanisms include lee wave generation, internal tide disintegration, and tide-front-topography interactions. The lee wave generation mechanism prevails at relatively shallow depths (up to ~100 m). The disintegration of the inner tide occurs at great depths, with elevation differences from 100 to 200 m. While the interaction of the tide and the front is important near the interface of surface currents. We assume that the strait is a prototype of other dynamically intensive regions of the Arctic."

    "abstract": "With the increasing demand for energy-efficient solutions in smart edge applications, there is a pressing need for computing architectures that can effectively manage di-verse and computation-intensive workloads. To address this, we propose APX-DREAM-CIM, an approximate digital SRAM-based Computation-In-Memory (CIM) accelerator specifically designed to maximize energy and area efficiency with minimal impact on accuracy by investigating cross-layer optimizations. The architecture uses, on the one hand, quantized models and, on the other hand, integrates a range of approximate adder designs, each offering distinct trade-offs between hard-ware efficiency and computational precision. To further enhance resilience to approximation-induced errors, we introduce a novel Approximate-Aware Training (AAT) methodology, which models the approximate behavior of the hardware during training, enabling the network to adapt accordingly. We evaluate APX-DREAM-CIM using the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets with LeNet-5 and ResNet-20 topologies. Experimental results show that APX-DREAM-CIM achieves up to 17% energy and 16% area reduction compared to the exact baseline architecture. Moreover, AAT enables the system to retain, and in some cases, even exceed, the accuracy of standard quantized models."

Existing reinforcement learning approaches have effectively addressed MRTA by considering task deadlines and robot capability limitations. This paper further incorporates environmental obstacles as explicit spatial constraints reconstructed from the environment and proposes a reinforcement learning strategy based on a heterogeneous graph Markov decision process. The proposed approach utilizes a neural architecture referred to as the Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network Attention-Based Model (HGNNAM), which adopts an encoder-decoder structure: (1) Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network Encoder, which integrates robot states, task attributes, and accurate path distances computed from environmental maps through a hierarchical message-passing mechanism; (2) Multi-Head Attention Decoder, which enables real-time decision-making guided by dynamically updated task masks, facilitating context-aware action selection. Experimental results demonstrate that the method consistently achieves robust task allocation performance in intricate maze-like environments and exhibits strong adaptability to previously unseen environments and diverse task types. Future work will further explore collaborative decision-making mechanisms for heterogeneous robot teams and varied task specifications."

    "abstract": "Human activity recognition (HAR) using smartwatch sensor data is a crucial enabling technology for healthcare monitoring, fitness assessment, and assistive applications. Deploying advanced deep learning architectures on wearable devices with limited computational capacity, however, poses significant challenges. This work presents an efficient HAR solution based on knowledge distillation, enabling compact models to retain high classification accuracy while satisfying smartwatch hardware constraints. The proposed framework adopts a teacher–student paradigm in which high-capacity neural networks—specifically CNN, LSTM, and CNN-LSTM models—trained on multimodal sensor data transfer their learned representations to a lightweight CNN student model optimized for resource-limited environments. Multi-sensor fusion from accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer measurements, commonly available on commercial smartwatches, is incorporated to enhance recognition capability. Evaluation is performed on two benchmark datasets: the CHA dataset, containing 13 daily activities from 10 participants, and the WISDM-HARB dataset, comprising 18 activities from 51 participants. Results indicate classification accuracies of 97.78–98.34% on CHA and 91.03–93.04% on WISDM-HARB, along with storage reductions of up to 85.6% and parameter count decreases of up to 56.9% compared with the original teacher models. These findings demonstrate the practicality of knowledge distillation for delivering accurate, real-time HAR on resource-constrained wearable platforms."

The absence of cylindrical symmetry in such complex rotor structures with auxiliary notch rotor core and rectangular-shaped interior permanent magnets (PMs) poses challenges for solving 2-D boundary conditions and developing the analytical model. To address this issue interior PMs are first mapped to the rotor surface and replaced by sin-shaped PMs. In other words, the original IPM machine with auxiliary notch rotor is transformed into a surface mounted PM machine. Next, sin-shaped PMs are segmented into a number of small pieces to form cylindrical symmetry along the angular length of each piece. Finally, 2-D Maxwell equations are discretely solved in each segment and summated to calculate the resultant flux distribution. Meanwhile, the effects of stator slot’s are modeled with magnetizing current. The accuracy of analytical results are verified by Finite Element (FE), and experimental tests on the motor prototype."

In these cases, the accurate recognition of human actions has become essential, and is currently making significant steps due to the wide use of Machine Learning algorithms. However, the standard methods in that category currently face several challenges that concern their ability to generalize and adapt to new, unseen data, as well as the need for large amounts of data for training. This survey examines how the methods of Multi-Task Learning and Meta Learning have been deployed as strategies to tackle the above challenges. It studies how the two approaches are applied to human action recognition, focusing on the utilized methodologies, data modalities, and architectural approaches, highlighting the way that the first method promotes task-related knowledge sharing, while the second enables adaptation to scarce data. Through the mapping of studies from 2014 to 2025, this survey identifies trends, methodological gaps, and future insights for the development of more adaptive and context-aware recognition systems."

    "abstract": "This investigation attempts to analyze and optimize the number of stages of low-energy Marx generators. Fast-discharging low-energy Marx generators are composed of stage capacitors of lower capacitance values, which are often comparable with various stray capacitances formed within the Marx system. In this article, analytical expressions for equivalent erected capacitance and open-circuit terminal voltage of the Marx generator are estimated considering the significant presence of stray capacitances. Mathematical observations consistently demonstrate an asymptotic decay in voltage multiplication efficacy with increasing stage count, ultimately reaching a regime of diminishing returns where incremental stages contribute insignificantly to the output potential. The erection dynamics are modeled as a discrete-time process, with comprehensive circuit analysis incorporating distributed stray capacitance elements. Acorrelation function relating three basic parameters: 1) stage count; 2) stage capacitance; and 3) parasitic capacitive coupling between elevated-potential nodes and the grounded containment structure is established. Two innovative design factors, namely stray capacitance loading factor (<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\boldsymbol {\\beta }$</tex-math> </inline-formula>) and effective voltage multiplication factor (<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\boldsymbol {\\Gamma }$</tex-math> </inline-formula>), are introduced to accurately estimate and optimize the number of stages. It is also established that the relating equation of these factors under certain conditions omits two fundamental polynomials. One of them is a depressed cubic, whose only real solution is the inverse plastic ratio, and the other is a quadratic whose root is the golden ratio. The inverse plastic ratio solution is opted as the most optimal solution, which is a balance between voltage amplification and energy efficiency, while the golden ratio solution could be the point of relatively higher voltage amplification at the cost of reduced energy efficiency. Amathematical analysis regarding the surge impedance of Marx discovers a condition that indicates the coexistence of Marx and PFN behavior at the same time. On the basis of these analyses and simulations, a 500-kV, 5-kA, 60-ns FWHM Marx generator is developed. Experiments are carried out using a resistive load and validate the analytical findings within 5%–7% accuracy. Details of analysis, optimization, and experiments are narrated in this article."

    "abstract": "As semiconductor manufacturing advances toward the 3 nm node and beyond, wafer sensitivity to particulate and moisture contamination becomes increasingly critical. During front opening unified pod (FOUP) door opening, airflow disturbances and deflection from the equipment front-end module (EFEM) can lead to the intrusion of external moisture and airborne molecular contaminants (AMC), potentially degrading wafer surface integrity and process yield. To address this, a high-velocity-type laminar air curtain device (HV-LAC) was developed using a low-pressure-drop PTFE filter combined with an airflow deflector and perforated plate. This design overcomes deformation and particle-shedding issues seen in conventional ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UPE) panels under high flow rates, while improving flow uniformity and barrier stability. The HV-LAC achieved a maximum outlet velocity of 0.54 m/s, maintained velocity non-uniformity around 10% across all flow conditions, and met ISO Class 1 cleanliness. Performance evaluation was conducted under combinations of EFEM background velocities (0.3, 0.4, 0.5 m/s), airflow deflection angles (0°, 15°, 30°), and curtain velocities (0.35, 0.41, 0.54 m/s), with FOUP purge flow at 130 LPM. Experimental results confirmed that the HV-LAC effectively suppressed moisture intrusion, with FOUP internal relative humidity (RH) maintained below 5% in all conditions. The best isolation was observed when curtain velocity matched EFEM airflow, demonstrating that velocity matching is critical to maintaining barrier integrity. This study offers a quantitative design reference for enhancing FOUP micro-environmental control in advanced semiconductor processes."

To address the low computational efficiency and poor interpretability of original KANs caused by B-spline basis functions, RBF-KAN adopts RBF as the core function for activation parameterization, while retaining KAN’s theoretical guarantees. Experiments on function approximation, basic classification datasets (Moon, Concentric circles, etc.), and the real-world large-scale Adult dataset demonstrate that RBF-KAN achieves competitive accuracy with significantly enhanced efficiency compared to KAN and FourierKAN. Specifically, it reduces parameters by 33%–65% and accelerates inference/training by 65%–99% while maintaining comparable accuracy (e.g., 0.8357 vs. KAN’s 0.8157 on Adult dataset). It exhibits excellent stability and generalization, especially in high-dimensional and large-scale scenarios. This work highlights RBF-KAN’s strengths, limitations, and future directions, underscoring its potential in tackling complex function approximation and classification challenges."

Meanwhile, their application fields such as healthcare, transportation, and education can drive technological advancement and innovation, thus fostering economic growth and improving our quality of life. However, due to mechanical wear from prolonged operation, the robot absolute positioning error can reach several millimeters, thus it is impossible for them to perform precise tasks.

An analytical model is developed to predict the shape of bistable actuators and is validated experimentally with a minimum prediction accuracy of 97.74%.

However, efficient federated training of these complex MoE-structured LAMs is hindered by significant system-level challenges, particularly in managing the interplay between heterogeneous client resources and the sophisticated coordination required for numerous specialized experts. This article highlights a critical, yet underexplored concept: the absence of robust quantitative strategies for dynamic client-expert alignment that holistically considers varying client capacities and the imperative for system-wide load balancing. Specifically, we propose a conceptual system design for intelligent client-expert alignment that incorporates dynamic fitness scoring, global expert load monitoring, and client capacity profiling. By tackling these systemic issues, we can unlock more scalable, efficient, and robust training mechanisms with fewer communication rounds for convergence, paving the way for the widespread deployment of large-scale federated MoE-structured LAMs in edge computing with ultra-high communication efficiency."

Based on electromechanical analogies and transfer matrix methods, the model establishes a comprehensive analytical framework incorporating mechanical–electrical coupling effects, energy losses, and geometric parameters. Experimental validation with varying size ratios and radial misalignment conditions between transmitting and receiving transducers demonstrates the model's accuracy. Parametric analysis reveals quantitative relationships between transducer size ratios and system performance, while elucidating the coupling effects between radial misalignment and transducer dimensional differences. The findings show that system efficiency is less impacted under small-range radial misalignment, particularly when the misalignment remains below the difference in transducer radii. Furthermore, the investigation shows a distinct tradeoff relationship: increased dimensional asymmetry enhances misalignment tolerance while reducing overall transmission efficiency. These insights provide theoretical guidance for the design optimization of asymmetric UPT systems."

    "abstract": "Steganography can be mainly classified into two categories: modification-based and generation-based approaches. Modification-based steganography embeds secret messages by altering specific statistical properties of the cover image, offering relatively high capacity and robustness. However, such modifications also make the stego images more susceptible to be detected by steganalysis tools. In contrast, generation-based steganography, which directly generates them via generative models, provides higher security but suffers from limited hiding capacity and poor robustness. To address these limitations, we propose a unified deep network for image steganography (U-StegNet) that integrates the high capacity and robustness of modification-based steganography with the high security of generation-based steganography. Specifically, we design a dual stage hiding strategy. In the first stage, we utilize a generative model to produce an intermediate image that hides part of the secret message while preserving statistical properties consistent with natural images, thereby enhancing resistance to steganalysis. In the second stage, we design a U-Net-based encoder to hide the remaining secret message into the intermediate image, while simultaneously enhancing fine-grained visual details. Moreover, we introduce a message division module that adaptively allocates the message length for each stage based on the image content and capacity constraints, thereby improving both imperceptibility and robustness. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our U-StegNet. It achieves a PSNR of 44.41 dB and an SSIM of 0.9968 on stego images, which demonstrates the high imperceptibility of our method. Furthermore, it maintains strong robustness across nine types of common attacks, with message extraction accuracy nearly above 98%."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel video-level RGB-T tracking paradigm based on prompt learning, termed PromptTrack, which establishes dense spatial-temporal associations through cross-modal interactions. The method introduces streaming temporal prompts to capture continuous target dynamics (e.g., appearance changes and motion trajectories), while leveraging multimodal spatial prompts to utilize complementary RGB and thermal-infrared (TIR) features dynamically. By propagating temporal prompts through consecutive frames and integrating bidirectional spatial interactions between modalities, PromptTrack achieves superior tracking performance in complex scenarios such as occlusion, low illumination, and distractors. The proposed framework employs a unified multimodal encoder with spatial-temporal modeling via multimodal spatial prompt blocks, enabling efficient fusion of RGB-TIR features without requiring domain-specific structure modifications. Extensive experiments on three RGB-T benchmarks (LasHeR, RGBT210, RGBT234) demonstrate that PromptTrack achieves new state-of-the-art performance, with 76.2% in precision rate on LasHeR and outperforming existing methods by ++1.9% in precision rate and +0.5% in success rate on RGBT234. Notably, its modality-agnostic design facilitates seamless generalization to RGB-D and RGB-E tracking domains achieving new benchmarks on DepthTrack, VOT-RGBD2022, and VisEvent datasets."

In this paper, a robust audio watermarking method with optimised embedding strength based on DCT-SWT-SVD is proposed. Specifically, the watermark bits to be embedded are encrypted using a chaotic map with high randomness. Then, the host audio signal is processed by discrete cosine transform (DCT) to determine the frequency bands for embedding, followed by stationary wavelet transform (SWT) and singular value decomposition (SVD) to extract robust features in these bands. Next, the encrypted watermark bits are embedded in carrier audio based on obtained robust features. After that, the effect of embedding strength on imperceptibility and robustness is theoretically analysed. Moreover, selectable intervals of embedding strength considering robustness and imperceptibility requirements are presented, where robustness is evaluated by attack simulation test using signal processing technique. Finally, the embedding strength is optimised using the sparrow search algorithm (SSA), with its adaptability discussed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods in terms of watermarking performance, exhibiting excellent resilience to common attack methods including desynchronization attacks, without affecting the quality of the watermarked audio."

We characterize vision-language relationship between semantic concepts, which typically has a hierarchical tree structure, in the hyperbolic space instead of the traditional Euclidean space. Hyperbolic spaces exhibit exponential volume growth with radius, unlike the polynomial growth in Euclidean space. We find that this unique property is particularly effective for embedding hierarchical data structures using the Poincaré ball model, achieving significantly improved representation and discrimination power. Coupled with negative learning, it provides more accurate and robust classifications with fewer feature dimensions. Our extensive experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that the T-DHA method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in few-shot image recognition and domain generalization tasks."

An IDETSD security control method under SLAMs and random deception attacks is presented to achieve the output synchronization of delayed RDNNs. Compared with time-triggered intermittent sampled-data (SD) control strategies, a dynamic event-triggered (ET) mechanism to more effectively mitigate the impact induced by random deception attacks that intentionally tamper with the state transmission signals from sensors to controllers is introduced in this article. Moreover, new output synchronization criteria are established by applying an ET-dependent switched Lyapunov functional (LF) and inequality techniques. Then, the desired IDETSD controller is obtained by solving linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). To validate the efficacy of the proposed approach, simulation outcomes from two numerical studies are presented."

However, high-penetration PV integration introduces critical operational challenges, including voltage violations and reverse power flows, which become progressively more pronounced as penetration levels increase and may ultimately harm user interests. To comprehensively assess the network's PV hosting capacity (PVHC) while safeguarding the interests of both PV owners and load consumers, this article proposes a novel stochastic biscenario (prefault and postfault) assessment framework, which explicitly quantifies and constrains postfault PV curtailment and load shedding, mediated by battery energy storage systems. We derive an analytical linearized expression for the nonlinear PV curtailment under all N-1 contingencies, transforming the original PVHC assessment model into a tractable mixed-integer linear programming model. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that, an inherent tradeoff exists between reducing fault-induced PV curtailment and enhancing load reliability in storage-integrated grids due to state of charge constraints, which holds significant guiding importance for the practical industrial application of PV integration. Finally, the effectiveness, and scalability of the proposed method are verified through different test systems."

Firstly, a novel dual-scale modeling approach is introduced that synergizes Galerkin-based order reduction with Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy technique to construct a relatively precise ODE-based MASs capturing the dominant dynamics. Secondly, a resilient dynamic ET strategy is formulated to orchestrate communication scheduling, which not only curtails the demand on network bandwidth but also delivers superior dynamic performance over established ET schemes. Building upon this mechanism, a distributed consensus protocol is devised with inherent robustness to counteract cyber attacks. Subsequently, by employing a constructed Lyapunov functional, sufficient criteria guaranteeing resilient cooperative control are deduced, and the corresponding controller parameters are computed by solving linear matrix inequalities. The practical effectiveness and theoretical contributions of the proposed approach are ultimately corroborated through simulations conducted on thermal management systems for cooling fins of a hypersonic vehicle."

    "abstract": "Bayesian optimization is a popular black-box optimization method for parameter learning in control and robotics. It typically requires an objective function that reflects the user's optimization goal. However, in practical applications, this objective function is often inaccessible due to complex or unmeasurable performance metrics. Preferential Bayesian optimization (PBO) overcomes this limitation by leveraging human feedback through pairwise comparisons, eliminating the need for explicit performance quantification. When applying PBO to hardware systems, such as in quadcopter control, crashes can cause time-consuming experimental resets, wear and tear, or otherwise undesired outcomes. Standard PBO methods cannot incorporate feedback from such crashed experiments, resulting in the exploration of parameters that frequently lead to experimental crashes. We thus introduce CrashPBO, a user-friendly mechanism that enables users to both express preferences and report crashes during the optimization process. Benchmarking on synthetic functions shows that this mechanism reduces crashes by 63 % and increases data efficiency. Through experiments on three robotics platforms, we demonstrate the wide applicability and transferability of CrashPBO, highlighting that it provides a flexible, user-friendly framework for parameter learning with human feedback on preferences and crashes.

    "abstract": "Today’s processing-in-memory (PIM) devices, such as UPMEM PIM, behave like computational offloading engines: applications must explicitly allocate memory ranks, upload PIM kernels, transfer data and control commands, launch kernels, and read back output data. Past research has focused on identifying offloading candidates and predicting the performance of corresponding PIM kernels. However, this is only half the truth: PIM management and data transfer overheads can easily jeopardize kernel-level performance gains, and thus must be taken into account by scheduling algorithms. These overheads, incurred as part of software development kit (SDK) operations, are application- and workload-dependent: workload partitioning (i.e., the amount and size of data transfers) often depends on workload size and resource allocation. Hence, PIM performance models must account for PIM SDK operations in addition to kernel execution, requiring time-intensive, application-specific benchmarks that must be repeated for each SDK release or workload change. We present a more efficient performance modelling approach based on behaviour models. We train a behaviour model that predicts an application’s PIM SDK operations for arbitrary workloads and resource allocations, and combine it with application-independent performance models for these operations. Thus, each application must be profiled only once, and profiling does not rely on availability of PIM modules or cycle-accurate simulation. We evaluate a proof-of-concept implementation of our approach on twelve UPMEM PIM applications, and show that it can predict application-specific PIM overheads from simulation traces with an error of less than 25 % in nine cases, and no more than 10 % in six cases."

    "abstract": "Underwater acoustic positioning responders are generally constrained by signal source power and battery capacity: shortening deployment period while increasing operational costs due to frequent requirement of battery replacement. This paper thus presents the design and implementation of a low-power circuit module allowing long operation times for both signal detection and equipment control. The module not only reduce duty cycle but also conserve battery power by allowing users to manage the responder’s operational state. The main contribution of this paper are: a) the design and detection of low-complexity wake-up signal, b) the design choice and decision of low power hardware circuitry, and c) low power embedded software deployment. Field tests are also conducted to support our claims. The results show that the duty circuit module achieves a detection probability of more than 90% with an average operating power consumption of 7.2 mW. The conventional duty circuit module’s power consumption is typically less than 100 mW; the performance index detailed in this article is considered state-of-the-art."

A comparative study between web-based and traditional laboratory methods revealed that students who used the system demonstrated improved comprehension and performance. While users praised its usability, reliability, and overall effectiveness, feedback suggested areas for enhancement, particularly in terms of innovation and long-term engagement. Findings indicate that GenB Distance Learning provides a scalable and accessible alternative to traditional lab-based learning, making science education more interactive and efficient for public school students. Future research could explore its long-term impact on learning retention and its potential integration into broader educational frameworks."

We investigate how users protect their data and what their data recovery plans look like. We identified some contradictory and surprising findings. For instance, we observed that many users were confused about who was responsible for data protection. Only 57 (11.6%) of the participants reported that data protection is a user’s responsibility. We asked participants to give a dollar value on how much their data might be worth. While 4 (0.8%) reported values of more than one million and 114 (23.1%) reported less than $100, 233 (47.3%) participants believed that their data was worth at least $1,000. However, 103 (20.9%) of those participants did not use any viable backup solution to protect their data."

    "abstract": "Estimating the number of impinging sources is an essential prerequisite for high-resolution direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation. Existing methods, such as the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Minimum Description Length (MDL), and eigenvalue gap techniques, have been widely used but often suffer from high computational complexity or poor robustness under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and small-sample scenarios. In this work, we propose and analyze two novel methods for source enumeration: (i) a normalized eigenvalue gap-based method (PM1), and (ii) a covariance trace-based method (PM2) that computes the number of sources as the ratio of the trace of the covariance matrix to the number of antenna elements. We conduct a comprehensive performance and complexity analysis of these methods in comparison with AIC and MDL. MATLAB simulations demonstrate that PM1 provides robust estimation under low SNR conditions with reduced computational overhead, while PM2 offers ultra-low complexity with competitive accuracy in moderate-to-high SNR regimes. These findings highlight the practical potential of the proposed algorithms for real-time DOA estimation in embedded systems."

    "abstract": "Detecting low-frequency faults in smart grids is challenging due to the class imbalance in fault data and dynamic changes in grid topology. To address these issues, this paper proposes a knowledge-guided self-attention graph neural network (KG-SA-GNN). First, a domain-specific knowledge graph is constructed by integrating equipment topological constraints, historical fault co-occurrence patterns, and maintenance rules, which enhances the modeling of physical relationships in the power grid. Second, a dynamic self-attention mechanism is introduced that incorporates relationship weights and fault frequency priors to adaptively focus on critical propagation paths and improve classification performance. Experimental results on the IEEE 39-node system show that the proposed method achieves a recall rate of 78.6% for cascading faults, outperforming SMOTE-GNN by 14.9%. The false alarm rate is reduced by 9.5%, and the macro-average F1-score reaches 87.1%. The results demonstrate that KG-SA-GNN provides an effective solution for imbalanced fault diagnosis in smart grids."

However, determining the optimal sensor placement remains a key challenge affecting detection accuracy and practical deployment. This study examines the influence of sensor position on fall detection performance using the proposed FD-ResNeXt, a deep residual network enhanced with multi-kernel modules and cardinality to improve feature representation from time-series signals. Experiments were conducted on the UpFall dataset, which includes fall and activities of daily living data collected from 17 participants wearing sensors at five body locations: ankle, right pocket, belt, neck, and wrist. The proposed model was trained and validated using five-fold cross-validation with both accelerometer and gyroscope data under single- and multi-sensor configurations. The results show that sensor placement has a significant impact on performance. The neck-mounted sensor achieved the highest accuracy (99.15%), followed by the ankle (98.55%) and belt (98.22%) positions. The wrist showed moderate improvement (97.03%), while the right pocket performed poorly (33.98%). Combining accelerometer and gyroscope data enhanced overall accuracy, confirming the advantage of multi-sensor fusion. The findings underscore critical trade-offs between placement, accuracy, and usability, offering valuable insights for designing robust, user-friendly fall detection systems."

Results reveal that both groups rely heavily on expert testimony, statistics, known facts, and logical reasoning. AI-generated essays exhibited quantitative superiority in expert testimony (p=0.002), statistics (p<0.001), and examples (p=0.017), but qualitative deficiencies in contextual specificity. For instance, AI essays prioritized generalized examples (e.g., \"Some companies ignore regulations\") and authoritative sources (e.g., WHO citations), while student essays integrated context-specific cases (e.g., \"Foxconn discharged 12,000 tons of wastewater in 2022\") and nuanced logical reasoning. Notably, known facts and shared beliefs were significantly overrepresented in AI outputs (p<0.001), reflecting a tendency toward consensus-based arguments. Pedagogically, we propose a hybrid approach: students should strategically integrate AI-generated authoritative evidence (e.g., expert citations, statistics) with human-curated contextualized examples and critical analysis to balance persuasiveness, originality, and engagement."

This work introduces a deployable adaptive assessment framework that combines psychometric modeling with confidence calibration. Items are authored with Revised Bloom’s Taxonomy to make cognitive demand explicit, and learner ability is estimated with Item Response Theory while mastery progression is tracked with Bayesian Knowledge Tracing. A 1–5 confidence rating is captured after each response, enabling calibration feedback and targeted nudges when confidence and accuracy diverge. Evaluation follows a hybrid protocol. Psychometric analyses are conducted on the Eedi dataset from the NeurIPS 2020 Education Challenge, showing moderate accuracy (64%), high reliability (KR20 = 0.98), and weak discrimination, highlighting the need for improved item authoring. Calibration analyses use the OSF Confidence Database, where learners display mild underconfidence and notable calibration error (ECE 0.52), confirming the value of integrating confidence capture.≈A construct validity check also links taxonomy-based difficulty tags with empirical IRT difficulty estimates. The results demonstrate that combining psychometric rigor with calibration-aware feedback is both feasible and informative. By aligning taxonomy tagging, item calibration, mastery tracking, and confidence capture, the proposed framework offers a transparent and practical path toward adaptive systems that improve learning accuracy while reducing metacognitive bias."

The seasonal frozen ground area is widely distributed in Xinjiang. Due to the influence of the climate of the seasonal frozen ground area on the shallow engineering geology, the electromagnetic environment of the seasonal frozen ground area shows seasonal changes, which leads to the great influence of the season in the propagation process of the electromagnetic wave in the shallow geology, which brings great trouble to the amplitude recovery of the ground penetrating radar data. In this paper, based on the relative permittivity data of Kaba-he in the seasonal frozen soil area of Xinjiang, the non-absorbing soil permittivity model in different seasons is constructed. Taking the metal pipe as an example, the reflection amplitude data of the metal pipe in different seasons are simulated by gprMax software, and the reflection amplitude data are restored to the same depth by the method of amplitude recovery. The particularity of amplitude recovery from ground penetrating radar (GPR) data in seasonal freezing area is discussed."

We design state, action, and reward formulations that capture QoS priorities and implement training/inference with lightweight overhead suitable for online deployment.

Educators have keenly recognized the advantages of this technology, leveraging AIGC as an instructional aid to create dynamic course materials and design diverse teaching activities, thereby significantly enriching classroom presentations. Students, on the other hand, enthusiastically utilize AIGC to enhance learning efficiency — for instance, employing intelligent translation software to overcome language barriers or refining essay content with AI-assisted writing tools. As the frequency of AIGC applications in educational settings continues to rise, profound shifts in pedagogical paradigms have emerged. The traditional binary \"teacher-student\" structure is transitioning into a ternary \"teacher-student-machine\" framework, fostering more flexible classroom interactions, personalized learning resource delivery, and greater autonomy and selectivity in learning pathways."

Its quality serves as a critical indicator of institutional teaching standards. With artificial intelligence profoundly impacting higher education, global institutions are rapidly integrating AI-related courses and applications, making early prediction of thesis quality grades increasingly imperative. This study leverages multidimensional data from engineering students over three consecutive academic years. Feature engineering and SMOTE oversampling techniques were employed to address data imbalance and enhance model performance. The processed dataset was fed into four models for training and testing: Random Forest (RF), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Following hyperparameter optimization via grid search, all models demonstrated strong performance across evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.Notably, the Random Forest(RF) model achieved a prediction accuracy of 87.85%, significantly outperforming comparative models. This research confirms RF's efficacy in forecasting thesis quality grades, providing data-driven decision support for reducing delayed graduation rates and optimizing educational resource allocation. Consequently, it advances practical applications of educational data mining."

    "abstract": "Efficient selective communication is critical in lowcost multi-robot systems to avoid network congestion and high computational overhead. However, identifying collision-risk neighbors quickly and accurately remains a challenge. We propose a LiDAR-guided adaptive RSSI filtering algorithm for coordinating object selection. To stabilize raw RSSI signals, our method adapts the EWMA filter by integrating LiDAR distance information. This ensures signal stability while enabling a rapid response as robots approach. Furthermore, a dynamic RSSI risk threshold is established, triggering communication only when a neighbor's signal strength indicates it is a coordination object. Experiments show the algorithm's responsiveness is significantly superior to baseline methods, including standard EWMA. Its computational time is comparable to EWMA and much lower than complex Kalman filter-based methods, demonstrating enhanced response capability while maintaining low overhead."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a two-layer Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework integrated with an Improved Cloud Drift Optimization (ICDO) algorithm to address the economic dispatch problem in renewable-energy-powered microgrids with hybrid energy storage systems (HESS). The upper-layer MPC performs long-term economic scheduling with battery degradation cost consideration, while the lower-layer MPC handles short-term power fluctuation suppression and prediction error compensation. To enhance the global optimization capability and computational efficiency of the non-convex upper-layer problem, an ICDO algorithm is introduced, incorporating sinusoidal chaotic mapping initialization, a ring topology strategy, and a multi-layer adaptive parameter mechanism. Simulation results under various electricity price and uncertainty scenarios demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces operating costs, mitigates battery degradation, and improves computational performance compared to conventional solvers and other swarm intelligence algorithms."

    "abstract": "With the rapid rise in renewable energy penetration, ensuring the secure and efficient integration of large-scale renewable generation has become a critical challenge for contemporary power systems. Accurately and promptly evaluating the renewable energy absorption capacity is essential for the reliable planning, real-time operation, and intelligent control of modern grids. Traditional assessment approaches based on deterministic mathematical models often involve intricate formulations and high computational burdens. On the other hand, methods driven by artificial intelligence frequently struggle to capture the inherent stochasticity and multi-time-scale volatility of renewable sources and loads, thereby compromising the accuracy of their predictions. To this end, this paper proposes a method for evaluating renewable energy absorption capacity of power systems based on fine-tuning large language model to solve the above challenges. First, short-term fluctuations and long-term trends in power grid operation data are extracted based on the bidirectional time convolution network; second, the text description of the power grid operation data is encoded; then, the timing feature encoding vector and the text description encoding vector are spliced, and the pre-trained large language model is input for LoRA fine-tuning to build a nonlinear mapping relationship between the power grid operation data and renewable energy absorption capacity; finally, the calculation simulation and experimental verification are carried out based on a provincial power grid in China. The results show that the method proposed in this paper has higher evaluation accuracy and speed than traditional models."

Day-Ahead peak shaving is formulated with a weighted objective that minimizes peak–valley spread and BESS energy throughput, solved via an improved Beluga Whale Optimization under power, ramp-rate, and SOC-zoned constraints. For real-time regulation, Swing Door Trending smooths AGC commands for the thermal unit while the BESS rapidly compensates residuals.

    "abstract": "Code review (CR) is essential to software development, helping ensure that new code is properly integrated. However, the CR process often involves significant effort, including code adjustments, responses to reviewers, and continued implementation. While past studies have examined CR delays and iteration counts, few have investigated the effort based on the volume of code changes required—especially in the context of GitLab’s Merge Request (MR) mechanism, which remains underexplored. In this paper, we define and measure CR effort as the amount of code modified after submission, using a dataset of over 23.6k MRs from four GitLab projects. We find that up to 71% of MRs require adjustments post-submission, and 28% of these involve changes to over 200 lines of code. Surprisingly, this effort is not correlated with review time or the number of participants. To better understand and predict CR effort, we train an interpretable machine learning model using metrics across multiple dimensions: text features, code complexity, developer experience, review history, and branching. Our model achieves strong performance (AUC 0.84–0.88) and reveals that complexity, experience, and text features are key predictors. Historical project characteristics also influence current review effort. Our findings highlight the feasibility of using ML to explain and anticipate the effort needed to integrate code changes during review."

EAMS-GAN offers advanced capabilities, including anti-eavesdropping, sender authentication, and secure multicasting, illustrating the potential sophistication of next-generation botnet operations. Experimental results show that the system achieves 99% payload transmission accuracy and 100% command communication accuracy without degrading image quality.

Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) offer an effective means to dynamically manipulate wireless channels for performance enhancement. This letter proposes a novel RIS-assisted terahertz physical layer security (PLS) precoding scheme aimed at 6G ultra-high-speed secure communication requirements, providing a core solution to the security transmission challenges in THz broadband scenarios. The scheme precisely resolves the double beam splitting bottleneck caused by the coupling between RIS and THz broadband through beam focusing and shaping technology, achieving directional concentration of signal energy and leakage suppression from a spatial perspective; further innovatively, the artificial noise (AN) is projected into the channel null space of legitimate users, leveraging the ultra-wide bandwidth advantage of THz to construct a full-band interference barrier. In the end, the simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

Starting from the influence of oscillation on the conduction law of the armature winding, the expression of the armature current was derived, and the expression of the armature magnetic field was further extracted to predict the harmonic characteristics in terms of excitation current. Simulation verification was implemented on an 8-pair pole 3-phase brushless exciter, and the experimental verification was completed on a 7-pair pole 3-phase brushless exciter. The research indicates that the specific frequency harmonics in the excitation current of the brushless exciter can be utilized to monitor the torsional vibration of the turbogenerator shaft system."

    "abstract": "Infrared remote sensing imagery has emerged as a critical data source in environmental perception and intelligent monitoring, with significant potential in scenarios requiring robust performance under low-light, nighttime, or complex atmospheric conditions. Improving the perception capability of vision models for infrared images is essential to these applications. However, existing vision models pre-trained on RGB data often underperform in the infrared domain due to the severe distribution shift. To bridge this gap, we systematically investigate self-supervised learning for infrared imagery from three perspectives: data, preprocessing, and pre-training paradigm. This work identifies three core challenges hindering effective infrared pre-training: 1) the lack of large-scale infrared pre-training datasets, 2) the non-iconic characteristic of infrared images, and 3) the scarcity of fine-grained textures. To mitigate the data scarcity, we construct a large and diverse dataset called Multi-Scene Infrared Pre-training (MSIP), consisting of 178,756 images. As for the non-iconic characteristic, a simple yet effective image preprocessing method, Object-Sensitive Random RoI Cropping (OS-RRC), is introduced. To alleviate the negative impact of weak textures on feature learning, we propose a novel pre-training paradigm called Continual Pre-training with ADapter (CPAD), which incorporates adapters to learn domain-specific features while freezing off-the-shelf pre-trained models to retain the general feature extraction capability. Furthermore, to overcome limitations of vanilla adapters in CPAD, we introduce the patchwise-scale adapter equipped with dynamically learnable scale factors, allowing for pre-training once and subsequent application to various tasks. Extensive experiments show that the proposed framework achieves notable performance gains across three representative downstream tasks, validating its effectiveness for infrared image analysis in environmental monitoring and intelligent perception systems."

    "abstract": "Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) systems deployed on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are emerging as a highly promising solution for a wide range of future remote sensing and monitoring applications. The integration of SAR’s well-established capabilities for high-resolution imaging and change detection with the flexibility, maneuverability, and cost-effectiveness of modern UAV platforms unlocks significant potential for innovative sensing missions. However, the practical implementation of SAR on UAVs presents considerable challenges, primarily due to the inherent limitations in UAV flight stability and precise navigation, which degrade image quality. As a result, robust autofocusing techniques are essential to correct motion-induced phase errors and ensure coherent image reconstruction. While numerous autofocusing methods have been proposed in the literature, most are designed under assumptions that do not hold for low-flying UAV platforms. Specifically, conventional algorithms often overlook the strong dependence of the SAR imaging geometry on both azimuth and range positions of the targets, which becomes pronounced at low altitudes. In this study, we introduce a novel autofocusing approach termed Geometry-Aware Entropy Minimization (GAME). The proposed algorithm reconstructs three-dimensional positioning errors by explicitly modeling the spatially variant acquisition geometry along the UAV trajectory. This geometry-aware formulation enables accurate autofocus correction under the challenging conditions associated with low-altitude UAV SAR acquisitions. The effectiveness of the GAME algorithm is demonstrated using real X-band SAR data collected by an octacopter platform, confirming its applicability and performance in practical scenarios."

To alleviate the conflicts amongst privacy, data property, and real-time performance for an LBS in the Internet of Vehicles, a secure point-of-interest information retrieval scheme is presented in this paper. We developed a lightweight fully homomorphic encryption algorithm based on the hardness of the discrete logarithm conjugacy search problem (DLCSP) and implemented it as an oblivious transfer (OT) protocol that not only conceals the query but also safeguards the data assets of the server. The effectiveness of our proposed method was validated experimentally. The results showed that our scheme outperformed state-of-the-art methods in terms of both computation and communication overhead, particularly on the server side. In addition, a simulation-based security validation demonstrated that our scheme is more robust when defined as an OT."

    "abstract": "Integrating multiple (sub-)systems is essential to create advanced Information Systems. Difficulties mainly arise when integrating dynamic environments, e.g., the integration at design time of not yet existing services. This has been traditionally addressed using a registry that provides the API documentation of the endpoints. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown to be capable of automatically creating system integrations (e.g., as service composition) based on this documentation but require concise input due to input token limitations, especially regarding comprehensive API descriptions. Currently, it is unknown how best to preprocess these API descriptions. In the present work, we (i) analyze the usage of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for endpoint discovery and the chunking, i.e., preprocessing, of state-of-practice OpenAPIs to reduce the input token length while preserving the most relevant information. To further reduce the input token length for the composition prompt and improve endpoint retrieval, we propose (ii) a Discovery Agent that only receives a summary of the most relevant endpoints and retrieves specification details on demand. We evaluate RAG for endpoint discovery using (iii) a proposed novel service discovery benchmark SOCBench-D representing a general setting across numerous domains and the real-world RestBench benchmark, first, for the different chunking possibilities and parameters measuring the endpoint retrieval accuracy. Then, we assess the Discovery Agent using the same test data set. The prototype shows how to successfully employ RAG for endpoint discovery to reduce the token count. Our experiments show that endpoint-based approaches outperform naüve chunking methods for preprocessing. Relying on an agent significantly improves precision while being prone to decrease recall, disclosing the need for further reasoning capabilities."

    "abstract": "Physiological signals such as respiration and heart rate are critical indicators for real-time health monitoring. Although conventional contact-based sensors like electrocardiograms offer high accuracy, they are limited by discomfort, hygiene concerns, and poor long-term usability. Radar-based and wireless RF sensing technologies have emerged as promising non-contact alternatives; however, they face challenges such as environmental interference, line-of-sight constraints, and limited signal selectivity. Additionally, hardware complexity, phase noise, and low signal-to-noise ratio hinder performance in dynamic environments. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel physiological sensing system based on spoof surface plasmonic (SSP) metamaterial structures. These SSP-based sensors offer a low-profile design, material compatibility, and strong surface wave confinement, along with radiative capabilities for short-range wireless communication. By integrating SSP waveguides with radiative elements, the system enables passive, indirect-contact, and reliable detection of vital signs, providing improved robustness over traditional radar-based solutions. Furthermore, the system supports remote sensing and IoT-based connectivity, enabling seamless integration into healthcare monitoring networks. Experimental validation confirms the system’s potential for unobtrusive health monitoring in clinical settings. This work lays the groundwork for metamaterial-assisted sensing systems in next-generation biomedical applications."

    "abstract": "In inaccessible environments with uncertain task demands, robots often rely on general-purpose tools that lack predefined usage strategies. These tools are not tailored for particular operations, making their longevity highly sensitive to how they are used. This creates a fundamental challenge: how can a robot learn a tool-use policy that both completes the task and prolongs the tool’s lifespan? In this work, we address this challenge by introducing a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that incorporates tool lifespan as a factor during policy optimization. Our framework leverages Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and Miner’s Rule to estimate Remaining Useful Life (RUL) based on accumulated stress, and integrates the RUL into the RL reward to guide policy learning toward lifespan-guided behavior. To handle the fact that RUL can only be estimated after task execution, we introduce an Adaptive Reward Normalization (ARN) mechanism that dynamically adjusts reward scaling based on estimated RULs, ensuring stable learning signals. We validate our method across simulated and real-world tool use tasks, including Object-Moving and Door-Opening with multiple general-purpose tools. The learned policies consistently prolong tool lifespan (up to 8.01× in simulation) and transfer effectively to real-world settings, demonstrating the practical value of learning lifespan-guided tool use strategies."

    "abstract": "The revolution of information technologies is blur-ring the boundary between physical and virtual worlds, with digital twin (DT) at the forefront of this transformation. Mean-while, DT is evolving from offering simple data mirrors to smart copilots, capable of understanding user’s intents and proactively providing profound insights. This ushers in the pivotal cognitive stage of the DT, where humans or embodied artificial intelligence agents (EAIs) can obtain cognitive perceptions within the DT world. Among various issues, in the cognitive stage, establishing strong interactions between the physical and DT worlds is critical. This paper thus explores the Next-Generation Semantic Communication (NextG-SemCom), well-suited for this issue, to fully enable the DT world with human-like cognitive capabilities. NextG-SemCom is envisioned as a cognitive-native paradigm that leverages Large AI Models (LAMs) as its core engine to perform intent understanding, contextual planning, and intent-oriented generative extraction. NextG-SemCom establishes a closed cognitive loop that shifts communication from data-driven to cognitive-driven, thereby not only reducing the traffic overhead, but also achieving cognitive comprehension of the transmitted information. This paper provides the first survey of the NextG-SemCom driven DT world, focusing on the advancement, trend and vision. We start by tracing the evolution of the DT from the initial virtual mapping stage to the current cognitive stage, and detail the distinguishing features of NextG-SemCom. We then present a holistic framework of cognitive interactions in the DT world, analyzing its core components, including the NextG-SemCom codec and network management, along with its design requirements and challenges. Furthermore, we discuss potential applications across a spectrum of human-human, human-EAI, and EAI-EAI interactive scenarios. Finally, we outline future research directions to provide a roadmap and inspire further studies in this promising field."

    "abstract": "Power system operators currently use deterministic optimization for unit commitment (UC). However, increased uncertainty caused by, e.g., intermittent renewable energy can reduce the social welfare from these UC solutions. To improve deterministic solutions given uncertainty, operators can bias forecasts of uncertain quantities, e.g., wind power production or load. Another option is to use virtual bidders, who are financial participants that arbitrage prices between forward and real-time markets. Alternatively, operators can directly address uncertainty with stochastic optimization, which will provide better solutions if the uncertainty distributions are known. However, stochastic UC is generally not used. The objective of this paper is to compare the social welfare obtained by stochastic UC, deterministic UC with demand biasing, and markets with virtual bidders. We provide examples where deterministic UC cannot recover the stochastic commitment independent of the bias value. We also show an example where virtual bidders neither recover the stochastic optimum nor the deterministic optimum with biasing. Finally, we provide computational examples where we fail to recover the stochastic solution on larger systems. From these results, we conclude that current deterministic methods likely suffer from a performance gap compared to stochastic methods, even under demand biasing and virtual bidding."

Existing physical backdoor attacks either lack stealth, provide inflexible attack control, or ignore emerging Vision-Large-Language-Models (VLMs). In this paper, we introduce FIGhost, the first physical-world backdoor attack leveraging fluorescent ink as triggers. Fluorescent triggers are invisible under normal conditions and activated stealthily by ultraviolet light, providing superior stealthiness, flexibility, and untraceability. Inspired by real-world graffiti, we derive realistic trigger shapes and enhance their robustness via an interpolation-based fluorescence simulation algorithm. Furthermore, we develop an automated backdoor sample generation method to support three attack objectives. Extensive evaluations in the physical world demonstrate FIGhost's effectiveness against state-of-the-art detectors and VLMs, maintaining robustness under environmental variations and effectively evading existing defenses."

    "abstract": "Recent lightweight salient object detection (SOD) models for strip steel surface defect typically adopt classification model as encoder to extract semantic features, followed by task-specific decoder for defect detection. Despite achieving promising results, these models often overlook the potential of leveraging class-level knowledge to enhance detection performance. In this paper, we propose a Class Knowledge-Guided Lightweight Network (CKLNet) for salient object detection of strip steel surface defect. Particularly, CKLNet employs a three-stage training strategy. In the first stage, a general SOD model is trained to perform initial detection of surface defect. Then, the second stage constructs a classification branch built upon the general SOD model to extract defect class knowledge. Embarking on this class knowledge, multiple class-specific decoders are trained in the third stage, where we can generate refined and class-aware defect predictions. Extensive experiments on two datasets demonstrate that CKLNet achieves superior detection performance and generalization capability when compared with the cutting-edge lightweight models, with real-time inference speed of 783 FPS on an RTX 2080Ti GPU. Moreover, unlike existing models that only enable defect localization, our CKLNet further provides accurate defect class identification.

The slotted patch structure and folded stub loading on the 1.69 2.2 GHz low-band (LB) antenna effectively suppress LB scattering effects while simultaneously generating a partially reflected wave for the 3.3–3.8 GHz high-band (HB) antenna to mitigate coupling between HB elements. Additionally, four circular parasitic elements are arranged around the LB antenna to further reduce coupling among the HB antennas and broaden the LB bandwidth, without requiring additional decoupling layers. A detailed analysis of the decoupling mechanism provided by the slotted patches and folded stubs is conducted. Measurement results confirm that the proposed design achieves excellent decoupling performance, restores the radiation patterns of the HB antennas, achieves an isolation level better than 25 dB, and delivers outstanding performance in both LB and HB frequency bands."

Traditional methods for detecting illegal parking rely heavily on active human effort and customized sensors, which are extremely cost-ineffective to cover large-scale cities.

    "abstract": "With the accelerated development of the global energy Internet and the integration of green and clean energy, the future power grid has posed more strict demands for the accuracy and stability of power load prediction. This paper proposes a novel deep neural network model, TCN-LSTM, that integrates Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and is enhanced by an adaptive attention mechanism and a hybrid loss function (MSE-CE). The main contributions of the research are Architectural Innovation, Training Optimization, and Empirical Validation. A dual-module design leverages TCN to capture long-term dependencies and LSTM to model temporal dynamics, while the attention mechanism dynamically prioritizes critical features, significantly improving feature utilization. Furthermore, the research combines the designed prediction model with a digital twin to construct a dynamic simulation environment for the power system, enabling real-time mapping and predictive feedback on the power grid’s operating status. This enables real-time updates and dynamic optimization of the prediction model, enhancing the adaptive capability of load forecasting. The comparison index data show that, in short-term load forecasting, the average absolute error, average absolute percentage error, and root mean square error of the proposed algorithm in the research are 52.1, 0.0059, and 70.9, respectively. Compared with other algorithms, they are reduced by an average of 30.03, 0.0028, and 26, respectively. In terms of long-term prediction results, the average absolute error, average absolute percentage error, and root mean square error of the proposed algorithm in the research are 57.2, 0.0081, and 80.9, respectively, which are on average reduced by 39.43, 0.0062, and 32.47 compared with other algorithms.

Although recent studies have extended multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to these tasks, they still face significant challenges in fine-grained multi-target scenarios. To address this, we propose MTRAG, a pixel-level multi-target referring and grounding framework that leverages semantic-spatial collaboration. Specifically, we introduce a Channel Extension Mechanism (CEM) that enables a global image encoder to extract global semantics and multi-region representations while retaining background context, without extra region feature extractors. Moreover, we introduce a grounding branch for pixel-level grounding and design a Hybrid Adapter (HA) to fuse semantic features from the MLLM branch with spatial information from the grounding branch, thereby enhancing the semantic-spatial alignment. For training, we meticulously curate MTRAG-D, a dataset comprising single-and multi-target referring and grounding samples derived from existing datasets and newly synthesized free-form multi-target referring instruction-following data. We also present MTR-Bench, a benchmark for systematic evaluation of multi-target referring. Extensive experiments across five core task, including single- and multi-target referring and grounding as well as image-level captioning, show that MTRAG consistently outperforms strong baselines on both multi- and single-target tasks, while maintaining competitive image-level understanding.

    "abstract": "The completion of sparse Location-Based Service (LBS) data for modeling urban-scale origin-destination (OD) flow is of great importance to transportation planning applications. Sparse trajectories lack realistic human mobility patterns. Only with completed trajectories one can derive urban-scale OD flow that resembles complete travel diaries as those gathered by surveys or actively collecting phone applications. We present DeepTimeGeo (DTG), a transformer encoder-only model that reconstructs complete trajectories from sparse LBS inputs. We adopt a rank-based representation of locations to preserve individual-level heterogeneity and take a sequence-to-sequence approach to address the issue of gradient back-propagation blockage when it comes to regulating human mobility patterns. We devise human mobility distribution-based loss functions and leverage auxiliary learning to model the dynamics of exploration versus returns in users’ spatial choices. Experimental results show the superiority of DTG in trajectory reconstruction compared to other start-of-the-art generative models for human mobility trajectories. We conducted a case study with LBS data in the city of Coral Gables, Florida. The case study reveals that DTG leads to a reduction of more than 15% (1.35 vs. 1.60), when compared to the state-of-art model, in the cross-entropy loss that measures the deviation from the ground truth departure time distribution. We further demonstrate through SUMO simulation that DTG-generated trip demand captures both morning and evening rush hours, enabled by the more accurate distribution of trip departure time with important implications for traffic estimates."

    "abstract": "Out-of-distribution states in robot manipulation often lead to unpredictable robot behavior or task failure, limiting success rates and increasing risk of damage. Anomaly detection (AD) can identify deviations from expected patterns in data, which can be used to trigger failsafe behaviors and recovery strategies. Prior work has applied data-driven AD on time series data for specific robotic tasks, however the transferability of an AD approach between different robot control strategies and task types has not been shown. Leveraging time series data, such as force/torque signals, allows to directly capture robot-environment interactions, crucial for manipulation and online failure detection. As robotic tasks can have widely signal characteristics and requirements, AD methods which can be applied in the same way to a wide range of tasks is needed, ideally with good data efficiency. We examine three industrial robotic tasks, robotic cabling, screwing, and sanding, each with multi-modal time series data and several anomalies. Several autoencoderbased methods are compared, and we evaluate the generalization across different robotic tasks and control methods (diffusion policy-, position-, and impedance-controlled). This allows us to validate the integration of AD in complex tasks involving tighter tolerances and variation from both the robot and its environment. Additionally, we evaluate data efficiency, detection latency, and task characteristics which support robust detection. The results indicate reliable detection with AUROC exceeding 0.96 in failures in the cabling and screwing task, such as incorrect or misaligned parts and obstructed targets. In the polishing task, only severe failures were reliably detected, while more subtle failure types remained undetected."

In this article, the method of combining deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is used to construct the corresponding control algorithm model. In this model, the DRL framework is carefully constructed, the state space, action space and reward function are reasonably defined, and an improved algorithm is designed based on deep Q network (DQN) to optimize the control strategy. By building an experimental platform including simulated photovoltaic array, energy storage battery pack and other components, the experimental verification is carried out under various working conditions such as rapid change of light intensity, sudden change of load and fluctuation of grid voltage. The results show that, compared with the traditional fixed strategy control, the inverter based on this algorithm model has fast active power output response and small fluctuation when the light intensity changes. When the load changes suddenly, the reactive power adjustment is accurate and fast; When the grid voltage fluctuates, it can effectively realize the coordinated regulation of P and Q. The control method of integrating DRL can improve the control performance of the optical storage coupled inverter and ensure the system stability and power quality."

However, university students are increasingly facing ethical challenges in their use of AI technologies. This growing concern highlights the need for robust assessment tools that can accurately measure students’ understanding of AI ethics. Although several studies have examined assessment instruments for AI literacy among university students, few have focused on the development of rigorously validated cognitive tests specifically targeting AI ethics. To address this gap, we developed the AI Ethics Test (AIEt). This study presents test design, content validation procedures, and pilot testing. The test was developed using the Evidence-Centered Design (ECD) framework, and 7 constructs were covered. A rigorous validation process was conducted, including expert reviews and cognitive interviews with students, to ensure content validity. Then, pilot testing was implemented at a public university in southwest China, involving 96 first- and second-year students. Item analysis was carried out, and informed revisions were made to enhance the test validity. AIEt provides an effective and reliable tool for assessing AI ethics, laying the groundwork for future research and practices in AI education at the higher education level."

First, we propose a unique pixel coordinate system with non-uniform and affine pixel division and mapping, which helps to resolve the occlusion effects between pixels and can be well tailored for common computational imaging technology. Second, inspired by Huygens’ principle, we propose a novel integral-form signal propagation model that well captures the overall amplitude and phase effects of the pixels with arbitrary shapes and sizes, thus leading to a greatly reduced quantization error and making it suitable for large-scale scenario sensing. The proposed system model allows free pairing of transmitters and receivers in the network and makes full use of the multi-view observations, further resolving the occlusion problem any individual receiver may encounter in large-scale environment sensing. We then propose a low computational complexity alternating optimization (AO) algorithm, which iteratively performs sparse reconstruction and occlusion detection to obtain accurate sensing results. Finally, the performance of the proposed method is analyzed. Extensive numerical results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method."

Meanwhile, based on this relationship, a quantitative relationship between the variance of sampling-view data and the number of sampling points is established, and the simulation experiment results are compared and validated. The results show that the overall variance of the sampling view significantly decreases with increasing sampling-view size and tends to stabilize after reaching a certain scale, reflecting the true spectral characteristics of the surface. The variance of the sample mean is inversely proportional to the number of sampling points, and the simulation experiments agree closely with the fitted model, verifying the universality of the constructed variance model. Under the premise of meeting accuracy requirements, equivalent substitution between sampling-view size and the number of sampling points can be achieved, providing a clear quantitative basis for optimizing ground spectral sampling strategies."

    "abstract": "As learner demographics change, so do the unique needs and expectations of Gen Z in Open Distance Learning (ODL). This exploratory study investigates the decline in student engagement with self-directed online activities during their ODL degree programs. One potential factor is the lack of a structured pedagogical framework to guide novice instructional designers (IDs) in creating inquiry-based online activities that improve engagement with Gen Z learners. Inspired by the Design and Development Research (DDR) approach and guided by the Successive Approximation Model 1 (SAM1) iterative process, this paper covers Phase One of the study, aiming to redesign inquiry-based learning activities rooted in the Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework and scaffolded using the ARCS motivational design model. By integrating social, cognitive, and student-centred design principles, the study aims to contribute to the discourse on effective learning design practices for postgraduate online learners. It also highlights the need for further investigation into instructional design practices to meet the diverse learning needs of digital native students."

    "abstract": "While artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated into higher education, little is known about how learners effectively utilize generative-AI (Gen-AI) tools and prompting strategies to create multimedia content. This study employs a case study and mixed-methods approach to explore how high- and low-achieving graduate students collaboratively use Gen-AI tools to create educational videos. Using the \"Write-Create-Validate\" (WCV) framework, we analyzed the AI usage behaviors of 27 students across three video creation assignments. The results show that high-achieving students adopted more structured, goal-oriented, and iterative prompting strategies, whereas low-achieving students tended to use simpler or inconsistent approaches. Statistical analyses confirmed significant differences between the two groups in both performance and AI usage patterns. These findings highlight the importance of prompt quality and refinement in AI-assisted learning. The study offers practical guidance for designing multimedia tasks that incorporate AI and for supporting students, especially those with lower performance, through structured prompting scaffolds."

With the rise of large language models and multi-system integrations, AI-assisted tools can now aggregate artifacts across GitHub, Slack, Jira, and Google Docs to generate evidence-backed summaries for managers. While anecdotal reports suggest these tools save time and broaden visibility into contributions, no systematic framework currently exists to evaluate their effectiveness. To our knowledge, this is the first framework designed for AI-assisted performance reviews, a managerial task that has received little attention compared to developer-facing AI tools. We propose four evaluation dimensions: efficiency, fairness and coverage, accuracy and trust, and usability and adoption. Each dimension is operationalized through two practical metrics. Our contribution is to establish a research agenda that connects anecdotal reports with systematic measurement and provides both researchers and practitioners with a foundation for responsible adoption of AI in performance management."

    "abstract": "Energy efficiency and safety remain critical challenges for heavy-duty electric vehicles (HDEVs) operating in connected intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Roadway grade (slope) and Signal Phase and Timing (SPaT) phase/countdown available using V2I communication are complementary factors that affect eco-driving policies, and the twin factors have not been sufficiently researched simultaneously for Eco-driving. This paper presents SAGE-HD (SPaT and Grade-Aware Deep Reinforcement Learning for Eco-Safe Longitudinal Control of Connected Heavy-Duty EVs). The proposed technique is a legality-aware, SPaT-and grade-aware deep reinforcement learning (DRL) controller for eco-safe longitudinal driving. We use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) actor-critic policy for learning. We introduce a lightweight safety shield that enforces stop-line legality and powertrain feasibility to make learning easier. Evaluation on a 41.9km corridor with 23 signalized intersections (fixed 40s/20s green/red cycles and shared offsets) uses an identical heavy-duty powertrain and compares against a signal-aware Eco-IDM baseline. The learned policy decreases traction energy from 43.58kWh to 27.52kWh (−36.9%), shortens trip time from 47.55min to 35.57min (−25.2%), and achieves 0/23 red-light violations (baseline 1/23).Results indicate that coupling SPaT scheduling and terrain adaptation with shielded DRL advances both efficiency and stability for HD-EV operation in IoT enabled corridors."

Then, combined with four fault locations (upstream of the fault point, downstream of the fault point, both upstream and downstream, and adjacent lines), the impact of IIDG on protection is discussed. Taking the three-stage current protection as an example, PSCAD simulations verify that the protection fails to operate correctly. Subsequently, an improved adaptive current protection scheme is proposed based on the composite sequence network. For phase-to-phase short circuits and three-phase short circuits, the settings of Stage I and Stage II are determined respectively. Simulation results show that this scheme can ensure the reliable operation of protection and effectively cover the entire length of the line."

    "abstract": "Contemporary software systems frequently harbor latent defects such as dormant logic errors, untested edge cases, and hidden security flaws that slip past static analysis tools and conventional test suites, undermining both reliability and security. To address this, we introduce BugBlaze, the first comprehensive framework for real time ignition detection of latent defects powered by explainable AI. At the center of BugBlaze is the BlazeCore engine, which integrates a large language model with an attention enhanced graph neural network to jointly represent source code and runtime logs. The framework incorporates several key modules: a TriggerTrace Predictor that anticipates defect-triggering inputs with SHAP based explanations, a CollabGuard Integrator that enriches pull requests with risk scores and natural language justifications, a PatchCraft Assistant that suggests preventive patches supported by XAI reports, and a RiskHeat Visualizer that highlights vulnerable code regions directly in the editor. Complementing these is a ContextMemory Vault that adapts risk profiles based on historical data, and an XAI-Trace Explainer that records LIME-based decision traces for transparency. Deployed through an IgnitionMesh across CI/CD pipelines, VSCode, and Git workflows, BugBlaze cut latent defect incidents by 87% and reduced mean time to detection by 65% across seven large-scale projects totaling 1.2M LOC. We also discuss scalability considerations, integration trade-offs, and future extensions toward adaptive learning in multilingual environments."

    "abstract": "The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) and digital transformation is driving higher education to shift from mass education to personalized education. However, current digital and intelligent technologies are primarily applied to teaching without fully exploring their potential. Thus, based on generative AI and knowledge graphs, a digital-intelligent collaborative teaching system is proposed to construct a novel intelligent teaching environment that supports active learning and collaborative teaching. The system focuses on the cultivation of talents in electronic information fields. Specifically, it leverages large models to develop a three-dimensional knowledge graph for professional courses, enabling the recommendation of personalized learning paths for students. Meanwhile, an intelligent formula derivation engine is designed to facilitate human-machine collaborative problem setting and solving, while establishing connections between knowledge and application based on the given problems. Moreover, a wireless communication agent incorporating teacher knowledge base is constructed to provide students with professional companion learning tools. The proposed system implemented over one semester in three classes with 144 students significantly enhances teaching quality and learning effectiveness, earning positive recognition from students. This provides a low-cost, high-efficiency digital-intelligent education model for new engineering education."

Focusing on this issue, this paper thoroughly investigates the mechanism of overcurrent during the fault recovery stage and demonstrates that the increasing of virtual power angle is the dominant cause of overcurrent. Based on this finding, an overcurrent suppression strategy is proposed: by equipping the grid forming control loop with a virtual power angle saturation module, the output current is constrained within a safe range throughout the entire fault stage. Simulations validate the theoretical analysis and confirm the effectiveness of the proposed strategy."

Addressing the limitations of traditional \"wind-solar-storage\" systems constrained by the short-term energy storage characteristics of batteries, which struggle to meet the continuous energy demands of mining areas, this paper constructs an integrated \"solar-wind-storage-hydrogen\" energy system. By establishing an optimization model targeting economic efficiency, environmental sustainability, and energy self-sufficiency, and solving it using a decomposition-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA/D), a Pareto optimal solution set characterizing the trade-offs among objectives is obtained. The fuzzy decision-making method is then applied to select the optimal compromise solution. These findings provide an innovative system architecture and scientific decision-making methodology for the green transformation of mining area energy systems, holding significant theoretical value and practical implications for advancing clean and low-carbon development in mining regions."

To address these issues, an enhanced TSA algorithm based on a random position disturbance strategy (TSAD) is proposed. Key innovations include: (1) A chaotic mapping strategy for population initialization, expanding solution space coverage; (2) An adaptive guidance coefficient dynamically balancing global exploration and local exploitation; (3) A random position disturbance mechanism maintaining population diversity throughout iterations. Validated on six benchmark functions (unimodal and multi-modal), TSAD achieves significantly superior convergence precision (e.g., down to 10-21)compared to PSO, SSA, CSA, MFO, and standard TSA, particularly excelling in high-dimensional(30D) scenarios. Crucially, TSAD attains these improvements without increasing computational cost, maintaining comparable runtime to TSA. The algorithm's robustness in avoiding local optima and scalability for complex, nonlinear scheduling models underscores its practical value for real-world power system optimization tasks."

In the existing channel estimation methods, both interpolation and denoising suffer from the problem of generalization. In this paper, we propose an adaptive interpolation and multi-task learning denoising network for generalization-enhanced CSI estimation. First, we model the wireless channel based on Gaussian process (GP) and use Bayesian optimization (BO) to find the optimal parameters of the Mat´ern kernel for interpolation. For each matrix, we can find the most suitable parameters of the kernel to achieve precise interpolation adaptively. Then, we design the multi-task residual network (MT-Net) based on multi-task learning. In MT-Net, shared layers are employed to utilize the relevant information between multiple tasks. And task-specific layers are also designed to extract the characteristics of each task. Compared to single-task learning, MT-Net can achieve information sharing between multiple tasks to enhance the scenario generalization of the model. Simulation results show that when the application scenario changes, our method exhibits a stronger generalization ability compared to other neural network-assisted methods."

    "abstract": "Multi-view representation is powerful to capture the complex characteristics of real-world data by integrating complementary information from various modalities. However, in many use cases, such as boiler combustion monitoring, factors including sensor sampling frequency, equipment malfunctions, and network delays can lead to temporal asynchrony in data collection. This asynchrony leads misaligned multi-modal data, furthering the difficulty of learning optimal fused representation. To address this misalignment in multi-view data, a body of methods based on autoencoders and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) have been presented. However, those methods are incapable of jointly exploring the underlying structure inherent in each view as well as the semantic consistency and structural similarity across views. To these ends, we propose a novel sample-bundled optimization for multi-view aligned clustering, which is based on Enhanced Anchor Graph and Contrastive Propagation (termed as <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">EAGCP</b>). We state that there is semantic consistency among intra-class samples (with the same and cross views) and that the global structures across different views demonstrate similarity. By leveraging these associations, we introduce an enhanced anchor graph with learnable sample correlation and a contrastive graph with feature propagation. Specifically, each anchor graphs preserves the semantic relationship among same-view samples, while the contrastive graph propagates feature information across multi-view samples. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method on benchmark datasets by validating its effectiveness in aligning and clustering multi-view data."

    "abstract": "This article investigates stealthy attack strategies that leverage auxiliary innovations in distributed state estimation. We propose a malicious attacker who exploits both local innovations and auxiliary innovations from neighboring nodes to construct the attack. Under such attacks, the dynamics of the compromised estimation error covariance are derived, and the attacker aims to maximize the trace while maintaining stealthiness. By leveraging singular value decomposition, we derive an analytical solution to the optimal stealthy attack, together with a degraded counterpart that does not exploit auxiliary innovations. Furthermore, to alleviate computational complexity for the attacker, a lower bound of the compromised estimation error covariance trace is established, based on which a numerical solution for a suboptimal stealthy attack is developed. Finally, the theoretical results are verified through simulations on a buoyant air turbine (BAT) model."

    "abstract": "Pulsed high magnetic fields (PHMFs) have emerged as essential tools in scientific research. Consequently, the design and analysis of pulsed magnets, as the key to generating PHMFs, have garnered significant research attention. Among them, the circuit model of pulsed magnets is critical for simulating their electromagnetic behavior and predicting the discharge characteristics. In this paper, a high-frequency characterization and modeling method via high-precision impedance measurement and neural network-based parameter identification is proposed. This study eliminates the influence of parasitic parameters and performs de-embedded impedance measurements of the pulsed magnet using a vector network analyzer (VNA) in conjunction with a custom-designed fixture adapter. Based on the measured data, a circuit model of the pulsed magnet was constructed, and the values of individual components in the model were subsequently identified using a neural network. For validation, the proposed circuit model was implemented in a simulation to predict the terminal-voltage variation and discharge behavior of the magnet. The results demonstrate a close agreement between the simulated and experimental voltage data, confirming the high accuracy and strong predictive capability of the model derived using the proposed method. In specific, under broadband square-wave with excitation frequencies of 1 MHz and 2 MHz, the model achieves a time-domain mean absolute errors (MAE) of 0.058/0.038 and a frequency-domain mean absolute relative error (MARE) of 0.066/0.064."

    "abstract": "In disaster scenario, the damage of ground base stations leads to the interruption of traditional communication. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) equipped with edge servers becomes the key infrastructure for emergency rescue. However, the UAV communication face strict bandwidth constraints, while aerial image transmission and ground search-rescue tasks both have high data redundancy. Simultaneously processing bidirectional UAV-ground tasks faces the dual pressure of delay and energy consumption. To address these challenges, this paper constructs a UAV-assisted semantic edge computing network. We introduce semantic compression technology to reduce the amount of redundant information in aerial images and search-rescue task data. We minimize the system energy consumption by collaboratively optimizing the task offloading decision, semantic compression ratio, edge computing resource allocation, transmission power, bandwidth allocation, and UAV three-dimensional flight trajectory. We decompose the complex non-convex joint optimization problem into five subproblems and propose an alternating optimization strategy to solve them iteratively. Specifically, we propose a branch and bound algorithm based on continuous relaxation and Lagrangian duality to solve the offloading decision subproblem. To solve the optimal semantic compression ratio, we develop an optimization algorithm based on block coordinate descent. We propose a sequential convex approximation algorithm to solve the power and bandwidth allocation subproblem. Then we design an improved artificial lemming algorithm to plan the UAV 3D flight trajectory. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme can effectively overcome the bandwidth bottleneck, significantly reduce the system energy consumption and guarantee the delay requirement of tasks."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a Zonal Adaptive Multi-Angle Pairing Robust Inversion (ZAMPRI) method to address the challenge of limited accuracy in retrieving cross-sectional surface flow velocity using Ultra-High Frequency (UHF) streamflow radar in complex riverine environments. Building upon the conventional Teague method, ZAMPRI incorporates longitudinal cross-section partitioning, adaptive estimation of the main flow direction, robust pre-screening based on the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD), and a multi-angle pairing-weighted fusion mechanism, which enables stable retrieval of cross-sectional surface flow velocity under complex conditions such as flow direction deviation, boundary interference, and data gaps. Simulation experiments demonstrate that under noisy, data-gapped conditions, ZAMPRI significantly reduces the MAE and RMSE of the retrieved cross-sectional surface flow velocity compared to the traditional Teague method, thereby exhibiting enhanced robustness. Multi-scale validation (single survey and long-term time series) using field data from the Yangtze River further shows that the cross-sectional surface flow velocity retrieved by ZAMPRI achieves a correlation coefficient exceeding 0.9 with measurements from a horizontal acoustic doppler current profiler, demonstrating stable reflection of true cross-sectional flow velocity variations under diverse hydrological and noise conditions. This study provides a highly accurate, generalizable new approach for estimating river cross-sectional flow velocity and discharge using monostatic UHF streamflow radar."

    "abstract": "Satellite solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) provides a new opportunity to quantify vegetation photosynthesis at large scales, but individual satellite observations are usually constrained by their respective limitations regarding spatial continuity or temporal coverage. Although various reconstructed SIF products have already been generated, their spatiotemporal variability remains highly dependent on selected explanatory variables, and complementary information from multiple sensors has not been fully exploited. Here, we developed a multi-source SIF fusion framework to integrate the respective strengths of the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2), Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2), and TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) products, to generate a Fusion-based global continuous SIF time series with high quality (FSIF). Specifically, a statistical spatiotemporal fusion (STF) approach is first employed to preliminarily merge the spatial resolution and timespan advantages across GOME-2 and TROPOMI SIF observations, and followed by a Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) model to extract the information from auxiliary data and OCO-2 SIF. FSIF covers the full period observed by the three sensors from 2008 to 2022, with a 0.05-degree and 8-day resolution. The spatial distribution of FSIF is consistent with TROPOMI SIF (R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>=0.91, p<0.001), primarily attributable to the STF process, which effectively constrains spatial patterns and value ranges. Fusion with OCO-2 observations further enhances the relationship between FSIF and the Eddy Covariance (EC)-based gross primary productivity (GPP) with an R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> difference of 0.09, which benefits from the superiority of OCO-2 SIF in GPP representation.

Although satellite-based retrieval has become indispensable, existing methods often struggle to simultaneously achieve high resolution, high accuracy, and physical interpretability under spatiotemporally heterogeneous conditions. To address these challenges, we propose STaR-PM, an interpretable spatiotemporal adaptive framework for PM<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2.5</sub> retrieval.

The LSTM forecasts delay-free state evolution, while the SVGP refines these predictions by modeling structured residuals with quantified uncertainty. The approach was validated on a mobile robot teleoperation platform executing straight, circular, and mixed trajectories under round-trip delays of up to 1 s.

However, Artificial Intelligence (AI) ventures developing data-dependent solutions in Business to Business (B2B) niche markets tend to deviate from these assumptions. Drawing on a comparative multiple case study, we investigate how data dependency affects Business Model Innovation processes and trajectories in AI ventures. We contrast the early stage business model experimentation of three AI digital ventures with that of three non-AI digital ventures operating in B2B niche markets. Our data corpus comprises 11 semi-structured interviews with 119 pages of transcripts, and is complemented by informal interviews and archival data. Our analysis followed a transparent, process-oriented coding approach. The findings reveal three recurring limitations on business model experimentation from data-dependent solutions - data availability, epistemic predictability, and data path-dependency – which condition how Business Model Innovation inputs are acquired, experimentation unfolds, and how scaling trajectories emerge. The venture AI ventures in our sample deviated from classical Software as a Service scaling patterns, instead relying on service-intensive launch strategies and staged automation to build a data corpus for AI training and expansion. By specifying data dependency as a structural constraint on business model experimentation and growth, this study refines core assumptions in digital innovation and BMI literature. It provides process-level explanations for slower and staged growth trajectories in AI ventures."

Federated Learning (FL), by distributing computation across geographically dispersed clients, offers a natural framework to leverage regional and temporal variations in Carbon Intensity (CI). This paper investigates how to reduce emissions in FL through carbon-aware client selection and training scheduling. We first quantify the emission savings of a carbon-aware scheduling policy that leverages slack time-permitting a modest extension of the training duration so that clients can defer local training rounds to lower-carbon periods. We then examine the performance trade-offs of such scheduling which stem from statistical heterogeneity among clients, selection bias in participation, and temporal correlation in model updates. To leverage these trade-offs, we construct a carbon-aware scheduler that integrates slack time, $\\alpha$-fair carbon allocation, and a global fine-tuning phase. Experiments on realworld CI data show that our scheduler outperforms slackagnostic baselines, achieving higher model accuracy across a wide range of carbon budgets, with especially strong gains under tight carbon constraints."

This inherent fuzzy decision-making ability has profound implications for multimodal image fusion, where the scarcity of ground-truth data for infrared and visible light integration presents a fundamental challenge for traditional deep learning approaches. Here we introduce a zero-shot transformer architecture that mirrors human cognitive flexibility by implementing fuzzy decision-making mechanisms for pixel-level fusion weight determination. Our approach circumvents the limitations of conventional pretraining requirements through a sparse attention mechanism that selectively preserves only 15-20% of the most salient cross-modal interactions, effectively filtering out redundancy and noise. To address the computational challenges of high-resolution data, we incorporate low-rank approximation techniques that reduce the complexity from quadratic to linear, capturing over 95% of cross-modal information using a projection dimension of merely 128. The method demonstrates remarkable stability across multiple benchmark datasets, achieving a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 65.904 dB under diverse environmental conditions. Our findings challenge the prevailing assumption that dense attention patterns are essential for effective feature integration, revealing instead that multimodal fusion inherently operates in a low-dimensional space. This biomimetic approach to zero-shot learning not only advances our understanding of cross-modal feature interactions but also provides a more generalizable framework for real-world applications where ground-truth data is scarce."

In this work, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is adopted to simultaneously perform position awareness and data transmission with limited radio resources. In particular, a situation-aware hybrid sensing pattern is proposed to reduce energy consumption and the interference of sensing to communication. In this hybrid pattern, the sensing function is activated on demand based on the channel state condition that is heavily affected by the position of UAV. Besides, the position control of UAV is performed based on the sensing result to further improve the transmission rate. Then, a joint optimization problem of beamforming design and power allocation is formulated to maximize energy efficiency. To solve this mixed integer nonlinear problem, the original problem is decomposed into subproblems in Phase I and Phase II. Finally, the golden-section based Dinkelbach algorithm and the penalty based approximation algorithm are proposed to solve the Phase I subproblem with the fractional objective function and rank-one constraints. Moreover, a quadratic transform enabled joint design of remote center beamforming and UAV transmit power is proposed to solve the Phase II subproblem. Simulation results verify that the proposed UAV-assisted integration of sensing, communication, and control approach outperforms compared approaches regarding data volume and energy efficiency."

To enable autonomous decision-making in dynamic environments, large language models (LLMs) have been integrated into IoE, leveraging the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to collect cross-device data for fine-tuning and transforming human natural language intents into structured tool calls that generate executable device instruction sequences. However, the massive data streams continuously generated in IoE environments often contain sensitive user privacy information, outdated low-quality data, and potentially malicious content, which can severely compromise the performance and trustworthiness of LLM-enabled IoE. Recently, LLM unlearning techniques have emerged as essential mechanisms for removing the influence of problematic data while preserving the model’s performance on retain data. However, existing unlearning approaches typically require full or partial access to the target LLM, which does not align with real-world IoE scenarios where only API access is available. To bridge this gap, we propose a closed-box unlearning framework for LLM-enabled IoE, without updating the target LLM parameters or accessing its internal logits. Our method employs a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-enhanced dual-auxiliary architecture for forget-data detection, enabling dynamic selection of IoE response models to prevent leakage of forgotten data while maintaining optimal performance for legitimate queries. Comprehensive experimental evaluations on the TOFU dataset across multiple forgetting ratios demonstrate that our approach achieves superior unlearning effectiveness while preserving LLM utility."

    "abstract": "Data-driven methods have achieved high accuracy in diagnosing control valve faults. However, Incremental Learning (IL) methods for step signal fault diagnosis of control valves remain insufficient. First, the distinct characteristics of various step-response signals lead to data imbalance, which makes it difficult for models to extract discriminative features from step-fault data. Second, the arrival of a novel fault class necessitates full retraining and incurs prohibitive computational overhead. Finally, as the number of fault classes increases, the model tends to bias toward newly added fault classes and may suffer from catastrophic forgetting of previously learned ones. These issues collectively degrade the performance of incremental fault diagnosis models. To solve these problems, this paper proposes an incremental fault diagnosis model based on Weighted Supervised Contrastive Knowledge Distillation (WSCKD), which extends the classical Incremental Classifier And Representation Learning (ICARL) framework in three key ways. First, supervised contrastive learning (SCL) is weighted to enhance representation learning for step-response signals. In addition, a new preferred example selection method, Greedy Diversity Sampling (GDS), is proposed to limit computational overhead and is combined with knowledge distillation to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, a Balanced Bagging Classifier (BBC) alleviates the adverse effects of class imbalance. Extensive simulation experiments were conducted on a control valve system. Experimental results demonstrate that the WSCKD method outperforms existing approaches, achieving average incremental accuracies of 94.32% for 5 fault classes."

    "abstract": "Reversible data hiding in JPEG images is critical for secure multimedia applications, while, existing histogram modification schemes are confined to fixed 1D or 2D dimensions. These methods fail to adapt to the characteristics of cover images and the demands of embedded data, resulting in suboptimal trade-offs among embedding capacity, image quality, and file size. To address these issues, this study proposes a Multi-Dimensional Histogram Modification Framework that advances histograms from \"fixed dimension\" to \"variable dimension\" and extends them to high-dimensional structures. Our key contributions are as follows: first, we propose an adaptive dimension selection strategy that dynamically determines the optimal histogram dimension by evaluating the capacity and distortion for each cover image and embedding task; second, we develop a high-dimensional histogram construction method that combines AC coefficients with absolute values of 1 and 2 at the same frequency to enhance the utilization of coefficient correlation; third, we design an optimized mapping algorithm that searches for the optimal mapping matrix to minimize both distortion and file expansion. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing 1D and 2D histogram modification schemes. On average, it increases the embedding capacity by 5000 bits, improves the image quality by 0.2 dB, and reduces the file size by 4000 bits."

    "abstract": "Solar photovoltaic (PV) system has become one of the most prevalent renewable energy sources, offering numerous benefits. However, such PV failures are inevitable due to circuit issues or environmental changes. This study proposes a low irradiance PV faults detection approach based on deep learning-driven ensemble learning (ELDL). Random forest, gradient boosting, and AdaBoost are ensembled as base learners while deep neural network (DNN) is used as final decision-making of meta learning. Both internal and external features are covered as they all affect the PV performance. Double dimensionality reductions of principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis are applied sequentially to gain representative feature extraction. Different tuning strategies are adopted: 1). Hyperopt for base learners; and 2). Optuna for DNN. Hyperopt helps gain more conditional search spaces, which become difficult due to complex, different base learners in ensemble learning. As such, Hyperopt provides versatility in search spaces. Optuna gives strong generalization of DNN in optimizing hyperparameters. The proposed ELDL method is not only validated with metrics but also with a robustness test of noise injection. The results show that the ELDL method is superior to other benchmarking models."

    "abstract": "This study presents a comprehensive statistical reliability analysis of monolithic Complementary Field Effect Transistors (CFETs), focusing on the impact of process-induced variations. The analysis highlights key sources of variability, including Metal Gate Granularity (MGG), Poly Grain Granularity (PGG), Random Dopant Fluctuation (RDF), and Line Edge Roughness (LER). In smaller geometries, the gate metal (or poly-gate) grain granularities play a significant role in threshold voltage (V<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">th</sub>) variations, raising severe reliability concerns. Through calibrated statistical TCAD simulations, the ON current (I<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ON</sub>) variation of 2.82 μA (2.85 μA) is observed in the nFET (pFET) side of CFET, due to MGG for experimentally reported 5 nm grain size. In advanced technologies like high bandwidth memory (HBM), the gate is made of polysilicon that suffers from the PGG in sub-3 nm node devices. The observed coefficient-of-variance (CV) of pFET (2.19) is higher than nFET (1.45), which shows higher variability in pFET due to poly grain size variations. Further, the process-induced RDF and LER significantly alter the V<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">th</sub>. Random numbers are generated by doping atoms in the Voronoi volume of each vertex to quantify the undoped and doped channels to statistically analyze the RDF. In contrast to a doped channel with σV<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">th</sub> of 9 mV (7 mV) for nFET (pFET), the undoped scenario yields a default standard deviation (σV<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">th</sub>) of 2 mV. To characterize LER, correlation length (Λ) is a prime factor; as Λ approaches the sheet width, CV increases by 24.32% (37.22%) in nFET (pFET). Thus, the results underscore the need for stringent control over grain morphology, doping precision, and edge definition to ensure reliable CFET performance."

    "abstract": "Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) often manipulate payload or deploy mechanisms such as grippers in order to fulfill missions, possibly resulting in shifts in the center of mass (CoM) that significantly degrade the controller’s performance. Reliance on fixed-gain controllers is inadequate for real-time missions with unpredictable disturbances, including dynamic ocean environments. This paper addresses the response of an AUV as it is subjected to a change in the CoM while following predefined trajectories under realistic environmental conditions. A direct adaptive recurrent neural network is used to compute a compensation term that is added to a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller, improving its ability to respond to CoM disturbances and environmental perturbations. For comparison, a gain-scheduled PID controller using predefined gains selected by angular velocity is also implemented. MATLAB simulations incorporating full 6 degrees of freedom AUV dynamics and an environmental model demonstrate that the addition of an adaptive neural network term to a standard PID controller had a lower average tracking error after a CoM change and in dynamic conditions when compared to a gain-scheduled PID controller, improving robustness in uncertain situations."

The system integrates a secondary AVR device that continuously monitors the target's UART RX/TX pins for unauthorized serial communication activity and triggers a fast 30-ms backup-and-wipe routine upon detection, followed by bootloader restoration for reusability. This response includes a backup of application firmware using a logger to a Wi-Fi enabled SD card and a secure memory wipe, followed by automatic bootloader restoration, thereby preserving device reusability. Unlike traditional self-destruct mechanisms that render devices permanently inoperable, this solution balances data protection with operational recovery. Implemented using off-the-shelf components and standard communication protocols (UART, SPI), the system offers an accessible, low-cost approach to embedded hardware security. Experimental results show consistent triggering within 30 milliseconds, an average backup duration of 26.8 s, and an erase latency of 33 ms, validating applicability in critical environments such as industrial controllers, automotive ECUs, and offline embedded systems."

Optical backhaul provides high-capacity links, while wireless access ensures ubiquitous mobility and flexibility. However, the integration of these two domains raises challenges in energy efficiency, particularly under dense urban traffic and heterogeneous service demands. This paper proposes an energy-aware optical-wireless convergence framework that minimizes overall power consumption while preserving Quality of Service (QoS). An analytical energy model is created that represents transmission and processing costs and techniques applied to minimize the energy per transmitted bit. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves up to 38% energy savings compared to conventional designs, while maintaining comparable throughput and lower latency. The results provide an emphasis on the energy-conscious opticalwireless (EC) integration as one of the key enablers to the realization of sustainable, 6G-enabled smart city infrastructures."

    "abstract": "As the penetration of renewable energy continues to rise and conventional synchronous generators are progressively retired, the decline in system inertia and the shortage of primary frequency-regulation capability have become increasingly prominent. Renewable-energy-driven hydrogen-production systems, whose electrolyzes feature fast and controllable electrochemical processes, offer a promising avenue for providing virtual inertia support and ancillary frequency regulation. To address the transient non-linearity and multi-physics coupling characteristics of electrolyzers, this paper proposes a virtual-inertia response and frequency-regulation control method for renewable-energy-based hydrogen-production systems that explicitly accounts for electrolyzer dynamic characteristics. First, a high-fidelity electrolyzer–hydrogen-production model is developed on the basis of electrochemical kinetics, thermodynamic equilibrium, and gas–liquid mass-transfer coupling, furnishing a rigorous platform for control-strategy design. Second, within a virtual synchronous generator (VSG) framework, a hierarchical coordinated-control scheme is implemented: a dynamic-inertia compensation loop collaborates with an adaptive power–frequency (P–f) regulation module to achieve rapid, coordinated virtual-inertia support and primary-frequency response. Third, to mitigate power fluctuations caused by electrolyzer operating constraints, an energy-conservation-based dynamic-matching mechanism is formulated between hydrogen-production capacity and grid frequency-regulation demand, thereby ensuring safe and economic system operation. Finally, time-domain simulations on a modified IEEE 30-bus test system demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances key frequency metrics—including maximum deviation and settling time—while surpassing benchmark strategies in both hydrogen-production efficiency and regulation economics. The results provide effective technical support for boosting grid inertia, improving frequency stability, and enabling high-efficiency green-hydrogen utilization under high renewable-energy penetration."

Basic corrections can clean up images but struggle when conditions change quickly or when lens damage persists. This paper introduces a live processing system that addresses these issues by combining environmental correction, blindspot detection, and object recognition into one pipeline. Each frame is first corrected for weather effects, then divided into regions analyzed for sharpness, contrast, and edges. AI techniques, including LSTMs, help the system learn patterns over time and distinguish between temporary disturbances and true blindspots. Confirmed blindspots are repaired instantly before frames reach the object detector. In testing, the system identified blindspots with an 89.6% accuracy, recalled more than 82% of true defects, and improved detection confidence across degraded video. By processing input live and adapting as conditions shift, the system strengthens perception and makes autonomous vehicles more reliable in everyday driving."

In this paper, we consider how current transmission planning processes are aligned with the Energy Master Plan and Environmental Justice Law, requiring serious engagement with communities and resilience investments in overburdened communities [2], [3]. Using a systematic examination of regulatory filings, planning studies, and geospatial data from 2020–2025, we find that while equity is expressly codified in state policy, it is consistently absent from infrastructure siting decisions, benefit distribution, and public engagement processes. Regional transmission planning programs, adopted to deliver interregional reliability and efficient cost allocation across multi-state service territories, many times lack mechanisms to incorporate localized equity considerations, misaligning state mandates at the policy level and on-the-ground outcomes [4]. We identify actionable pathways to bridge this gap, including using equity-informed planning criteria, enhanced community benefit arrangements, and enhanced coordination across statewide agencies, regional grid entities, and local actors. These findings though applicable to New Jersey also provide information for other states navigating energy transition, social equity, and system reliability in multi-state power systems."

By providing environmental information to drones via satellite networks, the overall flight routes and mission efficiency of UAV are enhanced. However, the poor performance of traditional UAV path planning algorithms has become a key constraint to UAV mission execution. To address the limitations of the traditional ant colony algorithm, including its weak global search capability and slow convergence speed, an improved ant colony algorithm is proposed. First, the algorithm utilizes environmental information provided by satellites, and a multi-scale domain hopping mechanism is introduced to expand the search scope of the algorithm and enhance its search capability in densely obstructed areas. Second, an elite reinforcement strategy is employed to accelerate the algorithm’s convergence toward optimal paths while ensuring the stability of the convergence curve. Compared with the traditional ant colony algorithm, the improved ant colony algorithm reduces the average path length by 12.6%, 21.6%, 26.7%, and 30.1% on 40×40, 60×60, 80×80, and 100×100 grid maps, respectively, while requiring fewer iterations to achieve convergence. The improved ant colony algorithm demonstrates higher search efficiency compared to the traditional ant colony algorithm, achieving better path planning results and faster convergence, making it better suited to the low-latency and high-stability requirements of satellite-based environments."

However, the intermittency and volatility of renewable generation have posed significant challenges to its consumption, becoming a major bottleneck in the energy transition. As a key mechanism for integrating multiple links, source–grid–load–storage (SGLS) coordinated scheduling, combined with the advantages of artificial intelligence (AI) in big data processing and dynamic optimization, provides an important pathway to address this issue. This paper focuses on the applications of AI in renewable energy forecasting and SGLS coordinated scheduling. Starting from the core concepts of renewable energy microgrids and SGLS coordination, it reviews three theoretical foundations: renewable energy integration, coordinated optimization, and intelligent algorithms. Subsequently, it systematically surveys the current applications of AI in renewable energy forecasting and SGLS optimization and scheduling, followed by an in-depth analysis of key challenges, including covariate shift under extreme scenarios, bottlenecks in multi-source heterogeneous data integration, conflicts of interest among multiple stakeholders, and data privacy protection. Finally, the paper proposes future directions such as the integration of AI with digital twins, the application of spatiotemporal graph technologies, blockchain, and multi-agent reinforcement learning, aiming to provide theoretical insights and practical implications for AI-driven renewable energy integration and intelligent power system scheduling."

This significantly improves the model’s performance in the domain. Experimental results show that, compared with AI systems that do not employ context engineering, the proposed method achieves a notable increase in accuracy across multiple professional question sets. The study demonstrates that combining context engineering with high-quality data can rapidly and effectively enhance a general-purpose language model's domain knowledge and problem-solving capabilities without fine-tuning of the model."

To address this, an optimal scheduling strategy for VPP peak shaving considering industrial load production processes is proposed: constructing a trading framework for VPP to participate in the two markets, establishing an energy-peak shaving response model for glass factory loads to tap adjustment potential, analyzing and modeling their typical production processes using the state-task network (STN) method, and then building an optimal VPP scheduling model to enhance loads’ enthusiasm for demand response (DR) while ensuring normal production in glass factories. Case simulations show that the model can fully exploit load potential and actively participate in DR under the premise of ensuring safe production and plans of industrial enterprises, with VPP revenue increased by 8.16% and peak shaving and valley filling volume improved by 23.73%."

This paper proposes a multi-source decomposition modeling approach that decomposes complex ramping demand into three independent components: load changes, wind fluctuations, and solar intermittency, providing a novel theoretical framework for new power systems. A multi-branch LSTM neural network with dynamic attention fusion mechanism is employed to achieve specialized modeling and adaptive optimization for different component characteristics.

These networks have however common effects of being impaired by a mixture of impairments that reduce performance; fiber cuts, signal attenuation and connector losses. The conventional fault management systems such as manual supervision and threshold-based monitoring among others are limited by their capability to work and cannot be applied adequately on largescale networks. To address the challenges, the new literature has recommended the use of the techniques of artificial intelligence (AI) in fault detection and localization in optical fiber systems.In this regard, machine learning (ML models) and deep learning (DL models) offered a chance to broaden the diagnostic process capabilities because of the opportunity to discover defects in the form of an automated solution, capable and precise in realtime. Experimental testing involving hardware proves that AIbased systems outperform traditional solutions in terms of both accuracy in detecting the adverse situations, and, reduce the mean time to recover (MTTR). In addition, the models are highly scaled hence making them particularly suited to deploy the next generation optical communication infrastructures. Overall, the use of AI-based fault management systems can ensure the network reliability is improved, the disruptions into the provided services are minimized, and the efficiency of the provided work is simplified in the modern models of telecommunication."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "At present, the 380V AC power supply system of substations generally lacks independent microcomputer-based protection for the incoming and outgoing feeders, relying instead on electronic trip units to perform protection functions. Although this approach simplifies wiring, the large measurement error of electronic trip units makes it difficult to achieve proper grading coordination between the inlet line and feeder line protections. When a fault occurs in an outgoing feeder, it often results in a cascading trip, causing a voltage loss across the entire 380V bus section. Moreover, locating the fault point is difficult, which severely affects the reliability of substation power supply. This paper proposes a highly integrated microcomputer-based protection device that can realize the protection functions for both incoming and outgoing lines within a single unit. This design saves panel installation space while providing high protection setting accuracy and low time-delay error, thus resolving the grading coordination problem between inlet line and feeder protections. In addition, a bus protection scheme with a blocking mechanism is adopted. It operates independently of external signals, featuring simple and reliable logic, and ensures rapid protection response in the event of bus faults."

The proposed system enables autonomous energy management by dynamically coordinating short and long-term storage based on real-world environmental and load data.At the component level, the PEM electrolyzer is modeled using thermodynamic and kinetic equations, capturing reversible electrochemical potential, activation, ohmic, and concentration losses under varying temperature and pressure. The lithiumion battery and supercapacitor are represented via dynamic and equivalent-circuit models, respectively, with hierarchical control logic ensuring fast transient response and long-term resilience.One-year simulations at 15-minute resolution demonstrate the system achieves near-complete off-grid operation with grid interaction below 2%. The electrolyzer operates at 87% thermal efficiency at 2 A/cm<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> and maintains hydrogen purity above 99.2%. The supercapacitor absorbs 5 kW load transients within 50ms, preserving battery state-of-charge between 20% and 80% and preventing degradation. Control transitions remain stable with voltage overshoot below 3%.Sensitivity analysis shows that a ±10°C stack temperature variation leads to only ±2.5% efficiency change, and moderate pressure increase improves hydrogen compression efficiency by 5% without electrical losses. These results validate the system’s technical feasibility and operational robustness. Future work will incorporate degradation modeling, techno-economic analysis, and hardware-in-the-loop validation to support real-world deployment in residential microgrids and data centers."

    "abstract": "In recent years, the growing demand for precision management have driven a growing need for robust and efficient object detection models in tasks such as crop monitoring, yield estimation, and field condition analysis. Targets in these scenarios are often small, diverse in appearance, and embedded in complex backgrounds, which places strict requirements on both detection robustness and real-time performance. Meanwhile, practical deployments typically run on resource-constrained edge platforms such as field sensor terminals or UAV-mounted devices, making model lightweighting and inference efficiency critical. To improve inference speed and structural compactness under these constraints, this study integrates a depthwise separable wavelet convolution module, termed WTConv2d, into the YOLOv12 framework to alleviate parameter redundancy during receptive field expansion. WTConv2d effectively enlarges the receptive field while preserving a compact model architecture. In addition, the original YOLOv12 detection head is replaced with the proposed v10Detect, which removes the dependence on non-maximum suppression and further accelerates inference. Experiments on a challenging agricultural image dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves approximately a 94.1% improvement in inference speed while maintaining comparable detection accuracy, indicating a favorable trade-off between efficiency and performance for lightweight edge deployment."

The line betweenness index and voltage stability index are fused using Dempster–Shafer evidence theory to accurately identify vulnerable lines. On this basis, a DG optimization configuration model considering line vulnerability is developed, which jointly optimizes DG siting and sizing.

    "abstract": "Fully supervised change detection (CD) methods in remote sensing (RS) perform well but depend on costly and time-consuming pixel-level annotations, which are impractical to obtain at scale. Therefore, it is essential to develop annotation-efficient alternatives that can narrow the performance gap with fully supervised methods. To this end, we propose a novel weakly supervised CD framework, named RCNet, which employs dual networks to implement reliable co-training using image-level annotations. Our framework is grounded in multi-view learning of co-training and the localization ability of class activation mapping (CAM). In our approach, two sub-nets with the same architecture perform image-level change classification and pixel-level segmentation from different views. Although CAM roughly localizes changes, ambiguity and noise in its pseudo labels may cause confirmation bias, limiting performance. Our approach mitigates this bias by introducing a feature discrepancy loss to enable cross-supervision between two sub-nets. Meanwhile, CAM tends to highlight a single object, but RS images commonly contain many dense and small changed objects with complexity, resulting in decreased reliability of pseudo labels. Therefore, we present an IoU-based reliable pseudo label screening (RPLS) strategy, which minimizes the likelihood of changed areas being misidentified as unchanged, enhancing the reliability of changed information obtained. Besides, to further improve boundary fineness and internal integrity of changed areas, we incorporate an additional strong perturbation branch for each sub-net and develop a consistency regularization loss. Extensive experiments on three challenging RS image CD datasets demonstrate that our RCNet achieves competitive performance with image-level labels.

Most existing text-video retrieval methods usually directly align global video-level and sentence-level features without establishing intrinsic connections between different modalities. Furthermore, due to the asymmetry between visual and textual information, the symmetrical modeling also has inherent limitations that may affect the search performance. To mitigate these problems, we propose an asymmetric hierarchical text-video retrieval framework based on clustering prototypes. Specifically, beyond the commonly used global features, we generate video instance prototypes using clustering algorithms and derive video object prototypes from video patch tokens. The text instance prototypes can be obtained by the developed Text Prototype Generation module (TPG). Besides, the Joint-Interaction Module (JIM) and the coarse-grained instance alignment scheme are proposed to coordinate different modalities. Furthermore, the cross-correlation matrix among instances is proposed, which can further reduce the heterogeneity between video and text modalities. Extensive experiments on several datasets (including MSRVTT, and MSVD) demonstrate that our method outperforms some existing state-of-the-art methods.

Existing solutions either rely on expensive encryption schemes, employ blockchain-based verification that incurs high computational and gas costs, or use differential privacy techniques that degrade spatial accuracy. This paper introduces the Privacy-preserving Task Assignment and Payment (PTAP) framework, a lightweight solution built upon secure multi-party computation (SMPC). PTAP employs additive secret sharing and a challenge-response mechanism across three semi-honest servers to achieve anonymous task allocation and payment without blockchain or zero-knowledge proofs. The framework guarantees full unlinkability between worker identities, task locations, and payment records while maintaining accurate location-based assignment and supporting traceability for dispute resolution. Experimental evaluation using the MP-SPDZ framework demonstrates scalability to over 1.5 million workers and 7 million payment tokens. The average end-to-end completion time is approximately 35.4 seconds, with zero gas cost. Compared to the state-of-the-art AVeCQ system [15], which requires about 13 minutes and 37 MWei per transaction on the Goerli network for only 1,024 users.

This paper analyzes the energy impact on relays and end-devices using Time-on-Air (ToA)-based estimates, comparing LoRaWAN relay performance with the Long Preamble method and emphasizing trade-offs and oscillator accuracy. Our analysis reveals that the tolerance of the crystal oscillator plays a major role in the end device’s energy consumption. Specifically, using a 10 PPM crystal instead of a 40 PPM crystal, the standardized mode provides a 29% energy reduction for SF7 values compared to the Long Preamble approach for a one-hour link periodicity."

Consequently, most Natural Language Processing (NLP) studies rely on widely accessible social media datasets containing expert annotations or heuristic labels. However, it remains unclear how expressions of suicidal ideation in these datasets relate to the ideation in genuine suicide notes. In this study, we address this gap by comparing manually annotated social media datasets in English and Turkish, as well as automatically labeled English datasets, directly against genuine suicide notes using a combination of linguistic and statistical analyses, classification models, and zero shot embedding-based representations. Results show that expert labeled social media data exhibit limited overlap with suicide notes across both languages while remaining distinguishable, whereas automatically labeled data diverge substantially from the notes in all analyses. These findings indicate that the annotation method critically shapes the signals learned by the computational models and that social media data capture different stages or forms of ideation than those in suicide notes. Overall, our findings emphasize the importance of careful dataset evaluation and caution against misinterpreting model performance in suicide risk detection research, given the shared objective: supporting global suicide prevention efforts."

However, this combined system may encounter instability problem such as medium-frequency oscillation in practical application. The impedance-based analysis method is commonly used for addressing such instability problems. Nevertheless, existing research lacks an impedance model of FSC-VSPSU and does not fully conduct the stability analysis of the system. Hence, this paper develops the impedance model for FSC-VSPSU. By integrating it with the impedance model of renewable energy units, an equivalent impedance model of the entire system is derived. The system stability is then analyzed using the impedance-based analysis method. To address the instability issues, a suppression method based on a single feedback parameter k is proposed for FSC-VSPSU. This method reshapes the equivalent impedance with minimal complexity, eliminating the need for filters that typically degrade dynamic response performance in existing solutions. Simulation and experimental results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the established impedance model and the proposed control strategy."

    "abstract": "Power system stability is a fundamental requirement for ensuring reliable and secure operation of interconnected grids. Disturbances such as short circuits or generator trips can initiate or amplify electromechanical oscillations, which, if not properly damped, can compromise system integrity. In this paper, a data-driven approach known as Model-Free Adaptive Control (MFAC) is applied to the design of Power Oscillation Damping (POD) controllers for mitigating inter-area oscillation modes in large-scale power systems. Unlike traditional model-based techniques, the MFAC method does not require a mathematical model of the system, relying solely on real-time input–output data to adaptively adjust the control signal. This makes the controller particularly suitable for systems with significant nonlinearities and uncertain operating conditions. The proposed POD controllers are implemented as supplementary controllers on embedded High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) links. Their performance is validated through two case studies: a test system composed of two HVDC links and eight synchronous generators, and a full-scale model of the Brazilian Interconnected Power System (BIPS). In both cases, the MFAC approach is applied to design POD controllers in multiple HVDC links, and the performance is compared with that of POD designs based on traditional techniques. In all evaluated scenarios, the MFAC controllers exhibit effective and efficient damping of inter-area oscillation modes.

    "abstract": "Air pollution has become a risk to the ecosystem in recent years, raising health concerns. To take precautionary steps against air pollution, policymakers require precise pollution forecasts achieved through advanced techniques. This paper conducted an extensive literature review of machine learning and deep learning models used for air pollution forecasting. The literature review consisted of 60 studies, each of which focused on indoor and outdoor air pollution forecast models. In comparison, hybrid and ensemble models emerged as prominent models across multiple regions using datasets collected from monitoring stations, satellites, and sensors. A few articles included interpretable models to evaluate the correlation between the target feature and the features used for model predictions through Explainable Artificial Intelligence techniques. This study offers a comparative discussion and further enhancements to existing studies, which can help improve performance and interpretability. The use of deep learning models was highlighted for their consistent performance in spatiotemporal modelling, along with various suggestions for future enhancements."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a highly digital transmitter capable of multi-band 16-QAM modulation for capsule endoscopy, which requires a high data rate with high energy efficiency and relatively high output power to meet receiver sensitivity specifications. A counter-assisted digital phase-locked loop (CDPLL) is utilized for generating clocks across multiple bands with low noise, resulting in good error vector magnitude (EVM) performance. The EVM generated by the CDPLL is better than 1% by using the proposed time-to-digital converter (TDC) calibration. A digital power amplifier with high power efficiency helps reduce the power consumption of the entire endoscopy capsule system, powered by a battery with limited capacity. Fabricated in a 180-nm CMOS process, the transmitter achieves a maximum data rate of 40 Mbps using 16-QAM modulation. At a 1.1-V supply, it achieves a 0.27/0.26-nJ/bit efficiency with a data rate of 40 MHz, and the measured EVM is 3.24/3.7% while delivering a -5-dBm output power within a 10-MHz narrow bandwidth at 435/415 MHz for the wireless medical capsule endoscopy band in Europe and the biomedical band in China, respectively. The corresponding figure of merit is 0.86/0.82 nJ/bit/mW in each band."

    "abstract": "Autonomous exploration in an unknown environment is a critical task for quadruped robot applications. Traditional approaches based on stacked decision rules often suffer from inefficiency due to the greedy behavior. In this work, we propose a hybrid architecture that jointly employs a graph neural network (GNN) and a multi-head self-attention mechanism within a reinforcement learning (RL) framework to address myopic decision-making across spatial and temporal dimensions. The environment is represented as a topological graph, where the GNN enables the agent to learn the spatial structure of the map by leveraging topological relations. Meanwhile, the multi-head self-attention mechanism (MHSA) captures global dependencies among subregions at different positions, enabling the robot to reason over long-range spatial relationships. The RL framework further mitigates temporal greediness by encouraging policy learning from accumulated experience, which equips the robot with the ability to reason about the spatial structure of unseen areas and strike a balance between exploiting known regions and exploring unknown ones. The proposed approach was validated in publicly available simulation environments. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly reduces redundant exploration and shortens the overall planned trajectory length."

    "abstract": "For calculation of internal field distribution in and electromagnetic scattering from dielectric objects, it is shown that the conventional solution scheme for volume integral equation (VIE) using the Schaubert-Wilton-Glisson (SWG) basis functions by Method of Moments (MoM) suffers from the accuracy problem，especially for high permittivity cases. The analysis shows that this problem is resulted from the use of the half SWG basis functions directly for the boundary elements without any additional restrictions for normal continuity condition. Based on this analysis, a divergence free condition is applied in boundary elements for the electric flux density vector which results in a revised version of the VIE-SWG (VIE-SWG-R) scheme. Numerical results show that the revised version is accurate not only for low but also for high permittivity cases. More importantly, it is much more accurate than the conventional VIE-SWG scheme when the mesh size varies between λ<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><i>r</i></sub>/8 and λ<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><i>r</i></sub>/15 with λ<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><i>r</i></sub> being the wavelength in a dielectric body, particularly for high permittivity cases. Besides, the VIE-SWG-R scheme results in fewer numbers of unknowns than the conventional scheme for the same discretization. Additionally, this revised solution scheme can be implemented by a minor modification of the conventional VIE-SWG scheme."

    "abstract": "The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) faces a significant challenge: the exhaustion of publicly available fresh data. This is because training an LLM requires a large demand for new data. Federated learning emerges as a promising solution, enabling collaborative model to contribute their private data to LLM global model. However, integrating federated learning with LLMs introduces new challenges, including the lack of transparency and the need for effective unlearning mechanisms. Transparency is essential to ensuring trust and fairness among participants, while accountability is crucial for deterring malicious behaviour and enabling corrective actions when necessary. To address these challenges, we propose a novel blockchain-based federated learning framework for LLMs that enhances transparency, accountability, and unlearning capabilities. Our framework leverages blockchain technology to create a tamper- proof record of each model's contributions and introduces an innovative unlearning function that seamlessly integrates with the federated learning mechanism. We investigate the impact of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) hyperparameters on unlearning performance and integrate Hyperledger Fabric to ensure the security, transparency, and verifiability of the unlearning process. Through comprehensive experiments and analysis, we showcase the effectiveness of our proposed framework in achieving highly effective unlearning in LLMs trained using federated learning. Our findings highlight the feasibility of integrating blockchain technology into federated learning frameworks for LLM."

    "abstract": "In this contribution, the optimal stabilization problem of periodic orbits is studied via invariant manifold theory and symplectic geometry. The stable manifold theory for the optimal point stabilization case is generalized to the case of periodic orbit stabilization, where a normally hyperbolic invariant manifold (NHIM) plays the role of a hyperbolic equilibrium point. A sufficient condition for the existence of an NHIM of an extended Hamiltonian system is derived in terms of a periodic Riccati differential equation. It is shown that the problem of optimal orbit stabilization has a solution if a linearized periodic system is stabilizable and detectable. A moving orthogonal coordinate system is employed along the periodic orbit, which is a natural framework for orbital stabilization and linearization along the orbit. Two illustrative examples are presented: the first involves stabilizing a spring-mass oscillator at a target energy level, and the second addresses an orbit transfer problem for a satellite-a classic scenario in orbital mechanics. In both cases, we show that the proposed nonlinear feedback controller outperforms traditional linear control."

While the top-ranked universities are the subject of numerous academic publications, very little literature is available on universities in the lower two-thirds of the ranking list.

This study proposes the introduction of a Peripheral Outlook Index for better capturing university engagement with peripheral schools in computer science (CS). The next research phase proposes an option how to expand UBB’s global academic presence and foster early computational competencies among rural dual Moldo-Romanian citizens, via XREDUNordiclab, a virtual educational platform. A new, promising research field in education consists of acquainting children with Machine Learning (ML) to foster this much-needed shift from traditional rule-driven thinking to ML-based data-driven thinking. [2] The framework establishes priorities for independent curricular development, emphasizing zero-coding, digital citizenship, and foundational artificial intelligence competencies. Scant if any attention has been paid to ML in computing education [2] for international online classes. We introduce a proposed model, the computer science talent development model (CSTDM), for finding and developing talents in computer science in K–12 settings [3] across Romania, the Republic of Moldova, and Finland. Results gained from a virtual, English-language international classroom suggest that strong motivational engagement can mitigate initial technical limitations, enabling children to comprehend and apply foundational ZeroCode Science concepts. This article starts by introducing the theoretical, pedagogical framework for learning by collaborative design. Then, it presents the research methodology, research setting, and the empirical work and analysis.[4] Research implications and future research directions within the K-12 context are also discussed.[5] The recent findings underscore the transformative potential of virtual, motivation-centered, cross-border pedagogical ecosystems in developing equitable, AI-literate educational pipelines."

Through meta-analysis of 22 domestic and international quasi-experimental studies (total sample size N=2183), this study found that interdisciplinary learning exerts a moderate-to-high and statistically significant positive effect on promoting students' higher-order thinking, but a relatively limited effect on innovative creativity and problem-solving ability. In addition, this effect was influenced by a number of moderating variables: in terms of teaching modes, blended and contextualised teaching had a significant effect; in terms of educational stages, the strongest effect was found at the primary school level; regarding course types, the stronger effect was found in the natural sciences and medical courses; and for the degree of integration between education and technology, the best effect was found at the \"substitution\" and \"redefinition\" levels; concerning the degree of embodiment, the medium degree of embodiment had a greater impact; and in terms of achievement measurement tools, the use of domain-based measurement tools was the most effective. Looking ahead to the future, teachers should cultivate students' higher-order thinking in a targeted manner based on the characteristics of their academic subjects, flexibly design interdisciplinary activities according to their cognitive development stages, strengthen teacher training and technological empowerment, reasonably use generative artificial intelligence (GAI) to construct a new mode of human-machine collaborative teaching, and adopt multi-dimensional evaluation tools that focus on student differences to dynamically monitor and promote students' higher-order thinking development."

    "abstract": "The large-scale integration of photovoltaic (PV) grid-connected generation poses new challenges to voltage stability in distribution networks. To address voltage limit violations caused by PV integration, this paper proposes a layered PV–energy storage coordinated reactive-power control strategy. First, a voltage-state awareness score is constructed by fusing voltage deviation, rate of change, and short-window magnitude, and the voltage state is classified into four levels-\"normal, slight violation, moderate violation, severe violation\"-to enable early, quantitative perception of over-limit risk. Then, resources are coordinated in layers according to the score: under slight violations, the remaining reactive power of PV inverters at violating nodes is prioritized; if the violation persists or worsens, multi-point PV reactive power is coordinated based on \"residual capacity and electrical distance\"; in severe-violation scenarios, active-power support from energy storage is superimposed (modulated by SOC weighting and power/cycling constraints), forming a closed-loop control of \"local priority-system-wide coordination-storage backstop.\" Daylong time-series simulations on the IEEE 33-node low-voltage distribution network show that, compared with traditional droop control, the proposed strategy more effectively suppresses peak-period overvoltage within the acceptable voltage band and reduces the maximum deviation at feeder ends, significantly improving system-wide voltage compliance and overall enhancing voltage quality and operational stability of the distribution network."

Drawing upon over 20 years of pedagogical practice in beginner-level Chinese language classes at a Japanese university, this study proposes a series of \"counter-intuitive,\" human-centered teaching strategies. These strategies are not designed to oppose technology but to build a complementary relationship with it. This paper argues that by focusing on igniting curiosity, building psychological safety, fostering empathy, and valuing the process of inquiry, educators can nurture the aspects of holistic development that AI cannot replace. We conclude that this synergy between technology and humanism is the key to realizing true General Education and holistic education in the AI era."

However, its complex switching state and real-time control strategy pose challenges to the computational efficiency and accuracy of the simulation model. In this paper, a high-precision real-time simulation method combining algorithmic modeling (ABM) and average switching modeling (ATMT) is proposed. By constructing switch state coding and interlocking logic, the precise abstraction of the switching behavior of TNPC inverter is realized. In the open-loop experiment, the system compares three methods: pure SimPower Systems modeling, ABM+ATMT modeling and ABM+SimPower hybrid modeling, and the results show that the total harmonic distortion (THD) of the output voltage is less than 3.1% in the whole working condition range of modulation ratio 0.6 to 1.0, which is significantly better than the comparison method, while maintaining excellent fundamental amplitude reproduction accuracy. In the closed-loop experiment, the VF control strategy is used to verify that the proposed ABM model and the physical Simscape model have a high degree of consistency between the power grid voltage and the inverter current waveform (fundamental amplitude deviation <0.1%, THD deviation <0.03%). This study provides an effective solution for efficient and high-precision real-time simulation of three-level inverters."

    "abstract": "The extraction methods of characteristic bands and the selection of inversion models for hyperspectral inversion of soil heavy metal pollution are key factors affecting inversion accuracy. How to optimize their combination to improve inversion accuracy is a pressing challenge that needs to be addressed. In a typical heavy metal-polluted area of Yugan County, 130 soil samples were collected. The Cr content was measured using the ICP-AES (Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectroscopy) method, and their hyperspectral information was collected in the laboratory using the FieldSpec4 Hi-ResNG spectrometer from ASD. Spectral preprocessing employed a combination of Savitzky-Golay smoothing (SG), multiplicative scatter correction (MSC), and first-order differential (FD) transformation to mitigate the effects of soil scattering and noise. Three algorithms—competitive adaptive reweighted sampling CARS), Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC), and genetic algorithm (GA)—were selected to extract characteristic bands. Three inversion models—random forest regression (RFR), partial least squares regression (PLSR), and XGBoost regression—were chosen to establish the relationship between the characteristic bands and Cr content.By comparing the inversion results of soil Cr content under different combinations of characteristic band extraction methods and inversion models, it was found that the CARS and PCC methods significantly improved the predictive performance of the PLSR, XGBoost, and RFR models. The combination of SG+MSC+FD+CARS+RFR extracted 84 characteristic bands located at 350–500 nm, 1600–1850 nm, and 2100–2500 nm. After modeling, the validation results showed a coefficient of determination (R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>) of 0.75, root mean square error (RMSE) of 6.74 μg/g, mean absolute error (MAE) of 5.37 μg/g, and mean relative error (MRE) of 7.35%, indicating excellent performance in predicting soil Cr content. Subsequent experiments explore the inversion model of soil heavy metal content based on spectral data extracted from ZY1-02D hyperspectral images, with an R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> of 0.84 for the training set and an R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> of 0.36 for the test set.Taking hyperspectral inversion of soil Cr pollution as an example, this study determined the optimal model by comparing the inversion accuracy of different combinations of characteristic band extraction methods and inversion models, providing a modeling approach for small-sample inversion of soil heavy metal pollution."

    "abstract": "Efficient resource dimensioning is critical in the dynamic NFV landscape, particularly in complex 5G core (5GC) deployments. We propose a Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based solution that automatically generates NF resource configurations to meet SLA targets while optimizing infrastructure use. Since the available data maps configurations to KPIs, direct training in the reverse direction (KPIs to configurations) is infeasible. We address this with inverse input reconstruction. A second challenge arises because multiple valid configurations can satisfy the same KPI, which we solve by designing a loss function that balances inference accuracy with aggregate resource usage. Finally, since collecting sufficient experimental data is prohibitively slow (30– 60 minutes per sample), we design and implement a 5GC simulator to generate representative datasets. We evaluate our solution in this setting and show that it enables accurate and efficient configuration generation, demonstrating its feasibility for complex NFV services."

    "abstract": "The rapid iteration of generative artificial intelligence has provided a technological driver for innovation in higher education. However, there is still controversy among researchers regarding whether generative artificial intelligence can improve college students' learning outcomes, and it is unclear how generative artificial intelligence can be effectively integrated into instructional design. Therefore, this study systematically analyzed 32 relevant experimental or quasi-experimental studies from the instructional design perspective using the meta-analysis approach. The results showed that the teaching application of generative artificial intelligence had a moderately positive impact on the learning outcomes of college students. It has shown certain positive effects under different teaching content, teaching resources, teaching modes and teaching evaluation. Moreover, the learning organization form, teaching period and sample size had a significant moderating effect on the learning outcomes of generative artificial intelligence. Based on this, the study put forward some suggestions on the integration of generative artificial intelligence into teaching, in order to provide reference for educators to further practice."

An evaluation method on the basis of the entropy-weighted TOPSIS model is proposed and applied. This method calculates the weights of evaluation indicators with the tool of information entropy and assesses teacher performance comprehensively through the TOPSIS model. The results of empirical experiments show that the model effectively captures differentiation among teachers across various indicators and is particularly sensitive to those with high variability. Additionally, the increase of the sample size refines the rationality of the assessment outcomes. The model demonstrates strong adaptability for evaluating teachers in different fields, inclusive of teaching, scientific research and public services, providing a valuable reference for the classified assessment of teachers in higher education institutions."

This paper proposes the use of a novel graph learning algorithm to draw on the relationship between graph regressors and signal smoothness to predict missing signals based on weather data. Using this algorithm, our aim is to identify similarities or dependencies in the data more accurately, thereby estimating climate behavior hidden within their network structures. The outcome of this study will be to improve predictive capabilities in graph signal prediction from learned graph topology."

    "abstract": "Aiming at the issues in road crack detection, such as heavy reliance on supervised algorithms, insufficient extraction accuracy, and weak detail characterization capability, this study proposes the RKDPT algorithm for road crack detection using high-density laser point cloud data. The method achieves precise extraction of three-dimensional crack coordinates and quantification of multi-dimensional attribute information. The preprocessing pipeline adopts grid partitioning and standardization to enhance crack feature distinctiveness. The RANSAC plane fitting algorithm is employed to extract candidate crack points. By integrating local neighborhood point density and Euclidean distance, outlier removal is performed via PCA to eliminate noise and obtain the final crack points. The TIN algorithm is utilized to construct crack boundary polygons and skeleton points, based on which attributes such as direction, length, width, and depth are quantified. Experimental results show that, compared with three different methods, the proposed approach achieves F1-score and IoU of 77.32% and 63.06%, respectively, reaching accuracy levels comparable to the baseline PointNet++ model in deep learning. Comparative results indicate that the accuracy for longitudinal cracks in length, width, and depth reaches 91.63%, 87.88%, and 94.02%, respectively, while for transverse cracks, it reaches 88.50%, 84.66%, and 93.51%, verifying the accuracy of the proposed crack detection and quantification algorithm."

    "abstract": "Issues in flight tests—such as high aircraft taxiing speeds, drastic channel variations, significant challenges in acquiring channel state information (CSI) for frequency division duplexing (FDD) systems, and the resultant severe degradation of transmission rates in existing cooperative precoding—are hereby addressed. A distributed link precoding method based on reciprocity is proposed. First, CSI reconstruction is performed using partial reciprocity. Leveraging the correlation among CSI obtained at different locations, reciprocity parameters are extracted for prediction. These predicted parameters are then used to replace their corresponding counterparts in the feedback CSI, thereby achieving channel correction. When channel correlation is weak, the conjugate beamforming (CB)-based precoding algorithm is adopted; when channel correlation is strong, the zero-forcing (ZF)-based precoding algorithm is employed. This approach enables the maximum utilization of diversity gain and multiplexing gain. Simulation results show that the proposed method can achieve accurate prediction of CSI, and after precoding with the accurate CSI, higher throughput can be obtained, which improves the offloading rate of aircraft test data."

Delineating between AI-generated and human-authored content is essential for academic integrity, journalism, cybersecurity, and digital forensics. State-of-the-art detectors often rely on superficial linguistic patterns or watermarking approaches. Not only such detectors ae unreliable, one can easily evade such detectors by paraphrasing, fine-tuning, or using model ensemble techniques. This paper presents DetectLLM, a novel multi-modal detection framework leveraging a combination of fine-grained linguistic analysis and deep contextual embeddings to identify LLM-generated text across various domains and model types.DetectLLM presents a hybrid setup that merges a transformer-based discriminator trained on a varied dataset of human and LLM-authored texts. It also includes a metadata-aware classifier that picks up on temporal, stylistic, and structural signals. We also include a contrastive learning module to distinguish LLM textual fingerprints from human writing styles, even in adversarial or obfuscated environments.Our method outperforms state-of-the-art LLM output detectors across multiple benchmarks, for content generated by GPT, Claude, LLaMA, and open-source fine-tuned models. Our approach achieves an F1-score of 88.9%, outperforming state-of-the-art AI generated detectors such as DetectGPT (86.2%) and the OpenAI Text Classifier (82.1%), while maintaining robustness and generalizability across languages and domains."

    "abstract": "In modern software delivery, continuous testing is a critical enabler of rapid and reliable deployments, yet long-running integration tests often create bottlenecks in CI/CD pipelines. This paper introduces SCTF (Scalable Continuous Testing Framework), a Jenkins-based solution built with Groovy that dynamically generates pipeline stages at runtime to optimize test execution. Unlike fixed pipelines, SCTF uses YAML-based configuration to easily set how many stages to run, how they’re arranged, and whether they run in parallel, sequence, or a mix—depending on each service’s testing needs. By grouping Cucumber features or scenarios and distributing them across configurable stages for parallel execution, overall test time can be reduced from several hours to under 30 minutes, accelerating feedback and production deployment readiness.Beyond dynamic orchestration, SCTF integrates advanced capabilities including stage-wise log preservation, consolidated Cucumber report generation, error log extraction, and automated Confluence uploads for enhanced traceability. It further supports rollback mechanisms which can be configured under certain condition, shell command execution, and real-time notifications through Slack and email, ensuring resilience and transparency across the delivery pipeline. By providing scalability, adaptability, and efficiency, SCTF enhances the robustness of Jenkins pipelines, enabling faster and more reliable production releases while strengthening the overall continuous testing lifecycle."

As a result, the computational burden and latency of traditional centralized control methods have risen significantly. Against this background, this paper proposes an economic dispatch technique for low-voltage distribution substations based on AOE (Activity on Edge) control technology. First, an event-driven control architecture based on AOE theory is designed to enable rapid deployment of edge computing services. Second, an economic optimal dispatch model for low-voltage distribution substations is established using AOE-based modeling. Finally, a Simulink-Based simulation is conducted to compare the proposed edge-based distributed control method with a conventional cloud-based centralized control approach. The results demonstrate that the proposed AOE-based edge control technology effectively reduces communication latency and meets the operational requirements of practical power grid applications."

    "abstract": "Modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) workloads have become increasingly complex and memory-intensive, posing a significant challenge to computational efficiency. One promising solution is to address the notorious von-Neumann memory wall bottleneck by enabling high-density memory to reduce the off-chip data movement. Spin Transfer Torque Magnetic Random Access Memory (STT-MRAM) has recently emerged as a promising non-volatile memory (NVM) technology. Compared to Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS)-based Static Random Access Memory (SRAM), MRAM achieves higher density while providing the desirable access speed and endurance for on-chip memory. However, the scaling of the standard STT-MRAM cell is hindered by the access transistor, which needs to be large to supply sufficient write currents for accurate STT-driven switching. In this work, we propose a heterogeneous MRAM architecture based on area-efficient and error-aware MRAM cell design. We exploit the insight that pre-trained DNN models have high heterogeneity in the error resiliency at the bit-level granularity. A comprehensive device-circuit-algorithm co-optimization framework is developed to harness a significant improvement in the on-chip density of MRAM, leading to substantial mitigation of the von Neumann bottleneck while narrowing the gap in write energy between MRAM and SRAM. Our evaluations of the co-designed MRAM-based AI inference engine demonstrate an optimal trade-off between bit error and efficiency. Compared to the SRAM baseline, we achieve up to 4.7x and 2.43x improvement in the efficiency of memory access energy and system-level energy, respectively, while preserving near-lossless inference accuracy."

    "abstract": "As one of the components of the Low Altitude Platforms (LAPs) and High Altitude Platforms (HAPs) for Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have become a key player for future six-generation (6G) networks. Understanding the Air-to-Ground (A2G) propagation channels is essential to enable reliable wireless communication systems between Ground Stations (GSs) and UAVs. In particular, due to the scarcity of available bandwidth, higher frequency bands, such as millimeter wave (mmWave), are essential. However, in previous studies, most of the high-altitude and highspeed UAV channel models in mmWave bands are solely based on simulations. To fill the gap, in this paper, A2G channels have been evaluated by means of a fixed-wing UAV measurement campaign considering three different heights (1500 m, 2000 m, 2400 m) and two different maneuvers, namely cruising and turning, in a rural scenario at Ka-band (28 GHz) and with 420MHz bandwidth. The multipath components (MPCs) are extracted by the space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm and used as the basis for developing a complete stochastic channel model. This model explicitly characterizes key parameters, including Path Loss (PL) with its exponent, Rician K-factor, Root-Mean-Square Delay Spread (RMS-DS), and Root- Mean-Square Doppler Frequency Spread (RMS-DFS) for different flight altitudes and aircraft attitudes. Due to large bandwidth considered, the increased delay resolution allowed us to provide through analyses of the exhibited propagation effects, such as the MPCs caused by the airframe. Furthermore, the models specifically include the effects of the attitude characteristics for each flight maneuver. For example, the PL model incorporated correction factors related to the changing flight attitude of the aircraft. As a result, the provided models constitute a complete framework for the simulation and evaluation of high-altitude and high-speed A2G channels, which are of utmost importance for the design and deployment of 6G NTN systems."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a millimeter-wave (mmWave) phased array antenna (PAA) design that reduces the required number of phase shifters while achieving high gain and low grating lobes for both horizontal (HP) and vertical polarization (VP) arrays. The design leverages a novel approach using overlapped large-sized elements (LSEs), each comprising a driven subelement with multiple passive and parasitic subelements, all implemented as patches. By configuring the LSEs with tailored aperture fields that approximate a sinc function distribution, the array achieves a flat-top active element pattern (AEP), effectively reducing scan loss and suppressing grating lobes. To demonstrate, 24-GHz 1×5-element HP and VP linear PAAs with λ0 element spacing are developed, which further form 1-D scanning 4×5-element HP and VP planar PAAs, respectively, fed by just five phase-shifted ports. The measurements show that the HP/VP array achieves a peak gain of 22 dBi/21.7 dBi with a scanning range of ±20°/±18°, scan loss below 2 dB/1.2 dB, and grating lobes below −10 dB. This design provides a cost-effective and simple structural solution for limited field-of-view applications requiring high performance and low grating lobes, with potential scalability for future mmWave vehicle systems."

By adjusting the reflectivity of the two SIs and coupling strength between them, we tailor coherent mode interference to achieve high-performance optical analogues of Fano resonance. The device is theoretically analyzed and experimentally fabricated on a SOI platform. Theoretical analysis predicts periodic Fano- like resonances with a high extinction ratio and a steep slope rate, arising from strong coherent optical mode interference within a compact resonator comprising two SIs and a connected feedback waveguide. Experimental results align with the theoretical model, validating the expected resonance behavior and confirming the effectiveness of the design. These findings underscore the potential of compact coupled SIs for generating Fano- like resonances, enabling broader applications in integrated photonics."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel stator-permanent-magnet axial-flux counter-rotating hybrid-excitation machine (SPM-AFCRHEM) for unbalanced-load operation of counter-rotating propeller (CRP) systems, and investigates three topologies with different stator configurations. By utilizing U-shaped permanent magnets (UPMs) and field-regulation windings to achieve magnetic decoupling and field-regulation capability. Firstly, the field-regulation principle of SPM-AFCRHEMs are analyzed. The working harmonics and their respective torque contributions are calculated and evaluated by establishing the magnetomotive force (MMF)-permeance model. Subsequently, the torque performance of SPM-AFCRHEMs with different pole-slot combinations is compared under unified winding layout principles, and the risk of negative-sequence back-electromotive force (EMF) caused by stator yoke magnetic saturation is discussed. Finally, the machines are comprehensively evaluated through comparative studies of no-load characteristics, load performance, and field-regulation time constants. A prototype of the top-performing configuration is fabricated and experimentally validated, demonstrating that the proposed SPM-AFCRHEM represents a competitive solution for direct-drive CRP systems."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a new tightly coupled LiDAR-inertial odometry (LIO) scheme for a quadruped robot operating under fluctuating conditions. By proposing external disturbance modeling, the profile of unknown disturbances and noise on the IMU is effectively characterized using the time delay estimation (TDE) technique. Simultaneously, the IMU orientation and the TDE-based uncertainty model are jointly updated through an Error-State Kalman Filter (ESKF) using a measurement model derived from LiDAR odometry (LO). Thereafter, the output of the ESKF is employed to mitigate vibration effects in the IMU preintegration factor, thereby enhancing the precision and stability of inertial motion estimation. Furthermore, the refined IMU preintegration pose is leveraged to correct LiDAR distortion and improve the accuracy of LO. As a result, the proposed approach achieves optimal performance, smooth trajectories, and enhanced robustness against uncertainties. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed LIO is evaluated through real-time experiments on a quadruped robot across different scenarios."

However, its value for the medical community compared to existing techniques is still undetermined. One of the reasons is the lack of large enough representative datasets of MW signals for evaluation and improvement of the developed signal processing algorithms. To overcome this, we present a fast hybrid method combining geometrical optics, physical optics and full-wave analysis that can model the direct problem, allowing us to create digital twins of experimental microwave monostatic setups, for fast generation of large representative datasets. For validation purposes, a digital twin of our in-house experimental dry microwave setup was implemented – <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">MWSensing</i> – and made openly available to the interested community. We have tested the model against experimental results in the 2-5 GHz range for cylindrical, elliptical and anthropomorphic, homogeneous and heterogeneous breasts phantoms, with a tumor placed inside, in different positions. We show that the MW signals obtained from <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">MWSensing</i> and from the experimental setup are of the same nature and provide similar imaging results. With this framework, it becomes possible to build a large dataset of MW signals, quickly and efficiently, enabling users to evaluate firsthand their algorithms before moving on to more advanced test stages."

Here we performed levitation force measurements on passive (open-circuit) dry wound and solder-impregnated REBCO no-insulation coils to investigate the effect of varying turn-to-turn resistivity. Finite element simulations employing a rotated anisotropic resistivity tensor successfully reproduced the observed behaviour, validating this approach. Low turn-to-turn resistivity facilitates the circulation of a net azimuthal current, which enhances levitation force but decays with time due to resistive dissipation. This work lays the groundwork for future research on active (powered) coils to fully realise the potential of no-insulation coils in superconducting bearings."

Secondly, to address the design problem of resilient control, a distributed leader state observer is introduced. Then, the distributed leader state observer with adaptive capability is designed to resolve the unpredictable states of the leaders under RLFCs. Thirdly, to obtain a reliable PI controller with high performance, stochastic stability criteria are derived via the algebraic Riccati equation and an appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii function (LKF). Finally, a simulation based on actual F-16 flight results is given to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed control strategy."

The QIQD Dialogic Computer operates through a law suite that enforces property neutrality, bounded entanglement, hardware binding, and entropy authority. Computation proceeds via a dialogic interface that translates natural language requests into lawful operations, and a structural engine that mutates state only under lawful conditions. Seeds, defined as unique four-tuples (K, Pr, Po, H), provide the basic carriers of information, while typed entanglement across strata (p/o/n/m) encodes structural correlations. An Operator Surface of verbs ensures all interactions remain auditable and compliant. We demonstrate the system through a case study: the lawful execution of a Room-Temperature Superconductor (RTS) algorithm. This experiment shows measurable coherence improvement (coherence_C from 0.57 to 0.61) while maintaining high min-entropy (0.89) and safe disclosure ratios (commuting_ratio = 1.0). The QIQD Dialogic Computer thus establishes a structurally lawful, assurance-embedded foundation for quantum-assured computation, with implications for cryptography, materials discovery, and complex system modeling."

A holistic kinematic model is developed by treating the mobile base and manipulator as an integrated system to enhance motion coordination. A control scheme combining a prescribed-performance controller and a quadratic programming-based control framework is designed to achieve fast convergence in visual servoing tasks while maintaining field-of-view and joint-limit constraints.

Simulation results demonstrate that, compared to the NSGA-II and MOPSO algorithms, the proposed algorithm significantly improves the diversity and convergence of the Pareto solutions through the introduction of dynamic inertia weights and elite crossover and mutation strategies. Moreover, compared to unordered charging, the proposed orderly strategy increases the average off-grid SOC by 3.3%, reduces the total cost by 29%, decreases the load peak by 28.4%, lowers the peak-valley difference rate by 39.3%, and reduces the load variance by 87.2%."

This study investigates the misalignment between current power engineering curricula at New Jersey institutions, including NJIT, Rowan University, and Rutgers, and the evolving skill demands of employers such as PSEG, PJM, and offshore wind developers. Through a comparative analysis of course catalogs, ABET learning outcomes, and 60 industry job postings (2023–2025), we identify significant gaps in training related to industrial control systems (ICS) security, spatial risk visualization, and data-driven grid decision-making. In response, we propose a modular, open-access educational framework that embeds cyber resilience labs and GIS-based grid dashboards into existing power systems courses. Developed in consultation with NJIT’s Power Systems Engineering Center and informed by the NSF IUCRC GOWIND Center’s workforce goals, this model enables students to analyze real-world scenarios, such as mapping substation vulnerabilities or simulating cyber-physical disruptions, using freely available tools like QGIS and open-source SCADA testbeds. The framework supports the New Jersey Energy Master Plan’s call for a skilled, diverse clean energy workforce and offers a scalable template for university-industry partnerships across the PJM region.

We show how these attacks can be applied to attack MAYO and PROV, two signature schemes submitted to the NIST call for additional post-quantum signature schemes. The attacks are demonstrated with reference implementations that run on an ARM Cortex-M4 processor. Our attacks do not require precise triggering or precise fault injection capabilities. Any type of fault in large portions of the code has the potential to result in successful key recovery. We demonstrate our attacks with very cheap equipment and simple clock glitching techniques, enabling the recovery of the secret key with either two faulty signatures or one correct signature and one faulty signature in the case of MAYO and one correct signature and two faulty signatures in case of PROV. The fact that our attacks do not require precise fault injection capabilities and can be successful with only a few signatures makes them particularly powerful, hence harmful for the implementation security of post-quantum digital signature schemes."

An automated region growing algorithm then performs preliminary segmentation. To refine these results and ensure boundary coherence, an MRF model minimizes an energy function via an efficient Graph Cut algorithm, yielding optimal binary segmentation.

    "abstract": "To address the requirements of realizing passive self-power supply function and miniaturization for hybrid current-limiting fuses, a passive power supply scheme is designed where the triggering device does not require external power supply. Firstly, an equivalent circuit model of the passive self-power supply unit is constructed, which converts the complex electricmagnetic field-circuit coupling problem into a single circuit problem, simplifying the model and calculation process. The calculation methods for key parameters in the circuit model are derived, and experiments are conducted to verify the accuracy of the model. Experimental results show that under two different current rise rates, the induced electromotive force (EMF) of the iron-core coil is in good agreement with the theoretical calculation results, which verifies the accuracy of the equivalent circuit model. This model has certain applicability and can be used to guide the multi-parameter optimization analysis and design of the passive self-power supply unit. In addition, the power supply voltage of the triggering device in this passive triggering scheme is directly obtained from the fault current; the larger the fault current, the more sufficient the voltage obtained by the system. This ensures that the system has an absolutely reliable power supply in extreme situations where protection is most needed, thereby improving the reliability and safety of the hybrid current-limiting fuse."

    "abstract": "To address cost control and power supply stability challenges posed by the diversity of grid agency electricity procurement resources, and the limitations of existing single procurement modes (poor adaptability, intra-provincial resource constraints), this paper develops a monthly-hourly dual-time-scale mid-to-long-term spot optimization model. First, variables are unified by time scale: intra-provincial mid-to-long-term procurement and renewable energy procurement are set as monthly variables, while inter-provincial mid-to-long-term procurement and spot procurement are hourly variables, with scale connection via aggregation and equalization. Then, aiming to minimize total procurement cost, multi-space resource allocation is achieved by incorporating special constraints of three inter-provincial channels. Simulations with full-year 2024 load and electricity price data, verified against a control group, show the model effectively connects mid-to-long-term and spot markets, ensures full renewable energy consumption and power supply stability, and cuts procurement cost significantly compared to the control group, achieving cost optimization."

    "abstract": "To overcome the key limitations of conventional cooling/heating load identification in distribution substations— namely, the insufficient characterization of temperature-response lags and the low dimensionality of features—this paper presents a multi-feature fusion model. First, a dynamic thermal-response event detector is built. It employs a sliding-window standard-deviation algorithm to capture abrupt temperature events and verifies load-response characteristics with Pearson correlation, extracting spatio-temporally coupled features. Second, a high-dimensional feature set covering load spectral entropy, period sensitivity, and lagged correlations is designed. Third, an improved LightGBM classifier is proposed: SMOTE is used to oversample cooling and heating loads to 80 % of the normal-load size, while principal-component analysis retains components explaining 95 % of the variance. Finally, a seasonal-priority strategy combined with a confidence-tier mechanism is established; samples whose predicted probabilities fall between 0.4 and 0.6 are manually reviewed to resolve classification conflicts. Validation on 1,133 actual substations shows the method achieves 92.3 % accuracy and an F1-score of 0.87 for cooling and heating load classification."

A hierarchical Siamese encoder is used to extract feature representations of different resolutions from dual-temporal images, and a learnable difference calculation module is used to quantify the change information of each scale. An adaptive fusion mechanism based on global context awareness is introduced to dynamically adjust the contribution weight of each scale feature. Experiments on the public change detection dataset verify the advantages of the adaptive fusion strategy compared with the fixed weight fusion in terms of detection accuracy and boundary accuracy. Ablation experiments prove the effectiveness of multi-scale feature extraction and adaptive weight adjustment. The research provides a new technical path for remote sensing image change detection, which can be applied to urban expansion monitoring, disaster loss assessment and other fields."

This research can also indicate which artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms were the most accurate to evaluate the safe operation of the industrial system. For two of the data sets, the Subspace K-Nearest Neighbors was the most accurate. For the other, a Fine Gaussian Support Vector Machine was the most accurate.

    "abstract": "As renewable energies (REs) are rapidly penetrating existing power systems, maintaining frequency stability has become increasingly difficult. Load frequency control (LFC) operations are very important under these circumstances. Classical PI controllers are widely used as LFC controllers; however, the system operator must retune the parameters whenever system configurations are changed. To address this issue, the authors have developed an adaptive model predictive LFC (AMPC-LFC) to improve the frequency stability by using an automatic parameter update. This paper proposes a modified AMPC-LFC for power systems with high penetration of wind turbine (WT) power generation in an interconnected two-area network. An extended Kalman filter (EKF) is applied to AMPC-LFC to estimate the parameters of the simplified internal model in real time. Furthermore, a high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission system with inertia emulation control (INEC) can reduce frequency deviations caused by WT and load changes. Simulation results show that the HVDC-AC hybrid transmission system can improve frequency control performance by up to 56% compared to AC-only systems. Additionally, when AMPC is compared with PI controllers and particle swarm optimization (PSO)-tuned adaptive PI controllers, AMPC can reduce frequency deviation for each controller by up to 64% and 44% respectively."

    "abstract": "Apache Kafka is a key component in event-driven and microservice architectures relying on distributed publishsubscribe messaging for scalable and fault-tolerant streaming of real-time data. To reduce distribution overhead, messages are buffered and dispatched to the broker when either a maximum batch size N is reached or a timeout T expires, enabling control on the trade-off between high throughput and low latency. However, this trade-off has been explored only through empirical studies, referred to specific system deployments and not suited for runtime adaptation to variable workload conditions. We provide an analytical characterization of the arrival process induced by Kafka batching policy under Poisson arrivals. The analysis develops on the observation that the time for buffering a full batch and the size of a batch dispatched at expiration of the timeout follow truncated Erlang and Poisson distributions, respectively. Leveraging this insight, we derive closed forms for quantities that characterize the arrival process, and we propose a method for efficient simulation of the process embedded at dispatching times. To support practical implementation, we evaluate solutions for drawing samples from an Erlang distribution provided by NumPy, PyTorch, and R, and we also propose a novel approach based on rejection sampling with proposal function in the family of Kumaraswamy distributions with automated optimization of parameters with respect to the number of phases. Numerical experimentation shows that: (i) aggregated simulation enabled by the analytical formulation is insensitive to the value of the batch size, and it definitely outperforms fine-grained simulation of individual message arrivals; (ii) the best efficiency is obtained with the NumPy implementation of Erlang, with promising results of the novel approach based on Kumaraswamy, which achieves results comparable to PyTorch and better than $\\mathbf{R}$."

    "abstract": "Medical ultrasound probes commonly employ a polymer encapsulation over the transducer for electrical protection and acoustic impedance matching. However, the speed of sound mismatch between the encapsulant and biological tissue can introduce Time Of Flight (TOF) errors that degrade beamforming coherence. This article presents a beamforming method that includes the encapsulating layer in the TOF calculation to improve image quality. Two TOF approximations, Direct Path (DP) and Normal Path (NP), are evaluated in terms of accuracy and computational cost. These are compared against the Homogeneous Direct Path (HDP) model, which neglects the encapsulant, and the exact Snell’s law Path (SP), computed using ray-tracing. Simulations and experiments are performed on a silicone encapsulated Row-Column Addressed (RCA) Capacitive Micromachined Ultrasound Transducer (CMUT) probe as a case study. DP and NP increased the processing time by only 1.2 × compared to HDP, while SP increased it by 46 ×. The measured standard deviation of the TOF error was reduced from 0.10 λ (HDP) to 0.06 λ (DP), and 0.05 λ (SP), ensuring high inter-channel coherence. Lateral resolution increased up to +47%, and contrast was enhanced by ≥ +2.1 dB using DP and SP models compared to HDP. The DP approximation achieved near-SP image quality, while maintaining HDP-level computational efficiency. The validity domain of NP and DP for any transducer was generalized using a critical F-number α. Overall, the proposed approximations provide a computationally efficient means to enhance resolution and contrast, establishing a practical solution for high-resolution realtime imaging."

Recently, several computational ensemble methods have been investigated to predict ADPs. Notwithstanding progress in ensemble techniques, finding optimal solutions for predicting ADPs requires continuous effort for improvement. Therefore, the current study proposed a novel Deep-Q-Network (DQN)-based Reinforcement learning (RL) approach for optimizing a multiview ensemble to predict anti-diabetic peptides and diabetic types. Initially, to obtain the multiview, diverse feature encodings were employed, which were then systematically categorized into three heterogeneous groups based on the information sources and information-extracting techniques. Each group is considered as a view, and these views are based on sequence, physicochemical properties with sequence composition, and evolutionary information. Next, the proposed ensemble is constructed with 36 branch classifiers derived from 6 convolutional neural networks(CNNs). A reinforcement learning technique is employed to optimize the ensemble search space of <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$2^{36}-1$</tex-math></inline-formula>, made by thirty-six branch CNNs and three views. The DQN approach encodes 36-bit binary strings to find the optimal ensemble. The optimal ensemble with an ideal view-classifier pair enhances antidiabetic prediction efficacy. It surpasses existing state-of-the-art with a classification accuracy of 96.37%, a matthews correlation coefficient of 0.870, and an area under the curve of 0.983 on the standard ADPs dataset. Lastly, the performance of the proposed ensemble is considered to be its efficacy in peptide antidiabetic activity prediction."

    "abstract": "Energy efficiency in serverless computing has remained under-explored despite its growing adoption. To fill this gap, we propose LoAPE, a load-aware and power-elastic serverless platform. Unlike existing methods limited to CPU core frequency scaling or density-based consolidation, LoAPE leverages c-states and uncore frequency scaling, which offer greater energy benefits but pose deployment challenges. Uncore changes affect the performance of all co-located functions, and cstates require sustained idle periods for effective energy savings. LoAPE’s insight is to strategically exploit function elasticity. By creating idle intervals across cores and servers, it enables aggressive c-state activation and uncore frequency reduction. To achieve this goal, LoAPE adopts topology-aware instance scheduling and eviction, which scale the number of active servers along with serverless functions. Within servers, LoAPE proactively manages active cores based on incoming loads. Our evaluations demonstrate that LoAPE delivers a 3.02× improvement in cluster energy reduction compared to frequency-scaling frameworks and extends savings by 1.17× over state-of-the-art density-aware schedulers, while meeting performance requirements."

    "abstract": "Networks of radiation detectors provide a platform for real-time radioactive source detection and identification in urban environments. Detection algorithms in these systems must adapt to naturally-occurring changes in background, which requires well-characterized relationships between precipitation events and their corresponding radiological signature.We present a quantitative and qualitative description of rain-induced radon progeny deposition events occurring in Chicago from September 2023 through February 2024. We measure ambient gamma radiation levels, precipitation rate, temperature, pressure and relative humidity in a network of sensor nodes. For each identified precipitation period, we decompose spectra into static- and radon-associated components as defined by a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm. We find a consistent powerlaw relationship between a precipitation-dependent peak of the radon progeny proxy (RPP) and the peak strength of radon-associated NMF component for most precipitation events. We conduct a case study of a rainfall period with abnormally high levels of implied radon progeny concentration and describe its temporal and spatial evolution. We hypothesize this phenomenon is due to the air mass path that intersects a uranium-rich region of Wyoming. Finally, we cluster precipitation events into three distinct categories. One category roughly corresponds to events with deep low-pressure systems and high relative radon concentration, while another is characteristic of light stratiform rain with slightly higher temperatures and intermediate relative radon concentration. The third category appears to contain weak-gradient or lake breeze convection showers with intermittent precipitation and low relative radon concentration. These findings suggest that radiological anomaly detection could be improved by training unique background models corresponding to each category of meteorological event."

Additionally, Single-Event Upset(SEU) phenomena were observed only in Yolov5s.To further investigate, pulsed laser experiments were carried out. The results showed that both Yolov5s and Ssd exhibited more severe SEFI, and SEU phenomena were detected in these two models.

First, a new modeling and analysis method is proposed and used to delineate the angle stability region. Second, the instability mechanisms of the two inverters are analyzed under different grid voltage sags and system parameters. Furthermore, the impact of the current control angles of both inverters on system stability is examined, leading to the proposal of a transient current limiting strategy that balances system transient stability with the desaturation capability of the GFM inverter.

    "abstract": "To enable compute-intensive and delay-sensitive maritime services, unmanned surface vessels (USVs) can offload tasks to mobile edge computing (MEC) servers mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, jointly minimizing energy consumption and latency is challenging due to the strong coupling between communication, computation, and mobility under stringent quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. To capture this trade-off, we formulate a weighted energy–delay minimization problem that jointly optimizes one-to-one UAV–USV scheduling, task partitioning, and UAV trajectory. The resulting problem is particularly difficult due to a hybrid discrete–continuous decision space and strong temporal coupling under stringent feasibility constraints. To address this mixed-integer nonconvex optimization problem, we reformulate it as a Markov decision process (MDP) and develop a constraint-aware OU–TD3 algorithm that integrates differentiable scheduling relaxation, feasibility-aware action mapping, and adaptive OU–Gaussian mixed exploration for stable learning in high-dimensional continuous control. We further extend the formulation and solution to a cooperative multi-UAV MEC setting with signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)-coupled interference and coordination constraints. Extensive simulations with statistical evaluation demonstrate stable convergence and up to 54.2% cost reduction over baseline schemes, while maintaining robustness under realistic maritime disturbances."

However, realizing intent-aware allocation in real time remains challenging due to uncertain resource availability and incomplete future information. This paper presents a modular framework that integrates semantic intent parsing, machine-learned resource prediction, and robust online decision-making. We propose IBN-ONMP, an IBN-based online resource allocation algorithm that leverages machine-learned predictions and adapts safety margins based on feedback to ensure feasibility and performance under uncertainty. We formally define the problem, establish theoretical guarantees including regret and competitive ratio bounds, and validate the approach on real-world and simulated datasets.

This paper presents GradCloak, a principled approach to guiding gradient perturbation with theoretical robustness bounds in federated learning as a service, aiming to find the minimum required noise for simultaneously achieving privacy protection, competitive accuracy, and preventing gradient leakage attacks. The paper is organized into three major components. <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">First</i>, we formulate the gradient leakage threats and their adverse effect. We categorize the attack into two broad types: leakage during local training and leakage before global aggregation. <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Second</i>, we investigate different gradient perturbation approaches. We analyze and compare these gradient perturbation methods, which are performed at the federated server, with those performed at the participating client(s). <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Third</i>, we introduce three robustness properties of robust perturbation against gradient leakage threats, formulated by <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">the anonymization bound</i> for training data robustness, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">the perturbation bound</i> for gradient robustness, and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">the distribution robustness bound</i> for perturbed gradients. We conduct extensive evaluations on eight benchmark datasets to demonstrate that specific settings of gradient perturbation exist that best balance privacy, accuracy, and leakage prevention.

    "abstract": "Partial shading significantly affects the performance and efficiency of photovoltaic (PV) arrays, leading to mismatch losses (MLs) and reduced energy output. This research proposes a novel odd-even column major order reconfiguration strategy to mitigate these challenges and optimize the performance of the total-cross-tied (TCT) PV array. The proposed method focuses on redistributing the shade by rearranging the PV modules while preserving TCT electrical connections, minimizing MLs, and enhancing the power generation. The proposed strategy is evaluated through extensive simulations and experimental validation on a 6 × 6 PV array under various shading scenarios using key performance indices such as global maximum power point, ML, power enhancement (PE), fill factor, and efficiency. Results demonstrate a significant improvement across all indices, with up to 19.86% PE, ML reduction to 1.46%, and a maximum efficiency of 16.96%. Therefore, the proposed method presents an effective solution to shading-induced challenges in PV arrays, promoting sustainable energy generation and advancing the adoption of solar power in diverse environmental conditions."

Performance analyses are further conducted in terms of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and area under the ROC curve. Monte Carlo simulations not only verified the correctness of the established theoretical results, but also demonstrated the superiority of LKC over other commonly used methods in terms of detection probability under Laplacian noise."

    "abstract": "Reliable data for global rapid coverage and short-period detection of tropical cyclones (TCs) are scarce. CYGNSS captures GNSS signals reflected from the Earth’s surface, delivering high-revisit global observations. This study presents a proof-of-concept evaluation of CYGNSS’s capability for global TC detection and tracking. A machine learning-based algorithm is introduced, which extracts wind speed features through regional segmentation. Using comparative analysis, statistics that effectively distinguish TC from non-TC samples were selected, while the spatiotemporal correlation of TC motion was incorporated for detection and tracking. This method addresses challenges including the irregular spatial sampling of CYGNSS data and the class imbalance between TC and non-TC samples. For daily time-slots, the method achieves a probability of detection (POD) of 82% with a false alarm rate (FAR) of 12% for tropical storm (TS) level TC detection. For hurricane-level TCs, the POD increases to 83% while the FAR decreases to 9%. The tracked TS-level tracks show a cosine similarity of 92.0% with IBTrACS reference paths. For semi-daily time-slots, the method attains a POD of 75% with a FAR of 8% for TS-level detection, while for hurricane-level TCs, the POD reaches 79% with a FAR reduced to 3%. The cosine similarity between tracked TS-level tracks and IBTrACS references reaches 93.1%. However, the limited quality of irregular point observations and the challenges in observing the fine-scale structure of TCs with CYGNSS data continue to constrain its capability for global TC detection with short revisit periods. Further refinement of the constellation’s design and antenna performance, integrated with complementary remote sensing systems, is essential to enhance the TC monitoring capability."

    "abstract": "Multimodal physiological emotion recognition is an essential and challenging field of human-computer interaction (HCI). However, the collection of labelled physiological signals is difficult and expensive, especially for electroencephalogram (EEG). To address above issue, we propose a novel self-supervised learning (SSL) method, named the Masked-signal Modeling based Self-supervised Learning (MMSL), to train model using numerous unlabelled physiological signal datasets. To capture robust and effective general representations, masked-signal modeling (MSM) is applied to pretrain within each modality through reconstructing EEG and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals by masking a certain proportion of signal. The pretrained signal encoder is then transferred to the SSL phase. In the SSL phase, representation alignment (RA) and cross-modal transformer (CMT) module are designed to capture effective representations without manual labeling through several signal transformations. A multimodal tensor fusion (MTF) technique is then used to integrate abundant multimodal information for transformation recognition. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, the pretrained modules are either frozen or fine-tuned for emotion recognition on the AMIGOS dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in arousal and valence levels compared to recent studies. Furthermore, several visualized results illustrate that the proposed method is capable of recognizing emotion states."

    "abstract": "The recent development of feedforward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) presents a new paradigm to reconstruct 3D scenes. Using neural networks trained on large-scale multi-view datasets, it can directly infer 3DGS representations from sparse input views. Although the feedforward approach achieves high reconstruction speed, it still suffers from the substantial storage cost of 3D Gaussians. Existing 3DGS compression methods relying on scene-wise optimization are not applicable due to architectural incompatibilities. To overcome this limitation, we propose TinySplat, a complete feedforward approach for generating compact 3D scene representations. Built upon standard feedforward 3DGS methods, TinySplat integrates a training-free compression framework that systematically eliminates key sources of redundancy. Specifically, we introduce View-Projection Transformation (VPT) to reduce geometric redundancy by projecting geometric parameters into a more compact space. We further present Visibility-Aware Basis Reduction (VABR), which mitigates perceptual redundancy by aligning feature energy along dominant viewing directions via basis transformation. Lastly, spatial redundancy is addressed through an off-the-shelf video codec. Comprehensive experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that TinySplat achieves over 100× compression for 3D Gaussian data generated by feedforward methods. Compared to the state-of-the-art compression approach, we achieve comparable quality with only 6% of the storage size. Meanwhile, our compression framework requires only 25% of the encoding time and 1% of the decoding time."

    "abstract": "Structured tabular data remains a cornerstone of information representation, serving critical roles in knowledge sharing, analytical workflows, and cross-domain interoperability. Despite their ubiquity, automated interpretation of tables is hindered by their inherent structural diversity, including non-standard formats, context-dependent semantics, and language-specific nuances. While recent advancements in pretrained language models have contributed to advances in table understanding, existing research is mainly focused on English-oriented datasets, resulting in under-explored low-resource languages such as Russian. To bridge this gap, we introduce RuTaBERT, a deep learning framework for semantic column annotation of Russian tables using transformer-based multilingual models. Our framework maps tabular data to semantic type labels from DBpedia, addressing linguistic features through domain-adaptive fine-tuning. The training utilizes a curated dataset of 3.2 million columns derived from the Russian Wikipedia corpus, preprocessed to reduce noise and lexical ambiguity. For this purpose, we develop a new LoReTA framework for automating the preparation of tabular data, including their automatic labeling based on table headers, which is suitable for various languages. RuTaBERT integrates context-enriched table linearization and a contrastive pre-training strategy to handle linguistic specificity and data sparsity. Experimental evaluations demonstrate RuTaBERT’s advantage, achieving a high Micro F1 score of 97.4% on an established benchmark, far surpassing baselines while demonstrating robustness on rare semantic types and computational efficiency. By transcending language barriers, RuTaBERT unlocks opportunities for knowledge graph enrichment, data integration, and automated analytics in low-resource language contexts."

    "abstract": "This study presents a machine-learning framework that predicts a fracture-based healing index of asphalt mixtures by explicitly incorporating image-quantified fracture-surface damage modes (adhesive, cohesive, aggregate). Damage types were quantified through digital image processing. Two datasets were employed: one with specimens broken at –20 °C and another with variable temperatures (–20 °C to 20 °C). Eight feature sets were developed to isolate key factors, and multiple ML models were tested. Results showed that breaking temperature is the most dominant factor influencing healing, though its strong correlation can create spurious relationships that mask the effects of mixture properties. When temperature was fixed, aggregate damage consistently emerged as the most reliable predictor, with the best performance achieved by Support Vector Regressor (R² = 0.856 at –20 °C). Bitumen content showed gradation-dependent effects: in porous mixtures, higher binder reduced aggregate damage, while in dense mixtures the effect was negligible. Regardless of gradation, higher binder content enhanced healing by improving crack filling and binder flow. Air voids also showed contrasting effects: healing decreased with higher voids in dense mixtures, but moderate voids in porous mixtures facilitated binder redistribution and improved healing. Among the algorithms, Support Vector Regressor achieved the highest predictive accuracy, followed by Gradient Boosting, while Linear Regression underperformed, reflecting the nonlinear nature of healing. Feature selection with Recursive Feature Elimination and Cross-Validation (RFECV) improved efficiency with minor accuracy loss, though excluding aggregate damage reduced reliability. Sensitivity analyses confirmed that breaking temperature dominated predictions at variable conditions, while at fixed temperature, volumetric properties and cohesive damage became more influential. These findings demonstrate the potential of ML to capture complex healing mechanisms and support mix design strategies tailored to gradation type and service temperature."

    "abstract": "Sign language gloss-to-text translation is a crucial task for enhancing communication and accessibility for the deaf community. However, the scarcity of annotated sign language data poses significant challenges for developing effective translation models. In this paper, we propose leveraging pretrainedxian language models to improve gloss-to-text translation performance. While intuitively one might assume bilingual translation objectives (e.g., En-De) suit this task, our extensive empirical analysis yields a counter-intuitive but critical key finding: the gloss-to-text task functions fundamentally as a monolingual constraint generation task rather than a cross-lingual translation task. Consequently, models pretrained with denoising auto-encoding objectives (e.g., mBART) significantly outperform those with translation objectives. Based on this insight, we propose to utilize large-scale multilingual pretrained models in our main experiments on three widely-used benchmarks (PHOENIX-2014T, ASLG-PC12, and CSL-Daily). Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach, which consistently benchmarks against and outperforms existing state-of-the-art models. Specifically, our method achieves absolute improvements of +4.37 BLEU on Phoenix2014T and +15.18 BLEU on CSL-Daily compared to strong baselines. We also discuss limitations, such as copying behavior and model robustness, which warrant further investigation. Our findings suggest that denoising auto-encoding pretrained models hold promise for advancing gloss-to-text translation and have the potential to greatly benefit the deaf community."

Second, a broadcasted residual network (BC-ResNet) is designed to support both KWS and speaker verification (SV) classification tasks, which reduces additions by 43.5% and parameters by 5% compared to a lightweight depthwise separable CNN (DSCNN). Third, an attention-aware soft-threshold denoising strategy is developed to dynamically filter noisy features, yielding up to a 5.8% increase in accuracy over the baseline without denoising at 0dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Finally, a multiplier-less processing element (PE) array combined with stacked-transistor-based ultra-low-leakage custom memory is designed, reducing hardware area by 31.3% and leakage power by 20.4%.

However, gaps in current research frameworks impede its further development. Dataset-based frameworks provide a limited perspective, failing to capture the dynamic, asynchronous, and interactive complexities of the real world. Simulation-based frameworks often employ synchronous implementation and oversimplified communication models, impeding meaningful real-time performance evaluation in asynchronous environments. To this end, we propose RAMACoDrive, a novel real-time asynchronous framework for cooperative perception research. RAMACoDrive implements complete process separation, allowing agents and their internal components to operate asynchronously and independently. It uniquely integrates hardware-in-the-loop V2X communication using an external device for realistic data forwarding. Furthermore, RAMACoDrive incorporates an asynchronous online evaluation method with real-time performance metrics, enabling comprehensive evaluation beyond mere accuracy. Through experiments centered on cooperative 3D object detection, we demonstrate its effectiveness in revealing the impact of real-world asynchronous effects and communication constraints. RAMACoDrive provides a valuable and realistic testbed for cooperative perception algorithms and helps to advance the deployment of practical applications. The code will be released on our GitHub repository."

    "abstract": "Obstacle avoidance is a fundamental requirement for safe and reliable robot operation. Due to the lack of techniques capable of efficiently and accurately computing volumetric distances and their derivatives, many obstacle avoidance frameworks neglect the volumetric characteristics of objects by using points or spheres as the choice of object representation. To overcome this, an optimisation-based method is used in this paper to accurately compute the minimum distance between convex shapes. In order to enable integration with gradient-based obstacle avoidance algorithms, a method that calculates the gradient of the minimum distance is introduced. This information is incorporated into a Quadratic Program to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for online obstacle avoidance. In contrast to methods that rely on closed-form expressions, the proposed framework leverages optimisation to simultaneously compute pairwise distances between multiple convex shapes. Simulation results, averaged over 1000 runs, demonstrate that the proposed approach completes tasks more accurately and consistently, improving trajectory tracking accuracy by up to 35% compared to the state-of-the-art baseline. The proposed framework is further validated on a physical robot system, confirming its practical applicability and robustness on real hardware."

Due to the complexity of the systems and the massive amount of data, traditional anomaly detection methods face challenges in handling dynamic time-series data, especially in the case of scarce labeled data. To address this issue, this paper proposes a time-series modeling and anomaly detection method based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. By combining the time-series modeling capability of LSTM, self-supervised learning mechanism behavior modeling, and attention mechanisms, this paper effectively improves the detection accuracy of anomalous behaviors in complex time-series data. In experiments, the model achieved anomaly detection in the energy industry control instruction flow through self-supervised learning and performed well in various scenarios, including equipment failures, operational errors, and communication interruptions. The experimental results show that the LSTM model achieves an accuracy of 0.93, a recall rate of 0.91, and an F1 score of 0.92 in equipment fault detection. In comparison with traditional methods, the F1 score of the LSTM model is, on average, 27% higher. Through experimental validation, the proposed method demonstrates high accuracy and robustness, meeting the real-time anomaly detection requirements in the energy industry internet environment."

Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) improves outcomes in COPD but remains underused; virtual-reality (VR)–enabled, home-based models may expand access and engagement. We evaluated a modular human–AI pipeline for thematic analysis of qualitative interviews with nine patients introduced to a VR PR app, assessing how closely LLM–generated themes align with human analysis. A three-agent workflow produced layered codebooks and themes; Sentence-T5-XXL embeddings and cosine similarity quantified theme proximity.

By integrating a machine vision module, the robot achieves accurate positioning of shaft workpieces, advancing the automation of the machining process. The overall system operational efficiency surpasses that of manual operation."

    "abstract": "Accurate clock synchronization in multi-hop networks is critical yet difficult to evaluate without disturbing the protocol under test. Building on the Sequence-Aligned Reference Broadcasts (SARB) method, this paper presents a systematic study of Precision Time Protocol (PTP) in an 8-hop line-topology testbed. The study sweeps delay estimation mechanism (end-to-end vs. peer-to-peer), synchronization intervals, and clock servo types. At the eighth hop, residual percentiles, median absolute deviation, and a success-ratio after robust outlier cleaning are assessed. For consistent comparison, an 8-Hop Residual (8HR) index is defined as a composite score normalized to a per-servo reference configuration. Results show that synchronization quality is dominated by servo design and parameter tuning, while the difference between end-to-end and peer-to-peer is marginal in boundary-clock chains where both effectively measure one-hop delays. Within this setting, PI servos perform best with end-to-end at a short synchronization interval, and linear-regression servos perform best with peer-to-peer at a moderate synchronization interval."

Onboard top-fed waveguide microstrip conversion is applied to increase the integration of the feed network and provide a certain sealing, improving the reliability of the radar system. Horn antennas are used for rapid design verification. Finally, the antenna, RF circuit board and FPGA development board were integrated.

Therefore, it is necessary to optimize the pricing and operation of multi-microgrid shared energy storage based on third-party investment. The hybrid game is used to model the two-layer energy sharing. The upper model is the energy sharing of shared energy storage and microgrid alliance, which is modeled and optimized by master-slave game, and solved by dichotomy. The lower layer is the power sharing between microgrids, which is modeled and optimized by cooperative game, and solved by alternating direction multiplier method (ADMM).

Space-terrestrial integration promises global coverage, ultra-high-capacity links, and lowlatency connectivity; however, it faces critical challenges including atmospheric turbulence, pointing errors, orbital dynamics, and intermittent link blockages. To address these issues, this paper proposes a fault-tolerant and energy-efficient hybrid architecture that leverages free-space optical (FSO) links, optical ground stations, and terrestrial fiber backbones. It includes adaptive modulation, fault protection through redundancy, and cross-layer allocation of resources to provide the high reliability in dynamic conditions in its architecture. Simulation and analytical models show that this design realizes considerable gains in the link availability, outage probability and energy efficiency relative to traditional FSO and satellite-only systems. These results show how resilient optical integration strategies can be used to serve next generation communication networks of space exploration, global broadband connectivity, and intelligent infrastructures of the earth."

MiniBlocks distinguishes itself through three core innovations: (1) a child-friendly UI designer featuring accessible widgets tailored to young learners; (2) an integrated debugger within the logic block designer, offering real-time feedback and step-by-step execution; and (3) cross-platform compilation and deployment pipelines for generating native Android and iOS packages. The paper begins with a literature review of 18 relevant studies and industry reports (2018–2024) on no-code and block-based platforms in K–12 education. Results show that MiniBlocks increases engagement and eases the learning curve compared to existing tools while filling a major gap in cross-platform application generation. Building on these foundations, the study further positions MiniBlocks as an end-to-end learning ecosystem that bridges early computational thinking pedagogy with real-world software engineering practices. We present a mixed-methods evaluation involving 72 participants aged 7–15 and 15 instructors, in which learners produced fully deployable apps that ran on both Android and iOS devices within a single 90-minute classroom session, an outcome unattainable with comparator platforms such as Scratch, MIT App Inventor, or Glide. MiniBlocks’ serverless build pipeline, implemented through GitHub Actions and containerized Flutter toolchains also achieved an average 38 % decrease in compilation latency compared with conventional CI/CD workflows. These findings underscore MiniBlocks’ potential not only as a teaching aid but as a scalable blueprint for future no-code solutions that aspire to deliver authentic, device-ready outcomes for novice programmers. By uniting child-centric design principles with industrial-grade deployment architecture, MiniBlocks charts a compelling path toward democratizing mobile-app creation for the next generation of digital innovators."

The optical properties, such as effective refractive index (Neff), effective mode area (Aeff), dispersion and confinement loss, of these nanoparticles, remain difficult and time-consuming to predict using the traditional simulation tools alone. This thesis proposes a machine learningrelated model to determine optical characteristics of PCFs effectively through core refractive index, all cladding rings, pitch, and the wavelength as structural parameters. The different types of regression models applied/ used encompassed the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest Regression (RFR) and K-Nearest Neighbours Regression (KNNR).

The article presents an excellent alternative to traditional numerical approaches by showing that predicting the characteristics of a single PCF within a short time and with a low cost is possible and accurate with the help of a Machine Learning model. Besides, it predetermines the new research into the field of photonic design automation and machine learning integration."

    "abstract": "When laser SLAM is used to construct point cloud map, because of the complexity of large scene environment, the data of single sensor is affected by noise and error, which easily leads to poor loop effect and drift in Z axis direction of point cloud map. In order to make up for the deficiency of single sensor, multi-sensor information is fused to build map and position. High frequency IMU information is added to right the factor cloud distortion of lidar and decrease the amassed error. In addition, GNSS data is introduced to provide absolute pose reference and correct the accumulated error of point cloud map, so as to improve the loop effect. The Z-axis absolute position is constrained directly by GNSS elevation data, and the Z-axis drift is corrected. Compared with single laser mapping odometer and multi-sensor fusion mapping odometer, absolute trajectory error (APE) analysis is done to verify the optimization effect of this study on loop effect and Z-axis drift. The point cloud map is repositioned, and the precision of point cloud map is verified by drawing positioning odometer and satellite odometer with EVO tool. This study can effectively improve the loop effect of point cloud map and correct the drift in Z axis direction."

    "abstract": "Videos capture high dimensional data that provide valuable information for downstream analysis. In low bandwidth environments, it is useful to focus attention on a set of key frames which capture the desired change, and only send those frames around that change for downstream processing. In this paper we focus on the KITTI dataset where a ground vehicle navigates through an urban road environment and the focus is on finding frames where the vehicle makes a turn. This could be useful in a scenario where an analyst is trying to figure out if the vehicle made a turn at the correct intersection, which is plausible during training and validation of an autonomous vehicle. If the system only transmits the frames around these turns, it requires lower bandwidth to transmit data and lower analyst time to process the change. We model the system in a Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) construct which approximates linear representations of non-linear dynamics. We use a low dimension input feature to extract \"turn detection\" as a \"forcing function\" applied to the system, using the Hankel Alternative View of Koopman (HAVOK) analysis. Using delay embedding and Koopman theory this decomposes chaotic dynamics into a linear model using the leading delay coordinates and a forcing function using the low energy delay coordinates. Since vehicle kinematics is not necessarily a well-defined periodic function, the regenerated dynamics is noisy, but the forcing function can be used to extract frames where the vehicle makes turns. Our contributions are: (1) We apply HAVOK analysis to vehicle kinematics, (2) We link vehicle turns with the forcing function of the model, (3) We show that both the peaks and valleys of the filtered absolute value of the forcing function provide candidate locations for kinetic change detection."

By analyzing the SBAC assessment standard system developed by the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium in the United States, and examining typical cases such as the bilingual teaching platform in China's \"Three Regions and Three Prefectures\" (Tibet, Tibetan areas in four provinces, the southern Xinjiang four prefectures, Sichuan's Liangshan Prefecture, Yunnan's Nujiang Prefecture, Gansu's Linxia Prefecture, and the production and construction corps located in the southern Xinjiang four prefectures), as well as conducting a comparative study of educational technology policies across 28 countries, this paper proposes a CRET three-dimensional model that includes cultural adaptation algorithms, multimodal resource libraries, and intelligent diagnostic systems. Research shows that classrooms adopting CRET can increase minority students' participation by 41% and improve knowledge retention by 33%. These groundbreaking advancements not only validate the feasibility of technology-enabled culturally responsive teaching but also establish a technological pathway to address the phenomenon of \"cultural poverty in education\", providing a replicable solution for global digital education governance.

In recent years, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) — such as the BERT series, GPT series, LLaMA series, DeepSeek series, T5, and their variants tailored for source code—has introduced novel technical approaches to this field. Numerous scholars, both domestic and international, have devoted significant efforts to the study of LLM-based source code processing techniques, resulting in a wealth of fruitful research outcomes.

    "abstract": "Medium-voltage direct current (MVDC) distribution networks are emerging as a promising architecture for next-generation distribution systems due to their improved efficiency, controllability, and compatibility with DC-based resources. However, the absence of standardized data exchange mechanisms and CIM-compliant modeling structures for MVDC components limits the development of interoperable energy management system (EMS) applications, including topology processor (TP) and online load flow (LF) analysis. This paper presents a set of CIM-based standardized data exchange interfaces with newly defined extensions to accurately model MVDC-specific devices such as DC/DC converters, soft open points (SOPs), DC loads, and DC junctions. Three dedicated CIM profiles, the DB-to-TP, FEP-to-TP, and TP-to-LF profiles, are designed to support role-based information exchange between EMS applications using RDF/XML serialization aligned with the IEC 61970 standard. A SHACL-based validation strategy is further presented to ensure semantic consistency and syntactic correctness of exchanged payloads. The profiles and CIM extensions are implemented and evaluated in a testbed that emulates an MVDC EMS architecture. Interoperability tests demonstrate that the generated RDF/XML payloads are compact, efficiently parsed, and fully conformant to SHACL rules, confirming their suitability for real-time EMS operation. The results highlight the practical applicability and scalability of the proposed CIM extensions and profiles for online LF analysis in MVDC distribution networks, providing a foundation for interoperable MVDC EMS deployments."

    "abstract": "Wireless power transfer (WPT) systems offer a promising solution for automating the charging process and extending the mission duration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, the weight of the WPT system's receiving part mounted on the UAV can significantly impact its energy consumption and overall performance. In this regard, the ferrite plate is a critical component. While it is necessary for improving magnetic coupling and reducing the stray magnetic field, it also increases weight. Topology optimization (TO) is an effective tool for addressing this challenge and identifying the most suitable shape for the ferrite plate. In this study, a multi-objective topology optimization (TO) approach based on the solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) method is employed to design an optimized ferrite plate for the receiver side of a WPT system for UAV charging. The multi-objective optimization, implemented through a weighted-sum formulation, identifies ferrite configurations that maximize mutual coupling while minimizing material usage. Three representative Pareto-optimal designs are fabricated and experimentally validated against a full-ferrite reference plate. The results show that the reference configuration is a dominated solution in the Pareto sense, as equivalent mutual coupling can be achieved with approximately 40% less ferrite material. The trade-off between the resulting reduction in charging efficiency and the decrease in the required flight power due to ferrite reduction is analyzed, further demonstrating the potential of TO to substantially reduce system weight without compromising overall system performance."

This article also provides a detailed guide to constructing the reluctance network, including simplifications to facilitate adoption by less experienced designers. Validation is performed against both 3D finite element analysis simulations and experimental tests, demonstrating good agreement in key performance metrics, such as magnetic flux density, back electromotive force, and torque.

    "abstract": "Point cloud registration is a key computer vision task that must be solved in most modern pipelines for 3-D data processing. Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithms are one of the most important and widely used approaches for solving the point cloud registration problem. In this paper, we tackle the problem of increasing the convergence basin of ICP algorithms, which often require a rough initial guess to obtain good results. We propose a novel family of ICP-based algorithms that perform registration over the augmented SE(3) space by including additional information about the local geometry through Triple Orthogonal Local Depth Images (TOLDI) local reference frame (LRF) technique. The key step in our proposed method is a new correspondence search step that computes the nearest neighbors by comparing distances in the SE(3) space while effectively balancing the importance of the rotation and translation components.We thoroughly compare the proposed methods with 16 other algorithms over diverse environments, including synthetic, indoor RGBD, and outdoor LiDAR data. The three algorithms from the proposed family that we implement, namely the SE(3)-pt2pt, SE(3)-pt2pl, and SE(3)-GICP methods achieve a consistent improvement in robustness to large initial displacements compared to the related iterative closest point algorithms. Our SE(3)-GICP algorithm variant substantially outperforms competitive fine registration algorithms on synthetic problems with large initial displacements and indoor RGBD experiments, whereas it remains on par with the best methods for the outdoor LiDAR dataset"

The thermal flux PSD can be accurately approximated as Si,T(f)≈4k(T2+Ta2)(Yth)/2-(T-Ta)2Gth/6 where k is the Boltzmann constant, Yth and Gth is the AC and DC thermal admittances, and T and Ta are the the device and ambient temperatures, respectively. We further demonstrate that a simple one-node RC model, combined with a frequency-independent flux PSD, provides a reasonable approximation for the frequency dependence of the temperature fluctuation PSD."

    "abstract": "Long Range (LoRa) technology is one of the most promising Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) technologies that has attracted much attention from research and academia owing to its wide area coverage, robustness to the Doppler effect and low energy consumption. The main purpose for moving from Sub-GHz to 2.4 GHz was to take advantage of the globally available 2.4 GHz ISM band. The major challenge of LoRa 2.4 GHz is the coexistence with other various technologies that currently utilize the 2.4 GHz ISM band such as Wi-Fi. This paper investigates the impact of Wi-Fi interference on LoRa communication in the 2.4 GHz band and presents an effective approach to mitigate the interference of Wi-Fi on LoRa and enable the coexistence between technologies in the 2.4 GHz Unlicensed Band. In this approach, frequency domain tracking and adaptive filtering are utilized. Thus, the interference from the OFDM subcarriers that interfere with LoRa’s transmissions is identified and tracked via the power spectral density (PSD). The paper employs a simulation framework to assess the effectiveness of an Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) Butterworth adaptive filtering to mitigate the interference. This method dynamically adjusts to interference to ensure efficient LoRa communication despite Wi-Fi interference. Simulation results demonstrate that an adaptive filter targeting the primary OFDM subcarrier frequencies can improve Bit Error Rate (BER) performance of LoRa system. With Butterworth filtering (order = 4, 4 bands), the LoRa BER under Wi-Fi interference is reduced (from ≈ 3×10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">−1</sup> to ≈ 10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">−4</sup> at SNR = 8 dB), enabling near-unity packet success probability (normalized throughput) and a near-zero packet loss rate (PLR) in the 2.4 GHz ISM coexistence scenario."

    "abstract": "In multichannel magnetocardiography (MCG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG) systems based on atomic magnetometers, the stray field derived from the magnetic coils are the main cause of the crosstalk noises. In this article, a novel nested self-shielded biplanar (NSSB) coil constructed by primary and shielded coils is proposed to suppress the stray field. The coil design theory is based on a modified target field method (TFM) after uniting the inner and outer target regions. And to obtain the optimal design parameters, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm with a dynamic adjusting strategy is involved. According to the simulation results from the finite element analysis (FEA) method, the NSSB coil has the capacity to reduce the stray field by about 100 times. In addition, the magnetic field noise originated from the magnetic coil itself can be suppressed by more than 10 times. An up-scaled test coil of 10 times is then manufactured via the printed circuit board (PCB) technology, and the measured results inside and outside the test coil show a high consistency with the simulation ones. Although there is a five-fold reduction of the uniformity performance in the inner target region, this NSSB coil is still promising in miniatured atomic magnetometers."

    "abstract": "Adaptive video streaming has become a core technology for modern video delivery, particularly in cellular networks. However, the growing dynamics of mobile environments and the diversity of user preferences present major challenges for adaptive bitrate (ABR) algorithms. Existing approaches often struggle to maintain a balance between high in-distribution performance and strong generalization across heterogeneous network conditions and personalized Quality of Experience (QoE) demands. To address these challenges, we propose NMoEABR, a unified ABR decision-making framework that integrates a nonlinear Mixtureof- Experts (NMoE) architecture with preference-aware metareinforcement learning. Specifically, we design an NMoE-based actor network that adaptively aggregates expert policies through dynamic convolution conditioned on real-time network states, thereby enhancing robustness and cross-network generalization in a zero-hot manner. Furthermore, to mitigate convergence difficulties arising from the joint optimization of expert policies and expert-weight prediction, we introduce a preference-aware meta-RL strategy that incorporates user preference embeddings and virtual preference synthesis to stabilize meta-policy updates. Comprehensive evaluations on real-world traces and wireless testbed demonstrate that NMoEABR consistently outperforms mainstream ABR benchmarks in terms of average QoE, stability, and adaptability, particularly under unseen network conditions and diverse user preference distributions."

Achieving such an objective requires fast and accurate core scheduling policies.

Currently, no analytical techniques exist to study the interactions between these controllers. In this paper, we use performance verification to establish bounds on the throughput and latency achieved by a server that employs state-of-the-art fine-grained core allocation and overload control mechanisms. Our model enables system performance analysis under a wide range of workload and system configurations (e.g., RTT, load, and burstiness). We show that worst-case throughput and latency degrade by $1.8 \\times$ and $2.3 \\times$, respectively, under high load and burstiness due to the interactions between overload control and fast core allocation. We validate our findings using simulations that demonstrate the plausibility of the identified worst-case behavior under realistic conditions."

    "abstract": "Characterization of fragmented rock piles is a fundamental task in the mining and quarrying industries, where rock is fragmented by blasting, transported using wheel loaders, and then sent for further processing. This field report studies a novel method for estimating the relative particle size of fragmented rock piles from only proprioceptive data collected while digging with a wheel loader. Rather than employ exteroceptive sensors (e.g., cameras or LiDAR sensors) to estimate rock particle sizes, the studied method infers rock fragmentation from an excavator’s inertial response during excavation. This paper expands on research that postulated the use of wavelet analysis to construct a unique feature that is proportional to the level of rock fragmentation. We demonstrate through extensive field experiments that the ratio of wavelet features, constructed from data obtained by excavating in different rock piles with different size distributions, approximates the ratio of the mean particle size of the two rock piles. Full-scale excavation experiments were performed with a battery electric, 18-tonne capacity, load-haul-dump (LHD) machine in representative conditions in an operating quarry. The relative particle size estimates generated with the proposed sensing methodology are compared with those obtained from both a vision-based fragmentation analysis tool and from sieving of sampled materials."

    "abstract": "Inter-turn short circuit (ITSC) faults are among the most common and critical failures in induction motors (IMs), necessitating accurate diagnosis for effective fault-tolerant control. However, diagnosing incipient ITSC faults is often complicated by voltage harmonics introduced by system nonidealities. To address this challenge, this article proposes a diagnostic strategy that explicitly accounts for such nonidealities. Two coupling models of the motor voltage signals are developed: 1) one incorporating only system nonidealities; and 2) the other including both nonidealities and ITSC faults. These models are employed to analyze the mapping relationships and spectral characteristics of voltage harmonics in both healthy and faulty motors. Given that current sensor scaling errors can lead to ITSC misdiagnosis, the proposed strategy first calibrates these errors using a gradient descent method, followed by ITSC detection based on the third-harmonic voltage. Experimental results validate the proposed approach, demonstrating its capability to mitigate the influence of sensor errors and enhance the reliability of ITSC fault diagnosis."

As a leader, the base station (BS) aims to maximize the benefit-cost ratio by jointly optimizing the position of the MAs and the transmit beamforming, thereby enhancing communication and sensing performance while reducing transmission power. As the follower, the Jammer attempts to minimize its energy consumption while ensuring that its jamming energy efficiency reaches a predefined threshold. To solve the game equilibrium problem, the optimal jamming power of the Jammer is determined using duality theory. For the BS's optimal response strategy, the jamming power is upper-bounded using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, and a flexible mode-switching mechanism between communication priority and sensing priority is introduced. The BS's transmit beamforming is then optimized using quadratic transform methods, while the optimal antenna positions are determined by applying submodular function maximization techniques. Furthermore, the existence and uniqueness of the proposed game's Stackelberg equilibrium have been established. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed model achieves a balance between power control, anti-jamming capability, and the trade-off between communication and sensing performance."

Recently, double-actor DRL methods have emerged as a promising class of DRL approaches, achieving substantial advancements in both exploration and Q-value estimation. However, existing double-actor DRL methods feature actors that operate independently in exploring the environment, lacking mutual learning and collaboration, which leads to suboptimal policies. To address this challenge, this work proposes a generic solution that can be seamlessly integrated into existing double-actor DRL methods by promoting mutual learning among the actors to develop improved policies. Specifically, we calculate the difference in actions output by the actors and minimize this difference as a loss during training to facilitate mutual imitation among the actors. Simultaneously, we also minimize the differences in Q-values output by the various critics as part of the loss, thereby avoiding significant discrepancies in value estimation for the imitated actions. We present two specific implementations of our method and extend these implementations beyond double-actor DRL methods to other DRL approaches to encourage broader adoption. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves twenty state-of-the-art (SOTA) DRL methods, including SOTA double-actor DRL methods, across eleven tasks, as measured by return and other metrics."

However, in highly turbid inland and coastal waters, traditional AC algorithms typically require shortwave infrared (SWIR) or ultraviolet (UV) bands, thereby limiting their applicability to sensors that lack such bands (e.g., HY-3A CZI). To address these limitations, we introduce ACTransNet, an end-to-end deep learning model based on the Transformer architecture. This model directly retrieves Rrs from satellite digital numbers (DNs), bypassing the explicit radiometric calibration (RC) process. The model is trained on synthetic datasets derived from Sentinel-2 MSI, with reference Rrs generated using a combined strategy that involves the POLYMER and ACOLITE-DSF algorithms. The training data span 40 distinct regions, covering diverse water environments ranging from clear open ocean to turbid coastal and inland waters. These data undergo a strict quality control process to ensure their representativeness and reliability. Application results using CZI data demonstrate that ACTransNet performs robustly across seven spectral bands, with <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R<sup>2</sup></i> values ranging from 0.61 to 0.97. In the visible bands, ACTransNet substantially reduces the mean absolute percentage difference (MAPD), with an average reduction of ∼ 82% relative to ACOLITE-DSF and ∼ 74% relative to NIR-bio. Comparisons with quasi-synchronized Sentinel-2 MSI imagery further confirm that the model maintains strong spatial consistency (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R<sup>2</sup></i> > 0.96) across two contrasting water environments (the eastern coast of the Bay of Bengal and Lake Hulun). In a separate evaluation, the model also outperforms traditional multi-step AC algorithms, such as DSF and NIR-bio. Overall, ACTransNet integrates the strengths of both POLYMER and DSF, offering enhanced accuracy and robustness across diverse water environments. This model provides a practical and generalizable solution for AC tasks, particularly for sensors with limited spectral bands, and offers valuable references for remote sensing applications on other similar satellite platforms."

    "abstract": "Band sampling (BSam) is a new concept recently developed for hyperspectral imaging. It implements a two-stage process by randomly sampling a partial band subset from full bands in the first stage followed by a series of feedback loops in the second stage which captures spatial information from the processed data to augment the current data cube in an iterative manner. Its potential and promise have been demonstrated in hyperspectral anomaly detection and image classification. However, a direct application of BSam to endmember finding (EF) is not feasible because endmembers are considered as pure signatures and using spatial filters not only smears but also contaminates the signature purity of endmembers. To address this issue, this paper re-derives BSam as a new BSam without feedback, called repetitive band sampling (RBSam) which utilizes a repetitive process rather than an iterative feedback process to make BSam applicable to EF. In particular, the endmembers found by an EF algorithm are not necessarily true endmembers, in which case, such EF algorithm-found endmembers are referred to as virtual endmembers (VEs). Since virtual dimensionality (VD) used to determine number of endmembers, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n<sub>e</sub></i> is only an estimate and may not be accurate in real practical applications, to resolve this dilemma, a progressive RBSam (PRBSam) is further extended for this purpose.

As technological innovation introduces diverse information systems, the necessity for seamless data exchange has become increasingly critical, particularly with the rise of digital twin ecosystems. However, persistent interoperability challenges continue to result in significant problems that hinder effective communication and collaboration throughout the project lifecycle. To investigate why data interoperability remains a persistent challenge despite various industry efforts, a workshop was held with over 40 experts to identify the practical barriers and enablers from an engineering management perspective. Qualitative analysis identified 12 barriers and 15 enablers, revealing that core impediments are not merely technological but inherently socio-technical, involving complex organizational and process-related factors. Key barriers include proprietary system integration and the difficulty of quantifying ROI, while the adoption of standards for multi-stakeholder collaboration and AI-driven automation serve as corresponding enablers. Based on these findings, six actionable strategies are proposed: (1) Overcome Integration Challenges and Vendor Lock-In, (2) Improve Adoption and Alignment of Standards, (3) Demonstrate and Quantify the Benefits of Interoperability, (4) Build Robust Data Governance and Ownership Frameworks, (5) Address Resistance to Process Change, and (6) Enhance Collaboration and Communication Structures. This study provides strategies addressing distinctive stakeholder priorities, including critical implications for SMEs and startups, thereby offering a roadmap to accelerate the realization of integrated digital twin ecosystems."

    "abstract": "HVAC control can be formulated as an optimization problem balancing energy consumption and occupant comfort. Model-based approaches such as model predictive control (MPC) deliver strong performance when accurate thermal models are available but degrade under model mismatch and require costly system identification. Learning-based methods, notably reinforcement learning (RL), avoid explicit modeling yet often incurs unsafe exploration, poor initial performance, and slow convergence in practice. We propose Optimization-Guided Behavioral Cloning with Restricted Residual Policy Learning (OGBC+RRPL), a hybrid framework that unites model-based optimization and data-driven adaptation. OGBC first builds an optimization-based HVAC control expert by solving a linear program derived from an approximate autoregressive thermal model and trains an initial policy offline via behavioral cloning. RRPL then refines this policy online by learning a compensating lightweight residual policy with an actor-critic algorithm enhanced by action clipping and critic regularization to ensure stable and safe updates. This design preserves optimization knowledge, mitigates catastrophic forgetting, and constrains risky exploration during online adaptation. Experiments on CityLearn v2 demonstrate that OGBC+RRPL delivers high-quality control immediately upon deployment, attains comparable or better performance far faster than standard online RL algorithms, and outperforms offline RL methods on both energy consumption and temperature-violation metrics. The results indicate that infusing optimization guidance into residual online learning provides a practical, data-efficient, and safe approach for real-world HVAC control. Our implementation code can be found at https://github.com/HailongW0818/HVAC-OGBC-RRPL."

    "abstract": "Emerging markets like the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) are highly volatile and prone to sudden price swings that traditional sentiment-based financial models often fail to capture, creating heightened risks for investors and the broader economy. Although existing studies highlight the strong influence of news sentiment on investor behavior and market activity, the temporal dimension, specifically how long it takes for news to affect price movements, remains largely underexplored in emerging markets and economies, particularly within the Philippine context. This study examines the temporal impact of news sentiment on stock index prediction in an empirical manner by evaluating the predictive power of lagged local news sentiment on the Philippine Stock Exchange Index (PSEi) and assessing how different lag durations (in days) influence the performance of a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) prediction model. To focus on the effect of lagged sentiment under normal market conditions, historical post-COVID PSEi data covering four full years were collected alongside more than 120,000 news articles from the finance-related sections of multiple major Philippine news outlets. Sentiment scores were generated using FinBERT, and wavelet coherence analysis was applied to decompose both sentiment and PSEi time series into frequency components and empirically identify optimal lag values through cross-correlation. The Bi-LSTM is fed and evaluated using RMSE, MDA, R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>, MAE, and MAPE to measure accuracy and directional correctness across time horizons. Results show that the most effective lag value for prediction is a 1-day lag of local news sentiment. Additionally, Corporate, Banking, and Economy news demonstrate the strongest predictive power, while Entrepreneurship and IT-Telecom sectors are less influential. When combining news sentiments, the model performs best with no lag added, and predictive accuracy improves as the lag length decreases."

    "abstract": "Insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT), as the most widely used power semiconductor device, its performance will directly determine the performance and stability of the power electronic system. With the use of power electronics in power systems, power semiconductors are more and more widely used in this field. With the growth of the use of time, power semiconductor devices will appear different degrees of decline characteristics, when the aging degree is more serious, the module internal material fatigue accumulation leads to the final failure of the package structure aging, a great threat to the stability of the system. Since material fatigue is difficult to observe directly, and the working environment of power semiconductor devices is complex, there is still a lack of more perfect life assessment strategy. The issues mentioned above were addressed in this paper by adopting a feed-forward neural network algorithm. Multiple characteristic parameters were utilized as the basis for determination, and a life assessment strategy for IGBT modules was designed, excluding the influence of environmental factors such as temperature and working conditions. Experimental verification was conducted for the Infineon FF450R17ME4 module, and a dataset was constructed by collecting feature parameters at different temperatures through offline experiments. This was completed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the evaluation strategy designed in the study."

    "abstract": "The growing sophistication of contemporary cyber threats necessitates a more effective and adaptive approach to cybersecurity training. Intuitive and adaptive approaches to learning, which are often required, are not provided in traditional learning methods. In this article, we present a new educational framework, \"Learning to Explain Cybersecurity with Q20 Game\", based on explainable AI (XAI), an educational game to enhance interactivity in learning. We propose a novel, game-inspired framework - the Explainable Q20 Cybersecurity Recommender (EQ-20CR), that learns to elicit the minimal set of evidential facts needed to justify cybersecurity defensive action. By casting \"Why should I execute this mitigation?\" as a 20 questions (Q20) game, a policy-based reinforcement-learning (RL) agent actively queries an environment until it can both (i) recommend the optimal security education and (ii) explain that decision with a concise dialogue trace. The article draws from \"Playing 20 Question Game with Policy-Based Reinforcement Learning\" [1] and \"Learning-to-Explain: Recommendation Reason Determination through Q20 Gaming\" [2]. The framework uses a policy-based reinforcement learning (RL) agent that leads the user through a sequence of questions to recognize and articulate a targeted cybersecurity concept, attack vector, or defense strategy. Furthermore, users are gradually exposed to informative questions by the system, revealing complicated, structured way at an adaptive difficulty level. In this paper, we design the architecture, its application to various concepts of cybersecurity through illustrative case studies, and its transformative potential on the training and awareness of cybersecurity recommendations."

The model errors in initial (analysis) fields significantly influence on forecast skill at monthly and longer (long-term) timescales. Weak-constraint four-dimensional variational (4D-Var) data assimilation enhances initial field accuracy by incorporating model error terms in the cost function, yet effectively estimating and correcting model errors remains challenging. This study addresses the pronounced model errors in stratospheric temperature within the YHEDA2.2.5 system by proposing an attention mechanism-based U-Net neural network model combined with deep learning, aiming to intelligently estimate and correct model errors in assimilation analyses to improve both assimilation quality and NWP accuracy. Experimental results indicate that the CBAM-enhanced U-Net model effectively captures spatial and vertical distribution features of stratospheric temperature model errors, significantly reducing discrepancies between corrected background fields and analysis fields. This study provides a novel approach for intelligent estimation and correction of stratospheric temperature model errors, which could be further incorporated as forcing terms in weak-constraint 4D-Var data assimilation systems."

LiFi offers indoors high throughput and line of sight wireless connections with reduction of RF congestion although LiFi terminals still need very robust cryptographic measures against spoofing and exfiltration of data. We combine a lattice-based KEM (CRYSTALS-Kyber/ Kyber-lite style) that is our main key-encapsulation system with an efficient signature/hybrid authentication protocol to implement forward-secure and quantumresistant session keys on resource-constrained ESP32 platforms. We describe the hardware/software integration, optimization of memory and CPU using the ESP32 dual core and hardware AES, and a small protocol stack on the LiFi sensor device. Our implementation in ESP32 Kyber is feasible based on existing ESP32 Kyber-based ESP32 implementations and the literature of PQC in IoT; we give an evaluation plan and predictable latency/throughput tradeoffs of realistic deployments inside homes. The suggested architecture allows to support the implementation of privacy-sensitive LiFi sensing into the interior with security, at the same time being viable on off-the-shelf microcontroller systems."

Then, vibration experiments are conducted, where the zero-order radial electromagnetic force generated by the twice switching frequency sideband current is used as the excitation. Through changing the switching frequency, the zero-order modal resonance frequency is covered by the frequency of the generated zero-order radial electromagnetic force, and the vibration acceleration at the stator surface is measured under different switching frequencies. Finally, a genetic algorithm is adopted to obtain the material parameters of the stator assembly. The material parameters of the stator assembly are encoded, and a population is established. Through finite element harmonic response analysis, the error between the finite element simulation and the vibration experiment results under the stator surface is taken as the optimization objective, and iterative optimization is carried out to ultimately determine the material parameters of the stator assembly."

However, partial discharge (PD) may occur inside GIS during long-term operation, serving as a precursor to insulation faults. Compared with acoustic and optical PD detection methods, UHF sensors offer higher sensitivity, more robust anti-interference capabilities, and the advantage of online, non-intrusive monitoring. Employing Ultra-High Frequency (UHF) non-intrusive sensors for online PD monitoring of GIS offers advantages such as high sensitivity, strong anti-interference capability, convenient installation, and operation without power interruption. It has become one of the mainstream detection technologies. This paper systematically introduces the arrangement methods of UHF sensors, signal acquisition and processing procedures, interference suppression strategies, and PD type identification methods. Combined with field application cases, it verifies the feasibility and effectiveness of this technology in practical engineering. Research shows that the UHF non-intrusive monitoring system can efficiently extract and accurately locate PD signals, providing strong support for GIS condition assessment and fault early warning."

    "abstract": "Formal semantics has long modeled meaning as a system of symbolic structures mapped onto syntactic forms. However, recent developments in psycholinguistics, embodied cognition, and artificial intelligence suggest a different path—one grounded in dynamic, procedural reasoning. This paper introduces container logic, a cognitively motivated framework in which verbs and predicates act as cognitive containers projecting internal expectations. We show how this model accounts for control, raising, and scope phenomena, not through derivations, but through real-time simulation and working memory dynamics. By drawing parallels to the behavior of large language models (LLMs), we suggest that language processing, human or artificial, relies on the ability to coordinate simulation structures across participants and systems. Procedural fluency, rather than symbolic competence, emerges as the core of both understanding and learning. Within this framework, AI becomes more than a computational tool: it supports the development of cooperative reasoning, scaffolding shared cognition in educational contexts. We argue that container-based semantics opens new possibilities for modeling, pedagogy, and the evolving role of AI in language learning and cognitive development."

Upon completion of the platform’s initial development, a user evaluation was conducted with 52 student participants through a structured questionnaire. The evaluation assessed the platform across four dimensions: system usability, perceived usefulness, user satisfaction, and usage intention. The results indicate that the platform significantly enhances learning interactivity, fosters motivation, and improves the overall user experience. These findings affirm the feasibility and practical value of embedding intelligent chatbot systems in online learning environments.

    "abstract": "In order to improve the target detection performance of millimeter-wave detection radar, it is usually necessary to increase the aperture to improve the resolution. However, in various complex environments, the lack of known position targets and low signal-to-noise ratio lead to the limited calibration accuracy of large-diameter coherent arrays, which in turn affects the target detection and sidelobe suppression effects. To solve this problem, this paper adopts the design method of incoherent node system to replace the traditional coherent array structure while maintaining the coherence of each transceiver channel, and reduce the continuous dependence of the system on high-precision online calibration. In order to further control the hardware cost and avoid the use of full-array antennas at each node, the antennas are sparsely arranged and the sidelobe suppression level is used as the key optimization index. By introducing the particle swarm optimization algorithm for sparse array design, the number of antennas is minimized and the side lobes are effectively suppressed. In summary, this paper uses the incoherent node system and antenna sparse arrangement to improve the target detection ability of millimeter-wave radar."

The medium voltage hybrid flexible interconnection switch has two ports, each used to connect two medium voltage AC distribution networks. The hybrid flexible interconnect switch is composed of a mechanical switch and an electronic flexible interconnect switch connected in parallel. When both medium voltage distribution networks are receiving power from the transmission line normally, the electronic flexible interconnection switch can control the active power transmitted between the two ports, thereby achieving flexible power transfer. When one of the upper level main grids or transmission lines of the distribution network fails and causes power loss, the mechanical switch closes to achieve fault transfer. Therefore, the power transmission capacity of electronic flexible interconnection switches depends only on the flexible adjustment capacity demand between two medium voltage distribution networks, and is independent of the capacity required for fault transfer."

To explore the reasons behind such misuse, this study used grounded theory to analyze original data from 27 official reports of global K-12 AI educational product misuse cases through three - level coding. It found three main factors: technological flaws, institutional gaps, and ethical disorder. Technological flaws come from design flaws and data security risks under tool rationality. Institutional gaps show the tension between weak supervision and capital expansion. Ethical disorder reflects how technical power distorts education's essence. Based on these findings, the study suggests a tiered governance approach: building a secure technology standard system, improving policy frameworks and multi - stakeholder governance mechanisms, and re - emphasizing \"people - oriented\" educational values."

To solve this problem, this paper proposes an adaptive fusion framework that integrates multimodal detection and trajectory estimation. The system switches between YOLOv8 object detection and AprilTag recognition to the scene conditions to ensure stable recognition. The MedianFlow method is used to predict the occlusion trajectory. A trajectory denoising module based on DBSCAN is used to extract representative motion patterns, and the detection results are fused with dynamic prior information using the CTRA-EKF model to achieve high-precision center and angle estimation. Experiments in multi-light source environments show that the proposed method maintains the continuity of the trajectory in the presence of occlusion and has an average heading error of 0.39°, a 78.7% reduction (from 1.83° to 0.39°) compared to the traditional CTRA+KF method. In 998 multi-scenario sequences, the average pixel and angle errors reach 12.41 pixels and 0.78° respectively, verifying the robustness and measurement accuracy of the proposed framework.When deployed on the RK3576 platform, the proposed method achieves a frame rate of 4K@4 FPS while maintaining minimal pixel and angular errors."

A common limitation of conventional 2D histograms, typically built from the central pixel's intensity and the local arithmetic mean, is their insufficient characterization of local texture, as they can be insensitive to significant tonal variations within the neighborhood. To overcome this, we introduce a novel 2D histogram construction guided by the minimum intensity value. Specifically, the proposed histogram is formed by pairing the intensity of each central pixel with the minimum gray value from a specifically defined 3-pixel neighborhood that strategically excludes the right-side pixel. This design aims to better capture local dark features and edges. The efficacy of our method is rigorously evaluated on standard test images, demonstrating that it produces segmentation results that are highly competitive with and often surpass those of current state-of-the-art thresholding techniques."

    "abstract": "During the de-icing operation of high voltage overhead transmission lines using a mobile DC de-icing device, the energization of the rectifier transformer will produce inrush current, which causes the relay protection to operate and makes the DC de-icing device unable to work. This paper conducts simulations on the inrush current of the rectifier transformer in a mobile DC de-icing device using a 10kV emergency generation vehicle as the AC power source. The influence of the winding connection type of the rectifier transformer on the inrush current is analyzed. This paper proposes an operation method of stepping up from zero voltage for the unloaded rectifier transformer by using the generator excitation control system of the generator in the emergency generation vehicle. The simulation results show that when the Δ/Y connected rectifier transformer is energized, the inrush current amplitude can reach 516.5A. With the application of the stepping up from zero voltage operation of the rectifier transformer, the inrush current can be limited to less than 1.0A. This ensures the mobile DC de-icing operation of transmission lines can be carried out safely and smoothly."

En-hancing the performance of MBS systems, however, requires innovative solutions for dynamic beam hopping (BH) and bandwidth allocation algorithms. In this paper, we investigate the satellite communication optimi-zation problem and introduce a new MBS control scheme that integrates BH scheduling with bandwidth sharing and distribution strategies.

    "abstract": "In order to improve the performance of micro-hemispherical resonant gyroscopes, it is necessary to eliminate the mode orientation offset and frequency split of the micro shell resonator (MSR). In this paper, a improved trimming strategy for the wineglass mode of MSR with T-shaped masses is proposed. Through the meticulous simulation of the mode orientation and frequency split for trimming grooves at varying positions on the MSR, it has been determined that the optimal position for mode orientation trimming is within 5° of the high-frequency mode. It can effectively reduce frequency split while minimizing mode orientation, thereby enhancing trimming efficiency. In simulations, the mode orientation offset and frequency split of the MSR efficiently decreased to the element division limit. In femtosecond laser ablation experiments, the frequency split of the resonator was significantly reduced during mode orientation offset trimming(< 1°), and further decreased to 0.19 Hz during frequency trimming. The experimental trends closely match the simulation results. This method has been demonstrated to trim the MSR’s mode orientation offset and frequency split more efficiently and reliably."

To resolve the challenge of implementing multiband operation with consistent polarization within limited volume, the proposed antenna design combines the techniques of multimode resonant patch and multi-resonant feeding. The upper radiating patch integrates a modified U-slot for enabling tri-band multimode resonance, while the middle-layer T-shaped feeding structure is loaded with two shorting pins and a notched square ring thus contributing two additional resonant bands via mode splitting. The antenna achieves a measured fractional operating bandwidth of 2.0%, 5.9%, 5.3%, 3.1% and 2.0% at 1.13, 1.62, 2.06, 2.62 and 2.88 GHz with |S<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">11</sub>| < -10 dB, respectively. Far-field measurement results confirm identical polarization mode and stable broadside radiation patterns across all bands. On-body evaluations reveal that the specific absorption rate values are below 0.4 W/kg with the input power of 1 W, complying well with the safety limit. This antenna shall be very attractive for off-body communications."

To address these issues, this paper proposes a Piecewise Affine (PWA)-based distributed scheme for Model Predictive Control (MPC) that optimizes energy and comfort through PWA-based quadratic programming. We utilize the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) for effective decomposition and apply the PWA technique to handle the nonlinear components. To solve the resulting large-scale nonconvex problems, the paper introduces a convex ADMM algorithm that transforms the nonconvex problem into a series of smaller convex problems, significantly enhancing computational efficiency. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the convex ADMM algorithm converges to a local optimum of the original problem. A case study involving 36 zones validates the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our proposed method reduces execution time by 86% compared to the centralized version."

Intracavitary MITAI is particularly attractive because microwave excitation can be delivered extracorporeally while reusing conventional ultrasound probes, making the three-dimensional (3-D) intracavitary MITAI conceptually simple and highly feasible. However, 3-D MITAI based on a self-rotating transrectal linear-array probe suffers from severe artifacts caused by the limited receive aperture in both the rotational and elevational directions, which can drastically degrade image quality. To address this problem, we design a 3-D MITAI framework that employs a transrectal intracavitary linear-array probe performing 360<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$^\\circ$</tex-math></inline-formula> self-rotation, and we propose two 3-D image reconstruction strategies: (1) a fast method based on two-dimensional (2-D) slice post-processing and direct 3-D point-cloud mapping, in which, for each rotation angle, the multi-channel radio-frequency (RF) data are independently reconstructed using 2-D delay-and-sum (DAS) combined with band-pass filtering, depth window gating, dynamic aperture control, coherence-factor (CF) weighting, ring-buffer detection, and multi-threshold gating, after which the cleaned pixels in the <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$r$</tex-math></inline-formula>–<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$z$</tex-math></inline-formula>cross-sectional plane are geometrically mapped into 3-D voxels or point clouds to achieve efficient 3-D reconstruction; and (2) a full-wavefield method that treats the multi-angle data acquired during rotation as a virtual 2-D cylindrical aperture, explicitly computes the propagation delays from each voxel in 3-D space to all virtual elements, and performs 3-D DAS beamforming to obtain a volumetric dataset with effective suppression of limited-aperture artifacts. Preliminary experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves lateral resolutions of 0.924 mm and 0.979 mm and axial resolutions of 0.737 mm and 0.966 mm for the two methods, respectively. Both strategies successfully realize 360<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$^\\circ$</tex-math></inline-formula> 3-D imaging, and with GPU acceleration, the full-wavefield 3-D reconstruction time is reduced from 2193 s to approximately 192 s. The proposed approach provides a practical solution for transrectal 3-D MITAI and, when combined with efficient large-area microwave illumination and potentially with conventional ultrasound readout, has strong potential for multimodal intracavitary applications such as rectum and surrounding vasculature imaging, where complementary acoustic structural and electromagnetic functional information could improve diagnostic accuracy."

However, for UAV systems that rely solely on point features, weak-texture environments cause a decline in pose estimation accuracy, creating a severe localization challenge. The fusion of line and point features introduces more geometric constraints, enhancing system robustness and localization accuracy. This letter presents a lightweight monocular visual-inertial SLAM framework, WEMA-VINS (Weak-grid ELSED MIS-filtered and Angular-constrained VINS), designed for robust point-line fusion. It integrates weak-texture region elimination, ELSED line detection, Maximum Independent Set (MIS)-based pruning of redundant segments, and an angular-constrained line optimization module. Our proposed framework collectively improves point feature quality, preserves structural line information, and enhances robustness against endpoint drift and partial occlusion, leading to reliable point-line fusion and efficient state estimation. Extensive experiments on the KAIST VIO and EuRoC datasets demonstrate that WEMA-VINS significantly improves both localization accuracy and robustness, consistently achieving leading performance over recent point-line SLAM baselines while maintaining real-time efficiency."

However, AI agents remain weak in plan verification and are vulnerable to perception errors caused by dynamic environments and inconsistent Industrial Internet of Things data. These limitations critically undermine the effectiveness of AI agent planning in complex production environments. To address the limitations, this study proposes a digital twin-aided AI (DTAI) agent-based production system, in which digital twins provide a causal data provisioning and simulation layer to support situation awareness and decision validation. A causally consistent symbiotic simulation approach is further introduced to align simulation results with actual production processes while reducing monitoring overhead. Controlled experiments show that the proposed approach achieves a higher rate of optimal scheduling while reducing monitoring overhead with production increase, and lowers computational cost compared with alternative digital twin synchronization designs. A large-scale aerospace manufacturing case study demonstrates that DTAI-based scheduling with consistent symbiotic simulation can largely reduce rescheduling rate by identifying and eliminating most resource conflicts, which further improves multi-objective production efficiency, including equipment usage, makespan, etc. These results indicate that the proposed framework provides a practical and verifiable solution for deploying AI agent-based intelligent manufacturing systems."

However, existing studies often oversimplify the respective strengths of CNNs and Transformers, attributing them solely to their abilities to capture local and global information. This characterization is neither precise nor reflective of their fundamental differences, leading to network designs that rely heavily on empirical practices rather than theoretical insights. To address this limitation and enhance the interpretability of fusion networks, we conduct a Fourier analysis to elucidate the distinct roles of CNNs and Transformers from a novel frequency perspective. Our analysis reveals that CNNs and Transformers exhibit contrasting properties in the frequency domain. However, prior CNN-Transformer hybrid architectures have failed to leverage these characteristics, resulting in a loss of low frequency contextual information.

Firstly, a frequency complementary learning mechanism is utilized to integrate the strengths of CNNs and Transformers in representation learning, effectively capturing essential low frequency features and rich high frequency details. Secondly, a frequency rebalancing module is designed to address the imbalance between high and low frequency components in the synthesized feature maps, ensuring their frequency distribution aligns with that of natural images. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed FCRNet. Additionally, experiments on downstream tasks validates the practicality of FCRNet."

Distinct from traditional asymptotic synchronization, which theoretically requires infinite time, a prescribed-time control scheme is proposed to force the system states to synchronize within a user-defined duration. Specifically, a coordinate transformation is introduced to eliminate the drift induced by heterogeneous natural power injections, and a time-varying scaling function is incorporated into the controller design to regulate the convergence rate. Based on a constructed Lyapunov function containing cross-terms, rigorous theoretical analysis ensures that the synchronization error converges to zero at the prescribed time regardless of initial conditions. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach."

    "abstract": "We consider an epidemic model formed by N elements, where $N\\lt \\infty$. More precisely, we analyze the susceptible-infected-recovered-susceptible (SIRS) with vaccinations, an extension of the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model where the susceptible population can be vaccinated and a recovered element is again susceptible after a random time. In our model, susceptible elements can avoid getting the infection with some probability (i.e., with a lockdown probability). We assume that each infected element incurs a cost per unit of time and the susceptible population incurs a cost that is decreasing and linear on the lockdown probability. We investigate a non-cooperative game where each player is an element of the population that can select its lockdown probability and aims to minimize its expected cost. Our first contribution consists of formulating the best response lockdown strategy of one player to the strategy of the rest of the players as a Markov Decision Process, which combined with a simple fixed-point algorithm, allows us to compute a solution to this decentralized setting (i.e., a symmetric Nash equilibrium of the game under analysis). We also formulate the centralized problem of finding the global optimum of this model, i.e., the lockdown strategy that minimizes the cost of the whole population, as a Markov Decision Process. We establish some analytical results on the structure of the solution of the centralized and the decentralized problems. Furthermore, our numerical results show that both strategies have a switching curve. We also conclude that the derived Nash equilibria and the global optimum are very similar, i.e. the decentralized architecture is very close to optimal. Finally, we conclude that the global optimum strategy confines more than the solution of the decentralized system (i.e. than the Nash equilibrium)."

    "abstract": "Digitalization strategies emerge through interactions among producers, consumers, and institutions across value chains, leading to gains in productivity, the introduction of new patents, and innovations in products and processes. Dynamic Capabilities theory extends the static resource-based view of the firm by incorporating learning and innovation in evolving environments. Its collaborative extension has recently been introduced to analyze the behavior of corporate dynamics within evolving ecosystems shaped by Information and Communication Technologies and firms' digitalization strategies. However, empirical evaluations of how digital value chains influence firm level productivity and innovation remain limited, relying on static efficiency evaluation frameworks. We apply a dynamic Slacks-Based Data Envelopment Analysis model to a panel of 1,369 Spanish manufacturing firms progressing through the emergence and consolidation phases of digitalization that have characterized the early decades of the twenty-first century. We examine how efficiency and competitiveness evolve, finding that larger firms and those in more complex technological sectors show more varied behavior but lower inefficiency. The findings offer implications for theory, best practices, and digitalization policies. The robustness of our analysis has been validated by demonstrating substantial differences between the patterns obtained under the standard static and our dynamic evaluation environments."

    "abstract": "Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is a promising wireless architecture for next-generation networks, but its performance is still strongly affected by pilot contamination, especially in dense and mobile user environments. In this work, we introduce a two-stage pilot assignment framework that leverages structured clustering, systematic refinement, and a channel estimation model that accounts for hardware impairments. In the first stage, we generate a warm-start pilot assignment using an interference-aware hybrid density-based hierarchical clustering method, which groups users based on both spatial proximity and mutual interference. In the second stage, this initial solution is refined using a Tabu Search algorithm whose search space is pruned by a lightweight learning-based mechanism, allowing faster and more effective optimization. In addition, we extend the study to user mobility and evaluate the spectral efficiency of the proposed design under dynamic network conditions. Simulation results confirm that the proposed pilot assignment framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art pilot assignment schemes under both static and mobile scenarios."

However, as iterations proceed, population diversity diminishes, leading to reduced exploration capability and susceptibility to local optima, especially in multimodal or complex landscapes. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a Differential Evolution Based on Spatial Partition Perturbation Mechanism (SPMDE). The application of KD-Tree enables SPMDE to dynamically manage population distribution, update stagnant individuals, and maintain diversity, thereby strengthening its global search capability in the evolutionary process. CEC2017 benchmark problems is used to evaluate the overall performance of SPMDE. Experimental results indicate that SPMDE achieves highly competitive optimization performance when compared to both state-of-the-art DE variants and enhanced versions of classic evolutionary algorithms."

    "abstract": "Layer jamming brakes exhibit variable stiffness with vacuum pressure, allowing them to restrict relative motion between two points. These devices hold significant potential for wearable applications due to their lightweight nature and ability to generate substantial linear tension for load transfer or selective movement restriction. However, the challenge of integrating displacement sensors within their structure has not yet been solved. In this article, we introduce a layer jamming system with resistive sensing jamming layers. The proposed mechanism leverages the relative motion of internal overlapping sensing jamming layers to produce a variation in resistance which can inform the user about their relative displacement while also producing frictional forces. This sensing approach is inherently synergistic with the mechanism of the device as it simultaneously generates friction and enables real-time displacement measurement without altering the shape of the device. The proposed device can generate a tensile force of up to 1017 N, can sense displacements over the entire range of operation of jamming layer brakes (up to 82% displacement) with a gauge factor of 1.15 and a linearity error within 1%. We demonstrate its application as a wearable device with a controllable braking point algorithm and as an upper-arm support system."

    "abstract": "Except for purely resistive loads, DC microgrids (MGs) interfaced with boost or buck converters typically feed multistage power converters via a common bus. A notable class within this framework is the tightly regulated point-of-load (POL) converter, which behaves as a constant power load (CPL) within its control bandwidth. Considering the challenges posed by the negative incremental impedance characteristics of CPLs on MG stability, this article establishes a second-order fully actuated (SOFA) model for nonlinear MGs incorporating CPLs and proposes a fully actuated (FA) voltage regulator based on a disturbance estimator. The proposed approach accounts for both known and unknown CPL scenarios, including load variations that are not previously identified. Furthermore, a closed-loop MG system with FA control under parameter perturbation is analyzed based on singular perturbation theory. In this study, the first-order under-actuated MG system containing CPLs is transformed into an SOFA system by means of techniques such as state transformation, system dimension reduction, and system order augmentation. Compared to the existing methods, the proposed FA controller, based on this system model, features a straightforward and easy-to-implement structure, which makes the parameterized design of the controller possible. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method for achieving voltage tracking as well as system stability is confirmed through abundant experimental cases conducted on a built hardware MG platform."

    "abstract": "Existing Transformer- or Mamba-based low-light image enhancement (LLIE) methods can capture long-range dependencies in images and achieve global degradation restoration, but suffer from insufficient detail recovery. Besides, these methods do not consider the different illumination levels in various regions or enhance the regional illumination accordingly. Furthermore, existing denoising methods often overfit to single noise distribution and type, showing poor generalization to the noises in low-light images. To address these issues, we propose an Illumination-guided Grouped Attention (IGA) module and a Masked Progressive Denoising (MPD) module for low-light image enhancement. The IGA module first improves the local feature representation through detail recovery operations, and then iteratively groups the image representation based on the illumination levels and conducts grouped attention to achieve both fine detail recovery and adaptive regional illumination optimization. The MPD module explores correlations within and among regions to enhance the texture and structure representations from a local to global perspective, thus achieving both local and global denoising and well denoising generalization capability. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on eight datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art low-light image enhancement methods. Furthermore, plugging our proposed IGA and MPD modules into existing Transformer- or Mamba-based LLIE methods can significantly improve their performance, further demonstrating the modules' ability to address the common issues in such methods."

    "abstract": "Q(t) measurement has been developed as a diagnostic technique for electrical insulators in DC applications, and is widely used to compare the relative properties of polymeric samples under high voltage; however, its conventional usage is limited to analyzing the charge amount compared to the space charge phenomenon. Conversely, Q(t) measurement can also serve as a diagnostic tool for leakage current through insulation materials because of its relatively high precision; hence, this study focuses on utilizing this method as an online abnormal detector. However, first, noisy data resulting from variable circumstances remains a challenge, even when simple low-pass filters are applied. This study ensures noise reduction by assuming an ordinary differential equation model and applying Kalman filters/Rauch–Tung–Striebel (RTS) smoothers to the experimental data of a polyimide sheet sample. Filtering/smoothing reduces the noise level to less than 1/900 of the simple first-difference data when an RTS smoother is applied, according to the comparison method that utilizes linearly-approximated data. Then, fixed-lag smoothers are applied, generally obtaining more smoothed data than that of the Kalman filter. Through the filtered results and Kalman filters’ property as an adaptive low-pass filter, a direction for filter designing is proposed, which depends on ‘process noise to the 2nd power’ / ‘observation noise.’ The filtering/evaluation/designing methods utilized in this study are beneficial for more precise diagnoses and are expected to provide a foundation for online leakage current detection."

Findings show that initial selection is driven by scenario-based educational needs and family investment rationality, while continued use depends on behavioral incentive loops and emotional human-computer connections. Balancing technological empowerment and control remains a key challenge. Design should integrate functional suitability, behavioral motivation, and ethical control.

To address the challenges posed by Generative AI to employability, this study explores how both the teacher and the students can build AI agents to facilitate the development of L2 job interview skills. AI Interest Group (AIG) (N=12) used and built AI agents with teacher guidance, Group A (N=14) used AI informally, and Group B (N=11) did not use AI in preparation for an L2 job interview. Mixed methods were used to examine students’ job interview performance and anxiety change, their perceived benefits and the relevance of AI literacy incorporation in an EAP course. One-way ANOVA analysis showed no significant difference in performance scores between the AIG group and the other two, but a significant difference between Groups A and B. Mixed ANOVA analysis showed a significant drop in anxiety levels across all groups, with a notably larger decrease among the AIG students. Thematic analysis from the interview data endorsed AI’s role in scaffolding, explaining the drop in anxiety level. All AIG students successfully built AI agents. They perceived this incorporation to be extremely relevant and expressed a strong need for AI literacy development. The study implies it is possible and might also be necessary to incorporate AI literacy development in EAP courses. Future research could explore larger sample sizes and examine more controlled teaching and learning practices once institutional policies have matured."

To address these issues, this paper proposes a variable coefficient droop control strategy based on a hybrid physical mechanism–data-driven modeling approach, which simultaneously considers load analysis and physical modeling. Using k-means clustering, loads are classified and active power characteristic curves are extracted. These load profiles are then incorporated into the photovoltaic (PV) inverter control model. Based on real-time voltage variations, the droop control coefficient is dynamically adjusted, thereby improving voltage control performance in the transformer district."

A Lagrange polynomial function is then established to determine the extremum, thereby deriving the optimal solution for circulating power minimization. In addition, SMC is introduced to enhance the system’s disturbance rejection capability. To mitigate the chattering issue inherent in conventional SMC, fuzzy adaptive control mechanism is incorporated to dynamically adjust the sliding mode controller parameters, thereby reducing chattering and improving system accuracy and performance. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed optimization control strategy."

In existing studies, there are limitations in the accuracy of three-dimensional temperature field inversion. This study proposes a two-step integration framework of \"sea surface temperature prediction - three-dimensional temperature field inversion\": First, an innovative RG-Transformer model is used to predict the sea surface temperature at future moments based on historical sea surface temperature data, which addresses the issues of error accumulation and poor adaptability to spherical space in traditional models. Subsequently, the predicted sea surface temperature is used as input, combined with a Random Forest model trained on the Argo dataset, to invert the subsurface three-dimensional temperature field at a depth of 0-200 m for the corresponding moment. The experimental results show that this integrated framework achieves high-precision prediction and inversion in global ocean regions. For short-term (2-month) sea surface temperature prediction, the RMSE is as low as 0.33°C, and the average error of the corresponding three-dimensional temperature field inversion layer is 0.51°C, representing an accuracy improvement of approximately 48% compared to traditional methods. The method proposed in this study effectively solves the difficulties in ocean temperature field prediction and provides comprehensive spatiotemporal data support for research on changes in ocean heat content and the dynamic distribution of fishery resources."

For the international comparison of high voltage and high current standards, a star or loop (petal) method is adopted. The pilot laboratory calibrates the traveling standard against the national measurement standard and provides the uncertainty, using the calibration value of the traveling standard as the reference value. Domestic and international laboratories use their respective standard setups, test equipment, and measurement methods to complete tests on the same traveling standard used for comparison. During the comparison process, stability checks are required both when leaving and returning to the high voltage metrology station, and short-term stability is quantified. Provided no abnormalities in sample stability are detected, the same sample is used throughout the entire measurement comparison plan for circulation. Each time the sample returns to a laboratory, the laboratory must perform one stability check (n=10), until all participants have completed their tests. Through the precise calibration of the traveling standard by the pilot laboratory, multiple rounds of stability checks, and a unified data evaluation method, the international comparison of high voltage and high current standards was successfully completed, effectively enhancing the international applicability in the field of high voltage and high current metrology."

Conventional deep learning models often experience substantial performance degradation when device orientation varies, a common occurrence in real-world usage. To address this limitation, we propose a compact CNN-BiGRU architecture designed to learn orientation-invariant motion representations directly from raw gyroscope signals. The model integrates convolutional layers for local pattern extraction with bidirectional gated recurrent units that capture temporal dependencies, enabling robust recognition of motion dynamics rather than orientation-specific values. The framework is evaluated on the RL-HAR dataset, which contains four activity classes—active, driving, inactive, and walking—recorded under multiple device orientations from 19 participants with diverse demographic characteristics. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for mobile deployment. The CNN-BiGRU network achieves 94.26% accuracy (±0.47%) and a 93.39% F1-score (±0.47%), representing roughly a 5% improvement over the strongest baseline model. With only 1.2 million parameters and an inference time of approximately 3.2 milliseconds per sample, the model delivers precise and orientation-invariant activity classification with minimal misclassification across all activity categories. These findings highlight the potential of lightweight hybrid architectures for reliable real-world HAR applications."

Short cables in laboratory settings can be handled conventionally, whereas long field cables require determining the voltage stabilization time before optimizing the fitting strategy to ensure dielectric loss calculation accuracy."

    "abstract": "Aiming at the issues of insufficiently refined churn risk stratification and the suboptimal alignment between recall strategies and user preferences in the potential churn user prediction and recall for the State Grid online platform, this paper constructs a dual-path churn risk stratification and intelligent recall strategy model that integrates XGBoost prediction with user profiling. Based on the dual-path ensemble learning model, a churn risk prediction pathway—with Boruta-XGBoost at its core and driven by Bayesian optimization—has been constructed. This approach accomplishes a multi-level stratification of user churn risk into \"high, medium, and low\" tiers, and further achieves adaptive threshold adjustment through a PID-based dynamic control mechanism. On the other hand, a churn user profiling pathway is constructed by jointly employing three metrics—the Pearson correlation coefficient, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, and analysis of variance (ANOVA)—thereby modeling the behavioral patterns and demand preferences of potential churn users. Finally, a two-dimensional matrix mapping is employed to achieve the cross-integration of risk prediction and user profiling. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves a churn user prediction accuracy of 0.9384, an F1-score of 0.8413, and a maximum AUC value of 0.8861, thereby enabling precise prediction of State Grid online platform user churn and effective matching of recall strategies."

    "abstract": "This study addresses the temporal variability and uncertainty of wind and solar outputs that, when integrated at scale into distribution networks, can cause supply–demand imbalances, power-quality deterioration, and reduced reliability. A Transformer-Based reliability assessment method is developed for distribution networks with large-scale distributed energy: first, an improved minimal-path approach is formulated for networks containing distributed resources; when upstream component failures trigger outages in areas with distributed generation, those areas shift to islanded operation, prioritizing the restoration of essential loads within the island. Subsequently, a Transformer-Based procedure is introduced to determine reliability-index intervals by reframing prediction as a classification task, effectively mitigating the non-smooth behavior of the indices. The method’s effectiveness is demonstrated on the IEEE RBTS 6-node system (feeder 4). The proposed approach enables real-time monitoring and early warning of operational risks in distribution networks."

Then, the electromagnetic performance such as magnetic field distribution, air-gap flux density, no-load back electromotive force, electromagnetic torque and torque ripple of the traditional surface-mounted and Halbach array structures is analyzed. To further enhance the motor’s torque performance, the finite element method was employed to analyze how the main magnetic pole angle affects this performance. The analysis resulted in the determination of the main magnetic pole angle that delivers the optimal comprehensive torque performance."

    "abstract": "As AI-driven applications continue to scale, the reliance on microservices architecture has become critical for achieving modularity, agility, and high availability. API gateways serve as the primary interface for managing microservices communication by handling authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and traffic routing. However, traditional API gateways are increasingly inadequate in the face of evolving cybersecurity threats and unpredictable, high-throughput API traffic generated by AI workloads. Static configurations, lack of contextual awareness, and limited adaptability expose systems to security vulnerabilities and performance bottlenecks.This paper proposes an AI-enhanced API Gateway architecture that introduces intelligent security and performance features using advanced machine learning models. Key innovations include zero-trust security enforcement, machine learning-based anomaly detection, adaptive rate limiting, and predictive load balancing. AI algorithms such as LSTM networks, Isolation Forests, Gaussian Mixture Models, and Deep Q-Networks are integrated into the gateway to detect malicious traffic patterns, dynamically adjust request thresholds, and efficiently route traffic based on historical and real-time metrics. The AI-powered API Gateway concept discussed in this paper offers a future-ready, scalable solution for securing and optimizing communication in complex AI microservices environments, enabling organizations to adapt quickly to evolving operational and security demands."

Unlike conventional methods that rely on pre-identified fault-based islands, the proposed scheme introduces a dynamic islanding strategy in which the number and boundaries of islands can evolve through merging during the repair process. This enhances flexibility and resilience by reducing reliance on isolated microgrids. In addition, the model jointly optimizes repair crew routing and system restoration by tracking the maintenance status of each component over discrete time intervals, ensuring proper coordination between repair activities, network reconfiguration, and island merging. In this way, the proposed approach achieves a stepwise restoration process that further improves recovery efficiency. The effectiveness of the proposed model is verified through case studies on the IEEE 33-bus system."

The simulation model of double active bridge is built, and the comparative experiments verify that the improved control proposed in this paper can keep the output stable, improve the dynamic response speed and reduce the overshoot under the conditions of input voltage disturbance, load disturbance and output voltage variation, and verify the feasibility of optimizing the anti-disturbance ability of the control strategy."

    "abstract": "To meet the demand for high spectral purity in modern communication systems, this paper presents a novel and cost-effective receiver front-end architecture that achieves high image rejection at the board level. The proposed design employs a synergistic filtering approach, where a notch filter is integrated within the low-noise amplifier (LNA) for targeted suppression of the image frequency, followed by a band-reject filter for broader stopband attenuation. A single-balanced mixer is subsequently used for down-conversion, significantly reducing overall system complexity. A prototype was fabricated on an RO4350B printed circuit board (PCB), targeting a radio frequency (RF) band of 3.0–3.5 GHz with an intermediate frequency (IF) range of 250–750 MHz. The results demonstrate an image-rejection ratio (IRR) exceeding 32 dB across the operational band, a conversion gain of 6 dB, and a noise figure (NF) of 2 dB. These results validate the proposed architecture as an effective and practical solution for achieving high image rejection in receiver front-ends while maintaining low cost and complexity."

    "abstract": "Voltage Unbalance (VU) is a significant power quality issue in low-voltage (LV) distribution feeders, particularly when voltage drops approach allowable limits and residential loads are unequally distributed across the three phases. The increasing penetration of single-phase rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) systems further worsens this problem by introducing asymmetrical power injection, leading to greater per-phase loading variation and increased VU. High levels of VU can increase network losses and cause malfunctions or premature failure of three-phase equipment, such as induction motors. To mitigate this, a distributed intelligent load transfer scheme is proposed to dynamically reduce VU by redistributing residential loads among phases. A central controller installed at the distribution transformer monitors power consumption in each house using Internet of Things (IoT) technology and determines optimal load transfers. These transfers are executed via static transfer switches with a three-phase input and a single-phase output, installed at each residence to allow flexible phase reassignment. A short pi-model distribution line with unbalanced loading conditions is developed in MATLAB/Simulink to simulate the proposed scheme. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in reducing voltage unbalance and improving the overall performance of the feeder."

Technical barriers include energy management, scalability, and integration issues. Organizational barriers are related to cost, planning, and the need for trained staff. Curricular and pedagogical barriers include gaps in student readiness, limited lab time, and platform choices that depend on budget. By detailing these barriers with practical examples, this paper aims to help educators and academic leaders develop more effective strategies to adopt low-power IoT in engineering programs."

This generates a need for tools that enable easy access to educational content for learners interested in self-directed study. This paper introduces an innovative tool for dynamically creating an on-demand course. It addresses challenges such as information overload and content organization by using YouTube's extensive video library combined with the advanced processing and generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and content curation techniques. The functions of the tool enable, firstly search and selection of YouTube videos based on user prompts. Then, the Gemini-2.5-flash model analyzes the selected videos and metadata to generate a coherent course structure and complementary material. Finally, a crucial LLM-assisted content curation phase refines and structures the content, seeking to align with the subjects of each section. This approach provides a personalized learning path, optimizing accessibility by obtaining targeted material from YouTube videos for effective learning. Initial evaluations demonstrated partial results of the tool to produce structured course content that meets learners’ needs. Although with initial results, this tool can establish a promising direction for democratizing access to personalized learning."

    "abstract": "Variable Message Signs (VMS) and Variable Speed Limits (VSL) are two of the most important parts on evolving Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) for supply drivers with dynamical traffic information in real time nowadays. Having accurate sign detections is crucial to road safety regulations. But such dynamic interfaces can be corrupted by occasional hardware failure, environmental conditions and data transmission errors, which, if not detected in time, can make serious trouble for the driver. The changes in the environment i.e. day and night lighting, unfavourable weather, change in the camera distance or quality make it quite a challenging task to identify anomalies in these road signs in real time. This paper introduces the photonics-enhanced deep learning system which is reliable in detecting anomalies in Variable Traffic Signs. The methodology relies on the CCTV videos collected over 2.5 years, a diversity of conditions including lighting, distance, and the design of signs, and annotated with thousands of samples. The suggested pipeline transfers the images through the CMOS-built sensors and optical transmission links, integrates YOLOv8 to detect the objects, OpenCV to pre-process the images, and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to detect and analyze Variable Traffic Signs. Anomalies are identified by comparing the received text and numeric values to logical consistency, format and semantic completeness. Intended to be used as real-time roadside VMS and VSL applications, the system is proven in experiments that the system is capable of providing a lightweight yet scalable solution to automated sign surveillance, which reinforces the management of road safety."

In this work, we develop a Semi- supervised Enhanced U-Net (SS-EU-Net) for remote sensing images in this article, with an ability to identify land encroachment areas, as well as to visualize spatially and analyze its time evolution behavior by means of the geographic information system (GIS). Inherited from the conventional U-Net, the model introduces two critical improvements: first, the method integrates self-supervised pre-training scheme and pseudo-label generation mechanism to improve the feature learning capability of the model on the unlabeled satellite images. Multi-scale attention fusion module was proposed to greatly enhance the segmentation performance on complex edge of ground objects. The model takes a remote sensing image with geographical coordinates as an input and then generates a pixel-level mask of encroachment based on GIS layer through coordinate registration, which accomplishes the refined monitoring for the temporal and spatial variations of encroachment as well as helps for the decision support. Experimental results demonstrate that SS-EU-Net enhances the IoU and F1 by 5.3% and 4.7% in remote sensing image data set of typical protected areas in USA than existing methods."

    "abstract": "Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) have become an integral part of time-of-flight positron emission tomography (TOF-PET) scanners in recent years. Their excellent photodetection efficiency and fast decay time are essential in state-of-the-art timing resolutions, which have enabled improvements in image quality for TOF-PET. However, most SiPMs share a common architecture: an array of single avalanche photodiodes. This design has a limitation: each pixel requires its own quenching resistor and conductive connections, creating inactive regions that reduce the effective detection area. In this paper we explored a new type of SiPMs called the Micropixel Avalanche Photodiodes (MAPD) for the purposes of TOF-PET. These devices utilize buried pixel technology, which minimizes detector dead zones and achieves an almost 100 % fill factor. We evaluated their noise characteristics, energy resolution, and coincidence timing resolution (CTR). Our findings indicate that although the MAPD-3NM-II devices exhibit higher dark count rates, notable optical cross-talk, and a narrower overvoltage range compared to the reference Hamamatsu S14160-3015PS SiPMs, they offer superior energy resolution—improving up to 17 % at 511 keV—while maintaining competitive timing performance at the same overvoltage. In particular, with 3.8×3.8×4 mm<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup> LYSO crystals, the MAPD-3NM-II achieved a CTR of 336 ± 12 ps, a 5% improvement compared to Hamamatsu at the same overvoltage. Despite operating only up to 4.5 V, the MAPD-3NM-II demonstrates strong potential for TOF-PET applications, especially in scenarios prioritizing energy resolution. Further structural optimizations to reduce cross-talk and expand the operable voltage range could make this technology a competitive alternative to established SiPM architectures."

    "abstract": "Accurate fatigue state assessment of helicopter rotors is essential for structural health monitoring, enabling early identification of degradation and improved operational safety. However, existing fatigue assessment methods often suffer from insufficient nonlinear modeling capability, heavy reliance on simulated data, and limited treatment of temporal dynamics and long-range dependencies across the fatigue assessment. To address these limitations, we propose an optimized hybrid 1D CNN-LSTM-Attention model for fatigue state assessment from fiber Bragg grating strain measurements. A full life-cycle strain-fatigue dataset is established through ground calibration and dynamic flapping fatigue experiments on a full-scale GFRP rotor beam instrumented with multiple FBG channels. The proposed architecture extracts local temporal patterns using 1D CNN, captures long-range dependencies using LSTM, and emphasizes fatigue-critical segments via attention-based reweighting. Experimental results under six-fold leave-one-sensor-out evaluation achieve 95.25% accuracy, 95.52% precision, 95.51% recall, and a 95.50% F1 score, outperforming conventional machine-learning baselines. Ablation studies further verify the contributions of each module. Additional evaluations under sensor-wise and section-wise holdout provide quantitative evidence of robustness to spatial variability within the same rotor-beam design under the tested conditions."

    "abstract": "The growing number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices requires decentralized Edge Intelligence solutions. As the current FL-based IDS systems are decentralized solutions for privacy protection, face two major problems: (1) network traffic manipulation through adversarial evasion attacks (2) privacy threats from gradient-based inference attacks and (3) server-side Robustness issue. The current methods which use Differential Privacy (DP) or adversarial training result in 5-15% accuracy reduction which makes them unsuitable for deployment. The key novelty of our work is the integration of a novel dual-defense framework that uniquely reconciles the conflict between differential privacy noise and adversarial gradient requirements, effectively eliminating the conventional ”accuracy tax” along with server-side Robust Aggregation. Our research develops an enhanced two-stage federated system which is robust and protects privacy while delivering secure IoT edge intelligence solutions. The core system FedEdge-ID provides 99.73% detection performance across different edge devices. Spectre-Fed enhances the FedEdge-ID framework via three key defenses: (1) Hybrid Loss Adversarial Training (α=0.5) to fortify decision boundaries against evasion, (2) Gradient-Guided Adaptive Privacy with decreasing noise injection (σ0=0.0005, γ =0.95) for secure gradient updates, and (3) Robust Trimmed Mean Aggregation to counter Byzantine poisoning. Experiments demonstrate that Spectre-Fed’s client-side (Layer 1) defense achieves 99.72% clean accuracy with only a 0.01% utility loss versus the non-private baseline. It shows strong adversarial resilience, retaining 99.34% accuracy against FGSM attacks (ϵ =0.01), a mere 0.38% degradation from the clean state. When integrated with server-side Robust Aggregation (Layer 2), the system sustains 99.59% accuracy even under active label-flipping attacks from 20% of clients, while preserving high utility compared to the baseline. The system achieves optimal privacy-utility balance through its formal privacy protection and its ability to resist adversarial attacks which makes it suitable for zero-trust IoT systems."

    "abstract": "Autonomous weeding robots offer significant potential for reducing labor and environmental costs in precision agriculture. However, most systems decouple chassis locomotion from manipulator control, limiting efficiency in unstructured environments. We present LSTM-PPO-Weeding, an end-to-end framework unifying mobility and manipulation via memory-augmented reinforcement learning (RL). A high-speed region of interest (ROI) filter abstracts camera input into three-dimensional weed/crop poses, enabling the system to focus solely on task-relevant features. To mitigate challenges arising from occlusion and partial observability, we integrate long short-term memory (LSTM) into the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm, establishing the proposed LSTM-PPO framework. The agent learns coordinated actions through a custom reward function balancing speed and precision. Experiments in simulation and real-world greenhouse settings show that LSTM-PPO-Weeding improves throughput while maintaining high accuracy. Compared to baseline methods, our approach reduces average weeding time by up to 74% with minimal loss in success rate, demonstrating its robustness for agricultural mobile manipulation."

    "abstract": "Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks (UASNs) have garnered considerable attention in recent years due to their widespread applications in both industrial and civilian domains, such as ocean exploration and environmental monitoring. This paper introduces an intelligent Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm to determine routing in UASNs with dynamic underwater environments adaptively. Initially, we model ocean currents and acoustic signal loss in underwater communication to perform the real-world characteristics of underwater routing. Based on software-defined networking (SDN) principles, we redefine the architecture of UASNs and propose an Adaptive Routing scheme for Software-Defined UASNs (ARSDU). Leveraging ARSDU, we propose the Reward Cooperative Distribution and Tracing Mechanism-enabled Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (RCDTM-MARL) algorithm to optimize routing decisions. The proposed RCDTM-MARL algorithm enhances the convergence speed of MARL by decomposing the reward function into independent-reward and interactive-reward, while incorporating an experience replay buffer to further accelerate convergence. Ultimately, the adaptive routing decision algorithm, based on RCDTM-MARL, adaptively determines the optimal routing path for UASNs. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed routing scheme outperforms recent research approaches, achieving superior underwater data routing decisions on multiple key performance metrics."

    "abstract": "Transferring human hand skills to robots is critical for biometric behavior analysis and human-robot interaction. Existing methods primarily rely on RGB cameras, which suffer from motion blur and overexposure conditions, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose a novel framework that synergistically combines event cameras (bio-inspired sensors with high dynamic range and low latency) with RGB data, enabling robust hand imitation through spatiotemporal synchronization. Our approach leverages the complementary strengths of event streams (capturing fast motion details) and RGB images (providing texture and edge information), effectively mitigating challenges like overexposure and motion blur. Furthermore, we contribute a large-scale synthetic event dataset tailored for dexterous hand analysis, supporting future research in biometric behavior modeling and dexterous motion transfer. Experiments demonstrate improvements over RGB-only methods, particularly in overexposure and fast motion scenarios, with enhanced accuracy and stability in both synthetic and real-world evaluations. This work bridges the gap between bio-inspired sensing, behavioral biometrics, and robots."

These environments—characterized by severe signal attenuation, complex geometries, and limited line-of-sight (LoS) conditions—demand innovative solutions to ensure reliable connectivity for safety-critical operations and autonomous systems. We evaluate the performance of four distinct RIS phase optimization strategies: Random Phase Assignment, Greedy Algorithm, Semidefinite Relaxation (SDR), and Deep Q-Network (DQN). Using detailed simulations at a 28 GHz carrier frequency, we assess key performance indicators including signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), bit error rate (BER), channel capacity, outage probability, and energy efficiency across varying tunnel distances. The results demonstrate that RIS-enabled intelligent phase control significantly enhances communication robustness and efficiency in subterranean environments, with the DQN-based approach achieving superior SNR gains while maintaining computational tractability. These findings underscore the strategic importance of RIS in advancing resilient, high-performance wireless infrastructures for underground mining and other confined industrial settings."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided wireless federated learning (FL) system, where an access point (AP) coordinates multiple edge devices to train a machine leaning model without sharing their own raw data. During the training process, we exploit the joint channel recon figuration via IRS and resource allocation design to reduce the latency of a FL task. Particularly, we propose three transmission protocols for assisting the local model uploading from multiple devices to an AP, namely IRS aided time division multiple access (I-TDMA), IRS aided frequency division multiple access (I-FDMA), and IRS aided non-orthogonal multiple access (I NOMA), to investigate the impact of IRS on the multiple access for FL. Under the three protocols, we minimize the per-round latency subject to a given training loss by jointly optimizing the device scheduling, IRS phase-shifts, and communication computation resource allocation. For the associated problem under I-TDMA, an efficient algorithm is proposed to solve it optimally by exploiting its intrinsic structure, whereas the high quality solutions of the problems under I-FDMA and I-NOMA are obtained by invoking a successive convex approximation (SCA) based approach. Then, we further develop a theoretical framework for the performance comparison of the proposed three transmission protocols. Sufficient conditions for ensuring that I-TDMA outperforms I-NOMA and those of its opposite are unveiled, which is fundamentally different from that NOMA always outperforms TDMA in the system without IRS. Simulation results validate our theoretical findings and also demonstrate the usefulness of IRS for enhancing the fundamental tradeoff between the learning latency and learning accuracy."

This allows the derivation of an expression for the bit error rate (BER), a key performance metric for UL PD-NOMA. We further utilize the derived BER expressions to introduce a joint optimization frame-work that minimizes the average BER via UL power allocation and dynamic RIS partitioning among the users. The analytical results are validated by simulations, and show that the proposed optimization scheme eliminates the BER floors that are associated with UL NOMA. The results also confirm the superiority of the optimized CRIS-NOMA scheme over conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and non-optimized UL NOMA schemes."

This letter proposes a defense strategy based on the improved isolation forest (IIF) for detecting malicious sensor nodes (MSNs) in cognitive wireless sensor networks (CWSNs). We analyze the distinct behavior patterns of the two types of SNs, and detect MSNs by isolating data points. Furthermore, we present an enhanced version of the traditional isolation forest to address its limitations.

Current detection approaches face significant challenges in distinguishing stealthy attacks from normal operational variations, as adversaries can craft attacks that preserve statistical correlations while disrupting physical processes. To address this critical gap, we propose a novel causal representation learning (CRL) framework that leverages intrinsic physical invariants for robust attack detection in industrial CPS. We develop two complementary methodologies, unsupervised secure causal feature extraction (USCFE) and supervised secure causal feature extraction (SSCFE), which extract low-dimensional causal features resilient to adversarial manipulation. Furthermore, theoretical guarantees on detection probability bounds and false alarm control are provided. Experimental validation shows that proposed methods outperform both traditional statistical methods and contemporary deep learning approaches, thus significantly advancing CPS security."

    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based volt-var control (VVC) in active distribution networks (ADNs) is prone to cyberattacks; malicious attackers can design adversarial attacks to tamper with the real-time measurements and bypass the bad data detection (BDD) mechanism, causing voltage limit violations. Previous work in this area predominantly focuses on designing suitable attack vectors, assuming unlimited attacker resources and neglecting the BDD mechanism. To this end, a new objective as a function of attack timing is designed to maximize the frequency of voltage violation of ADNs with the fewest number of attacks. Furthermore, perturbation set transformation is implemented on the attack vectors to bypass the BDD, ensuring the stealthiness of the attack. For solving the attack optimization with complex constraints, this article reformulates the adversarial attack on DRL-based VVC agents as a hybrid-action state-adversarial Markov decision process (MDP) and proposes a novel knowledge transferred DRL-based adversary to launch strategically timed (when) and stealthy (how) adversarial attacks. Case studies are conducted to verify that the strategically timed adversarial samples generated by the adversary significantly impact the voltage regulation capability of VVC agents while ensuring stealthiness against the BDD mechanism, through benchmarking against existing baseline adversarial attack methods."
