    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) perform strongly on biological benchmarks, raising concerns that they may help novice actors acquire dual-use laboratory skills. Yet, whether this translates to improved human performance in the physical laboratory remains unclear. To address this, we conducted a pre-registered, investigator-blinded, randomized controlled trial (June-August 2025; n = 153) evaluating whether LLMs improve novice performance in tasks that collectively model a viral reverse genetics workflow. We observed no significant difference in the primary endpoint of workflow completion (5.2% LLM vs. 6.6% Internet; P = 0.759), nor in the success rate of individual tasks. However, the LLM arm had numerically higher success rates in four of the five tasks, most notably for the cell culture task (68.8% LLM vs. 55.3% Internet; P = 0.059). Post-hoc Bayesian modeling of pooled data estimates an approximate 1.4-fold increase (95% CrI 0.74-2.62) in success for a \"typical\" reverse genetics task under LLM assistance. Ordinal regression modelling suggests that participants in the LLM arm were more likely to progress through intermediate steps across all tasks (posterior probability of a positive effect: 81%-96%). Overall, mid-2025 LLMs did not substantially increase novice completion of complex laboratory procedures but were associated with a modest performance benefit. These results reveal a gap between in silico benchmarks and real-world utility, underscoring the need for physical-world validation of AI biosecurity assessments as model capabilities and user proficiency evolve."

    "abstract": "LLMs are increasingly being used for complex problems which are not necessarily resolved in a single response, but require interacting with an environment to acquire information. In these scenarios, LLMs must reason about inherent cost-uncertainty tradeoffs in when to stop exploring and commit to an answer. For instance, on a programming task, an LLM should test a generated code snippet if it is uncertain about the correctness of that code; the cost of writing a test is nonzero, but typically lower than the cost of making a mistake. In this work, we show that we can induce LLMs to explicitly reason about balancing these cost-uncertainty tradeoffs, then perform more optimal environment exploration. We formalize multiple tasks, including information retrieval and coding, as sequential decision-making problems under uncertainty. Each problem has latent environment state that can be reasoned about via a prior which is passed to the LLM agent. We introduce a framework called Calibrate-Then-Act (CTA), where we feed the LLM this additional context to enable it to act more optimally. This improvement is preserved even under RL training of both the baseline and CTA. Our results on information-seeking QA and on a simplified coding task show that making cost-benefit tradeoffs explicit with CTA can help agents discover more optimal decision-making strategies."

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data exhibit strong and reproducible statistical structure. This has motivated the development of large-scale foundation models, such as TranscriptFormer, that use transformer-based architectures to learn a generative model for gene expression by embedding genes into a latent vector space. These embeddings have been used to obtain state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on downstream tasks such as cell-type classification, disease-state prediction, and cross-species learning. Here, we ask whether similar performance can be achieved without utilizing computationally intensive deep learning-based representations. Using simple, interpretable pipelines that rely on careful normalization and linear methods, we obtain SOTA or near SOTA performance across multiple benchmarks commonly used to evaluate single-cell foundation models, including outperforming foundation models on out-of-distribution tasks involving novel cell types and organisms absent from the training data. Our findings highlight the need for rigorous benchmarking and suggest that the biology of cell identity can be captured by simple linear representations of single cell gene expression data."

    "abstract": "Agent Skill framework, now widely and officially supported by major players such as GitHub Copilot, LangChain, and OpenAI, performs especially well with proprietary models by improving context engineering, reducing hallucinations, and boosting task accuracy. Based on these observations, an investigation is conducted to determine whether the Agent Skill paradigm provides similar benefits to small language models (SLMs). This question matters in industrial scenarios where continuous reliance on public APIs is infeasible due to data-security and budget constraints requirements, and where SLMs often show limited generalization in highly customized scenarios. This work introduces a formal mathematical definition of the Agent Skill process, followed by a systematic evaluation of language models of varying sizes across multiple use cases. The evaluation encompasses two open-source tasks and a real-world insurance claims data set. The results show that tiny models struggle with reliable skill selection, while moderately sized SLMs (approximately 12B - 30B) parameters) benefit substantially from the Agent Skill approach. Moreover, code-specialized variants at around 80B parameters achieve performance comparable to closed-source baselines while improving GPU efficiency. Collectively, these findings provide a comprehensive and nuanced characterization of the capabilities and constraints of the framework, while providing actionable insights for the effective deployment of Agent Skills in SLM-centered environments."

    "abstract": "Fluid molecular ferroelectrics are a new class of organic materials where ferroelectricity is found in conjunction with 3D fluidity whilst still retaining spontaneous polarization values comparable to their traditional solid state counterparts. One of the major challenges for soft condensed matter physics is predicting whether a fluid molecular material will form ferroelectric phase with nematic or smectic order. Through the synthesis of forty five systematically varied molecules, and by analogy to solid molecular ferroelectrics, is it shown that subtle hydrogen fluorine substitution allows for tuneable syn-parallel pairing motifs resulting in either specific pairings leading too geometrically constrained lamellar order or diversified pairings stabilising nematic ordering. Large-scale, fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations reveal that smectic ferroelectricity emerges from discrete lateral pairing modes, whereas nematic phases arise from a multiplicity of equivalent polar configurations. Together, these findings establish experimentally validated design principles for fluid molecular ferroelectrics and provide a predictive framework for engineering functional polar fluids."

    "abstract": "We propose that the superconducting diode (SD) efficiency can be significantly enhanced near the transition between two superconducting states by choosing parameters where, before the system goes normal with increasing supercurrent, it switches into a different superconducting order for one direction of the current but not for the other. This mechanism for producing high SD efficiency relies on the expectation that the critical current depends sensitively on the superconducting order. We demonstrate this explicitly by performing detailed calculations for a bilayer superconductor with an in-plane magnetic field, which admits the standard Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) and the orbital Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) orders as a function of the strength of the magnetic field. We predict a sharp peak in the SD efficiency in the FFLO state close to the transition, which arises from a complex interplay between the two superconducting orders. An implication of our study is that the measurement of the SD efficiency can provide fundamental insight into the nature of the BCS-FFLO transition both as a function of the magnetic field and the supercurrent."

Measuring the mass and radius of these planets, combined with their moderated irradiation, allows us to estimate their planetary bulk composition, which is a key quantity to comprehend giant planet formation and structure. Aims. We present the discovery of two transiting warm giant planets orbiting solar-type stars from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), which were characterized by further spectroscopic and photometric ground-based observations. Methods. We performed a joint analysis of photometric data with radial velocities to confirm and characterize TOI-883 b and TOI-899 b, two sub-Saturns orbiting solar-like stars. Results. TOI-883 b and TOI-899 b have masses of $0.123 \\pm 0.012$ $M_J$ and $0.213 \\pm 0.024$ $M_J$, radius of $0.604 \\pm 0.028$ $R_J$ and $0.991 \\pm 0.044$ $R_J$, periods of $10.06$ d and $12.85$ d and equilibrium temperature of $1086 \\pm 19$ K and $1040 \\pm 19$ K, respectively. Conclusions. While having similar masses, orbital periods and stellar host properties, these planets seem to have different internal compositions, which could point to distinct formation histories. Both planets are suitable targets for atmospheric studies to further constrain formation scenarios of planets in the Neptune-Saturn mass range"

    "abstract": "The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP) but has simultaneously created a \"resource divide.\" State-of-the-art legal intelligence systems typically rely on massive parameter counts (7B+) and cloud-based inference, rendering them inaccessible to practitioners in resource-constrained environments and posing significant data sovereignty risks. This paper introduces Quecto-V1, a domain-specific Small Language Model (SLM) engineered to democratize access to Indian legal intelligence. Built upon a custom configuration of the GPT-2 architecture (124 million parameters), Quecto-V1 was trained from scratch exclusively on a corpus of Indian statutes, including the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), and the Constitution of India. Unlike generalist models, which prioritize broad world knowledge, our approach maximizes \"lexical density\" within the legal domain. Furthermore, we address the deployment bottleneck by applying post-training 8-bit quantization (GGUF format), compressing the model to a memory footprint of under 150 MB. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that Quecto-V1 achieves high fidelity in retrieving statutory definitions and penal provisions, outperforming general-purpose SLMs in domain-specific exact match tasks while running entirely offline on consumer-grade CPUs. We further present an ablation study showing that 8-bit quantization yields a 74% reduction in model size with less than 3.5% degradation in retrieval accuracy compared to full-precision baselines. These findings suggest that for specialized, high-stakes domains like law, domain-specific training coupled with aggressive quantization offers a viable, privacy-preserving alternative to monolithic cloud models."

We present a computational framework that analyzes MD trajectories to quantitatively interpret macroscopic transport by decomposing it into additive contributions from physically motivated events. They are defined either through heuristically identified microscopic transitions, capturing events such as single-ion hops, multi-ion hops, and vehicular motion, or through transitions between chemically interpretable coordination macrostates. The construction guarantees that attributed contributions sum exactly to the Onsager transport coefficients estimated via the Green-Kubo/Einstein formalism, while scanning the sampling window exposes characteristic temporal scales at which distinct transport mechanisms emerge and dominate. Applied across three prototypical electrolytes-inorganic crystals, liquids, and polymers-the framework quantitatively resolves long-standing debates (e.g., the role of concerted motion and exchange), identifies dominant mechanisms and rate-limiting steps, quantifies their frequencies and effectiveness, and extracts activation energies for distinct transport modes, thereby distilling design rules for fast conduction. This general and reproducible analysis tool turns MD trajectories into quantitative mechanism maps, enabling the ion-conductor community to adjudicate mechanistic hypotheses and accelerate discovery."

Recent epidemics, particularly COVID-19, highlight the need for models capturing adaptation to perceived risk, social influence, and policy signals. This review synthesizes post-2020 models incorporating behavioral adaptation, examines their theoretical grounding, and evaluates how behavioral constructs modify transmission, vaccination, and compliance. Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, we searched Scopus and PubMed (2020-2025), screening 1,274 records with citation chaining. We extracted data on disease context, country, modeling framework, behavioral mechanisms (prevalence-dependent, policy/media, imitation/social learning), and psychosocial constructs (personal threat, coping appraisal, barriers, social norms, cues to action). A total of 216 studies met inclusion criteria. Results: COVID-19 accounted for 73% of studies. Most used compartmental ODE models (81%) and focused on theoretical or U.S. settings. Behavioral change was mainly reactive: 47% applied prevalence-dependent feedback, 25% included awareness/media dynamics, and 19% relied on exogenous policy triggers. Game-theoretic or social learning approaches were rare (less or equal than 5%). Behavioral effects primarily modified contact or transmission rates (91%). Psychosocial constructs were unevenly represented: cues to action (n=159) and personal threat (n=145) dominated, whereas coping appraisal (n=82), barriers (n=36), and social norms (n=25) were less common. Conclusions: We propose a taxonomy structured by behavioral drivers, social scale, and memory to clarify dominant paradigms and their empirical basis. Mapping models to psychosocial constructs provides guidance for more theory-informed and data grounded-integration of behavioral processes in epidemiological modeling."

Secondly, in contrast to the purely Dirichlet case, a key challenge is to establish the non-vanishing of the tangential derivative of $u$ along the Neumann boundary. To address this, we employ local analysis techniques of angular derivatives, as introduced by Hartman and Wintner [Amer. J. Math., 1953]. Thirdly, we identify the signs of directional derivatives of $u$ along sections of the moving line. Using a planar sub-spherical sector as an example, we illustrate how these new innovative techniques and the moving plane method can be combined to derive symmetry and monotonicity results, particularly when the amplitude is less than or equal to $2π/3$."

Such models often require discretization of continuous neural time series data, a process referred to as 'tokenization'. However, the impact of different tokenization strategies for neural data is currently poorly understood. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of sample-level tokenization strategies for transformer-based large neuroimaging models (LNMs) applied to magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. We compare learnable and non-learnable tokenizers by examining their signal reconstruction fidelity and their impact on subsequent foundation modeling performance (token prediction, biological plausibility of generated data, preservation of subject-specific information, and performance on downstream tasks). For the learnable tokenizer, we introduce a novel approach based on an autoencoder. Experiments were conducted on three publicly available MEG datasets spanning different acquisition sites, scanners, and experimental paradigms. Our results show that both learnable and non-learnable discretization schemes achieve high reconstruction accuracy and broadly comparable performance across most evaluation criteria, suggesting that simple fixed sample-level tokenization strategies can be used in the development of neural foundation models.

(2022). Since martingale techniques do not apply, we obtain the convergence of the finite-dimensional distributions through a bespoke version of Slutsky's lemma: First, we overcome the lack of hypercontractivity by an iterated integration-by-parts scheme which reduces the remaining analysis to finite Wiener chaos; crucially, this argument relies on Malliavin differentiability of the nonlinearity but not on chaos decay and, as a consequence, encompasses the centred absolute value function. Second, in the spirit of the law of large numbers, we show that the diagonal of the second-order process converges to an explicit symmetric correction term. Finally, we compute all the moments of the remaining process and, through a fine combinatorial analysis, show that they converge to those of the Stratonovich Brownian rough path perturbed by an antisymmetric area correction, as computed by a suitable amendment of Fawcett's theorem. All of these steps benefit from a major combinatorial reduction that is implied by the original argument of Breuer and Major (1983)."

If both the population index and detection threshold can be determined, observed meteor rates can be converted to fluxes and extrapolated to any desired brightness or size. We argue that the distribution of observed or instrumental meteor magnitudes is best modeled as an exponentially modified Gaussian (exGaussian) distribution. This is for three reasons: first, an exGaussian distribution is the natural result of random variations in detection threshold and/or post-detection measurement errors in magnitude. Second, an exGaussian distribution provides a better fit to the magnitude distribution than all other competing distributions in the literature; we demonstrate this using both a set of faint optical meteor magnitudes and a set of radar meteor echo amplitudes. Finally, the population index, mean detection threshold, and random variation/error terms are easily extracted from the best-fit parameters of an exGaussian distribution."

Existing explainability methods rely on final-layer attributions, capture either local token-level attributions or global attention patterns without unification, and lack context-awareness of inter-token dependencies and structural components. They also fail to capture how relevance evolves across layers and how structural components shape decision-making. To address these limitations, we proposed the \\textbf{Context-Aware Layer-wise Integrated Gradients (CA-LIG) Framework}, a unified hierarchical attribution framework that computes layer-wise Integrated Gradients within each Transformer block and fuses these token-level attributions with class-specific attention gradients. This integration yields signed, context-sensitive attribution maps that capture supportive and opposing evidence while tracing the hierarchical flow of relevance through the Transformer layers. We evaluate the CA-LIG Framework across diverse tasks, domains, and transformer model families, including sentiment analysis and long and multi-class document classification with BERT, hate speech detection in a low-resource language setting with XLM-R and AfroLM, and image classification with Masked Autoencoder vision Transformer model. Across all tasks and architectures, CA-LIG provides more faithful attributions, shows stronger sensitivity to contextual dependencies, and produces clearer, more semantically coherent visualizations than established explainability methods. These results indicate that CA-LIG provides a more comprehensive, context-aware, and reliable explanation of Transformer decision-making, advancing both the practical interpretability and conceptual understanding of deep neural models."

For Abelian TOs under decoherence, we develop a replica field-theory framework based on a doubled-state construction that relates TEN and TMI to the quantum dimensions of domain-wall defects between decoherence-induced topological boundary conditions, yielding general expressions in the strong-decoherence regime. We further compute TEN and TMI exactly for decohered $G$-graded string-net states, including cases with non-Abelian anyons. We interpret the results within the strong one-form-symmetry framework for mixed-state TOs: TMI probes the total quantum dimension of the emergent premodular anyon theory, whereas TEN detects only its modular part."

It remains computationally demanding whether training from scratch, initialising from pre-trained weights, or fine-tuning large models. Although pre-trained vision-language models such as CLIP offer rich image representations, existing adaptation or fine-tuning methods often rely on their global image embeddings, limiting their ability to capture fine-grained, localised attributes essential in complex, cluttered street scenes. To address this, we propose CLIP-MHAdapter, a variant of the current lightweight CLIP adaptation paradigm that appends a bottleneck MLP equipped with multi-head self-attention operating on patch tokens to model inter-patch dependencies. With approximately 1.4 million trainable parameters, CLIP-MHAdapter achieves superior or competitive accuracy across eight attribute classification tasks on the Global StreetScapes dataset, attaining new state-of-the-art results while maintaining low computational cost.

In the first stage, a non-parametric kernel regression model constructs state-of-charge trajectory bounds from historical data that satisfy peak-shaving requirements. The second stage utilizes the remaining capacity for energy arbitrage via a transfer learning method. Case studies using New York City commercial building demand data show that our method achieves a 1.3 times improvement in performance over the state-of-the-art forecast-based method, achieving cost savings and effective peak management without relying on predictions."

    "abstract": "Large-scale sharing of dialogue-based data is instrumental for advancing the science of teaching and learning, yet rigorous de-identification remains a major barrier. In mathematics tutoring transcripts, numeric expressions frequently resemble structured identifiers (e.g., dates or IDs), leading generic Personally Identifiable Information (PII) detection systems to over-redact core instructional content and reduce dataset utility. This work asks how PII can be detected in math tutoring transcripts while preserving their educational utility. To address this challenge, we investigate the \"numeric ambiguity\" problem and introduce MathEd-PII, the first benchmark dataset for PII detection in math tutoring dialogues, created through a human-in-the-loop LLM workflow that audits upstream redactions and generates privacy-preserving surrogates. The dataset contains 1,000 tutoring sessions (115,620 messages; 769,628 tokens) with validated PII annotations. Using a density-based segmentation method, we show that false PII redactions are disproportionately concentrated in math-dense regions, confirming numeric ambiguity as a key failure mode. We then compare four detection strategies: a Presidio baseline and LLM-based approaches with basic, math-aware, and segment-aware prompting. Math-aware prompting substantially improves performance over the baseline (F1: 0.821 vs. 0.379) while reducing numeric false positives, demonstrating that de-identification must incorporate domain context to preserve analytic utility. This work provides both a new benchmark and evidence that utility-preserving de-identification for tutoring data requires domain-aware modeling."

These attacks exploit a critical vulnerability in passport enrollment procedures adopted by many countries, where the facial image is often acquired without a supervised live capture process. In this paper, we propose a novel face morphing technique based on Arc2Face, an identity-conditioned face foundation model capable of synthesizing photorealistic facial images from compact identity representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by comparing the morphing attack potential metric on two large-scale sequestered face morphing attack detection datasets against several state-of-the-art morphing methods, as well as on two novel morphed face datasets derived from FEI and ONOT. Experimental results show that the proposed deep learning-based approach achieves a morphing attack potential comparable to that of landmark-based techniques, which have traditionally been regarded as the most challenging. These findings confirm the ability of the proposed method to effectively preserve and manage identity information during the morph generation process."

Law enforcement must identify these businesses within a dense population of lawful establishments, but investigative resources are limited and the illicit status of each location is unknown until inspection. Detection methods based on online reviews offer some insight, yet operators can manipulate these signals, leaving covert establishments undetected. IMBs constitute one of the largest segments of indoor sex trafficking in the United States, with an estimated 9,000 establishments. Mobility data offers an alternative to online signals, covering establishments that avoid digital visibility entirely. We derive features from mobility data spanning temporal visitation patterns, dwell times, visitor catchment areas, and demand stability. Because confirmed labels exist only for establishments identified through advertising platforms, we employ positive-unlabeled learning to address the label asymmetry in ground truth. The model achieves 0.97 AUC and 0.84 Average Precision. Four operational signatures characterize high-risk establishments: demand consistency, evening-concentrated visits, compressed service durations, and locally drawn clientele. The model produces risk scores for each business-week observation. Aggregating to the business level, prioritizing the highest-risk 10% of massage establishments captures 53% of known illicit operations, a 5.3-fold improvement over uninformed inspection. We develop a decision-support system that produces calibrated prioritization scores for law enforcement, enabling investigators to concentrate inspections on the highest-risk venues. The operational signatures may resist strategic manipulation because they reflect actual operations rather than online signals that operators can control."

Axenovich and Walzer showed that, for fixed $\\mathcal P$, $R(\\mathcal P, Q_n)$ grows linearly with $n$. However, for the diagonal question, we do not even come close to knowing the order of growth of $R(Q_n,Q_n)$. The current upper bound is $R(Q_n,Q_n)\\leq n^2-(1-o(1))n\\log n$, due to Axenovich and Winter. What about lower bounds? It is trivial to see that $2n\\leq R(Q_n,Q_n)$, but surprisingly, even an incremental improvement required significant work. Recently, an elegant probabilistic argument of Winter gave that, for large enough $n$, $R(Q_n,Q_n)\\geq 2.02n$. In this paper we show that $R(Q_n,Q_n)\\geq 2.7n+k$, where $k$ is a constant. Our current techniques might in principle show that in fact, for every $ε>0$, for large enough $n$, $R(Q_n,Q_n)\\geq (3-ε)n$. Our methods exploit careful modifications of layered-colourings, for a large number of layers. These modifications are stronger than previous arguments as they are more constructive, rather than purely probabilistic."

Despite its relevance, systematic investigations of Bi$_2$O$_3$ thin films remain scarce. Here, we report a comprehensive, multi-technique study of bismuth oxide grown on Au(111). By combining synchrotron-based x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and diffraction with low-energy electron diffraction and scanning tunneling microscopy, we elucidate the structural evolution of the surface during controlled oxidation and subsequent annealing. We find that Bi deposition induces well-defined surface reconstructions, whereas oxidation triggers the formation of a complex sequence of Bi$_2$O$_3$ domains. High-resolution spectroscopic and diffraction data enable us to propose a structural model consistent with the $(201)$ surface of $β$-Bi$_2$O$_3$. In addition, work function measurements reveal substantial electronic modifications at the interface. These results provide benchmark structural and electronic insights into the Bi oxide/Au(111) system and establish a framework for integrating Bi$_2$O$_3$ in devices in combination to two-dimensional semiconductors exploiting its low contact resistance."

    "abstract": "Click models are a central component of learning and evaluation in recommender systems, yet most existing models are designed for single ranked-list interfaces. In contrast, modern recommender platforms increasingly use complex interfaces such as carousels, which consist of multiple swipeable lists that enable complex user browsing behaviors. In this paper, we study position-based click models in carousel interfaces and examine optimization methods, model structure, and alignment with user behavior. We propose three novel position-based models tailored to carousels, including the first position-based model without latent variables that incorporates observed examination signals derived from eye tracking data, called the Observed Examination Position-Based Model (OEPBM). We develop a general implementation of these carousel click models, supporting multiple optimization techniques and conduct experiments comparing gradient-based methods with classical approaches, namely expectation-maximization and maximum likelihood estimation. Our results show that gradient-based optimization consistently achieve better click likelihoods. Among the evaluated models, the OEPBM achieves the strongest performance in click prediction and produces examination patterns that most closely align to user behavior. However, we also demonstrate that strong click fit does not imply realistic modeling of user examination and browsing patterns. This reveals a fundamental limitation of click-only models in complex interfaces and the need for incorporating additional behavioral signals when designing click models for carousel-based recommender systems."

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a class of generalised linear models (GLMs) driven by latent processes for modelling count, real-valued, binary, and positive continuous time series. Extending earlier latent-process regression frameworks based on Poisson or one-parameter exponential family assumptions, we allow the conditional distribution of the response to belong to a bi-parameter exponential family, with the latent process entering the conditional mean multiplicatively. This formulation substantially broadens the scope of latent-process GLMs, for instance, it naturally accommodates gamma responses for positive continuous data, enables estimation of an unknown dispersion parameter via method of moments, and avoids restrictive conditions on link functions that arise under existing formulations. We establish the asymptotic normality of the GLM estimators obtained from the GLM likelihood that ignores the latent process, and we derive the correct information matrix for valid inference. In addition, we provide a principled approach to prediction and forecasting in GLMs driven by latent processes, a topic not previously addressed in the literature. We present two real data applications on measles infections in North Rhine-Westphalia (Germany) and paleoclimatic glacial varves, which highlight the practical advantages and enhanced flexibility of the proposed modelling framework."

This is typically addressed using a Shack-Hartmann sensor, which pairs a high-speed camera with a lenslet array, but such systems add significant cost, weight, and power demands. In this work, we present a hybrid opto-electric neural network (OENN) wavefront sensor that enables ultra-high-speed operation in a compact, low-cost system. Subwavelength diffractive metasurfaces efficiently encode the incoming wavefront into tailored irradiance patterns, which are then decoded by a lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP). In simulation and experiment, the hybrid approach achieves average Strehl ratio (SR) improvements exceeding 60% and 45%, respectively, for unseen wavefronts compared to purely electronic sensors with few-pixel inputs. Although larger MLPs allow purely electronic sensors to match the hybrid's SR under static conditions, transient atmosphere modeling shows that their added latency leads to rapid SR degradation with increasing Greenwood frequency, while the hybrid system maintains performance. These results highlight the potential of hybrid OENN architectures to unlock scalable, high-bandwidth free-space communication systems and, more broadly, to advance optical technologies where real-time sensing is constrained by electronic latency."

    "abstract": "Accurate assessment of anthropogenic climate change relies on historical instrumental data, yet observations from the early 20th century are sparse, fragmented, and uncertain. Conventional reconstructions rely on disparate statistical interpolation, which excessively smooths local features and creates unphysical artifacts, leading to systematic underestimation of intrinsic variability and extremes. Here, we present a unified, probabilistic generative deep learning framework that overcomes these limitations and reveals previously unresolved historical climate variability back to 1850. Leveraging a learned generative prior of Earth system dynamics, our model performs probabilistic inference to recover spatiotemporally consistent historical temperature and precipitation fields from sparse observations. Our approach preserves the higher-order statistics of climate dynamics, transforming reconstruction into a robust uncertainty-aware assessment. We demonstrate that our reconstruction overcomes pronounced biases in widely used historical reference products, including those underlying IPCC assessments, especially regarding extreme weather events. Notably, we uncover higher early 20th-century global warming levels compared to existing reconstructions, primarily driven by more pronounced polar warming, with mean Arctic warming trends exceeding established benchmarks by 0.15--0.29°C per decade for 1900--1980. Conversely, for the modern era, our reconstruction indicates that the broad Arctic warming trend is likely overestimated in recent assessments, yet explicitly resolves previously unrecognized intense, localized hotspots in the Barents Sea and Northeastern Greenland. Furthermore, based on our seamless global reconstruction that recovers precipitation variability across the oceans and under-monitored regions, we uncover an intensification of the global hydrological cycle."

To address these limitations, we introduce Framework of Thoughts (FoT)--a general-purpose foundation framework for building and optimizing dynamic reasoning schemes. FoT comes with built-in features for hyperparameter tuning, prompt optimization, parallel execution, and intelligent caching, unlocking the latent performance potential of reasoning schemes. We demonstrate FoT's capabilities by implementing three popular schemes--Tree of Thoughts, Graph of Thoughts, and ProbTree--within FoT. We empirically show that FoT enables significantly faster execution, reduces costs, and achieves better task scores through optimization. We release our codebase to facilitate the development of future dynamic and efficient reasoning schemes."

This discretization preserves nonnegativity at the discrete level and is shown to be convergent under suitable regularity conditions. A rigorous convergence analysis is provided, highlighting the role of mass lumping in ensuring nonnegativity and of operator splitting in decoupling the deterministic and stochastic dynamics. Numerical experiments are presented to confirm the convergence rates and the preservation of nonnegativity. In addition, we examine several numerical examples outside the scope of the established theory, aiming to explore the range of applicability and potential limitations of the proposed method."

We propose DressWild, a novel feed-forward pipeline that reconstructs physics-consistent 2D sewing patterns and the corresponding 3D garments from a single in-the-wild image. Given an input image, our method leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to normalize pose variations at the image level, then extract pose-aware, 3D-informed garment features. These features are fused through a transformer-based encoder and subsequently used to predict sewing pattern parameters, which can be directly applied to physical simulation, texture synthesis, and multi-layer virtual try-on. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach robustly recovers diverse sewing patterns and the corresponding 3D garments from in-the-wild images without requiring multi-view inputs or iterative optimization, offering an efficient and scalable solution for realistic garment simulation and animation."

    "abstract": "Object detection models are critical components of automated systems, such as autonomous vehicles and perception-based robots, but their sensitivity to adversarial attacks poses a serious security risk. Progress in defending these models lags behind classification, hindered by a lack of standardized evaluation. It is nearly impossible to thoroughly compare attack or defense methods, as existing work uses different datasets, inconsistent efficiency metrics, and varied measures of perturbation cost. This paper addresses this gap by investigating three key questions: (1) How can we create a fair benchmark to impartially compare attacks? (2) How well do modern attacks transfer across different architectures, especially from Convolutional Neural Networks to Vision Transformers? (3) What is the most effective adversarial training strategy for robust defense? To answer these, we first propose a unified benchmark framework focused on digital, non-patch-based attacks. This framework introduces specific metrics to disentangle localization and classification errors and evaluates attack cost using multiple perceptual metrics. Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art attacks and a wide range of detectors. Our findings reveal two major conclusions: first, modern adversarial attacks against object detection models show a significant lack of transferability to transformer-based architectures. Second, we demonstrate that the most robust adversarial training strategy leverages a dataset composed of a mix of high-perturbation attacks with different objectives (e.g., spatial and semantic), which outperforms training on any single attack."

Probabilistic approaches to global wellposedness problems usually provide ensemble bounds on the solutions. These bounds are the main tools to ensure convergence procedures yielding the existence and uniqueness of global solutions. A question of interest consists in transforming such ensemble bounds into individual controls on the flow ; this, among other uses, gives valuable information on the long-time behavior of the solutions. Toward such question of bounds transformation, Bourgain initiated a successful procedure that exploited the local wellposedness of the PDE, with an estimate of the time of size-doubling. In this note, we construct an estimation procedure which relies on a different local requirement. It turns out that this substitute is flexible enough to be possible to fulfill with the help of the ensemble bound itself. For applications of the procedure, we are able to provide new pathwise controls on solutions to NLS equations."

In addition, we employ three different equations of state (EoSs), including one with a pasta phase, each based on a distinct theoretical framework: the variational method, relativistic Brueckner--Hartree--Fock theory, and relativistic mean-field theory. We emphasize that these approximations require only the TOV solutions for the core and the EoS properties at the core--crust interface; in our approach, only the energy density is needed. Finally, the relativistic approximation, as well as the Newtonian approximation with corrections, shows good agreement with the exact solutions. This indicates that a simple treatment of the crust is sufficient for structural purposes, independently of the uncertainties in the sub-nuclear equation of state, which are not very large. The unified EoS SINPA (relativistic mean-field theory), including the pasta phase, was used to study the thin-crust approximation, while degeneracy in the $M$--$R$ relation is demonstrated through: (i) anisotropic pressure in the modified TOV equations, (ii) the $f(R, L_m, T)$ gravity model, and (iii) dark matter admixture. As demonstrated, modifications to the description of gravitation introduce degeneracies in the mass--radius relation that are challenging to disentangle or quantify precisely."

We demonstrate efficacy of our implementation for benchmarks of C-RASPs in the literature, in particular in connection to the following applications: (1) transformer program optimization, and (2) constrained learning of transformer programs (based on a partial specification)."

    "abstract": "Motivated by recent developments in the theory of gravitation, we revisit the idea of topological variations, originally introduced by Wheeler and Hawking, from a rigorous perspective. Starting from a localized version of the Einstein-Hilbert variational principle, we encode the key aspects of the variational procedure in the form of a topology on a suitable space of variational configurations with low Sobolev regularity. This structure is the final topology with respect to the admissible variational maps and naturally lends itself to generalizations. We rigorously introduce two distinct types of topological variations, corresponding to the infinitesimal addition of disconnected components and to infinitesimal surgeries, both motivated by related physical concepts. Using tools from the theory of Sobolev spaces and precise asymptotics, we establish dimensional obstructions for the continuity and differentiability of the Einstein-Hilbert action with respect to these variations, and show that in the extended variational framework the action does not admit critical points in dimension $n=4$, while higher dimensions are free of this problem. Finally, we demonstrate the non-trivial effect of higher order curvature terms on the critical dimension."

We compare to a previous photolysis comparison exercise, namely PhotoComp 2011. Overall, we find good agreement between our results and previous work, with discrepancies usually caused by the implementation of temperature or pressure dependent quantum yields and updated cross-section data. We provide a new set of benchmark photolysis rates for additional species both for Solar irradiance and when irradiated by an M dwarf host star. In general, the higher actinic flux at far-UV and shorter wavelengths of the M dwarf compared to the Sun drives increased photolysis rates for reactions with high threshold energies. This work provides an updated set of benchmark results for further studies of photolysis in the Earth's atmosphere and that of other planets."

However, achieving long-range interfacial order while maintaining high-quality graphene remains a significant challenge. Here, we demonstrate the synthesis of large-area quasi-free-standing monolayer graphene (QFMLG) via the intercalation of a two-dimensional (2D) Sn. While the triangular Sn(1x1) interface exhibits a robust metallic band structure, the decoupled QFMLG maintains charge neutrality, confirmed by photoemission spectroscopy. Using high-resolution Raman spectroscopy and microscopy, we distinguish between direct intercalation and diffusion-driven expansion, identifying the latter as the critical pathway to superior QFMLG crystalline quality. Temperature-dependent analysis reveals dynamical structural coupling between the decoupled QFMLG and the Sn interface, providing a novel degree of freedom for strain engineering. Beyond uncovering the diffusion-driven mechanism, this work establishes metal intercalation as an effective strategy for tailoring durable graphene-metal heterostructures with tunable properties for next-generation quantum materials platforms."

    "abstract": "The pursuit of general-purpose robotic manipulation is hindered by the scarcity of diverse, real-world interaction data. Unlike data collection from web in vision or language, robotic data collection is an active process incurring prohibitive physical costs. Consequently, automated task curation to maximize data value remains a critical yet under-explored challenge. Existing manual methods are unscalable and biased toward common tasks, while off-the-shelf foundation models often hallucinate physically infeasible instructions. To address this, we introduce RoboGene, an agentic framework designed to automate the generation of diverse, physically plausible manipulation tasks across single-arm, dual-arm, and mobile robots. RoboGene integrates three core components: diversity-driven sampling for broad task coverage, self-reflection mechanisms to enforce physical constraints, and human-in-the-loop refinement for continuous improvement. We conduct extensive quantitative analysis and large-scale real-world experiments, collecting datasets of 18k trajectories and introducing novel metrics to assess task quality, feasibility, and diversity. Results demonstrate that RoboGene significantly outperforms state-of-the-art foundation models (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro). Furthermore, real-world experiments show that VLA models pre-trained with RoboGene achieve higher success rates and superior generalization, underscoring the importance of high-quality task generation.

    "abstract": "Conventional large language model (LLM) fairness alignment largely focuses on mitigating bias along single sensitive attributes, overlooking fairness as an inherently multidimensional and context-specific value. This approach risks creating systems that achieve narrow fairness metrics while exacerbating disparities along untargeted attributes, a phenomenon known as bias spillover. While extensively studied in machine learning, bias spillover remains critically underexplored in LLM alignment. In this work, we investigate how targeted gender alignment affects fairness across nine sensitive attributes in three state-of-the-art LLMs (Mistral 7B, Llama 3.1 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B). Using Direct Preference Optimization and the BBQ benchmark, we evaluate fairness under ambiguous and disambiguous contexts. Our findings reveal noticeable bias spillover: while aggregate results show improvements, context-aware analysis exposes significant degradations in ambiguous contexts, particularly for physical appearance ($p< 0.001$ across all models), sexual orientation, and disability status. We demonstrate that improving fairness along one attribute can inadvertently worsen disparities in others under uncertainty, highlighting the necessity of context-aware, multi-attribute fairness evaluation frameworks."

Furthermore, these outer regions do not reach the conditions necessary for fast $α$-captures in ${^{18}}\\mathrm{O}$ to ${^{22}}\\mathrm{Ne}$, thus being favorable to maintaining a low ${^{16}}\\mathrm{O}/{^{18}}\\mathrm{O}$ ratio."

We describe a construction of the controlled Markov chain, having stochastic transition rates adapted to the observation filtration. By a change of probability measure of Girsanov type, we introduce the so-called separated optimal control problem, where the state is the conditional (unnormalized) distribution of the controlled Markov chain and the observation process becomes a driving Brownian motion, and we prove the equivalence with the original control problem. The controlled equations for the separated problem are an instance of the Wonham filtering equations. Next we present an analysis of the separated problem: we characterize the value function as the unique viscosity solution to the dynamic programming equations (both in the parabolic and the elliptic case) we prove verifications theorems and a version of the stochastic maximum principle in the form of a necessary conditions for optimality."

The asymmetry results from asymmetric coin operations, asymmetric initial states, and asymmetric polarization-dependent losses. By varying these asymmetry factors, the inverse participation ratio and entanglement entropy of the walker are numerically calculated for different coin and loss parameters, both for symmetric and asymmetric initial states. We then experimentally implement a 16-step asymmetric DTQW using a time-multiplexing fiber loop structure. By choosing an asymmetric initial state, both coin-position entanglement and delocalization are simultaneously enhanced under specific coin parameters. Moreover, we observe that with finite asymmetric polarization-dependent loss, the photon probability on the left side decreases significantly, while that on the right side increases and becomes more localized. Interestingly, under specific coin parameters, the entanglement and delocalization exhibit improved robustness against polarization-dependent loss. These results demonstrate that the DTQWs constitute an ideal platform for investigating photonic delocalization and hybrid entanglement."

    "abstract": "Feynman famously asserted that interference is the only real mystery in quantum mechanics (QM). It is concluded that the reason for this mystery, and thereby the related mysteries of complementarity, non-commutativity of observables, the uncertainty principle and violation of Bell's equality, is that the axioms of QM depend vitally on the continuum nature of Hilbert Space, deemed unphysical. We develop a theory of quantum physics - Rational Quantum Mechanics (RaQM) - in which Hilbert Space is gravitationally discretised. The key to solving the mysteries of QM in RaQM is a number-theoretic property of the cosine function, concealed in QM when angles range over the continuum. This number-theoretic property describes mathematically the utter indivisibility of the quantum world and implies that the laws of physics are profoundly holistic. We contrast holism with nonlocality. In theories which embrace the continuum, the violation of Bell's inequality requires the laws of physics to be either nonlocal or not realistic; both incomprehensible concepts. By contrast, holism, as embodied in Mach's Principle or in the fractal geometry of a chaotic attractor, is neither incomprehensible nor unphysical. As part of this, we solve the deepest mystery of all; why nature makes use of complex numbers."

Both methods are evaluated across three ABSA subtasks (Aspect Term Extraction (ATE), Aspect Sentiment Classification (ATSC), and Aspect Sentiment Pair Extraction (ASPE)), four SemEval datasets, and two encoder-decoder models: T5-Base and Tk-Instruct. Our results show that the agentic augmentation outperforms raw prompting in label preservation of the augmented data, especially when the tasks require aspect term generation. In addition, when combined with real data, agentic augmentation provides higher gains, consistently outperforming prompting-based generation. These benefits are most pronounced for T5-Base, while the more heavily pretrained Tk-Instruct exhibits smaller improvements.

Several types of sensors are used to capture dynamic responses and monitor changes during the operation of critical parts of complex systems. Piezoelectric (PZ) materials belong to a class of electroactive materials that convert mechanical deformation into an electrical response. For example, PZ ceramics or PVDF foils are employed for online sensing of the time history of mechanical deformation. This paper focuses on the dynamical response of a cantilever beam structure equipped with a glued PZ sensor and combines experimental and modelling approaches to achieve accurate and reliable results. The time history of the normal velocity at a point on the beam surface was recorded with a laser vibrometer during transient vibrations of the beam, triggered by the sudden removal of a mass load at the beam's free end. Simultaneously, the output voltage of the PZ sensor was measured with an electronic device. An elastodynamic model of a cantilever beam coupled with a piezoelectric sensor is introduced, along with its discretization using the finite element method. The mathematical model includes additional terms that enforce a floating-potential boundary condition to maintain a constant charge on one of the sensor's electrodes and is presented in an extended form suitable for sensitivity analysis or parameter identification. The model implementation is validated using a numerical example corresponding to the experimental setup. The computed results show good agreement with the experimental data. Furthermore, values of the Rayleigh damping parameters were identified based on the experimental measurements."

WPEM models the full profile as a probabilistic mixture density and iteratively infers component-resolved intensities while keeping peak centres Bragg-consistent, producing a continuous, physically admissible intensity representation that remains stable in heavily overlapped regions and in the presence of mixed radiation or multiple phases. We benchmark WPEM on standard reference patterns (\\ce{PbSO4} and \\ce{Tb2BaCoO5}), where it yields lower $R_{\\mathrm{p}}$/$R_{\\mathrm{wp}}$ than widely used packages (FullProf and TOPAS) under matched refinement conditions.

    "abstract": "Continuum manipulators in flexible endoscopic surgical systems offer high dexterity for minimally invasive procedures; however, accurate pose estimation and closed-loop control remain challenging due to hysteresis, compliance, and limited distal sensing. Vision-based approaches reduce hardware complexity but are often constrained by limited geometric observability and high computational overhead, restricting real-time closed-loop applicability. This paper presents a unified framework for markerless stereo 6D pose estimation and position-based visual servoing of continuum manipulators. A photo-realistic simulation pipeline enables large-scale automatic training with pixel-accurate annotations. A stereo-aware multi-feature fusion network jointly exploits segmentation masks, keypoints, heatmaps, and bounding boxes to enhance geometric observability. To enforce geometric consistency without iterative optimization, a feed-forward rendering-based refinement module predicts residual pose corrections in a single pass. A self-supervised sim-to-real adaptation strategy further improves real-world performance using unlabeled data. Extensive real-world validation achieves a mean translation error of 0.83 mm and a mean rotation error of 2.76° across 1,000 samples. Markerless closed-loop visual servoing driven by the estimated pose attains accurate trajectory tracking with a mean translation error of 2.07 mm and a mean rotation error of 7.41°, corresponding to 85% and 59% reductions compared to open-loop control, together with high repeatability in repeated point-reaching tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first fully markerless pose-estimation-driven position-based visual servoing framework for continuum manipulators, enabling precise closed-loop control without physical markers or embedded sensing."

It relies on energy-based regressors to enhance parameter observability, supports both equality and inequality priors on inertial and actuation parameters, enforces dynamically consistent disturbance projections, and augments proprioceptive measurements with energy observations to disambiguate nonlinear friction effects. To ensure scalability, we derive a parameterized equality-constrained Riccati recursion that preserves the banded structure of the problem, achieving linear complexity in the time horizon, and develop computationally efficient derivatives. Simulation studies on representative robotic systems, together with hardware experiments on a Unitree B1 equipped with a Z1 arm, demonstrate faster convergence, lower inertial and friction estimation errors, and improved contact consistency compared to forward-dynamics and decoupled identification baselines. When deployed within model predictive control frameworks, the resulting models yield measurable improvements in tracking performance during locomotion over challenging environments."

However, robots operating in real-world environments face a critical limitation: they cannot anticipate how objects move. Long-horizon mobile manipulation requires closing the gap between semantics, geometry, and kinematics. In this work, we present MoMa-SG, a novel framework for building semantic-kinematic 3D scene graphs of articulated scenes containing a myriad of interactable objects. Given RGB-D sequences containing multiple object articulations, we temporally segment object interactions and infer object motion using occlusion-robust point tracking. We then lift point trajectories into 3D and estimate articulation models using a novel unified twist estimation formulation that robustly estimates revolute and prismatic joint parameters in a single optimization pass. Next, we associate objects with estimated articulations and detect contained objects by reasoning over parent-child relations at identified opening states. We also introduce the novel Arti4D-Semantic dataset, which uniquely combines hierarchical object semantics including parent-child relation labels with object axis annotations across 62 in-the-wild RGB-D sequences containing 600 object interactions and three distinct observation paradigms. We extensively evaluate the performance of MoMa-SG on two datasets and ablate key design choices of our approach. In addition, real-world experiments on both a quadruped and a mobile manipulator demonstrate that our semantic-kinematic scene graphs enable robust manipulation of articulated objects in everyday home environments.

    "abstract": "Two widely-used non-local extensions of dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), cellular DMFT (CDMFT) and the dynamical cluster approximation (DCA), both yield self-energies marred by having some unphysical properties: CDMFT yields real-space self-energies that are not translationally invariant, and DCA yields momentum-space self-energies with discontinuities in their momentum dependence. It is often desirable to remove these flaws by post-processing cluster DMFT results, using strategies called periodization for CDMFT and interpolation for DCA -- for brevity, we refer to both cases as interpolation. However, traditional interpolation approaches struggle to capture intricate structures such as hole pockets in the hole-doped square-lattice Hubbard model, as highlighted in Phys. Rev. B 105, 35117 (2022). Further, these approaches interpolate frequency-dependent functions, which may lead to causality violations. Here, we propose Liouvillian interpolation, a novel, intuitive, and robust scheme for interpolating cluster DMFT results. Our key idea is to interpolate frequency-independent matrix elements of the single-particle irreducible part of the Liouvillian, obtained from a continued-fraction expansion of the cDMFT self-energy. We demonstrate that the ingredients of such an expansion possess a more local Fourier expansion than the functions involved in traditional interpolation schemes, and that Liouvillian interpolation inherently conserves causality. We illustrate our method for the one-dimensional Hubbard model using CDMFT, and for the two-dimensional Hubbard model using four-patch DCA. For the latter, we find that L-interpolation can (depending on doping) yield Fermi and Luttinger arcs which together form a closed surface."

We then extend the notion of solution to distributional coefficients and initial data by a Friedrichs-type regularisation procedure. Within this very weak framework, we establish the existence and uniqueness of solution nets and prove consistency with the classical weak solution whenever the coefficients are regular."

    "abstract": "Meshless methods are used to solve partial differential equations by approximating differential operators at a node as a weighted sum of values at its neighbours. One of the algorithms for generating nodes suitable for meshless numerical analysis is an n-dimensional Poisson disc sampling based method. It can handle complex geometries and supports variable node density, a crucial feature for adaptive analysis. We modify this method for parallel execution using coupled spatial indexing and work distribution hypertrees. The latter is prebuilt according to the node density function, ensuring that each leaf represents a balanced work unit. Threads advance separate fronts and claim work hypertree leaves as needed while avoiding leaves neighbouring those claimed by other threads. Node placement constraints and the partially prebuilt spatial hypertree are combined to eliminate the need to lock the tree while it is being modified. Thread collision handling is managed by the work hypertree at the leaf level, drastically reducing the number of required mutex acquisitions for point insertion collision checks. We explore the behaviour of the proposed algorithm and compare the performance with existing attempts at parallelisation and consider the requirements for adapting the developed algorithm to distributed systems."

    "abstract": "Future vehicular networks require continuous connectivity to serve highly mobile users in urban environments. To mitigate the coverage limitations of fixed terrestrial macro base stations (MBS) under non line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions, fleets of unmanned aerial base stations (UABSs) can be deployed as aerial base stations, dynamically repositioning to track vehicular users and traffic hotspots in coordination with the terrestrial network. This paper addresses cooperative multi-agent trajectory design under different service areas and takeoff configurations, where rapid and safe adaptation across scenarios is essential. We formulate the problem as a multi-task decentralized partially observable Markov decision process and solve it using centralized training and decentralized execution with double dueling deep Q-network (3DQN), enabling online training for real-world deployments. However, efficient exploration remains a bottleneck, with conventional strategies like $ε$-greedy requiring careful tuning. To overcome this, we propose the multi-agent meta-advisor with advisor override (MAMO). This framework guides agent exploration through a meta-policy learned jointly across tasks. It uses a dynamic override mechanism that allows agents to reject misaligned guidance when the advisor fails to generalize to a specific scenario. Simulation results across three realistic urban scenarios and multiple takeoff configurations show that MAMO achieves faster convergence and higher returns than tuned $ε$-greedy baselines, outperforming both an advisor-only ablation and a single generalized policy. Finally, we demonstrate that the learned UABS fleet significantly improves network performance compared to deployments without aerial support."

However, their intrinsic biological variability and nonlinearity pose significant challenges for controllability and predictability. To address these issues, this study investigates the application of supervised learning, a form of machine learning, to model and predict the behavior of biohybrid machines (BHMs), focusing on a muscle ring anchored on flexible polymer pillars. First, static prediction models (i.e., random forest and neural network regressors) are trained to estimate the maximum exerted force achieved from input variables such as muscle sample, electrical stimulation parameters, and baseline exerted force. Second, a dynamic modeling framework, based on Long Short-Term Memory networks, is developed to serve as a digital twin, replicating the time series of exerted forces observed in response to electrical stimulation. Both modeling approaches demonstrate high predictive accuracy. The best performance of the static models is characterized by R2 of 0.9425, whereas the dynamic model achieves R2 of 0.9956. The static models can enable optimization of muscle actuator performance for targeted applications and required force outcomes, while the dynamic model provides a foundation for developing robustly adaptive control strategies in future biohybrid robotic systems."

BRachytherapy via artificially Intelligent GOMEA-Heuristic based Treatment planning (BRIGHT) generates multiple treatment plans, each with a different trade-off between tumour coverage and organs-at-risk sparing. BRIGHT was recently extended to cervical cancer brachytherapy. In this study, we present a novel, custom-developed graphical user interface (GUI) that enables plan navigation, pairwise comparisons, dose distribution visualisation, and possibility for adjustments - essential for efficient clinical use of BRIGHT. End-user validation of BRIGHT with the dedicated GUI was conducted for cervical cancer brachytherapy by emulating clinical practice in ten previously treated patients. A multidisciplinary brachytherapy team used BRIGHT to create new treatment plans. GUI usability was assessed using the System Usability Scale (SUS). BRIGHT plan quality was compared to clinical practice via blinded one-on-one comparisons. The GUI offered helpful features for plan navigation and evaluation, giving users quick insight into whether planning aims are achievable and what treatment options are available. The overall SUS score was 83.3, indicating an 'excellent' system. BRIGHT outperformed clinical practice in five out of ten patients regarding the coverage-sparing trade-off and performed equally well in the remaining five. The BRIGHT plan was preferred over the clinical plan in eight out of ten patients, four of which showed clinically relevant differences. The clinical plan was preferred in two patients, neither with clinically relevant differences. In conclusion, BRIGHT, with its dedicated GUI, is a clinically viable and user-friendly tool for treatment planning in cervical cancer brachytherapy."

    "abstract": "Quantum stochastic processes are widely used in describing open quantum systems and in the context of quantum foundations. Physically relevant quantum stochastic processes driven by multiplicative colored noise are generically non-Markovian and analytically intractable. Further, their Markovian limits are generically inequivalent when using either the Ito or Stratonovich conventions for the same quantum stochastic processes. We introduce a quantum noise homogenization scheme that temporally coarse-grains non-Markovian, colored-noise driven quantum stochastic processes and connects them to their effective white-noise (Markovian) limits. Our approach uses a novel phase-space augmentation that maps the non-Markovian dynamics into a higher dimensional Markovian system and then applies a controlled perturbative coarse-graining scheme in the characteristic time scales of the noise. This allows an explicit analytical algorithm to derive effective Markovian generators with renormalized coefficients and enables imposing various physical constraints on them. We thus resolve the Ito-Stratonovich ambiguity for multiplicative colored noise driven quantum stochastic processes, wherein we show that their consistent Markovian limit corresponds to the Stratonovich convention with renormalized coefficients as well as Ito correction terms. By assuming their Markovian limit unravels completely positive, trace-preserving maps, we further characterize a physically relevant family of non-Markovian quantum stochastic processes driven by multiplicative colored noise."

Unlike probabilistic zero forcing, RZF is governed by in-neighborhood structure and can fail to propagate globally due to directionality. The model extends naturally to weighted directed graphs by replacing neighbor counts with incoming weight proportions. We study the expected propagation time of RZF, establishing monotonicity properties with respect to enlarging the initial blue set and increasing weights on edges out of initially blue vertices, as well as invariances that relate weighted and unweighted dynamics. Exact values and sharp asymptotics are obtained for several families of directed graphs, including arborescences, stars, paths, cycles, and spiders, and we derive tight extremal bounds for unweighted directed graphs in terms of basic parameters such as order, degree, and radius. We conclude with an application to an empirical input-output network, illustrating how expected propagation time under RZF yields a dynamic, process-based notion of centrality in directed weighted systems."

In deployed settings, long contexts are typically managed through compaction in token space via summarization. However, summarization can be highly lossy, substantially harming downstream performance. Recent work on Cartridges has shown that it is possible to train highly compact KV caches in latent space that closely match full-context performance, but at the cost of slow and expensive end-to-end optimization. This work describes an approach for fast context compaction in latent space through Attention Matching, which constructs compact keys and values to reproduce attention outputs and preserve attention mass at a per-KV-head level. We show that this formulation naturally decomposes into simple subproblems, some of which admit efficient closed-form solutions. Within this framework, we develop a family of methods that significantly push the Pareto frontier of compaction time versus quality, achieving up to 50x compaction in seconds on some datasets with little quality loss."

    "abstract": "Entanglement is a central and subtle feature of quantum theory, whose structure and operational behavior can change dramatically when additional physical constraints, such as symmetries or superselection rules, are imposed. Such constraints can give rise to striking and counter-intuitive phenomena, including local broadcasting of entangled states and failures of entanglement monogamy. These effects naturally arise in tomographically nonlocal theories (like real quantum theory, twirled worlds, or fermionic quantum theory), where composite systems possess holistic degrees of freedom that are inaccessible to local measurements. In this work, we study entanglement in such theories within the framework of generalized probabilistic theories. We show that the failure of tomographic locality leads to two qualitatively distinct forms of entanglement, which we term $\\textit{tomographically-local}$ entanglement and $\\textit{tomographically-nonlocal}$ entanglement. We analyze the operational consequences of this distinction, proving that tomographically-nonlocal entanglement is useless for Bell nonlocality, steering, and teleportation, but sufficient for dense coding and perfectly secure data hiding. This framework clarifies the origin of several previously puzzling features of entanglement that arise when tomographic locality fails, as can happen even in quantum theory when one considers fermions or fundamental superselection rules."

Word-level embeddings exhibit uniformly contracting dynamics with no positive LE, while answer-level embeddings, in spite of the overall contraction, display a number of positive LEs and higher-dimensional attractors. The resulting LE spectra robustly separate psychotic from healthy speech, while differentiation within the psychotic group is not statistically significant overall, despite a tendency of the most severe cases to occupy distinct dynamical regimes.

We evaluate the impact of input representation by comparing networks trained on raw measurements versus preprocessed features derived from a linearization method. Simulation results show that the learning-based approach consistently outperforms existing linear methods under RSS noise across all noise levels, and matches or surpasses state-of-the-art performance under increasing AoA noise.

TNQE first represents each classical input via a TN decomposition and then compiles the resulting tensor cores into an encoding circuit through two complementary core-to-circuit strategies. To make this compilation trainable while respecting the unitary nature of quantum operations, we introduce a unitary-aware constraint that parameterizes TN cores as learnable block unitaries, enabling them to be directly optimized and directly encoded as quantum operators. The proposed TNQE framework enables explicit control over circuit depth and qubit resources, allowing the construction of shallow, resource-efficient circuits. Across a range of benchmarks, TNQE achieves encoding circuits as shallow as $0.04\\times$ the depth of amplitude encoding, while naturally scaling to high-resolution images ($256 \\times 256$) and demonstrating practical feasibility on real quantum hardware."

The control scheme is divided into two steps. The first one is dedicated to the estimation of the leader state by each follower in a distributed way and in a fixed-time. Then, based on the estimate of the leader state, each follower computes its control law to track the leader in a fixed-time. In this paper, two control strategies are investigated and compared to solve the two mentioned steps. The first one is an autonomous protocol which ensures a fixed-time convergence for the observer and for the controller parts where the Upper Bound of the Settling-Time (UBST) is set a priory by the user. Then, the previous strategy is redesigned using time-varying gains to obtain a non-autonomous protocol. This enables to obtain less conservative estimates of the UBST while guaranteeing that the time-varying gains remain bounded. Some numerical examples show the effectiveness of the proposed consensus protocols."

TV regularization has a long history in regression and density estimation, including results on $L^2$ and KL divergence convergence rates. Here, we revisit this task using the Highly Adaptive Lasso (HAL) framework. We formulate a HAL-based maximum likelihood estimator (HAL-MLE) using the log-spline link function from \\citet{kooperberg1992logspline}, and show that in the univariate setting the bounded sectional variation norm assumption underlying HAL coincides with the classical bounded TV assumption. This equivalence directly connects HAL-MLE to existing TV-penalized approaches such as local adaptive splines \\citep{mammen1997locally}. We establish three new theoretical results: (i) the univariate HAL-MLE is asymptotically linear, (ii) it admits pointwise asymptotic normality, and (iii) it achieves uniform convergence at rate $n^{-(k+1)/(2k+3)}$ up to logarithmic factors for the smoothness order $k \\geq 1$. These results extend existing results from \\citet{van2017uniform}, which previously guaranteed only uniform consistency without rates when $k=0$. We will include the uniform convergence for general dimension $d$ in the follow-up work of this paper. The intention of this paper is to provide a unified framework for the TV-penalized density estimation methods, and to connect the HAL-MLE to the existing TV-penalized methods in the univariate case, despite that the general HAL-MLE is defined for multivariate cases."

A data-processing framework, called SeaSpoofFinder, available here: seaspooffinder.github.io/ais_data, was developed to ingest and post-process global AIS streams and to detect candidate anomalies through a two-stage procedure. In Stage 1, implausible position jumps are identified using kinematic and data-quality filters; in Stage 2, events are retained only when multiple vessels exhibit spatially consistent source and target clustering, thereby reducing false positives from single-vessel artifacts. The resulting final potential spoofing events (FPSEs) reveal recurrent patterns in several regions, including the Baltic Sea, the Black Sea, Murmansk, Moscow, and the Haifa area, with affected footprints that can span large maritime areas. The analysis also highlights recurring non-spoofing artifacts (e.g., back-to-port jumps and data gaps) that can still pass heuristic filters in dense traffic regions. These results indicate that AIS-based monitoring can provide useful evidence for identifying and characterizing potential spoofing activity at scale, while emphasizing that AIS-only evidence does not provide definitive attribution."

    "abstract": "A pinching antennas (PAs)-aided integrated sensing and multicast communication framework is proposed. In this framework, the communication performance is measured by the multicast rate considering max-min fairness. Moreover, the sensing performance is quantified by the Bayesian Cramér-Rao bound (BCRB), where a Gauss-Hermite quadrature-based approach is proposed to compute the Bayesian Fisher information matrix. Based on these metrics, PA placement is optimized under three criteria: communications-centric (C-C), sensing-centric (S-C), and Pareto-optimal designs. These designs are investigated in two scenarios: the single-PA case and the multi-PA case. 1) For the single-PA case, a closed-form solution is derived for the location of the C-C transmit PA, while the S-C design yields optimal transmit and receive PA placements that are symmetric about the target location. Leveraging this geometric insight, the Pareto-optimal design is solved by enforcing this PA placement symmetry, thereby reducing the joint transmit and receive PA placement to the transmit PA optimization. 2) For the general multi-PA case, the PA placements constitute a highly non-convex optimization problem. To solve this, an element-wise alternating optimization-based method is proposed to sequentially optimize all PA placements for the S-C design, and is further incorporated into an augmented Lagrangian (AL) framework and a rate-profile formulation to solve the C-C and Pareto-optimal design problems, respectively. Numerical results show that: i) PASS substantially outperforms fixed-antenna baselines in both multicast rate and sensing accuracy; ii) the multicasting gain becomes more pronounced as the user density increases; and iii) the sensing accuracy improves with the number of deployed PAs."

We conduct a systematic benchmark of 17 LLMs using a unified evaluation framework. Our analysis uncovers annotator bias and substantial instability in model judgments. Surprisingly, increased model scale does not guarantee improved annotation quality--smaller, more task-aligned models frequently exhibit more consistent behavior than their larger counterparts. These results highlight important limitations of current LLMs for sensitive annotation tasks in low-resource languages and underscore the need for careful evaluation before deployment."

    "abstract": "Accurate estimation of propagation characteristics of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is crucial for predicting their geoeffectiveness. Stereoscopic techniques to study the kinematics of CMEs generally have been carried out using remote sensing observations from three viewpoints, i.e. STEREO-A, STEREO-B, and SOHO. Since the loss of STEREO-B in 2014, stereoscopic reconstruction of CMEs has been restricted to the observations from only two viewpoints, i.e., STEREO-A and SOHO. When the angle of separation between STEREO-A and SOHO is small, it leads to larger uncertainties in the CME kinematics derived using stereoscopic techniques. In this paper, we demonstrate how this limitation can be addressed and how uncertainties in the estimation of CME kinematics and propagation direction can be reduced. For this purpose, we selected the CME of April 21, 2023, which was observed by two spacecraft, i.e. STEREO-A and SOHO, separated by a small 10 degree angle. Using the Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS) model on the remote-sensing observations near the Sun and the Advanced Drag-Based Model (ADBM) in the heliosphere, we estimated the arrival time of the CME at different locations in the heliosphere and compared it with the actual arrival time obtained from the in-situ measurements taken by three spacecraft, BepiColombo, STEREO-A and Wind. Our analysis reveals a directional uncertainty of approx 20 degree from observations from two viewpoints. These uncertainties significantly affect the arrival-time prediction of the CME. We consider the actual chronology of CME arrival times at STEREO-A and Wind as critical parameters to constrain the direction of propagation, which serves as a key input in the ADBM. The chronology of arrival of the CME ejecta at STEREO-A, which is 4.5 hrs earlier than at Wind, proved essential for resolving directional ambiguities in the GCS reconstruction model"

In real-world edge detection (e.g., floor-plan walls, satellite roads/buildings, and medical organ boundaries), crispness and data efficiency are crucial, yet producing crisp raw edge maps with limited training samples remains challenging. Although image-generation foundation models perform well on many downstream tasks, their pretrained priors for data-efficient transfer and iterative refinement for high-frequency detail preservation remain underexploited for edge detection. To enable crisp and data-efficient edge detection using these capabilities, we introduce an edge-specialized adaptation of image-generation foundation models. To better specialize the foundation model for edge detection, we incorporate an edge-oriented objective with an efficient pixel-space loss. At inference, we introduce guidance based on unconditional dynamics, enabling a single model to control the edge density through a guidance scale. Experiments on BSDS500, NYUDv2, BIPED, and CubiCasa compare against state-of-the-art methods and show consistent gains, particularly under no-post-processing crispness evaluation and with limited training data."

The spin-orbit coupled band structure shows $Γ$-centred Fermi sheets with coexistence of band-selective Rashba-like (in-plane) and Ising-like (out-of-plane) superconductivity. Remarkably, the superconducting gaps are odd in spin, orbital, and momentum channels despite the presence of global inversion symmetry. Fermi surface topologies and little-group symmetry enforce distinct irreducible representations to the Rashba and Ising channels, forbidding their mixing. Our findings open up a symmetry-based route to multichannel superconductivity in 2D transition-metal dichalcogenides with unique functionalities."

In complete interaction graphs, optimal space-time trade-offs are known for the leader election and exact majority problems. However, it has remained open if other graph families exhibit similar space-time complexity trade-offs, as existing lower bound techniques do not extend beyond highly dense graphs. In this work, we show that -- unlike in complete graphs -- population protocols on bounded-degree trees do not exhibit significant asymptotic space-time trade-offs for leader election and exact majority. For these problems, we give constant-space protocols that have near-optimal worst-case expected stabilisation time. These new protocols achieve a linear speed-up compared to the state-of-the-art. Our results are based on two novel protocols, which we believe are of independent interest. First, we give a new fast self-stabilising 2-hop colouring protocol for general interaction graphs, whose stabilisation time we bound using a stochastic drift argument. Second, we give a self-stabilising tree orientation algorithm that builds a rooted tree in optimal time on any tree. As a consequence, we can use simple constant-state protocols designed for directed trees to solve leader election and exact majority fast. For example, we show that ``directed'' annihilation dynamics solve exact majority in $O(n^2 \\log n)$ steps on directed trees."

    "abstract": "This paper re-evaluates the relationship between the observed sunward electron cutoff energy and the depth of the Sun's global electrostatic potential. It investigates whether taking into account the effects of local traps formed by magnetic fluctuations provides an alternative explanation for the observed electron deficit. The fluctuations of the highly variable interplanetary magnetic field form a series of shallow magnetic mirror traps that move at approximately the speed of the solar wind. The study investigates the dynamics of electrons as they move outward against an attractive solar electrostatic potential and interact with these traps. By following the motion of the electrons using first-principles calculations, we assess the effect of the traps on the velocity distribution of the particles. Electrons that escape the local trap continue to lose energy as they move outward until they are eventually captured by subsequent traps, preventing them from returning to the observer as sunward-moving particles. We derive a mathematical expression for the cutoff velocity, defined as the limit beyond which particles can no longer overtake the outer endpoint of a local trap. It turns out that the observed cutoff energy characterizes only the local potential drop within a trap, rather than the total depth of the Sun's potential well. The true potential well can be significantly deeper, scaled by the ratio of the radial distance from the Sun to the trap size. Furthermore, electrons captured by these moving traps contribute to the formation of the solar wind core population. The Sun's electrostatic potential is a more significant factor in solar wind acceleration than previously interpreted from cutoff data. The interaction between electrostatic deceleration and moving magnetic traps provides a new framework for understanding the origin and behavior of the solar wind core electrons."

By utilizing GNNs, the proposed model, termed the Collision-captured Network (CN), integrates data assimilation (DA) techniques to effectively learn and predict sea ice dynamics under various conditions. The approach was validated using synthetic data, both with and without observed data points, and it was found that the model accelerates the simulation of trajectories without compromising accuracy. This advancement offers a more efficient tool for forecasting in marginal ice zones (MIZ) and highlights the potential of combining machine learning with data assimilation for more effective and efficient modeling."

Micron-scale photochromic hybrid films present a particularly attractive platform for these applications, combining straightforward preparation with substantial optical modulation and scalability for high-volume fabrication. However, rational design of such films remains fundamentally constrained by the absence of well-defined optical constants. Unlike homogeneous thin films, micron-scale hybrid photochromic materials comprise active particles dispersed non-uniformly within polymer matrices. Conventional first-principles electromagnetic simulations face substantial computational costs and discrepancies between simulated and experimental particle distributions. Here, we introduce a data-driven framework that extracts effective optical constants directly from minimal experimental transmittance measurements. Our dual-state effective model approximates the complex inhomogeneous photochromic layer as a compressed homogeneous medium characterized by pseudo-refractive indices and pseudo-extinction coefficients for both pristine and UV-irradiated states. Through systematic optimization against experimental data from tungsten oxide-polyvinylpyrrolidone hybrid films, we determine wavelength-dependent pseudo-optical constants and compression ratios that enable accurate prediction of optical modulation within the tested thickness range. Our methodology establishes a framework for engineering hybrid photochromic systems and demonstrates how data-driven modeling can overcome limitations in characterizing complex nanostructured materials."

In addition, we propose an image measurement method to easily acquire the calibration information between the camera coordinate system and the fork coordinate system necessary to apply the measurements in the camera coordinate system to the fork control. In the experiment space, a wide-angle camera was fixed at the backrest of a reach type forklift. The wide-angle images taken by placing a pallet in front of the camera were processed. As a result of evaluating the error by comparing the image measurement value with the hand measurement value when changing the pitch inclination angle of the pallet, the relative height of the pallet and the fork, and whether the pallet is loaded or not, it was confirmed that the error was within the allowable range for safely inserting the fork."

    "abstract": "Training LLMs as interactive agents for multi-turn decision-making remains challenging, particularly in long-horizon tasks with sparse and delayed rewards, where agents must execute extended sequences of actions before receiving meaningful feedback. Most existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches model LLM agents as flat policies operating at a single time scale, selecting one action at each turn. In sparse-reward settings, such flat policies must propagate credit across the entire trajectory without explicit temporal abstraction, which often leads to unstable optimization and inefficient credit assignment. We propose HiPER, a novel Hierarchical Plan-Execute RL framework that explicitly separates high-level planning from low-level execution. HiPER factorizes the policy into a high-level planner that proposes subgoals and a low-level executor that carries them out over multiple action steps. To align optimization with this structure, we introduce a key technique called hierarchical advantage estimation (HAE), which carefully assigns credit at both the planning and execution levels. By aggregating returns over the execution of each subgoal and coordinating updates across the two levels, HAE provides an unbiased gradient estimator and provably reduces variance compared to flat generalized advantage estimation. Empirically, HiPER achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging interactive benchmarks, reaching 97.4\\% success on ALFWorld and 83.3\\% on WebShop with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (+6.6\\% and +8.3\\% over the best prior method), with especially large gains on long-horizon tasks requiring multiple dependent subtasks.

Literary theory identifies uncertainty as a necessary condition for creative expression, while current alignment strategies steer models away from uncertain outputs to ensure factuality and reduce hallucination. We formalize this tension by quantifying the \"uncertainty gap\" between human-authored stories and model-generated continuations. Through a controlled information-theoretic analysis of 28 LLMs on high-quality storytelling datasets, we demonstrate that human writing consistently exhibits significantly higher uncertainty than model outputs. We find that instruction-tuned and reasoning models exacerbate this trend compared to their base counterparts; furthermore, the gap is more pronounced in creative writing than in functional domains, and strongly correlates to writing quality. Achieving human-level creativity requires new uncertainty-aware alignment paradigms that can distinguish between destructive hallucinations and the constructive ambiguity required for literary richness."

Here, we show that non-conservative motion of interfacial dislocations is intrinsically coupled to the nucleation and lateral propagation of nanoscale growth ledges, providing a defect-based kinetic description of lath growth. Phase-field-crystal simulations of a prototypical face-centered cubic/body-centered cubic (FCC/BCC) transformation resolve strongly anisotropic interface kinetics: the end face advances continuously along the lath long axis, whereas facets thicken by discrete ledge sweeps accompanied by mixed glide-climb reactions in a closed dislocation network. Crystallographic analyses predict the dislocation arrangements, rationalize the anisotropy via the geometry of misfit localization, and show how dislocation motion accommodates the transformation strain. In situ transmission electron microscopy of austenite precipitates in duplex stainless steel captures rapid ledge propagation on habit planes, consistent with the predicted migration mode. Our results bridge point-defect transport, dislocation reactions, and interface mobility, enabling quantitative, transferable predictions of precipitate morphology evolution."

Motivated by this observation, we introduce ASPEN, a hybrid architecture that combines spectral and temporal feature streams via multiplicative fusion, requiring cross-modal agreement for features to propagate. Experiments across six benchmark datasets reveal that ASPEN is able to dynamically achieve the optimal spectral-temporal balance depending on the paradigm. ASPEN achieves the best unseen-subject accuracy on three of six datasets and competitive performance on others, demonstrating that multiplicative multimodal fusion enables effective cross-subject generalization."

We consider two settings involving a finite dictionary of $M$ densities: (i) model aggregation, where $p$ belongs to the dictionary, and (ii) convex aggregation (mixture density estimation), where $p$ is a mixture of densities from the dictionary. Crucially, we make no assumption on the base densities: their ratios may be unbounded and their supports may differ. For both problems, we identify the best possible high-probability guarantees in terms of the dictionary size, sample size, and confidence level. These optimal rates are higher than those achievable when density ratios are bounded by absolute constants; for mixture density estimation, they match existing lower bounds in the special case of discrete distributions. Our analysis of the mixture case hinges on two new covering results. First, we provide a sharp, distribution-free upper bound on the local Hellinger entropy of the class of mixtures of $M$ distributions. Second, we prove an optimal ratio covering theorem for convex sets: for every convex compact set $K\\subset \\mathbb{R}_+^d$, there exists a subset $A\\subset K$ with at most $2^{8d}$ elements such that each element of $K$ is coordinate-wise dominated by an element of $A$ up to a universal constant factor.

    "abstract": "This study examines the variability of ionospheric total electron content (VTEC) in response to solar and geomagnetic drivers across solar cycles 23 to 25. While the dominant effect of solar radiation on VTEC is well-known, a comprehensive understanding of how these relationships and their time-lags vary across distinct solar cycle phases and across cycles of differing intensity has been lacking. Using global VTEC data from the Chinese Academy of Sciences Global Ionospheric Maps (CASG) and solar-geophysical indices from NASA's OMNI dataset spanning from 1998 to 2025, this study bridges that gap by quantifying correlation strengths and time-lag relationships between VTEC and parameters such as $F_{10.7}$ solar flux, R sunspot number, Kp, Ap, and Dst indices, and solar wind properties. Results show that solar proxies, particularly $F_{10.7}$ and R sunspot number, exhibit the strongest, most consistent correlations with VTEC, especially during the ascending and descending phases of the solar cycle, with a characteristic $\\sim2$-day lag attributed to thermospheric oxygen dynamics and ionospheric recombination processes. In contrast, geomagnetic indices exhibit weaker and phase-dependent correlations, while direct correlations between solar wind parameters and global VTEC are weak, as their influence is primarily mediated by geomagnetic activity and exhibits strong regional and temporal heterogeneity. Phase-resolved analyses further reveal that geomagnetic activity plays a more prominent role during transitional phases, while maximum and minimum periods are dominated by EUV variability and non-solar drivers, respectively. These findings highlight the necessity of incorporating solar phase and time-lag dependencies in ionospheric modelling and forecasting efforts."

    "abstract": "Gene Regulatory Networks(GRNs) with feedback are essential components of many cellular processes and may exhibit oscillatory behavior. Analyzing such systems becomes increasingly complex as the number of components increases. Since gene regulation often involves a small number of molecules, fluctuations are inevitable. Therefore, it is important to understand how fluctuations affect the oscillatory dynamics of cellular processes, as this will allow comprehension of the mechanisms that enable cellular functions to remain even in the presence of fluctuations or, failing that, to determine the limit of fluctuations that permits various cellular functions. In this study, we investigated the conditions under which GRNs with feedback and intrinsic fluctuations exhibit oscillatory behavior. Our focus was on developing a procedure that would be both manageable and practical, even for extensive regulatory networks, that is, those comprising numerous nodes. Using the second-moment approach, we described the stochastic dynamics through a set of ordinary differential equations for the mean concentration and its second central moment. The system can attain either a stable equilibrium or oscillatory behavior, depending on its scale and, consequently, the intensity of fluctuations. To illustrate the procedure, we analyzed two relevant systems: a repressilator with three nodes and a system with five nodes, both incorporating intrinsic fluctuations. In both cases, it was observed that for very small systems, which therefore exhibit significant fluctuations, oscillatory behavior is inhibited. The procedure presented here for analyzing the stability of oscillations under fluctuations enables the determination of the critical minimum size of GRNs at which intrinsic fluctuations do not eliminate their cyclical behavior."

We show that positive invariant random fields with uniformly bounded second moments are in one-to-one correspondence with bounded positive harmonic functions. The proof combines a remote past pullback construction with a uniqueness argument that applies a contraction inspired by chaos expansion. As a consequence, the space of invariant measures inherits geometric structure from the Martin Boundary. We further establish a small-noise Gaussian fluctuation result within each harmonic sector and show that the long-time behavior of solutions is completely determined by the Martin boundary data of the initial condition. These results reveal a direct connection between stochastic PDE dynamics and boundary theory in potential analysis."

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), efficiently serving LLM inference under limited GPU resources has become a critical challenge. Recently, an increasing number of studies have explored applying serverless computing paradigms to LLM serving in order to maximize resource utilization. However, LLM inference workloads are highly diverse, and modern GPU clusters are inherently heterogeneous, making it necessary to dynamically adjust deployment configurations online to better adapt to the elastic and dynamic nature of serverless environments. At the same time, enabling such online reconfiguration is particularly challenging due to the stateful nature of LLM inference and the massive size of model parameters. In this paper, we propose a dynamic pipeline reconfiguration approach that enables online adjustment of pipeline configurations while minimizing service downtime and performance degradation. Our method allows the system to select the optimal pipeline configuration in response to changing workloads. Experimental results on heterogeneous GPU platforms, including NVIDIA A100 and L40s, demonstrate that our migration mechanism incurs less than 50 ms of service downtime, while introducing under 10% overhead on both time-to-first-token (TTFT) and time-per-output-token (TPOT)."

    "abstract": "Stochastic simulation is widely used to study complex systems composed of various interconnected subprocesses, such as input processes, routing and control logic, optimization routines, and data-driven decision modules. In practice, these subprocesses may be inherently unknown or too computationally intensive to directly embed in the simulation model. Replacing these elements with estimated or learned approximations introduces a form of epistemic uncertainty that we refer to as submodel uncertainty. This paper investigates how submodel uncertainty affects the estimation of system performance metrics. We develop a framework for quantifying submodel uncertainty in stochastic simulation models and extend the framework to digital-twin settings, where simulation experiments are repeatedly conducted with the model initialized from observed system states. Building on approaches from input uncertainty analysis, we leverage bootstrapping and Bayesian model averaging to construct quantile-based confidence or credible intervals for key performance indicators. We propose a tree-based method that decomposes total output variability and attributes uncertainty to individual submodels in the form of importance scores. The proposed framework is model-agnostic and accommodates both parametric and nonparametric submodels under frequentist and Bayesian modeling paradigms. A synthetic numerical experiment and a more realistic digital-twin simulation of a contact center illustrate the importance of understanding how and how much individual submodels contribute to overall uncertainty."

While scaling has improved average-case performance, persistent failures on low-frequency, domain-specific, cultural, and temporal knowledge remain poorly characterized. This paper develops a structured taxonomy and analysis of long-Tail Knowledge in large language models, synthesizing prior work across technical and sociotechnical perspectives. We introduce a structured analytical framework that synthesizes prior work across four complementary axes: how long-Tail Knowledge is defined, the mechanisms by which it is lost or distorted during training and inference, the technical interventions proposed to mitigate these failures, and the implications of these failures for fairness, accountability, transparency, and user trust. We further examine how existing evaluation practices obscure tail behavior and complicate accountability for rare but consequential failures. The paper concludes by identifying open challenges related to privacy, sustainability, and governance that constrain long-Tail Knowledge representation. Taken together, this paper provides a unifying conceptual framework for understanding how long-Tail Knowledge is defined, lost, evaluated, and manifested in deployed language model systems."

The analysis employs a scale-dependent growth equation and utilizes the fk-PT perturbation theory approach, implemented in the FOLPS-nu code, to compute the full 1-loop power spectrum multipoles, in particular, the monopole and quadrupole ($\\ell=0,2$, respectively). The results show that at redshift $z=0$, the monopole of both MG models is suppressed compared to $Λ$CDM, with the Symmetron being closer to the standard model, while the quadrupole presents the opposite behavior. To validate the pipeline, we use General Relativity (GR) mock catalogs (EZMocks), since suitable Symmetron simulations are not available. The main result is that the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis successfully recovers the expected GR limit (i.e., $β_0 \\approx 0$) from the Symmetron model when applied to this mock data, confirming the viability of our methodology for cosmological inference. Then, we conclude that the pipeline is prepared to test MG models against current and near-future galaxy surveys."

To address this limitation, we present a high-resolution, district-level dataset on tuberculosis (TB) fatalities and hospital accessibility in South Korea, covering the years 2014 to 2022 across 228 districts. The dataset is constructed using a reconstruction method that infers age-disaggregated TB cases and fatalities at the district level by integrating province-level age-specific statistics with district-level spatial and demographic data, enabling analyses that account for both spatial heterogeneity and age structure. Building on an existing hospital allocation framework, we extend the objective function to an age-weighted formulation and apply it to the reconstructed dataset to minimize TB fatalities under different age-weighting schemes. We demonstrate that incorporating age structure can give rise to distinct optimized hospital allocation patterns, even when the total number of minimized fatalities is similar, revealing trade-offs between efficiency and demographic targeting. In addition, the dataset supports temporal analyses of TB burden, hospital availability, and demographic variation over time, and provides a testbed for spatial epidemiology and optimization studies that require high-resolution demographic and healthcare data."

Under this setting, the point estimation problem has attracted considerable attention. In this paper, we focus on a less studied inference question: how can we conduct valid statistical inference in such settings with unknown bias? We propose a strategy to combine unbiased and biased estimators from a sensitivity analysis perspective. We derive a sequence of confidence intervals indexed by the magnitude of the bias, which enable researchers to assess how conclusions vary with the bias levels. Importantly, we introduce the notion of the b-value, a critical value of the unknown maximum relative bias at which combining estimators does not yield a significant result. We apply this strategy to three canonical combined estimators: the precision-weighted estimator, the pretest estimator, and the soft-thresholding estimator. For each estimator, we characterize the sequence of confidence intervals and determine the bias threshold at which the conclusion changes. Based on the theory, we recommend reporting the b-value based on the soft-thresholding estimator and its associated confidence intervals, which are robust to unknown bias and achieve the lowest worst-case risk among the alternatives."

    "abstract": "X-ray reflection spectroscopy is a powerful tool for testing the Kerr hypothesis and probing the strong gravity regime around accreting black holes. Most tests of General Relativity (GR) assume that the spacetime around a black hole is circular, meaning the metric possesses a specific symmetry structure common to the Kerr solution. However, deviations from circularity are predicted by various modified gravity theories and non-vacuum General Relativity solutions. In this work, we test a specific non-circular metric constructed based on a locality principle, where the deviation from the Kerr spacetime is driven by the local spacetime curvature. To accurately model the reflection spectrum in this background, we implement a relativistic ray-tracing code in horizon-penetrating (ingoing Kerr) coordinates, which are favored for their ability to avoid introducing curvature singularities at the horizon in non-circular spacetimes. We apply this model to the high-quality \\textit{NuSTAR} spectrum of the Galactic black hole binary EXO 1846--031. Our spectral analysis reveals a source with a high inclination angle ($ι\\approx 76^{\\circ}$) and a near-extremal spin parameter ($a_* \\approx 0.98$). While we identify a global minimum in the parameter space suggesting a non-zero deformation ($\\ell_{\\mathrm{NP}} \\approx 0.12$), the 99\\% confidence interval fully encompasses the Kerr limit ($\\ell_{\\mathrm{NP}}=0$). We conclude that the current X-ray reflection data for EXO 1846--031 are consistent with the Kerr hypothesis. This work demonstrates the feasibility of using X-ray reflection spectroscopy to constrain non-circular metrics and establishes a framework for future tests."

However, most existing benchmarks for multimodal foundation models (MFMs) emphasize environment-centric spatial relations (relations among objects in a scene), while largely overlooking observer-centric relationships that require reasoning relative to agent's viewpoint, pose, and motion. To bridge this gap, we introduce SAW-Bench (Situated Awareness in the Real World), a novel benchmark for evaluating egocentric situated awareness using real-world videos. SAW-Bench comprises 786 self-recorded videos captured with Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) smart glasses spanning diverse indoor and outdoor environments, and over 2,071 human-annotated question-answer pairs. It probes a model's observer-centric understanding with six different awareness tasks. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals a human-model performance gap of 37.66%, even with the best-performing MFM, Gemini 3 Flash. Beyond this gap, our in-depth analysis uncovers several notable findings; for example, while models can exploit partial geometric cues in egocentric videos, they often fail to infer a coherent camera geometry, leading to systematic spatial reasoning errors. We position SAW-Bench as a benchmark for situated spatial intelligence, moving beyond passive observation to understanding physically grounded, observer-centric dynamics."

These two problems were inspired by a conjecture of Stembridge stating that the Poincaré series of reflections is rational and by the solution provided by de Man. To address the first problem, we introduce reflection-prefixes, arising naturally from palindromic reduced words. We study their connections with the root poset, dominance order on roots, and dihedral reflection subgroups. Using $m$-canonical automata associated with $m$-Shi arrangements, we prove that the language of reduced words for reflection-prefixes is regular. For the second problem, we focus on affine Coxeter groups. In this case, we derive a simple formula for the Poincaré series using symmetries of the Hasse diagram of the root poset."

We propose an alternative approach that represents an e-graph natively in the compiler's intermediate representation, facilitating the application of constructive compiler passes that maintain the e-graph state throughout the compilation flow. We build on a Python-based MLIR framework, xDSL, and introduce a new MLIR dialect, eqsat, that represents e-graphs in MLIR code. We show that this representation expands the scope of equality saturation in the compiler, allowing us to interleave pattern rewriting with other compiler transformations. The eqsat dialect provides a unified abstraction for compilers to utilize equality saturation across various levels of intermediate representations concurrently within the same MLIR flow."

However, a sampling problem remains when computing observables that rely on states which are rare in equilibrium, for example folding free energies. Here, we introduce enhanced diffusion sampling, enabling efficient exploration of rare-event regions while preserving unbiased thermodynamic estimators. The key idea is to perform quantitatively accurate steering protocols to generate biased ensembles and subsequently recover equilibrium statistics via exact reweighting. We instantiate our framework in three algorithms: UmbrellaDiff (umbrella sampling with diffusion models), $Δ$G-Diff (free-energy differences via tilted ensembles), and MetaDiff (a batchwise analogue for metadynamics). Across toy systems, protein folding landscapes and folding free energies, our methods achieve fast, accurate, and scalable estimation of equilibrium properties within GPU-minutes to hours per system -- closing the rare-event sampling gap that remained after the advent of diffusion-model equilibrium samplers."

While parameter sharing in VQCs can reduce the parameter space dimensionality and potentially mitigate the barren plateau phenomenon, it introduces a complex trade-off that has been largely overlooked. This paper investigates how parameter sharing, despite creating better global optima with fewer parameters, fundamentally alters the optimization landscape through deceptive gradients -- regions where gradient information exists but systematically misleads optimizers away from global optima. Through systematic experimental analysis, we demonstrate that increasing degrees of parameter sharing generate more complex solution landscapes with heightened gradient magnitudes and measurably higher deceptiveness ratios. Our findings reveal that traditional gradient-based optimizers (Adam, SGD) show progressively degraded convergence as parameter sharing increases, with performance heavily dependent on hyperparameter selection. We introduce a novel gradient deceptiveness detection algorithm and a quantitative framework for measuring optimization difficulty in quantum circuits, establishing that while parameter sharing can improve circuit expressivity by orders of magnitude, this comes at the cost of significantly increased landscape deceptiveness. These insights provide important considerations for quantum circuit design in practical applications, highlighting the fundamental mismatch between classical optimization strategies and quantum parameter landscapes shaped by parameter sharing."

Using Gymnasium and PennyLane, we evaluate Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Advantage Actor--Critic (A2C) on systems comprising two to ten qubits and on targets of increasing complexity with \\(λ\\) ranging from one to five.

    "abstract": "Hazard and survival functions are natural, interpretable targets in time-to-event prediction, but their inherent non-additivity fundamentally limits standard additive explanation methods. We introduce Survival Functional Decomposition (SurvFD), a principled approach for analyzing feature interactions in machine learning survival models. By decomposing higher-order effects into time-dependent and time-independent components, SurvFD offers a previously unrecognized perspective on survival explanations, explicitly characterizing when and why additive explanations fail. Building on this theoretical decomposition, we propose SurvSHAP-IQ, which extends Shapley interactions to time-indexed functions, providing a practical estimator for higher-order, time-dependent interactions. Together, SurvFD and SurvSHAP-IQ establish an interaction- and time-aware interpretability approach for survival modeling, with broad applicability across time-to-event prediction tasks."

    "abstract": "We computed Lyapunov times ($T_L$) for a sample of trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) and outer main-belt asteroids (MBAs) using three numerical approaches: the variational method and two implementations of the renormalization technique. For each object, $T_L$ was derived both from the nominal orbit and from ensembles of 1001 orbital clones, enabling direct comparison between single-orbit and ensemble-based estimates. Across the sample, the methods generally produced consistent results, though larger discrepancies were observed for some MBAs. TNOs, in contrast, displayed greater consistency across methods, likely due to fewer overlapping resonances. Importantly, clone ensembles provided more robust and reliable stability indicators than nominal-orbit computations. Median values from clone populations reduced method-dependent biases and revealed dynamical behaviors that would remain hidden in single-orbit analyses, especially for objects with poorly constrained orbits or evolving in resonant regions. While our study focused on a limited but diverse set of objects, the methodology can be directly extended to larger populations, offering a systematic framework for exploring the long-term stability and dynamical evolution of main-belt asteroids, trans-Neptunian objects or other classes of objects in the Solar System."

    "abstract": "The prevalence of malicious packages in open-source repositories, such as PyPI, poses a critical threat to the software supply chain. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising tool for automated security tasks, their effectiveness in detecting malicious packages and indicators remains underexplored. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of 13 LLMs for detecting malicious software packages. Using a curated dataset of 4,070 packages (3,700 benign and 370 malicious), we evaluate model performance across two tasks: binary classification (package detection) and multi-label classification (identification of specific malicious indicators). We further investigate the impact of prompting strategies, temperature settings, and model specifications on detection accuracy. We find a significant \"granularity gap\" in LLMs' capabilities. While GPT-4.1 achieves near-perfect performance in binary detection (F1 $\\approx$ 0.99), performance degrades by approximately 41\\% when the task shifts to identifying specific malicious indicators. We observe that general models are best for filtering out the majority of threats, while specialized coder models are better at detecting attacks that follow a strict, predictable code structure. Our correlation analysis indicates that parameter size and context width have negligible explanatory power regarding detection accuracy. We conclude that while LLMs are powerful detectors at the package level, they lack the semantic depth required for precise identification at the granular indicator level."

This paper studies optimal retirement decumulation in an individual tontine account with an MBG overlay under international diversification and systematic longevity risk. The retiree chooses withdrawals and asset allocation dynamically to trade off expected total withdrawals (EW) against the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) of terminal wealth, subject to realistic investment constraints. The optimization is solved under a plan-to-live convention, while stochastic mortality affects outcomes through its impact on mortality credits at the pool level. We develop a neural-network based computational approach for the resulting high-dimensional, constrained control problem. The MBG is priced ex post under the induced EW--CVaR optimal policy via a simulation-based actuarial rule that combines expected guarantee costs with a prudential tail buffer. Using long-horizon historical return data expressed in real domestic-currency terms, we find that international diversification and longevity pooling jointly deliver the largest improvements in the EW--CVaR trade-off, while stochastic mortality shifts the frontier modestly in the expected direction. The optimal controls use foreign equity primarily as a state-dependent catch-up instrument, and implied MBG loads are driven mainly by tail outcomes (and the chosen prudential buffer) rather than by mean payouts."

First, I analyze standard coreference evaluations and show that their design often leads to non-generalizable conclusions due to issues of measurement validity - including contestedness (multiple, competing definitions of coreference) and convergent validity (evaluation results that rank models differently across benchmarks). Second, I propose and implement a novel evaluation focused on testing systems' ability to infer the relative plausibility of events, a key aspect of resolving coreference. Through this extended evaluation, I find that contemporary language models demonstrate strong performance on standard benchmarks - improving over earlier baseline systems within certain domains and types of coreference - but remain sensitive to the evaluation conditions: they often fail to generalize in ways one would expect a human to be capable of when evaluation contexts are slightly modified. Taken together, these findings clarify both the strengths, such as improved accuracy over baselines on widely used evaluations, and the limitations of the current NLP paradigm, including weaknesses in measurement validity, and suggest directions for future work in developing better evaluation methods and more genuinely generalizable systems."

Unlike one-off panels, which represent the population in a single snapshot, permanent assemblies enable shifting participation across multiple rounds. This structure offers a powerful framework for ensuring that different groups of individuals are represented over time across successive panels. In particular, it allows smaller groups of individuals that may not warrant representation in every individual panel to be represented across a sequence of them. We formalize this temporal sortition framework by requiring proportional representation both within each individual panel and across the sequence of panels. Building on the work of Ebadian and Micha (2025), we consider a setting in which the population lies in a metric space, and the goal is to achieve both proportional representation, ensuring that every group of citizens receives adequate representation, and individual fairness, ensuring that each individual has an equal probability of being selected. We extend the notion of representation to a temporal setting by requiring that every initial segment of the panel sequence, viewed as a cumulative whole, proportionally reflects the structure of the population. We present algorithms that provide varying guarantees of proportional representation, both within individual panels and across any sequence of panels, while also maintaining individual fairness over time."

An adaptive penalty method is developed to ensure safety while balancing optimality. Trajectories from previous iterations are utilized to learn a value function using normalizing flows, which enables richer uncertainty modeling compared to Gaussian priors. SIT-LMPC is designed for highly parallel execution on graphics processing units, allowing efficient real-time optimization.

    "abstract": "Physics-informed neural networks and neural operators often suffer from severe optimization difficulties caused by ill-conditioned gradients, multi-scale spectral behavior, and stiffness induced by physical constraints. Recently, the Muon optimizer has shown promise by performing orthogonalized updates in the singular-vector basis of the gradient, thereby improving geometric conditioning. However, its unit-singular-value updates may lead to overly aggressive steps and lack explicit stability guarantees when applied to physics-informed learning. In this work, we propose SpecMuon, a spectral-aware optimizer that integrates Muon's orthogonalized geometry with a mode-wise relaxed scalar auxiliary variable (RSAV) mechanism. By decomposing matrix-valued gradients into singular modes and applying RSAV updates individually along dominant spectral directions, SpecMuon adaptively regulates step sizes according to the global loss energy while preserving Muon's scale-balancing properties. This formulation interprets optimization as a multi-mode gradient flow and enables principled control of stiff spectral components. We establish rigorous theoretical properties of SpecMuon, including a modified energy dissipation law, positivity and boundedness of auxiliary variables, and global convergence with a linear rate under the Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition. Numerical experiments on physics-informed neural networks, DeepONets, and fractional PINN-DeepONets demonstrate that SpecMuon achieves faster convergence and improved stability compared with Adam, AdamW, and the original Muon optimizer on benchmark problems such as the one-dimensional Burgers equation and fractional partial differential equations."

    "abstract": "Discovering the unknown governing equations of grid-connected inverters from external measurements holds significant attraction for analyzing modern inverter-intensive power systems. However, existing methods struggle to balance the identification of unmodeled nonlinearities with the preservation of physical consistency. To address this, this paper proposes a Physics-Informed Sparse Machine Learning (PISML) framework. The architecture integrates a sparse symbolic backbone to capture dominant model skeletons with a neural residual branch that compensates for complex nonlinear control logic. Meanwhile, a Jacobian-regularized physics-informed training mechanism is introduced to enforce multi-scale consistency including large/small-scale behaviors. Furthermore, by performing symbolic regression on the neural residual branch, PISML achieves a tractable mapping from black-box data to explicit control equations. Experimental results on a high-fidelity Hardware-in-the-Loop platform demonstrate the framework's superior performance. It not only achieves high-resolution identification by reducing error by over 340 times compared to baselines but also realizes the compression of heavy neural networks into compact explicit forms. This restores analytical tractability for rigorous stability analysis and reduces computational complexity by orders of magnitude. It also provides a unified pathway to convert structurally inaccessible devices into explicit mathematical models, enabling stability analysis of power systems with unknown inverter governing equations."

The fluid is subject to a uniform gravitational field and capillary forces acting along the free boundary. The interface between the fluid and the surrounding air is a free surface whose motion is driven by gravity, surface tension, and the fluid velocity field. The triple-phase intersections where the fluid, the air above the vessel, and the solid vessel wall meet are referred to as contact points, and the angles formed there are called contact angles. The model under consideration incorporates boundary conditions that allow for full motion of the contact points and dynamic contact angles. Under these conditions, \\cite{Yang} established the existence of equilibrium configurations for the model. These equilibria consist of a quiescent fluid occupying a domain whose upper boundary can be represented as the graph of a function in polar coordinates, minimizing a gravity-capillary energy functional subject to a fixed mass constraint. The equilibrium contact angles may take any value in $(0,π)$ depending on the choice of capillary parameters. In the present work, we develop a framework of a priori estimates for this model. We prove that, for initial data sufficiently close to equilibrium, the system admits global solutions that converge exponentially fast to a (horizontally) shifted equilibrium state."

Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) addresses this issue by optimizing the worst-case expected loss over an uncertainty set of distributions, offering a principled approach to robustness. Meanwhile, as training data in DRO always involves sensitive information, safeguarding it against leakage under Differential Privacy (DP) is essential. In contrast to classical DP-ERM, DP-DRO has received much less attention due to its minimax optimization structure with uncertainty constraint. To bridge the gap, we provide a comprehensive study of DP-(finite-sum)-DRO with $ψ$-divergence and non-convex loss. First, we study DRO with general $ψ$-divergence by reformulating it as a minimization problem, and develop a novel $(\\varepsilon, δ)$-DP optimization method, called DP Double-Spider, tailored to this structure. Under mild assumptions, we show that it achieves a utility bound of $\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}+ (\\frac{\\sqrt{d \\log (1/δ)}}{n \\varepsilon})^{2/3})$ in terms of the gradient norm, where $n$ denotes the data size and $d$ denotes the model dimension. We further improve the utility rate for specific divergences. In particular, for DP-DRO with KL-divergence, by transforming the problem into a compositional finite-sum optimization problem, we develop a DP Recursive-Spider method and show that it achieves a utility bound of $\\mathcal{O}((\\frac{\\sqrt{d \\log(1/δ)}}{n\\varepsilon})^{2/3} )$, matching the best-known result for non-convex DP-ERM.

For the purpose of proving the existence of a multiplicative control forcing the solution rest at a time $T>0$, we need to establish the decay property of solutions for the system without control first. We have obtained decay estimates for the $L^\\infty$-norm and the $H^1$-norm of solutions to the homogenous quasilinear parabolic equations. Notably, the decay of the $L^\\infty$-norm requires no smallness condition on the initial data, whereas the decay of the $H^1$-norm requires that the $L^\\infty$-norm remains small. Based on the decay estimates and maximum modulus estimate of solutions to quasilinear parabolic equations, together with the local null controllability of quasilinear parabolic equations under additive controls, we prove the null controllability of the quasilinear parabolic equations via multiplicative controls. As a byproduct, we also obtain the global null controllability for large time to the quasilinear parabolic equations via additive controls. Given that the controllability under multiplicative control is achieved over a long time horizon, we finally investigate the existence of time optimal control."

A key contribution is a variational formulation that makes the DGP to deep neural network (DNN) correspondence explicit: maximizing the DGP evidence lower bound (ELBO) is equivalent to training DNNs with weight decay and Monte Carlo (MC) dropout. This yields fast mini-batch stochastic optimization without Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), while providing principled uncertainty quantification through MC-dropout forward passes as approximate posterior draws, producing calibrated credible surfaces for prediction and spatial effect estimation. Across simulations, DNC is competitive with existing spatial factor models, particularly under strong nonstationarity and complex cross-dependence, while delivering substantial computational gains. In a multivariate environmental case study, DNC captures spatially varying cross-variable interactions, produces interpretable maps of multivariate outcomes, and scales uncertainty quantification to large datasets with orders-of-magnitude reductions in runtime."

Upon slip, we update internal forces computed in the null space of the grasp via a quadratic program that preserves the object wrench while enforcing actuation limits. The pipeline yields a theoretical sensing-to-command latency of 35-40 ms, with 5 ms for PzR-based contact and geometry updates and about 4 ms for the quadratic program solve. In controlled trials, slip onset is detected at 20ms. We demonstrate closed-loop stabilization on multifingered grasps under external perturbations. Augmenting efficient analytic force control with learned tactile cues yields both robustness and rapid reactions, as confirmed in our end-to-end evaluation.

    "abstract": "Approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search is widely used in the retrieval stage of large-scale recommendation systems. In this stage, candidate items are indexed using their learned embedding vectors, and ANN search is executed for each user (or item) query to retrieve a set of relevant items. However, ANN-based retrieval has two key limitations. First, item embeddings and their indices are typically learned in separate stages: indexing is often performed offline after embeddings are trained, which can yield suboptimal retrieval quality-especially for newly created items. Second, although ANN offers sublinear query time, it must still be run for every request, incurring substantial computation cost at industry scale. In this paper, we propose MultiFaceted Learnable Index (MFLI), a scalable, real-time retrieval paradigm that learns multifaceted item embeddings and indices within a unified framework and eliminates ANN search at serving time. Specifically, we construct a multifaceted hierarchical codebook via residual quantization of item embeddings and co-train the codebook with the embeddings. We further introduce an efficient multifaceted indexing structure and mechanisms that support real-time updates. At serving time, the learned hierarchical indices are used directly to identify relevant items, avoiding ANN search altogether. Extensive experiments on real-world data with billions of users show that MFLI improves recall on engagement tasks by up to 11.8\\%, cold-content delivery by up to 57.29\\%, and semantic relevance by 13.5\\% compared with prior state-of-the-art methods.

Although chemical functionalization can significantly enhance graphene-water interfacial thermal conductance, it often degrades graphene's intrinsic in-plane phonon transport. In this work, we perform a systematic deep neural network molecular dynamics study comparing edge-functionalized graphene nanoribbons with surface-functionalized graphene in aqueous environments. We demonstrate that functionalizing only 10% of the ribbon edges with hydroxyl groups increases the graphene-water interfacial thermal conductance by more than eightfold, primarily due to strengthened interfacial interactions and improved wettability at the edges. In contrast to basal-plane oxidation, edge functionalization largely preserves in-plane thermal conductivity. Importantly, hydroxyl edge groups exert competing effects on phonon transport: they introduce additional boundary scattering that suppresses heat conduction, while simultaneously passivating dangling bonds at bare edges, thereby reducing phonon localization and edge-induced scattering. This competition leads to a non-monotonic dependence of in-plane thermal conductivity on edge functionalization ratio. These results establish edge functionalization as an effective strategy for enhancing graphene-water interfacial thermal transport without sacrificing intrinsic phonon transport properties."

Unlike traditional abstract graphs, our purpose is not only to retrieve and distinguish variations in the connectivity structure of the data but also geometric differences of the network branches. Our proposed approach relies on the extraction of a specifically curated and explicit set of topological, geometric and directional features, designed to satisfy key invariance properties. We leverage the resulting feature representation for tasks such as group comparison, clustering and classification on cohorts of shape graphs. The effectiveness of this representation is evaluated on several real-world datasets including urban road/street networks, neuronal traces and astrocyte imaging. These results are benchmarked against several alternative methods, both feature-based and not."

    "abstract": "Vibration from an erroneous disturbance harms the manufactured components and lowers the output quality of an FDM printer. For moving machinery, vibration analysis and control are crucial. Additive manufacturing is the basis of 3D printing, which utilizes mechanical movement of the extruder to fabricate objects, and faults occur due to unwanted vibrations. Therefore, it is vital to examine the vibration patterns of a 3D printer. In this work, we observe these parameters of an FDM printer, exemplified by the MakerBot Method X. To analyze the system, it is necessary to understand the motion it generates and select appropriate sensors to detect those motions. The sensor measurement values can be used to determine the condition of the printer. We used an accelerometer and an acoustic sensor to measure the vibration and sound produced by the printer. The outputs from these sensors were examined individually. The findings show that vibration occurs at relatively low levels during continuous motion because it mainly appears at component transition edges. Due to abrupt acceleration and deceleration during zigzag motion, vibration reaches its peak."

    "abstract": "Online media platforms often need to measure how frequently users are exposed to specific content attributes in order to evaluate trade-offs in A/B experiments. A direct approach is to sample content, label it using a high-quality rubric (e.g., an expert-reviewed LLM prompt), and estimate impression-weighted prevalence. However, repeatedly running such labeling for every experiment arm and segment is too costly and slow to serve as a default measurement at scale. We present a scalable \\emph{surrogate-based prevalence measurement} framework that decouples expensive labeling from per-experiment evaluation. The framework calibrates a surrogate signal to reference labels offline and then uses only impression logs to estimate prevalence for arbitrary experiment arms and segments. We instantiate this framework using \\emph{score bucketing} as the surrogate: we discretize a model score into buckets, estimate bucket-level prevalences from an offline labeled sample, and combine these calibrated bucket level prevalences with the bucket distribution of impressions in each arm to obtain fast, log-based estimates. Across multiple large-scale A/B tests, we validate that the surrogate estimates closely match the reference estimates for both arm-level prevalence and treatment--control deltas. This enables scalable, low-latency prevalence measurement in experimentation without requiring per-experiment labeling jobs."

    "abstract": "Code translation, the automatic conversion of programs between languages, is a growing use case for Large Language Models (LLMs). However, direct one-shot translation often fails to preserve program intent, leading to errors in control flow, type handling, and I/O behavior. We propose an algorithm-based pipeline that introduces a language-neutral intermediate specification to capture these details before code generation. This study empirically evaluates the extent to which structured planning can improve translation accuracy and reliability relative to direct translation. We conduct an automated paired experiment - direct and algorithm-based to translate between Python and Java using five widely used LLMs on the Avatar and CodeNet datasets. For each combination (model, dataset, approach, and direction), we compile and execute the translated program and run the tests provided. We record compilation results, runtime behavior, timeouts (e.g., infinite loop), and test outcomes. We compute accuracy from these tests, counting a translation as correct only if it compiles, runs without exceptions or timeouts, and passes all tests. We then map every failed compile-time and runtime case to a unified, language-aware taxonomy and compare subtype frequencies between the direct and algorithm-based approaches. Overall, the Algorithm-based approach increases micro-average accuracy from 67.7% to 78.5% (10.8% increase). It eliminates lexical and token errors by 100%, reduces incomplete constructs by 72.7%, and structural and declaration issues by 61.1%. It also substantially lowers runtime dependency and entry-point failures by 78.4%. These results demonstrate that algorithm-based pipelines enable more reliable, intent-preserving code translation, providing a foundation for robust multilingual programming assistants."

However, since a separate INR must be overfit for each video, scaling to high-resolution videos while maintaining encoding efficiency remains a significant challenge. Hypernetwork-based approaches predict INR weights (hyponetworks) for unseen videos at high speeds, but with low quality, large compressed size, and prohibitive memory needs at higher resolutions. We address these fundamental limitations through three key contributions: (1) an approach that decomposes the weight prediction task spatially and temporally, by breaking short video segments into patch tubelets, to reduce the pretraining memory overhead by 20$\\times$; (2) a residual-based storage scheme that captures only differences between consecutive segment representations, significantly reducing bitstream size; and (3) a temporal coherence regularization framework that encourages changes in the weight space to be correlated with video content. Our proposed method, TeCoNeRV, achieves substantial improvements of 2.47dB and 5.35dB PSNR over the baseline at 480p and 720p on UVG, with 36% lower bitrates and 1.5-3$\\times$ faster encoding speeds. With our low memory usage, we are the first hypernetwork approach to demonstrate results at 480p, 720p and 1080p on UVG, HEVC and MCL-JCV.

    "abstract": "Latent space models are widely used for analyzing high-dimensional discrete data matrices, such as patient-feature matrices in electronic health records (EHRs), by capturing complex dependence structures through low-dimensional embeddings. However, estimation becomes challenging in the imbalanced regime, where one matrix dimension is much larger than the other. In EHR applications, cohort sizes are often limited by disease prevalence or data availability, whereas the feature space remains extremely large due to the breadth of medical coding system. Motivated by the increasing availability of external semantic embeddings, such as pre-trained embeddings of clinical concepts in EHRs, we propose a knowledge-embedded latent projection model that leverages semantic side information to regularize representation learning. Specifically, we model column embeddings as smooth functions of semantic embeddings via a mapping in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We develop a computationally efficient two-step estimation procedure that combines semantically guided subspace construction via kernel principal component analysis with scalable projected gradient descent. We establish estimation error bounds that characterize the trade-off between statistical error and approximation error induced by the kernel projection. Furthermore, we provide local convergence guarantees for our non-convex optimization procedure. Extensive simulation studies and a real-world EHR application demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "Fast weight architectures offer a promising alternative to attention-based transformers for long-context modeling by maintaining constant memory overhead regardless of context length. However, their potential is limited by the next-token prediction (NTP) training paradigm. NTP optimizes single-token predictions and ignores semantic coherence across multiple tokens following a prefix. Consequently, fast weight models, which dynamically update their parameters to store contextual information, learn suboptimal representations that fail to capture long-range dependencies. We introduce REFINE (Reinforced Fast weIghts with Next sEquence prediction), a reinforcement learning framework that trains fast weight models under the next-sequence prediction (NSP) objective. REFINE selects informative token positions based on prediction entropy, generates multi-token rollouts, assigns self-supervised sequence-level rewards, and optimizes the model with group relative policy optimization (GRPO). REFINE is applicable throughout the training lifecycle of pre-trained language models: mid-training, post-training, and test-time training. Our experiments on LaCT-760M and DeltaNet-1.3B demonstrate that REFINE consistently outperforms supervised fine-tuning with NTP across needle-in-a-haystack retrieval, long-context question answering, and diverse tasks in LongBench. REFINE provides an effective and versatile framework for improving long-context modeling in fast weight architectures."

The dynamics is described by the Schrödinger equation on a curved spatial background and, when included, by minimal coupling to a magnetic vector potential incorporating an Aharonov--Bohm flux. After separation of variables, the problem reduces to a one-dimensional radial eigenvalue equation governed by an effective potential that combines torsion-induced Coulomb-like and centrifugal-like structures with magnetic/flux-dependent terms and optional model interactions. Because closed-form analytic solutions are not reliable over the parameter ranges required for systematic scans, we compute spectra and eigenfunctions numerically by formulating the radial equation as a self-adjoint Sturm--Liouville problem and solving it with a finite-difference discretization on a truncated radial domain, with explicit convergence control. We analyze four representative scenarios: (i) no external potential, (ii) Cornell-type confinement, (iii) Kratzer-type interaction, and (iv) the small-oscillation regime around the minimum of a Morse potential. We present systematic trends of the low-lying levels as functions of the torsion parameter, magnetic field, and azimuthal sector, and we show that geometric couplings alone can produce effective confinement even in the absence of an external interaction."

We introduce SynthBH, a synthetic-powered multiple testing procedure that safely leverages such synthetic data. We prove that SynthBH guarantees finite-sample, distribution-free FDR control under a mild PRDS-type positive dependence condition, without requiring the pooled-data p-values to be valid under the null. The proposed method adapts to the (unknown) quality of the synthetic data: it enhances the sample efficiency and may boost the power when synthetic data are of high quality, while controlling the FDR at a user-specified level regardless of their quality. We demonstrate the empirical performance of SynthBH on tabular outlier detection benchmarks and on genomic analyses of drug-cancer sensitivity associations, and further study its properties through controlled experiments on simulated data."

Here the data points are partitioned into groups and the task is to choose a prescribed number of data points from each group, called centers, while minimizing the maximum distance from any point to its closest center. Although a polynomial-time $3$-approximation is known for this problem in general metrics, it has remained open whether this approximation guarantee is tight or could be further improved, especially since the unconstrained $k$-center problem admits a polynomial-time factor-$2$ approximation. We resolve this open question by proving that, for every $ε>0$, achieving a $(3-ε)$-approximation is NP-hard, assuming $\\text{P} \\neq \\text{NP}$. Our inapproximability results hold even when only two disjoint groups are present and at least one center must be chosen from each group. Further, it extends to the canonical one-per-group setting with $k$-groups (for arbitrary $k$), where exactly one center must be selected from each group. Consequently, the factor-$3$ barrier for fair $k$-center in general metric spaces is inherent, and existing $3$-approximation algorithms are optimal up to lower-order terms even in these restricted regimes. This result stands in sharp contrast to the $k$-supplier formulation, where both the unconstrained and fair variants admit factor-$3$ approximation in polynomial time."

To resolve this dilemma, we propose VETime, the first TSAD framework that unifies temporal and visual modalities through fine-grained visual-temporal alignment and dynamic fusion. VETime introduces a Reversible Image Conversion and a Patch-Level Temporal Alignment module to establish a shared visual-temporal timeline, preserving discriminative details while maintaining temporal sensitivity. Furthermore, we design an Anomaly Window Contrastive Learning mechanism and a Task-Adaptive Multi-Modal Fusion to adaptively integrate the complementary perceptual strengths of both modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VETime significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in zero-shot scenarios, achieving superior localization precision with lower computational overhead than current vision-based approaches.

First is Clustering-Neighborhood Stability Measure (clustering-NSM), an internal measure of clustering quality -- a function of a clustering of a dataset -- that we show to be predictive of ANNS accuracy. The second, Point-Neighborhood Stability Measure (point-NSM), is a measure of clusterability -- a function of the dataset itself -- that is predictive of clustering-NSM. The two together allow us to determine whether a dataset is searchable by clustering-based ANNS given only the data points.

However, recent efforts to extend alignment to other languages often require substantial resources, either through large-scale, high-quality supervision in the target language or through pairwise alignment with high-resource languages, which limits scalability. In this work, we propose a resource-efficient method for improving multilingual safety alignment. We introduce a plug-and-play Multi-Lingual Consistency (MLC) loss that can be integrated into existing monolingual alignment pipelines. By improving collinearity between multilingual representation vectors, our method encourages directional consistency at the multilingual semantic level in a single update. This allows simultaneous alignment across multiple languages using only multilingual prompt variants without requiring additional response-level supervision in low-resource languages. We validate the proposed method across different model architectures and alignment paradigms, and demonstrate its effectiveness in enhancing multilingual safety with limited impact on general model utility. Further evaluation across languages and tasks indicates improved cross-lingual generalization, suggesting the proposed approach as a practical solution for multilingual consistency alignment under limited supervision."

    "abstract": "The nearly scale-invariant primordial power spectrum provides the standard initial conditions for cosmological perturbations. However, the largest scales remain only weakly constrained by CMB observations, leaving room for deviations such as an infrared (IR) cut-off. This possibility is further motivated by the persistence of large-scale CMB anomalies, most notably the low quadrupole power. In this work, we revisit several broad classes of phenomenologically motivated IR cut-off scenarios using parametrised functional forms of the primordial power spectrum. We confront these models with the latest CMB, BAO, and supernova data and derive updated constraints on the cut-off scale and associated features. Our results remain consistent with earlier studies, showing that although such models suppress power at low multipoles, the improvement in fit is marginal and does not overcome the associated parameter penalties. We therefore find no statistically significant evidence favouring IR cut-off models over the standard power-law spectrum with current data. We further explore the interplay between IR cut-off features and a possible increase in the reionisation optical depth, motivated by the recent CMB-BAO tension highlighted by DESI DR2 within the $Λ$CDM framework. We show that the additional freedom introduced by large-scale suppression is generally insufficient to support a substantial increase in optical depth, owing to the weak statistical preference for suppressed large-scale temperature power. Finally, we examine the implications of IR cut-off models for large-scale CMB anomalies by analysing the corresponding anomaly statistics within a Bayesian framework."

Depending on the case, however, detrimental processes can be less amplified than the desired couplings. We leverage this observation to improve the fidelity for preparing Bell-type entangled states between two bosonic modes in the presence of noise and losses. We also investigate noise models for which the protocol either fails or partially achieves a loss-tolerant state preparation speedup. Our work facilitates faster preparation of complex quantum states and implementation of entangling gates in the presence of decoherence mechanisms."

    "abstract": "Medical ultrasound (US) imaging is a frontline tool for the diagnosis of kidney diseases. However, traditional freehand imaging procedure suffers from inconsistent, operator-dependent outcomes, lack of 3D localization information, and risks of work-related musculoskeletal disorders. While robotic ultrasound (RUS) systems offer the potential for standardized, operator-independent 3D kidney data acquisition, the existing scanning methods lack the ability to determine the optimal imaging window for efficient imaging. As a result, the scan is often blindly performed with excessive probe footprint, which frequently leads to acoustic shadowing and incomplete organ coverage. Consequently, there is a critical need for a spatially efficient imaging technique that can maximize the kidney coverage through minimum probe footprint. Here, we propose an autonomous workflow to achieve efficient kidney imaging via template-guided optimal pivoting. The system first performs an explorative imaging to generate partial observations of the kidney. This data is then registered to a kidney template to estimate the organ pose. With the kidney localized, the robot executes a fixed-point pivoting sweep where the imaging plane is aligned with the kidney long axis to minimize the probe translation. The proposed method was validated in simulation and in-vivo. Simulation results indicate that a 60% exploration ratio provides optimal balance between kidney localization accuracy and scanning efficiency. In-vivo evaluation on two male subjects demonstrates a kidney localization accuracy up to 7.36 mm and 13.84 degrees. Moreover, the optimal pivoting approach shortened the probe footprint by around 75 mm when compared with the baselines. These results valid our approach of leveraging anatomical templates to align the probe optimally for volumetric sweep."

The system consists of two stages: the phase selector of RIS and the extraction of respiration rate. To mitigate synchronization-induced common phase drifts, the difference of Möbius transformation (DMT) is integrated into the deep learning framework, named DMTNet, to jointly configure multiple active RIS elements. Notably, the training data are generated in simulation without collecting real-world measurements, and the resulting phase selector is validated experimentally. For sensing, multi-antenna measurements are fused by the DC-offset calibration and the DeepMining-MMV processing with CA-CFAR detection and Newton's refinements. Prototype experiments indicate that active RIS deployment improves respiration detectability while simultaneously enabling higher-order modulation; without RIS, respiration detection is unreliable and only lower-order modulation is supported."

This study focuses on tension twins during uniaxial compression of Mg-Y alloys, with three key aspects: the orientation specificity of twin grains, the relative evolution of CRSS with increasing Y content, and the local stress and strain evolution at twin sites. Experimental characterization and crystal plasticity modeling were performed. In Mg-7wt.%Y, TT2-{112-1} tension twins were observed in addition to the common TT1-{101-2} twins. Increasing Y suppressed TT1 formation while promoting TT2 activity. A previously unreported group of crystallographic orientations with a higher global Schmid factor for <c+a> slip was identified, which exhibited TT1 twinning with increasing compression strain. To elucidate Y effects on twin activity and local mechanical fields, both TT1 and TT2 tension twin modes were incorporated into PRISMS-Plasticity, an open-source, finite element-based crystal plasticity solver. Four binary Mg-Y alloys were modeled under compression, and statistical analysis was conducted to correlate initial orientations, stress-strain distributions, and twin activities as functions of Y concentration. The plasticity analysis revealed that increasing Y decreases the CRSS ratio of prismatic and pyramidal slip relative to TT1 twinning, while the slip-to-twin CRSS ratio for TT2 increases, thereby serving as a potential indicator of differential twin activity with Y addition in Mg alloys. Additionally, despite their small volume fraction, TT2 twin sites were predicted higher local strain accumulation locally, relative to the representative volume element and TT1 twins, suggesting their potential influence on localized phenomena such as recrystallization or twin nucleation. These findings provide insight into local mechanical behavior in Mg alloys and support alloy design for advanced engineering applications."

We use U.S. worker-level data to estimate employment and wage differences by gender and by mobility/strength impairments in construction and non-construction jobs. We also use occupational-level data to examine variations in workforce composition, physical skill requirements, and earnings across detailed construction occupations. Regression estimates indicate that being a woman and having strength and mobility impairments are associated with substantial employment and pay gaps in construction compared to non-construction jobs. Further analysis shows a high negative correlation between the representation of women and the ability levels required in those occupations. Finally, we discuss several wearable exoskeletons under development for people with upper-body and lower-body impairments, focusing on how these innovations could be integrated into construction jobs. These findings suggest that wearable exoskeletons that enhance manual dexterity, balance, and strength may improve the representation of women and people with disabilities in some of the higher-paying occupations in construction."

While the excitonic coupling is treated as a static parameter in many cases, structural dynamics can introduce time-dependence on the excitonic coupling. However, influence of the dynamics of excitonic coupling on the exciton transfer has been scarcely understood. In the present study, exciton transfer under dynamical fluctuation in excitonic coupling was investigated via combined use of non-adiabatic molecular dynamics simulations, exciton density analysis, and a simple two-state model, for inter-ligand exciton transfer in bis(dipyrrinato)Zn(II) as the example case. The reaction coordinate for the exciton transfer was obtained a posteriori via regression analysis where the target and explanatory variables are diabatic energy gaps and atomic displacements, respectively. The results suggest that dynamical angular fluctuation between the two dipyrrinato ligands incidentally increase the excitonic coupling, accelerating the exciton transfer between the ligands."

    "abstract": "Abstracting from a low level to a more explanatory high level of description, and ideally while preserving causal structure, is fundamental to scientific practice, to causal inference problems, and to robust, efficient and interpretable AI. We present a general account of abstractions between low and high level models as natural transformations, focusing on the case of causal models. This provides a new formalisation of causal abstraction, unifying several notions in the literature, including constructive causal abstraction, Q-$τ$ consistency, abstractions based on interchange interventions, and `distributed' causal abstractions. Our approach is formalised in terms of category theory, and uses the general notion of a compositional model with a given set of queries and semantics in a monoidal, cd- or Markov category; causal models and their queries such as interventions being special cases. We identify two basic notions of abstraction: downward abstractions mapping queries from high to low level; and upward abstractions, mapping concrete queries such as Do-interventions from low to high. Although usually presented as the latter, we show how common causal abstractions may, more fundamentally, be understood in terms of the former. Our approach also leads us to consider a new stronger notion of `component-level' abstraction, applying to the individual components of a model. In particular, this yields a novel, strengthened form of constructive causal abstraction at the mechanism-level, for which we prove characterisation results. Finally, we show that abstraction can be generalised to further compositional models, including those with a quantum semantics implemented by quantum circuits, and we take first steps in exploring abstractions between quantum compositional circuit models and high-level classical causal models as a means to explainable quantum AI."

    "abstract": "The growing demand for large language models (LLMs) requires serving systems to handle many concurrent requests with diverse service level objectives (SLOs). This exacerbates head-of-line (HoL) blocking during the compute-intensive prefill phase, where long-running requests monopolize resources and delay higher-priority ones, leading to widespread time-to-first-token (TTFT) SLO violations. While chunked prefill enables interruptibility, it introduces an inherent trade-off between responsiveness and throughput: reducing chunk size improves response latency but degrades computational efficiency, whereas increasing chunk size maximizes throughput but exacerbates blocking. This necessitates an adaptive preemption mechanism. However, dynamically balancing execution granularity against scheduling overheads remains a key challenge. In this paper, we propose FlowPrefill, a TTFT-goodput-optimized serving system that resolves this conflict by decoupling preemption granularity from scheduling frequency. To achieve adaptive prefill scheduling, FlowPrefill introduces two key innovations: 1) Operator-Level Preemption, which leverages operator boundaries to enable fine-grained execution interruption without the efficiency loss associated with fixed small chunking; and 2) Event-Driven Scheduling, which triggers scheduling decisions only upon request arrival or completion events, thereby supporting efficient preemption responsiveness while minimizing control-plane overhead. Evaluation on real-world production traces shows that FlowPrefill improves maximum goodput by up to 5.6$\\times$ compared to state-of-the-art systems while satisfying heterogeneous SLOs."

    "abstract": "Trajectory estimation involves determining the trajectory of a mobile robot by combining prior knowledge about its dynamic model with noisy observations of its state obtained using sensors. The accuracy of such a procedure is dictated by the system model fidelity and the sensor parameters, such as the accuracy of the sensor (as represented by its noise covariance) and the rate at which it can generate observations, referred to as the sensor query schedule. Intuitively, high-rate measurements from accurate sensors lead to accurate trajectory estimation. However, cost and resource constraints limit the sensor accuracy and its measurement rate. Our work's novel contribution is the estimation of sensor schedules and sensor covariances necessary to achieve a specific estimation accuracy. Concretely, we focus on estimating: (i) the rate or schedule with which a sensor of known covariance must generate measurements to achieve specific estimation accuracy, and alternatively, (ii) the sensor covariance necessary to achieve specific estimation accuracy for a given sensor update rate. We formulate the problem of estimating these sensor parameters as semidefinite programs, which can be solved by off-the-shelf solvers. We validate our approach in simulation and real experiments by showing that the sensor schedules and the sensor covariances calculated using our proposed method achieve the desired trajectory estimation accuracy. Our method also identifies scenarios where certain estimation accuracy is unachievable with the given system and sensor characteristics."

To address this, we propose a training-free Inference-Time Subspace Alignment framework.

Experiments show this effectively calibrates inference, allowing foundation models to leverage reasoning without sacrificing ID-grounded accuracy."

This establishes the analogue of the Dyson and Lieb-Yngvason theorems for the Bose-Hubbard gas.

In particular, it is independent of other features of the underlying Bravais lattice."

Selected candidate actions are evaluated with batched critic forwards and stored in an LRU cache keyed by a quantized state projection and local action identifiers, dramatically reducing redundant critic computation while preserving decision quality via conservative k-hop cache invalidation.

    "abstract": "First-order phase transitions are commonly associated with a discontinuous behavior of some of the thermodynamic variables and the presence of a latent heat. In the present study it is shown that this is not necessarily the case. Using standard thermodynamics, the general characteristics of phase transitions are investigated, considering an arbitrary number of conserved particle species and coexisting phases, and an arbitrary set of state variables. It is found that there exist two different possible types of realizations of a phase transition. In the first type, one has the immediate replacement of a single phase with another one. As a consequence, some of the global extensive variables indeed behave discontinuously. In the second type, one has instead the gradual (dis-) appearance of a single phase over a range of the state variables. This leads to a continuous behavior of the (global) basic thermodynamic variables. Furthermore, in this case it is not possible to define a latent heat in a trivial manner. It is derived that the latter (former) case happens if the number of extensive state variables used is larger or equal (lower) than the number of coexisting phases. The choice of the state variables thus place a crucial role for the qualitative properties of the phase transition."

While recent deep learning approaches have advanced this field, they are typically optimized and evaluated using native sequence recovery, which is a limited surrogate for structural fidelity, since different sequences can fold into similar 3D structures and high recovery does not necessarily indicate correct folding. To address this limitation, we propose RIDER, an RNA Inverse DEsign framework with Reinforcement learning that directly optimizes for 3D structural similarity. First, we develop and pre-train a GNN-based generative diffusion model conditioned on the target 3D structure, achieving a 9% improvement in native sequence recovery over state-of-the-art methods. Then, we fine-tune the model with an improved policy gradient algorithm using four task-specific reward functions based on 3D self-consistency metrics. Experimental results show that RIDER improves structural similarity by over 100% across all metrics and discovers designs that are distinct from native sequences."

We present a direct formulation in the continuum, and establish how this formulation captures the scaling limit of the discrete version. In the continuum, QSSEP emerges as a non-commutative process, driven by free increments, conditioned on the algebra of functions on the ambiant space to encode spatial correlations. We actually develop a more general framework dealing with conditioned orbits with free increments which may find applications beyond the present context. We view this construction as a preliminary step toward formulating a quantum extension of the macroscopic fluctuation theory."

The key innovation is a residual-based pressure stabilization scheme derived by reformulating the Laplacian drag force in the momentum equation as a weighted advection term involving the nonlinear Poisson--Boltzmann equation, thereby eliminating second-order derivative terms while maintaining theoretical rigor. Well-posedness of the coupled stabilized problem is established using the Banach and Brouwer fixed-point theorems under sufficiently small data assumptions, and optimal a priori error estimates are derived in the energy norm with convergence rates of order $\\mathcal{O}(h^k)$ for approximation degree $k \\geq 1$. Numerical experiments on diverse polygonal meshes -- including distorted elements, non-convex polygons, Voronoi tessellations, and configurations with hanging nodes -- confirm optimal convergence rates, validating theoretical predictions. Applications to electro-osmotic flows in nanopore sensors with complex obstacle geometries illustrate the method's practical utility for engineering simulations. Compared to Taylor--Hood finite element formulations, the equal-order approach simplifies implementation through uniform polynomial treatment of all fields and offers native support for general polygonal elements."

In this paper, we show that for a broad class of jointly distributed random variables $(X,Y)$ the Ingleton inequality holds up to a small additive error, even even though the mutual information between $X$ and $Y$ is far from being extractable. Contrary to common intuition, strongly non-extractable mutual information does not lead to large violations of the Ingleton inequality in this setting. More precisely, we consider pairs $(X,Y)$ that are uniformly distributed on their joint support and whose associated biregular bipartite graph is an expander. For all auxiliary random variables $A$ and $B$ jointly distributed with $(X,Y)$, we establish a lower bound on the Ingleton quantity $I(X:Y | A) + I(X:Y | B) + I(A:B) - I(X:Y)$ in terms of the spectral parameters of the underlying graph.

    "abstract": "Massive O-type stars lose a significant fraction of their mass through radiation-driven winds, a process that critically shapes their evolution and feedback into the interstellar medium. Accurate predictions of mass-loss rates are essential for models of stellar structure and population synthesis. We computed wind parameters for O-type stars using a self-consistent approach that couples the hydrodynamics of the wind with detailed calculations of the line acceleration. This approach follows the theory of radiation-driven stellar winds and allows us to derive mass-loss rate distributions for different atomic configurations of the stellar flux. We used the TLUSTY code for stellar atmosphere models to compute non-local thermodynamic equilibrium models; these models served as input radiation fields for the calculation of the line-force parameters, for which we used the LOCUS code. These line-force parameters were then iteratively coupled with the HYDWIND code to solve the wind hydrodynamics. The procedure was applied across a grid of stellar parameters for three chemical configurations. We obtain self-consistent wind parameters for a broad set of O-type stellar models. The results show a systematic decrease in mass-loss rates with the inclusion of more elements in the radiation field, which is attributed to a strong effect on the UV region of the spectral energy distribution. As more elements are included, resulting in a larger number of spectral lines, the contribution from the UV diminishes, leading to lower mass-loss rates. We fitted three theoretical prescriptions for $\\dot{M}$ using a Bayesian approach; this yielded Pearson correlation values greater than 0.92 for all three model grids. It also allowed for the estimation of the wind momentum-luminosity relationships for each of the grids, yielding results similar to those based on observations of O-type stars."

The proposed framework adopts a hierarchical architecture in which a service provider adjusts hourly incentive rates based on wholesale electricity prices and aggregated residential load. The financial interests of both the service provider and end users are explicitly considered. A deep reinforcement learning approach is employed to learn optimal real-time incentive rates under explicit capacity constraints. Heterogeneous user preferences are modelled through appliance-level home energy management systems and dissatisfaction costs. Using real-world residential electricity consumption and price data from three households, simulation results show that the proposed approach effectively reduces peak demand and smooths the aggregated load profile. This leads to an approximately 22.82% reduction in the peak-to-average ratio compared to the no-demand-response case."

In this study, we investigate commonly used loss functions, deriving novel regret bounds that characterize when Bayes-optimal decisions for these objectives must diverge. Our results reveal a fundamental trade-off between the two objectives of (1) fingerprint similarity and (2) molecular retrieval. Optimizing for more accurate fingerprint predictions typically worsens retrieval results, and vice versa. Our theoretical analysis shows this trade-off depends on the similarity structure of candidate sets, providing guidance for loss function and fingerprint selection."

GA$^2$Ms add selected pairwise interactions which improves accuracy, but sacrifices interpretability and limits model auditing. We propose \\emph{Conditionally Additive Local Models} (CALMs), a new model class, that balances the interpretability of GAMs with the accuracy of GA$^2$Ms. CALMs allow multiple univariate shape functions per feature, each active in different regions of the input space. These regions are defined independently for each feature as simple logical conditions (thresholds) on the features it interacts with. As a result, effects remain locally additive while varying across subregions to capture interactions. We further propose a principled distillation-based training pipeline that identifies homogeneous regions with limited interactions and fits interpretable shape functions via region-aware backfitting. Experiments on diverse classification and regression tasks show that CALMs consistently outperform GAMs and achieve accuracy comparable with GA$^2$Ms. Overall, CALMs offer a compelling trade-off between predictive accuracy and interpretability."

    "abstract": "Analytical diffusion models offer a mathematically transparent path to generative modeling by formulating the denoising score as an empirical-Bayes posterior mean. However, this interpretability comes at a prohibitive cost: the standard formulation necessitates a full-dataset scan at every timestep, scaling linearly with dataset size. In this work, we present the first systematic study addressing this scalability bottleneck. We challenge the prevailing assumption that the entire training data is necessary, uncovering the phenomenon of Posterior Progressive Concentration: the effective golden support of the denoising score is not static but shrinks asymptotically from the global manifold to a local neighborhood as the signal-to-noise ratio increases. Capitalizing on this, we propose Dynamic Time-Aware Golden Subset Diffusion (GoldDiff), a training-free framework that decouples inference complexity from dataset size. Instead of static retrieval, GoldDiff uses a coarse-to-fine mechanism to dynamically pinpoint the ''Golden Subset'' for inference. Theoretically, we derive rigorous bounds guaranteeing that our sparse approximation converges to the exact score. Empirically, GoldDiff achieves a $\\bf 71 \\times$ speedup on AFHQ while matching or achieving even better performance than full-scan baselines. Most notably, we demonstrate the first successful scaling of analytical diffusion to ImageNet-1K, unlocking a scalable, training-free paradigm for large-scale generative modeling."

Previously overlooked aspects are uncovered and linked to the nonequilibrium and nonconservative nature of the interaction. Specifically, we examine a behavior that can be understood by characterizing the underlying physical processes in terms of a motional-induced effective temperature. This phenomenon shares similarities with the Fulling-Davies-Unruh effect, opening new perspectives for the understanding of nonequilibrium physics at work in the system."

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without exposing clients' private data, and has been widely adopted in privacy-sensitive scenarios. However, FL faces two critical security threats: curious servers that may launch inference attacks to reconstruct clients' private data, and compromised clients that can launch poisoning attacks to disrupt model aggregation. Existing solutions mitigate these attacks by combining mainstream privacy-preserving techniques with defensive aggregation strategies. However, they either incur high computation and communication overhead or perform poorly under non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data settings. To tackle these challenges, we propose SRFed, an efficient Byzantine-robust and privacy-preserving FL framework for Non-IID scenarios. First, we design a decentralized efficient functional encryption (DEFE) scheme to support efficient model encryption and non-interactive decryption. DEFE also eliminates third-party reliance and defends against server-side inference attacks. Second, we develop a privacy-preserving defensive model aggregation mechanism based on DEFE. This mechanism filters poisonous models under Non-IID data by layer-wise projection and clustering-based analysis. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments show that SRFed outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in privacy protection, Byzantine robustness, and efficiency."

Reliably modeling dynamic obstacles and optimizing collision-free trajectories under perceptive and control uncertainty are challenging. This article focuses on revealing tight connection between reactive planning and dynamic mapping for manipulators from a model-based perspective. To enable efficient particle-based perception with expressively dynamic property, we present a tensorized particle weight update scheme that explicitly maintains obstacle velocities and covariance meanwhile. Building upon this dynamic representation, we propose an obstacle-aware MPPI-based planning formulation that jointly propagates robot-obstacle dynamics, allowing future system motion to be predicted and evaluated under uncertainty. The model predictive method is shown to significantly improve safety and reactivity with dynamic surroundings. By applying our complete framework in simulated and noisy real-world environments, we demonstrate that explicit modeling of robot-obstacle dynamics consistently enhances performance over state-of-the-art MPPI-based perception-planning baselines avoiding multiple static and dynamic obstacles."

    "abstract": "While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities for reasoning and self-correction at the textual level, these strengths provide minimal benefits for complex tasks centered on visual perception, such as Chart Parsing. Existing models often struggle with visually dense charts, leading to errors like data omission, misalignment, and hallucination. Inspired by the human strategy of using a finger as a ``visual anchor'' to ensure accuracy when reading complex charts, we propose a new paradigm named Visual Self-Refine (VSR). The core idea of VSR is to enable a model to generate pixel-level localization outputs, visualize them, and then feed these visualizations back to itself, allowing it to intuitively inspect and correct its own potential visual perception errors. We instantiate the VSR paradigm in the domain of Chart Parsing by proposing ChartVSR. This model decomposes the parsing process into two stages: a Refine Stage, where it iteratively uses visual feedback to ensure the accuracy of all data points' Pixel-level Localizations, and a Decode Stage, where it uses these verified localizations as precise visual anchors to parse the final structured data. To address the limitations of existing benchmarks, we also construct ChartP-Bench, a new and highly challenging benchmark for chart parsing. Our work also highlights VSR as a general-purpose visual feedback mechanism, offering a promising new direction for enhancing accuracy on a wide range of vision-centric tasks."

We derive analytic expressions for the momentum broadening distributions to first order in the opacity expansion, and perform a numerical investigation to quantify their impact.

    "abstract": "Ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) enables ultra-low-power connectivity by allowing passive backscatter devices (BDs) to convey information through reflection of ambient signals. However, the cascaded AmBC channel suffers from severe double path loss and multiplicative fading, while accurate channel state information (CSI) acquisition is highly challenging due to the weak backscattered signal and the resource-limited nature of BDs. To address these challenges, this paper considers an AmBC system in which the reader is equipped with a pixel-based fluid antenna system (FAS). By dynamically selecting one antenna position from a dense set of pixels within a compact aperture, the FAS-enabled reader exploits spatial diversity through measurement-driven port selection, without requiring explicit CSI acquisition or multiple RF chains. The intrinsic rate-energy tradeoff at the BD is also incorporated by jointly optimizing the backscatter modulation coefficient under an energy harvesting (EH) neutrality constraint. To efficiently solve this problem, a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based framework is developed to jointly determine the FAS port selection and modulation coefficient on an optimize-then-average (OTA) basis. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme significantly improves the achievable rate compared with conventional single-antenna readers, with gains preserved under imperfect observations, stringent EH constraints, and different pixel spacings."

Although the association between black hole mechanics and black hole thermodynamics is well-established, the comprehensive geometric formulation of thermodynamic variables deserves further investigation. In this work, both Newman-Penrose (NP) and Geroch-Held-Penrose (GHP) formalisms are considered within the framework of horizon thermodynamics. We show that the NP formalism reformulates the horizon condition as the Penrose-Rindler equation. In this context, a Smarr-like formula for stationary black holes is recovered from the Penrose-Rindler equation reinterpreted as a horizon equilibrium of pressures, which includes a pressure associated with the horizon rotation. A complete geometric reformulation of this reinterpretation of the Penrose-Rindler equation evaluated at the horizon is developed within the GHP formalism. The GHP approach further inspires the introduction of the horizon-averaged matter pressure and its conjugate volume, thereby enabling a quasi-local realization of the Smarr-like formula for stationary black holes. This geometric formulation clarifies the connection between horizon dynamics and thermodynamics and offers a unified setting for extending black hole thermodynamics beyond spherical symmetry."

Using the narrow-width approximation, we further extract the branching fractions of the corresponding two-body decays $B^+\\to D_s^+R$. Our results are consistent with the available experimental measurements and previous theoretical studies.

However, conventional implementations suffer from ``percussion smearing,'' a well-known artifact that significantly degrades the quality of percussive components. We attribute this artifact to a fundamental time-scale mismatch between the temporally smeared magnitude spectrogram and the localized, newly generated phase. To address this, we propose SELEBI, a signal-adaptive phase vocoder algorithm that significantly reduces percussion smearing while preserving stability and the perfect reconstruction property. Unlike conventional methods that rely on heuristic processing or component separation, our approach leverages the nonstationary Gabor transform. By dynamically adapting analysis window lengths to assign short windows to intervals containing significant energy associated with percussive components, we directly compute a temporally localized magnitude spectrogram from the time-domain signal. This approach ensures greater consistency between the temporal structures of the magnitude and phase. Furthermore, the perfect reconstruction property of the nonstationary Gabor transform guarantees stable, high-fidelity signal synthesis, in contrast to previous heuristic approaches. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively mitigates percussion smearing and yields natural sound quality."

In this paper, to eliminate this error-propagation problem, we propose an algorithm that reconstructs the residual signal directly. The proposed method takes advantage of the high-frequency characteristics of the modulo samples and the sparsity of both the residual signal and its difference. Simulation results show that the proposed method reconstructs the original signal more accurately than a conventional method based on the differences of the residual signal."

Concretely, we investigate a modified version of the Qi-Wu-Zhang model and develop a procedure to smoothly shrink the width of the system in one direction. By tracking gaps which remain open throughout the modulation, we establish a smooth transition from a two-dimensional to a one-dimensional topological insulator. In between the system exhibits both one- and two-dimensional topology, and the way the system accomplishes the transition is by making the one-dimensional topology more robust as the width decreases, while the two-dimensional topology becomes less robust.

Yet consumer devices exhibit volatile computational availability due to competing applications and unpredictable usage patterns. This volatility poses a fundamental challenge: how can we quantify the probability that a device, or ensemble of devices, will maintain the processing rate required by a streaming service? This paper presents an analytical framework for computational reliability in XEC, defined as the probability that instantaneous capacity meets demand at a specified Quality of Service (QoS) threshold. We derive closed-form reliability expressions under two information regimes: Minimal Information (MI), requiring only declared operational bounds, and historical data, which refines estimates via Maximum Likelihood Estimation from past observations. The framework extends to multi-device deployments, providing reliability expressions for series, parallel, and partitioned workload configurations. We derive optimal workload allocation rules and analytical bounds for device selection, equipping orchestrators with tractable tools to evaluate deployment feasibility and configure distributed streaming systems. We validate the framework using real-time object detection with YOLO11m model as a representative DI streaming workload; experiments on emulated XED environments demonstrate close agreement between analytical predictions, Monte Carlo sampling, and empirical measurements across diverse capacity and demand configurations."

    "abstract": "Our understanding of the oceans remains limited by sparse and infrequent observations, primarily because current methods are constrained by the high cost and logistical effort of underwater monitoring, relying either on sporadic surveys across broad areas or on long-term measurements at fixed locations. To overcome these limitations, monitoring systems must enable persistent and autonomous operations without the need for continuous surface support. Despite recent advances, resident underwater vehicles remain uncommon due to persistent challenges in autonomy, robotic resilience, and mechanical robustness, particularly under long-term deployment in harsh and remote environments. This work addresses these problems by presenting the development, deployment, and operation of a resident infrastructure using a docking station with a mini-class Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) at 90m depth. The ROVis equipped with enhanced onboard processing and perception, allowing it to autonomously navigate using USBL signals, dock via ArUco marker-based visual localisation fused through an Extended Kalman Filter, and carry out local inspection routines. The system demonstrated a 90% autonomous docking success rate and completed full inspection missions within four minutes, validating the integration of acoustic and visual navigation in real-world conditions. These results show that reliable, untethered operations at depth are feasible, highlighting the potential of resident ROV systems for scalable, cost-effective underwater monitoring."

Herein, SPOI-AE was trained and tested on \\textit{in vivo} mouse lymph node sPA images with unknown ground truth chromophore concentrations. SPOI-AE better reconstructs input sPA pixels than conventional algorithms while providing biologically coherent estimates for optical parameters, chromophore concentrations, and the percent oxygen saturation of tissue.

SCAR estimates both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters by aligning aerial images with 2D--3D correspondences derived from publicly available orthophotos and elevation models. In contrast to existing approaches that rely on dedicated calibration maneuvers or manually surveyed ground control points, our method leverages external geospatial data to detect and correct calibration degradation under field deployment conditions. We evaluate our approach on six large-scale aerial campaigns conducted over two years under diverse seasonal and environmental conditions. Across all sequences, SCAR consistently outperforms established baselines (Kalibr, COLMAP, VINS-Mono), reducing median reprojection error by a large margin, and translating these calibration gains into substantially lower visual localization rotation errors and higher pose accuracy. These results demonstrate that SCAR provides accurate, robust, and reproducible calibration over long-term aerial operations without the need for manual intervention."

For companies developing such applications, this entails extensive investment in highly skilled personnel or costly outsourcing. This research work aims to demonstrate that enhancing feature extractors can substantially alleviate this challenge, enabling models to learn more effective representations with less labeled data. Utilizing a self-supervised learning strategy, we present a model trained on unlabeled data that outperforms state-of-the-art feature extractors pre-trained on ImageNet and particularly designed for object detection tasks. Moreover, the results demonstrate that our approach encourages the model to focus on the most relevant aspects of an object, thus achieving better feature representations and, therefore, reinforcing its reliability and robustness."

We initiate the study of one-factorizations of complete multipartite graphs subject to distance constraints. The problem of decomposing $K_{n\\times g}$ into the largest subgraphs with minimum distance three is investigated. It is proved that, for $n\\le g$, the complete multipartite graph $K_{n\\times g}$ can be decomposed into $g^2$ copies of the largest subgraphs with minimum distance three.

One class of benchmarks evaluates memorization by testing recall of past conversations or text but fails to capture how memory is used to guide future decisions. Another class focuses on agents acting in single-session tasks without the need for long-term memory. However, in realistic settings, memorization and action are tightly coupled: agents acquire memory while interacting with the environment, and subsequently rely on that memory to solve future tasks. To capture this setting, we introduce MemoryArena, a unified evaluation gym for benchmarking agent memory in multi-session Memory-Agent-Environment loops. The benchmark consists of human-crafted agentic tasks with explicitly interdependent subtasks, where agents must learn from earlier actions and feedback by distilling experiences into memory, and subsequently use that memory to guide later actions to solve the overall task. MemoryArena supports evaluation across web navigation, preference-constrained planning, progressive information search, and sequential formal reasoning, and reveals that agents with near-saturated performance on existing long-context memory benchmarks like LoCoMo perform poorly in our agentic setting, exposing a gap in current evaluations for agents with memory."

Loop closure detection between perceptual inputs of different robotic agents is easily compromised in the context of perceptual aliasing, or when perspectives differ significantly. For this reason, direct mutual observation among robots is a powerful way to connect partial SLAM graphs, but often relies on the presence of calibrated arrays of fiducial markers (e.g., AprilTag arrays), which severely limits the range of observations and frequently fails under sharp lighting conditions, e.g., reflections or overexposure. In this work, we propose a novel solution to this problem leveraging recent advances in Deep-Learning-based 6D pose estimation. We feature markerless pose estimation as part of a decentralized multi-robot SLAM system and demonstrate the benefit to the relative localization accuracy among the robotic team. The solution is validated experimentally on data recorded in a test field campaign on a planetary analogous environment."

In their seminal work in 1989, Karp, Luby, and Madras solved this problem in time $O(n/\\varepsilon^2)$ in an oracle model where each object $X_i$ can be accessed via three types of queries: obtain the volume of $X_i$, sample a random point from $X_i$, and test whether $X_i$ contains a given point $x$. This running time was recently shown to be optimal [Bringmann, Larsen, Nusser, Rotenberg, and Wang, SoCG'25]. In another line of work, Meel, Vinodchandran, and Chakraborty [PODS'21] designed algorithms that read the objects in one pass using polylogarithmic time per object and polylogarithmic space; this can be phrased as a dynamic algorithm supporting insertions of objects for union volume estimation in the oracle model. In this paper, we study algorithms for union volume estimation in the oracle model that support both insertions and deletions of objects. We obtain the following results: - an algorithm supporting insertions and deletions in polylogarithmic update and query time and linear space (this is the first such dynamic algorithm, even for 2D triangles); - an algorithm supporting insertions and suffix queries (which generalizes the sliding window setting) in polylogarithmic update and query time and space; - an algorithm supporting insertions and deletions of convex bodies of constant dimension in polylogarithmic update and query time and space."

    "abstract": "Achieving cooperation among self-interested agents remains a fundamental challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning. Recent work showed that mutual cooperation can be induced between \"learning-aware\" agents that account for and shape the learning dynamics of their co-players. However, existing approaches typically rely on hardcoded, often inconsistent, assumptions about co-player learning rules or enforce a strict separation between \"naive learners\" updating on fast timescales and \"meta-learners\" observing these updates. Here, we demonstrate that the in-context learning capabilities of sequence models allow for co-player learning awareness without requiring hardcoded assumptions or explicit timescale separation. We show that training sequence model agents against a diverse distribution of co-players naturally induces in-context best-response strategies, effectively functioning as learning algorithms on the fast intra-episode timescale. We find that the cooperative mechanism identified in prior work-where vulnerability to extortion drives mutual shaping-emerges naturally in this setting: in-context adaptation renders agents vulnerable to extortion, and the resulting mutual pressure to shape the opponent's in-context learning dynamics resolves into the learning of cooperative behavior. Our results suggest that standard decentralized reinforcement learning on sequence models combined with co-player diversity provides a scalable path to learning cooperative behaviors."

The optoelectronic properties of the sensors were analyzed, including single-photoelectron gain calibration and dark count rate measurements, to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio. By embedding wavelength-shifting fibers to enhance light collection efficiency, the system was configured into a three-fold coincidence telescope. The angular distribution of the cosmic ray muon flux was measured to validate the detector's stability and geometric acceptance. Fitting the experimental data to a $\\bm{\\cos^n(θ)}$ distribution yielded an angular exponent of $\\bm{n = 1.44 \\pm 0.06}$, consistent with literature values.

    "abstract": "Darwinian evolution requires (i) heritable records, (ii) repeatable copying with variation, and (iii) routine irreversibility. Categorical quantum mechanics (CQM) makes precise why ``copy'' and ``delete'' are not generic quantum operations: they exist only for a realized \\emph{classical data} sector (a preferred basis/observable; a commutative structure). Decoherence explains how a pointer basis can be selected dynamically, but it does not by itself select a unique outcome. This motivates a neutral presentation of the main ontological options (unique-history, decohered multiplicity, agent-relative facticity, and a stochastic foundation with variable diffusion). We also note the relevance of the ``agency constraint'' argued by Adlam-McQueen-Waegell: in a strictly coherent, basis-unselected ``purely quantum'' regime, minimal agency fails due to no-cloning and linearity, which sharpens the role of classical resources for record-based processes. Extended Wigner's Friend scenarios then serve as a stress test, since they treat ``friends'' simultaneously as coherent quantum systems and as agents possessing stable records. Finally, a stochastic-mechanics foundation (with variable diffusion) offers a continuous bridge between quantum and classical regimes, and suggests a principled way to implement measurement update as conditioning plus a time-symmetric minimal-change rule."

Benchmarks for these agents must both reliably compare models and yield on-policy training data. Prior agentic benchmarks (e.g., tau-bench, tau2-bench, AppWorld) rely on fully deterministic backends, which are costly to build and iterate. We propose Proxy State-Based Evaluation, an LLM-driven simulation framework that preserves final state-based evaluation without a deterministic database. Specifically, a scenario specifies the user goal, user/system facts, expected final state, and expected agent behavior, and an LLM state tracker infers a structured proxy state from the full interaction trace. LLM judges then verify goal completion and detect tool/user hallucinations against scenario constraints. Empirically, our benchmark produces stable, model-differentiating rankings across families and inference-time reasoning efforts, and its on-/off-policy rollouts provide supervision that transfers to unseen scenarios. Careful scenario specification yields near-zero simulator hallucination rates as supported by ablation studies. The framework also supports sensitivity analyses over user personas. Human-LLM judge agreement exceeds 90%, indicating reliable automated evaluation. Overall, proxy state-based evaluation offers a practical, scalable alternative to deterministic agentic benchmarks for industrial LLM agents."

However, existing multimodal fusion methods face significant challenges. First, they often rely on computationally expensive models, limiting their applicability in low-resource environments. Second, they often employ cascaded attention modules, which potentially increase risk of information loss during inter-module transitions and hinder their capacity to effectively capture robust shared representations across modalities. This restricts their generalization in multi-disease analysis tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a Hybrid Parallel-Fusion Cascaded Attention Network (HyPCA-Net), composed of two core novel blocks: (a) a computationally efficient residual adaptive learning attention block for capturing refined modality-specific representations, and (b) a dual-view cascaded attention block aimed at learning robust shared representations across diverse modalities. Extensive experiments on ten publicly available datasets exhibit that HyPCA-Net significantly outperforms existing leading methods, with improvements of up to 5.2% in performance and reductions of up to 73.1% in computational cost.

Such observations allow quantitative tests of the Kerr paradigm and of possible deviations from the no-hair theorem. In scalar-tensor extensions of gravity, black holes may possess primary scalar hair, introducing an additional independent parameter beyond mass and spin. In this work, we construct rotating black hole solutions with primary scalar hair in beyond Horndeski gravity and analyze their photon regions and shadow formation. We show that the scalar hair parameter $Q$ induces characteristic modifications of the shadow, and in particular negative $Q$ enlarges the shadow and reduces its oblateness, while positive $Q$ shrinks and enhances its distortion. Modeling M87* within this framework and imposing the EHT bounds on $θ_d$ and $ΔC$, we determine the viable $(a,Q)$ parameter space. We find that current observations do not exclude rotating black holes with primary scalar hair, although the allowed region is significantly restricted for $Q>0$. Finally, the scalar-hair-induced deviations are of order $\\mathcal{O}(μ\\mathrm{as})$, placing them near the sensitivity threshold of present instruments and within reach of next-generation horizon-scale imaging."

While prior work characterises cutting overhead largely in terms of subcircuit counts and sampling complexity, its end-to-end impact on iterative, estimator-driven training pipelines remains insufficiently measured from a systems perspective. In this paper, we propose a cut-aware estimator execution pipeline that treats circuit cutting as a staged distributed workload and instruments each estimator query into partitioning, subexperiment generation, parallel execution, and classical reconstruction phases. Using logged runtime traces and learning outcomes on two binary classification workloads (Iris and MNIST), we quantify cutting overheads, scaling limits, and sensitivity to injected stragglers, and we evaluate whether accuracy and robustness are preserved under matched training budgets. Our measurements show that cutting introduces substantial end-to-end overheads that grow with the number of cuts, and that reconstruction constitutes a dominant fraction of per-query time, bounding achievable speed-up under increased parallelism. Despite these systems costs, test accuracy and robustness are preserved in the measured regimes, with configuration-dependent improvements observed in some cut settings. These results indicate that practical scaling of circuit cutting for learning workloads hinges on reducing and overlapping reconstruction and on scheduling policies that account for barrier-dominated critical paths."

    "abstract": "Recently, the superconducting diode effect (SDE), characterized by unequal critical currents in opposite directions, has been observed experimentally and predicted theoretically in models of bulk superconductors and Josephson junctions (JJs). In this work, we construct a Josephson junction using a recently discovered unconventional coplanar magnet, the $p$-wave magnet (PM), with proximity-induced superconductivity, and demonstrate the emergence of a Josephson diode effect (JDE). The barrier region is formed by another unconventional collinear magnet, namely an altermagnet (AM). We illustrate that apart from time-reversal and inversion symmetries, the mirror operation $M_{yz}$ emerges as the key symmetry constraint. Also, unlike earlier models that realize the JDE using unconventional magnets, this setup does not require Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) or different superconductors across the junction. Moreover, we demonstrate that the realization of the JDE in this framework requires only minimal conditions while maintaining high performance. The effect remains robust across a broad parameter regime, and thus making the system particularly promising for applications in quantum circuits and computing technologies."

The local bound on nonlocal predictability is defined as the maximum probability with which one observer can correctly predict the other's measurement outcome prior to measurement. We show that product states always meet this bound, while all pure entangled states and some classically correlated states can exceed it. This demonstrates a nonlocal phenomenon since the predictability of measurement outcomes increases after the measurement. Perfect nonlocal predictability for arbitrary projective measurements occurs only for maximally entangled states among all pure states, underscoring their special role. Comparing pure entangled states with their dephased versions, we find that dephasing on one subsystem can enhance nonlocal predictability for a broad class of states and measurements - a counterintuitive, noise-induced advantage that vanishes for maximally entangled states under any projective measurement."

Each leg is modeled as a deformable continuum using discrete Cosserat rod theory, enabling the capture of large bending deformations, distributed elasticity, tendon actuation, and ground contact interactions. A modular whole-body modeling framework is introduced, in which compliant leg dynamics are represented through physically consistent reaction forces applied to a rigid torso, providing a scalable interface between continuum soft limbs and rigid-body locomotion dynamics. This formulation allows efficient whole-body simulation and real-time control without sacrificing physical fidelity. The proposed model is embedded into a convex model predictive control framework that optimizes ground reaction forces over a 0.495 s prediction horizon and maps them to tendon actuation through a physics-informed force-angle relationship. The resulting controller achieves asymptotic stability under diverse perturbations. The framework is experimentally validated on a physical prototype during crawling and walking gaits, achieving high accuracy with less than 5 mm RMSE in center of mass trajectories. These results demonstrate a generalizable approach for integrating continuum soft legs into model-based locomotion control, advancing scalable and reusable modeling and control methods for soft quadruped robots."

We are interested in subsets $S$ of $E$ that control $X$ in the sense that we can induce any given solution $x \\in X$ as an optimum for any given objective function $c \\in \\mathcal{C}$ by adding linear terms to $c$ on the coordinates corresponding to $S$. This problem has many applications, e.g., when $X$ corresponds to the set of all traffic flows, the ability to control implies that one is able to induce all target flows by imposing tolls on the edges in $S$. Our first result shows the equivalence between controllability and identifiability. If $X$ is convex, or if $X$ consists of binary vectors, then $S$ controls $X$ if and only if the restriction of $x$ to $S$ uniquely determines $x$ among all solutions in $X$. In the convex case, we further prove that the family of controlling sets forms a matroid. This structural insight yields an efficient algorithm for computing minimum-weight controlling sets from a description of the affine hull of $X$. While the equivalence extends to matroid base families, the picture changes sharply for other discrete domains. We show that when $X$ is equal to the set of $s$-$t$-paths in a directed graph, deciding whether an identifying set of a given cardinality exists is $Σ\\mathsf{_2^P}$-complete. The problem remains $\\mathsf{NP}$-hard even on acyclic graphs. For acyclic instances, however, we obtain an approximation guarantee by proving a tight bound on the gap between the smallest identifying sets for $X$ and its convex hull, where the latter corresponds to the $s$-$t$-flow polyhedron."

The key new ingredient is a family of carefully chosen subsets of the shrinking targets studied by Kleinbock-Strömbergsson-Yu, together with a short-range mixing estimate for the associated hitting events. Our method also works for the analogous weighted problem where the relevant supremum norms are replaced by certain weighted quasi-norms."

However, in many practical scenarios, arbitrary restrictions induced by exogenous stochasticity might be placed on a player's action set. To model this setting, for a game $\\mathcal{G}_{\\mathrm{orig}}$ with action set $A_i$ for each player $i$, we introduce the corresponding Game with Stochastic Action Sets (GSAS) which is parametrized by a probability distribution over the players' set of possible action subsets $\\mathcal{S}_i \\subseteq 2^{\\vert A_i\\vert}\\backslash\\{\\varnothing\\}$. In a GSAS, players' strategies and Nash equilibria (NE) admit prohibitively large representations, thus existing algorithms for NE computation scale poorly. Under the assumption that action availabilities are independent between players, we show that NE in two-player zero-sum (2p0s) GSAS can be compactly represented by a vector of size $\\vert A_i\\vert$, overcoming naive exponential sized representation of equilibria. Computationally, we introduce an efficient approach based on sleeping internal regret minimization and show that it converges to approximate NE in 2p0s-GSAS at a rate $O(\\sqrt{\\log\\vert A_i\\vert/T})$ with appropriate choice of stepsizes, avoiding the exponential blow-up of game-dependent constants."

Alternatively, we explore fine-tuning an existing OCR model, despite not being trained for the target languages. Through extensive evaluation on multilingual Indic OCR benchmarks and deployment-oriented metrics, we find that the second strategy consistently achieves better accuracy-latency trade-offs.

Together, these systems achieve SOTA performance and provide practical guidance for building production-scale OCR pipelines in the Indian context."

Existing approaches often abstract adaptation objectives as a reward function and steer diffusion models to generate high-reward samples. However, these approaches can incur high computational overhead due to additional training, or rely on stringent assumptions on the reward such as differentiability. Moreover, despite their empirical success, theoretical justification and guarantees are seldom established. In this paper, we propose DOIT (Doob-Oriented Inference-time Transformation), a training-free and computationally efficient adaptation method that applies to generic, non-differentiable rewards. The key framework underlying our method is a measure transport formulation that seeks to transport the pre-trained generative distribution to a high-reward target distribution. We leverage Doob's $h$-transform to realize this transport, which induces a dynamic correction to the diffusion sampling process and enables efficient simulation-based computation without modifying the pre-trained model. Theoretically, we establish a high probability convergence guarantee to the target high-reward distribution via characterizing the approximation error in the dynamic Doob's correction. Empirically, on D4RL offline RL benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while preserving sampling efficiency."

First, this work identifies a set of modules showing consistent and local activation changes under an inference workload through activation-based analysis. Subsequently, we transplant an internal module that is properly activated for a specific task into the target model, leading to immediate and measurable functional changes without additional training or fine-tuning. To experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of the transplant technique, we quantify the relationship between transplant strength and performance improvement under different conditions for two language models. In the cross-generation setting, we find that transplanting activation-selected modules can substantially improve the underperforming model, reaching up to twice the target baseline and achieving gap-based recovery above 100%. Moreover, in transplant experiments between a base model and its instruction-tuned counterpart, transplantation improves the underperforming model toward the stronger baseline, yielding up to about 2.33 times the target baseline with gap-based recovery reaching up to 100% in the best case. These results show that meaningful capacity transfer can be realized through the implantation of highly localized modules implied by language models. Overall, this work provides empirical evidence for task-localized modularity in language models and presents a new research area: model transplantation."

We further elucidate the impact of batch size and model architecture (including depth, parameter count, sparsity, skip connections, and other characteristics) on non-convex optimization. Additionally, we derive a model-agnostic lower bound for the achievable empirical risk, theoretically demonstrating that data determines the fundamental limit of trainability. On the generalization front, we derive deterministic and probabilistic bounds on generalization error based on generalized conditional entropy measures. The former explicitly delineates the range of generalization error, while the latter characterizes the distribution of generalization error relative to the deterministic bounds under independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) sampling conditions. Furthermore, these bounds explicitly quantify the influence of three key factors: (i) information loss induced by irreversibility in the model, (ii) the maximum attainable loss value, and (iii) the generalized conditional entropy of features with respect to labels. Moreover, they offer a unified theoretical lens for understanding the roles of regularization, irreversible transformations, and network depth in shaping the generalization behavior of deep neural networks. Extensive experiments validate all theoretical predictions, confirming the framework's correctness and consistency."

In this paper, we explore how reinforcement learning can be used to compute a class of Euclidean path integrals that yield the thermal density matrix of a quantum system, thereby enabling the computation of the free energy or other thermal expectation values. In particular, we propose a two-step approach with the unique feature that after a variational approximation for a quantity is obtained in a first step, it can then be used to efficiently compute the exact result in a second step.

High-order semantic relations across time steps and modalities are preserved via adaptive hyperedge construction. Empirical results on standard multimodal emotion benchmarks show that EC-Net produces robust, semantically coherent representations and consistently improves accuracy, particularly when modalities are partially available or contaminated by noise. These findings indicate that explicit hierarchical geometry combined with hypergraph fusion is effective for resilient multimodal affect understanding."

    "abstract": "Transformer-based single-object trackers achieve state-of-the-art accuracy but rely on fixed-depth inference, executing the full encoder--decoder stack for every frame regardless of visual complexity, thereby incurring unnecessary computational cost in long video sequences dominated by temporally coherent frames. We propose UncL-STARK, an architecture-preserving approach that enables dynamic, uncertainty-aware depth adaptation in transformer-based trackers without modifying the underlying network or adding auxiliary heads. The model is fine-tuned to retain predictive robustness at multiple intermediate depths using random-depth training with knowledge distillation, thus enabling safe inference-time truncation. At runtime, we derive a lightweight uncertainty estimate directly from the model's corner localization heatmaps and use it in a feedback-driven policy that selects the encoder and decoder depth for the next frame based on the prediction confidence by exploiting temporal coherence in video. Extensive experiments on GOT-10k and LaSOT demonstrate up to 12\\% GFLOPs reduction, 8.9\\% latency reduction, and 10.8\\% energy savings while maintaining tracking accuracy within 0.2\\% of the full-depth baseline across both short-term and long-term sequences."

Inspired by rapid-prototyping in manufacturing, we propose a fast, low-cost evaluation method using Vision-Language Model (VLM) personas to simulate outcomes comparable to field results. While LLMs show human-like reasoning and language capabilities, autonomous vehicle (AV)-pedestrian interaction requires spatial awareness, emotional empathy, and behavioral generation. This raises our research question: To what extent can VLM personas mimic human responses in field studies? We conducted parallel studies: 1) one real-world study with 20 participants, and 2) one video-study using 20 VLM personas, both on a street-crossing task. We compared their responses and interviewed five HCI researchers on potential applications. Results show that VLM personas mimic human response patterns (e.g., average crossing times of 5.25 s vs. 5.07 s) lack the behavioral variability and depth. They show promise for formative studies, field study preparation, and human data augmentation."

Under the assumption that there are worst-case hard languages in NP, we show the following: 1. If all languages in NP have NIZK proofs or arguments satisfying $ ε_c+ε_s+ ε_z < 1 $, then One-Way Functions (OWFs) exist. This covers all possible non-trivial values for these error rates. It additionally implies that if all languages in NP have such NIZK proofs and $ε_c$ is negligible, then they also have NIZK proofs where all errors are negligible.

The proposed design combines a spin-serial and replica-parallel update schedule with a dual-BRAM delay-line architecture, enabling scalable support for fully connected Ising models while eliminating fan-out growth in logic resources. By exploiting SSQA, the architecture achieves fast convergence using only final replica states, significantly reducing memory requirements compared to conventional p-bit-based annealers. Implemented on a Xilinx ZC706 FPGA, the proposed system solves an 800-node MAX-CUT benchmark and achieves up to 50% reduction in energy consumption and over 90\\% reduction in logic resources compared with prior FPGA-based p-bit annealing architectures.

A standard evaluation procedure aggregates multiple responses from LLM agents into a single final answer, often via majority voting, and compares it against reference answers. However, this process can obscure the quality and distributional characteristics of the original responses. In this paper, we propose a novel evaluation framework based on the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) of cosine similarities between generated responses and reference answers. This enables a more nuanced assessment of response quality beyond exact match metrics. To analyze the response distributions across different agent configurations, we further introduce a clustering method for ECDFs using their distances and the $k$-medoids algorithm. Our experiments on a QA dataset demonstrate that ECDFs can distinguish between agent settings with similar final accuracies but different quality distributions. The clustering analysis also reveals interpretable group structures in the responses, offering insights into the impact of temperature, persona, and question topics."

Despite extensive observational work, quantitatively comparing FD morphology across events and linking it to storm severity remains challenging due to heterogeneous station responses, coverage gaps, and the multivariate nature of the network. This work introduces a graph-based event representation in which each FD is mapped to an event network constructed from pairwise dissimilarities between station response time series. A controlled sparse backbone is obtained via the minimum spanning tree, enabling comparable event graphs across cases. From each graph, a compact set of geometric/topological fingerprints is computed, including global integration measures, spectral summaries, mesoscopic structure, centrality aggregates, and complexity descriptors. Predictive skill is assessed using strict leave-one-event-out validation over a pre-defined grid of distance metrics and distance-domain transformations, with selection criteria fixed \\emph{a priori}. The proposed fingerprints exhibit measurable signal for three tasks: (i) multi-class classification of geomagnetic storm intensity (G3/G4/G5) with moderate but consistent performance and errors dominated by adjacent categories; (ii) stronger binary severity screening ($\\ge$G4 vs.\\ G3) with high sensitivity to severe events; and (iii) drop regression with partial least squares achieving positive explained variance relative to a fold-wise mean baseline."

For that we use an approach of Cazenave-Naumkin [19], thus, avoiding any Strichartz estimates. Then, using the pseudo-conformal transformation, we extend the local result to the global one for the initial data with a quadratic phase. Furthermore, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of such global solutions and prove scattering for data with the quadratic phase $e^{ib|x|^2}$ with sufficiently large positive $b$, in $H^1(\\mathbb R)$. One of the advantages of considering an infinite sum in the nonlinearity term is being able to consider exponential nonlinearities, such as $e^{γ|u|^{k}} u$, as well as sine or cosine nonlinearities, and obtain well-posedness in those cases, the first such result for most of those nonlinearities. To conclude, we show numerical simulations for various examples of combined nonlinearities, including the double nonlinearity and an exponential one, then investigate the behavior of solutions with positive or negative initial $b$ in a quadratic phase data. Furthermore, we also show that a ground state in the NLS equation with combined nonlinearities no longer provides a sharp threshold for global behavior such as scattering vs. finite time blow-up, instead the equation has a much richer dynamics."

The PHEOD solitons are completely stable, and, unlike the conventional solitons, they feature oscillatory tails.

Existing approaches face fundamental limitations: they cannot effectively share intelligence across borders due to privacy constraints, lack reasoning capabilities to understand complex multi-step attack patterns, and fail to capture intricate graph-structured relationships in financial networks. We introduce FedGraph-AGI, a novel federated learning framework integrating Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) reasoning with graph neural networks for privacy-preserving cross-border insider threat detection. Our approach combines: (1) federated graph neural networks preserving data sovereignty; (2) Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) aggregation for heterogeneous jurisdictions; and (3) AGI-powered reasoning via Large Action Models (LAM) performing causal inference over graph data. Through experiments on a 50,000-transaction dataset across 10 jurisdictions, FedGraph-AGI achieves 92.3% accuracy, significantly outperforming federated baselines (86.1%) and centralized approaches (84.7%). Our ablation studies reveal AGI reasoning contributes 6.8% improvement, while MoE adds 4.4%. The system maintains epsilon = 1.0 differential privacy while achieving near-optimal performance and scales efficiently to 50+ clients. This represents the first integration of AGI reasoning with federated graph learning for insider threat detection, opening new directions for privacy-preserving cross-border intelligence sharing."

However, its layer-by-layer process remains vulnerable to faults such as nozzle clogging, filament runout, and layer misalignment, which compromise print quality and reliability. Traditional inspection methods are costly, time-intensive, and often limited to post-process analysis, making them unsuitable for real-time intervention. In this current study, the authors developed a novel, low-cost, and portable faultdetection system that leverages multimodal sensor fusion and artificial intelligence for real-time monitoring in FDM-based 3D printing. The system integrates acoustic, vibration, and thermal sensing into a non-intrusive architecture, capturing complementary data streams that reflect both mechanical and process-related anomalies. Acoustic and thermal sensors operate in a fully contactless manner, while the vibration sensor requires minimal attachment such that it will not interfere with printer hardware, thereby preserving portability and ease of deployment. The multimodal signals are processed into spectrograms and time-frequency features, which are classified using convolutional neural networks for intelligent fault detection. The proposed system advances Industry 4.0 objectives by offering an affordable, scalable, and practical monitoring solution that improves faultdetection accuracy, reduces waste, and supports sustainable, adaptive manufacturing."

We introduce GPSBench, a dataset of 57,800 samples across 17 tasks for evaluating geospatial reasoning in LLMs, spanning geometric coordinate operations (e.g., distance and bearing computation) and reasoning that integrates coordinates with world knowledge. Focusing on intrinsic model capabilities rather than tool use, we evaluate 14 state-of-the-art LLMs and find that GPS reasoning remains challenging, with substantial variation across tasks: models are generally more reliable at real-world geographic reasoning than at geometric computations. Geographic knowledge degrades hierarchically, with strong country-level performance but weak city-level localization, while robustness to coordinate noise suggests genuine coordinate understanding rather than memorization. We further show that GPS-coordinate augmentation can improve in downstream geospatial tasks, and that finetuning induces trade-offs between gains in geometric computation and degradation in world knowledge.

This phenomenon arises from additional arithmetic constraints on the mixed areas of lattice polytopes.

Predictive maintenance frameworks increasingly leverage sensor-generated time-series data, yet traditional methods require manual feature engineering, and deep learning models often degrade in online settings with evolving operational patterns. This work presents a semantic-aware, label-efficient continual learning framework for railway fault diagnostics. Accelerometer signals are encoded via a Variational AutoEncoder into latent representations capturing the normal operational structure in a fully unsupervised manner. Importantly, semantic metadata, including axle counts, wheel indexes, and strain-based deformations, is extracted via AI-driven peak detection on fiber Bragg grating sensors (resistant to electromagnetic interference) and fused with the VAE embeddings, enhancing anomaly detection under unknown operational conditions. A lightweight gradient boosting supervised classifier stabilizes anomaly scoring with minimal labels, while a replay-based continual learning strategy enables adaptation to evolving domains without catastrophic forgetting. Experiments show the model detects minor imperfections due to flats and polygonization, while adapting to evolving operational conditions, such as changes in train type, speed, load, and track profiles, captured using a single accelerometer and strain gauge in wayside monitoring."

We present Zone-Adaptive Intrusion Detection (ZAID), a collaborative detection and model-improvement framework for unseen attack types, where \"zero-day\" refers to previously unobserved attack families and behaviours (not vulnerability disclosure timing). ZAID combines a universal convolutional model for generalisable traffic representations, an autoencoder-based reconstruction signal as an auxiliary anomaly score, and lightweight adapter modules for parameter-efficient zone adaptation. To support cross-zone generalisation under constrained connectivity, ZAID uses federated aggregation and pseudo-labelling to leverage locally observed, weakly labelled behaviours. We evaluate ZAID on ToN_IoT using a zero-day protocol that excludes MITM, DDoS, and DoS from supervised training and introduces them during zone-level deployment and adaptation. ZAID achieves up to 83.16% accuracy on unseen attack traffic and transfers to UNSW-NB15 under the same procedure, with a best accuracy of 71.64%. These results indicate that parameter-efficient, zone-personalised collaboration can improve the detection of previously unseen attacks in contested IoBT environments."

Unlike synthetic benchmarks, IndicEval grounds evaluation in real examination standards, enabling realistic measurement of reasoning, domain knowledge, and bilingual adaptability. The framework automates assessment using Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategies and supports modular integration of new models and languages. Experiments conducted on Gemini 2.0 Flash, GPT-4, Claude, and LLaMA 3-70B reveal three major findings. First, CoT prompting consistently improves reasoning accuracy, with substantial gains across subjects and languages. Second, significant cross-model performance disparities persist, particularly in high-complexity examinations. Third, multilingual degradation remains a critical challenge, with marked accuracy drops in Hindi compared to English, especially under Zero-Shot conditions. These results highlight persistent gaps in bilingual reasoning and domain transfer. Overall, IndicEval provides a practice-oriented, extensible foundation for rigorous, equitable evaluation of LLMs in multilingual educational settings and offers actionable insights for improving reasoning robustness and language adaptability."

In this paper, we give a comprehensive answer to long-standing open complexity questions for three types of selection problems and three types of budgeted uncertainty sets. In particular, we demonstrate that the two-stage selection problem with continuous budgeted uncertainty is NP-hard, while the corresponding two-stage representative selection problem is solvable in polynomial time. Our hardness result implies that also the two-stage assignment problem with continuous budgeted uncertainty is NP-hard."

Choosing a pump with a wavelength in the range 2100nm-2210nm and a pulse duration of 5ps, we quantitatively performed simulations targeting a probability of photon pair generation per pulse of 0.05, and we found realistic conditions of utilization (2cm-length straight waveguides, intra-modal Four Wave Mixing with the fundamental TE00 mode) with a pump peak power in between 9.2mW and 32mW. A first design (wCOM) reaches a signal wavelength as high as 3.905um, which is situated in an atmospheric transparency window, while maintaining an idler in the Telecom C-band, making it of high interest for atmospheric Quantum Key Distribution. Two other designs wCH4 and wNO2 aim precise CH4 and NO2 gas sensing with a signal wavelength of 3265nm and 3461nm respectively.

The significant feature of our result is that it does not require any restriction on the size of the flux characterizing the flow. Precisely, by extending and refining an approach initially introduced by J.B. McLeod, we demonstrate the continuous invertibility of the linearized operator at a generic Couette-Poiseuille solution that does not exhibit flow reversal. We then deduce local uniqueness of these solutions as well as their nonlinear structural stability under small external forces. Moreover, we prove the uniqueness of certain class of Couette-Poiseuille solutions ``in the large,\" within the set of solutions possessing natural symmetry. Finally, we bring an example showing that, in general, if the flow reversal assumption is violated, the linearized operator is no longer invertible."

By modeling the wireless channel as a spatially correlated Gaussian random field, channel estimation is formulated as a Gaussian process (GP) regression problem with motion-constrained spatial sampling. Closed-form expressions for the linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) estimator and the corresponding estimation error are derived. A fundamental comparison with discrete port-based architectures is established under identical position constraints, showing that continuous FA sampling achieves equal or lower estimation error for any finite pilot budget, with strict improvement for non-degenerate spatial correlation models. Numerical results validate the analysis and show the performance gains of continuous FA sampling over discrete baselines."

We present a combined dynamic contact angle (DCA) model that merges the geometric accuracy of the generalized Hoffman-Voinov-Tanner law with the kinematic consistency of a Hoffman function-based approach, improving predictions of droplet spreading and receding. We simulate water-glycerol droplet impact on sapphire glass at Weber numbers 20 -- 250 and assess both contact angle formulations. Simulated radial velocity fields are processed in Python using SciPy and compared with Particle Image Velocimetry measurements in the longitudinal section of the spreading droplet. The Hoffman function-based model captures the main droplet kinematic trends and provides more consistent receding dynamics. The generalized Hoffman-Voinov-Tanner law matches the maximum spreading diameter within 7%. However, during receding, it shows a median absolute error in radial velocity up to three times higher than that of the Hoffman function-based solution. Average radial velocity and spreading velocity can differ from experimental trends even when maximum spreading is reproduced. These findings support validation combining geometric and kinematic metrics and motivate the combined model for predicting spreading and receding. Using the maximum spreading factor $β_{max}$ as the ratio of the maximum spreading diameter over the initial droplet diameter and the characteristic capillary number $Ca_{char}$ defined from the mean internal horizontal velocity at 300 micrometer above the substrate, we introduce a $(β_{max},\\,Ca_{char})$ diagram to relate spreading characteristics to internal flow dynamics. We hypothesize that, given sufficient data, the contact-line geometry may be used to estimate internal kinematics."

Existing methods either assume known sound speed, require multiple microphones, or rely on separate calibration, making them impractical for systems with minimal sensing. We propose an online sound speed estimator that operates during general multichannel audio playback and requires only a single observation microphone. The method exploits the structured effect of sound speed on the reproduced signal and estimates it by minimizing the mismatch between the measured audio and a parametric acoustic model. Simulations show accurate tracking of sound speed for diverse input signals and improved spatial control performance when the estimates are used to compensate propagation errors in a sound zone control framework."

Subsequently, by time discretization of this system, we develop an accelerated primal-dual algorithm with a gradient-defined adaptive step size.

The uniqueness of this Geminid fireball consists of the record depth of its penetration in the atmosphere (to the height of 32.5 km) and in the fact that most likely a very small fraction of its initial mass survived severe deceleration in the atmosphere and landed on the ground. Such deeply penetrating Geminid with so precise and reliable data has not yet been observed. From a comparison with a large number of Geminids observed by the European Fireball Network and all brightest Geminids from the Prairie Fireball Network in USA and the Canadian MORP Network, we have shown that for Geminids with an entry mass greater than approximately 10 grams, the terminal altitude limit does not decrease further as it does for smaller Geminids, but remains constant at around 38 km. In this comparison, we have shown that there is only one exception, and that is the Geminid presented here. This one penetrated nearly 6 km deeper with very low terminal speed for Geminids. During the atmospheric flight this Geminid meteoroid slowed down from its original speed of 35.75 km/s to 6.8 km/s. This small meteoroid with initial mass of only 0.25 kg is probably the fastest candidate for a meteorite dropping event ever observed. This solid meteoroid belonging to the meteor shower survived a significant dynamic pressure of almost 2 MPa and thus ranks among the interplanetary bodies of asteroidal origin that caused the observed meteorite fall. Although a similar Geminid event has been previously presented in the literature, we demonstrate here that this claim was flawed."

In the prominent Eisenberg-Noe model, a fundamental aspect is clearing -- to determine the amount of assets available to each financial institution in the presence of potential defaults and bankruptcy. A clearing state represents a fixed point that satisfies a set of natural axioms. Existence can be established (even in broad generalizations of the model) using Tarski's theorem. While a maximal fixed point can be computed in polynomial time, the complexity of computing other fixed points is open. In this paper, we provide an efficient algorithm to compute a minimal fixed point that runs in strongly polynomial time. It applies in a broad generalization of the Eisenberg-Noe model with any monotone, piecewise-linear payment functions and default costs. Moreover, in this scenario we provide a polynomial-time algorithm to compute a maximal fixed point. For networks without default costs, we can efficiently decide the existence of fixed points in a given range. We also study claims trading, a local network adjustment to improve clearing, when networks are evaluated with minimal clearing. We provide an efficient algorithm to decide existence of Pareto-improving trades and compute optimal ones if they exist."

For this purpose, the contributions of the electromagnetic waves with the transverse magnetic and transverse electric polarizations to the Casimir force are computed using the Lifshitz theory expressed in terms of the pure imaginary Matsubara frequencies. Furthermore, the fractions of the evanescent and propagating waves in these contributions are found using an equivalent formulation of the Lifshitz theory along the real frequency axis. All computations are performed for Au-Ni and Ni-Ni plates using the Drude model and the experimentally consistent plasma model over the separation region from 0.5 to 6~mum, where the total force value is determined by conduction electrons. It is shown that the transverse magnetic contribution to the Casimir force does not depend on the used model of the dielectric permittivity, so that the total difference between the predictions of the Lifshitz theory using the Drude model and the measurement data is determined by the transverse electric contribution. In doing so, as opposed to the case of nonmagnetic metals, both fractions of the evanescent and propagating waves in this contribution depend on the model of the dielectric permittivity used in computations, whereas the magnetic properties of the plate metal influence the Casimir force solely through the fraction of propagating waves in the transverse electric contribution. The issue of a more adequate theoretical description of the electromagnetic response of magnetic metals is discussed."

By using the value we obtained, it is possible to estimate an integrated spectral index between 4.8 and 6.6 GHz of $α\\sim1.17$, where $F(ν)\\propto ν^{-α}$, indicating a possible higher-frequency slowdown of the spectral steepening observed between 1.4 and 4.8 GHz. Such a spectral behavior is compatible with turbulent re-acceleration if the seed electrons have a spectrum extending up to high energies, as in the case of continuous injection by hadronic interactions or dark matter annihilation.

For ZK-rollups, delayed proofs cause finality lag and economic loss; for Ethereum's emerging L1 zkEVM, proofs must complete within the 12-second slot window to enable stateless validation. The Ethereum Foundation's Ethproofs initiative coordinates multiple independent zkVMs across proving clusters to achieve real-time block proving, yet no principled orchestration framework addresses the joint challenges of (i) strict head-of-chain ordering, (ii) sub-slot latency bounds, (iii) fault-tolerant task reassignment, and (iv) prover-agnostic workflow composition. We present push0, a cloud-native proof orchestration system that decouples prover binaries from scheduling infrastructure. push0 employs an event-driven dispatcher--collector architecture over persistent priority queues, enforcing block-sequential proving while exploiting intra-block parallelism. We formalize requirements drawn from production ZK-rollup operations and the Ethereum real-time proving specification, then demonstrate via production Kubernetes cluster experiments that push0 achieves 5 ms median orchestration overhead with 99--100% scaling efficiency at 32 dispatchers for realistic workloads--overhead negligible (less than 0.1%) relative to typical proof computation times of 7+ seconds. Controlled Docker experiments validate these results, showing comparable performance (3--10 ms P50) when network variance is eliminated. Production deployment on the Zircuit zkrollup (14+ million mainnet blocks since March 2025) provides ecological validity for these controlled experiments.

    "abstract": "This work presents HAWX, a hardware-aware scalable exploration framework that employs multi-level sensitivity scoring at different DNN abstraction levels (operator, filter, layer, and model) to guide selective integration of heterogeneous AxC blocks. Supported by predictive models for accuracy, power, and area, HAWX accelerates the evaluation of candidate configurations, achieving over 23* speedup in a layer-level search with two candidate approximate blocks and more than (3*106)* speedup at the filter-level search only for LeNet-5, while maintaining accuracy comparable to exhaustive search. Experiments across state-of-the-art DNN benchmarks such as VGG-11, ResNet-18, and EfficientNetLite demonstrate that the efficiency benefits of HAWX scale exponentially with network size. The HAWX hardware-aware search algorithm supports both spatial and temporal accelerator architectures, leveraging either off-the-shelf approximate components or customized designs."

    "abstract": "Community detection is a fundamental task in complex network analysis. Fairness-aware community detection seeks to prevent biased node partitions, typically framed in terms of individual fairness, which requires similar nodes to be treated similarly, and group fairness, which aims to avoid disadvantaging specific groups of nodes. While existing literature on fair community detection has primarily focused on group fairness, we introduce a novel measure to quantify individual fairness in community detection methods. The proposed measure captures unfairness as the vectorial distance between a node's true and predicted community representations, computed using the community co-occurrence matrix. We provide a comprehensive empirical investigation of a broad set of community detection algorithms from the literature on both synthetic networks, with varying levels of community explicitness, and real-world networks. We particularly investigate the fairness-performance trade-off using standard quality metrics and compare individual fairness outcomes with existing group fairness measures. The results show that individual unfairness can occur even when group fairness or clustering accuracy is high, underscoring that individual and group fairness are not interchangeable. Moreover, fairness depends critically on the detectability of community structure. However, we find that Significance and Surprise for denser graphs, and Combo, Leiden, and SBMDL for sparser graphs result in a better trade-off between individual fairness and community quality. Overall, our findings, together with the fact that community detection is an important step in many network analysis downstream tasks, highlight the necessity of developing fairness-aware community detection methods."

    "abstract": "Accurate and computationally efficient 3D medical image segmentation remains a critical challenge in clinical workflows. Transformer-based architectures often demonstrate superior global contextual modeling but at the expense of excessive parameter counts and memory demands, restricting their clinical deployment. We propose RefineFormer3D, a lightweight hierarchical transformer architecture that balances segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency for volumetric medical imaging. The architecture integrates three key components: (i) GhostConv3D-based patch embedding for efficient feature extraction with minimal redundancy, (ii) MixFFN3D module with low-rank projections and depthwise convolutions for parameter-efficient feature extraction, and (iii) a cross-attention fusion decoder enabling adaptive multi-scale skip connection integration. RefineFormer3D contains only 2.94M parameters, substantially fewer than contemporary transformer-based methods. Extensive experiments on ACDC and BraTS benchmarks demonstrate that RefineFormer3D achieves 93.44\\% and 85.9\\% average Dice scores respectively, outperforming or matching state-of-the-art methods while requiring significantly fewer parameters. Furthermore, the model achieves fast inference (8.35 ms per volume on GPU) with low memory requirements, supporting deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments. These results establish RefineFormer3D as an effective and scalable solution for practical 3D medical image segmentation."

The chapter demonstrates how these methods lead to results on the existence of well-behaved proof systems in the contemporary framework of universal proof theory and how they provide a road map for constructing interpolation proofs using modern proof formalisms. The emphasis of the chapter is on constructive, modular, and syntax-driven techniques that illuminate deeper connections between interpolation properties and proof systems."

Naive methods -- like applying MLPs to flattened parameters -- perform poorly, making the design of better weight-space architectures a central challenge. While prior work leveraged permutation symmetries in standard networks to guide such designs, no analogous analysis or tailored architecture yet exists for Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). In this work, we show that KANs share the same permutation symmetries as MLPs, and propose the KAN-graph, a graph representation of their computation. Building on this, we develop WS-KAN, the first weight-space architecture that learns on KANs, which naturally accounts for their symmetry. We analyze WS-KAN's expressive power, showing it can replicate an input KAN's forward pass - a standard approach for assessing expressiveness in weight-space architectures. We construct a comprehensive ``zoo'' of trained KANs spanning diverse tasks, which we use as benchmarks to empirically evaluate WS-KAN. Across all tasks, WS-KAN consistently outperforms structure-agnostic baselines, often by a substantial margin. Our code is available at https://github.com/BarSGuy/KAN-Graph-Metanetwork."

By leveraging a robust and efficient agglomeration strategy, we construct a nested hierarchy of grids suitable for multilevel solver frameworks. The effectiveness and performance of the methodology are assessed through a series of numerical experiments on two- and three-dimensional domains, involving different ionic models and realistic unstructured geometries. The results demonstrate strong solver effectiveness and favorable scalability with respect to both the polynomial degree of the discretization and the number of levels selected in the multigrid preconditioner."

Three causal and four intervening conditions, as well as strategies were identified, to influence the use of GenAI. The study highlights both the potential and challenges of GenAI usage in education and business. While GenAI can significantly enhance productivity and learning outcomes, concerns about ethical implications, reliability, and the risk of academic misconduct persist. The developed grounded model offers a comprehensive understanding of GenAI usage among students, providing valuable insights for educators, policymakers, and developers of GenAI tools seeking to bridge the gap between education and business."

In contrast, audio SSL models still rely on fine-tuning because simple probing fails to unlock their full potential and alters their rankings when competing for SOTA on AudioSet. Hence, a robust and efficient probing mechanism is required to guide the trajectory of audio SSL towards reliable and reproducible methods. We introduce Convex Gated Probing (CGP), a prototype-based method that drastically closes the gap between fine-tuning and probing in audio. CGP efficiently utilizes all frozen layers via a gating mechanism and exposes the location of latent task-relevant information. Guided by CGP, we rework the entire SSL pipeline of current SOTA audio models that use legacy implementations of prior SSL methods. By refining data preprocessing, model architecture, and pre-training recipe, we introduce Better Audio Transformer (BAT), and establish new SOTA on audio benchmarks."

One promising solution is automated detection tools, many of which are developed within academia. We interviewed nine experienced practitioners working within or alongside regulatory bodies to understand their work against deceptive design patterns, including the use of supporting tools and the prospect of automation. Computing technologies have their place in regulatory practice, but not as envisioned in research. For example, investigations require utmost transparency and accountability in all the activities we identify as accompanying dark pattern detection, which many existing tools cannot provide. Moreover, tools need to map interfaces to legal violations to be of use. We thus recommend conducting user requirement research to maximize research impact, supporting ancillary activities beyond detection, and establishing practical tech adoption pathways that account for the needs of both scientific and regulatory activities."

This prevents them from being used as first-stage rankers, but also incurs a cost when re-ranking documents. Prior work has addressed this bottleneck from two largely separate directions: accelerating cross-encoder inference by sparsifying the attention process or improving first-stage retrieval effectiveness using more complex models, e.g. late-interaction ones. In this work, we propose to bridge these two approaches, based on an in-depth understanding of the internal mechanisms of cross-encoders. Starting from cross-encoders, we show that it is possible to derive a new late-interaction-like architecture by carefully removing detrimental or unnecessary interactions. We name this architecture MICE (Minimal Interaction Cross-Encoders). We extensively evaluate MICE across both in-domain (ID) and out-of-domain (OOD) datasets. MICE decreases fourfold the inference latency compared to standard cross-encoders, matching late-interaction models like ColBERT while retaining most of cross-encoder ID effectiveness and demonstrating superior generalization abilities in OOD."

In this work, we propose that such modifications need not be introduced phenomenologically but can emerge dynamically from stochastic fluctuations of the spacetime metric. We consider a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe perturbed by a conformal, time-dependent noise factor, whose ensemble average vanishes, leaving the mean background geometry unchanged. By averaging the Einstein equations to second order in the fluctuation amplitude, we derive a modified Friedmann equation that includes an effective correction term. This correction is shown to be equivalent to the general expression obtained from an arbitrary deformation of the entropy-area relation. By specifying the statistical properties, particularly the variance of the conformal noise, we successfully reproduce the Friedmann equation corrections associated with several well-known generalized entropy frameworks, including Rényi, (dual) Kaniadakis, Barrow, logarithmic, and MOND inspired hypergeometric entropies. Our results suggest that deviations from the area law can be interpreted as the macroscopic, coarse-grained imprint of unresolved, microscopic stochastic degrees of freedom in spacetime."

The analysis focuses on the central region of the cylinder, where axial variations in the flow are relatively weak, allowing the magnetic field to be represented as a helically traveling wave. Four magnetic impeller configurations and multiple forcing intensities are examined. In all cases, the velocity profiles in the central region display a similar \\propto r^{-2} dependence across a wide range of Reynolds numbers and forcing region widths. The magnetic field is found to start growing under conditions similar to those of the Riga dynamo. However, the growing modes exhibit a substantial nonzero group velocity, indicating that the associated instability is convective: the flow can amplify an externally applied magnetic field but cannot sustain it autonomously. We outline several approaches for overcoming this limitation in order to realize a working laboratory dynamo based on an internally unconstrained swirling jet-type flow."

Given an invariant bound $λ_{\\max}\\leλ_{\\rm bound}$ on the electric Riemann eigenvalues $E_{ij}\\equiv R_{\\hat{0}i\\hat{0}j}$ along freely falling worldlines, we prove (i)~a rigorous upper bound on accumulated geodesic deviation through any bounded curvature interior, controlled by $τ_*\\equivλ_{\\max}^{-1/2}$, and (ii)~the existence of a critical wavenumber $k_*\\simτ_*^{-1}$ separating adiabatic from non-adiabatic perturbation transfer through high-curvature epochs, with Bogoliubov coefficients exponentially suppressed for $k\\,τ_*\\gg 1$. Both results depend only on the tidal bound (and, for mode transfer, on a mild timescale assumption for the curvature-driven effective potential) and are otherwise insensitive to metric details. For preparation, we collect the standard operational consequences of bounded curvature, including the accuracy-dependent local-inertial domain $L_{\\rm LI}(\\varepsilon)\\sim\\sqrt{\\varepsilon}\\, λ_{\\max}^{-1/2}$ and, for conformally flat cores in four dimensions, the benchmark ratio $τ_*/L_*=24^{1/4}$ with $L_*\\equiv K_{\\max}^{-1/4}$.

To address this gap, we conducted a five-day field study with 40 participants, combining objective smartphone app tracking with daily reconstructions of flow-inducing activities. Across 673 reported flow occurrences, participants rarely associated flow with social media (2 percent). Instead, heavier social media use predicted fewer daily flow occurrences. We further examine this relationship through the effects of social media use on fatigue, mood, and motivation. Altogether, our findings suggest that flow and social media may not align as closely as assumed - and might even compete - underscoring the need for further research."

We show that the associated Boltzmann measure d$μ$ = exp(-g(x))dx satisfies a fixed-point property identity relating in a simple manner its degree-2n moments to the coefficients of g. This generalizes familiar identities for the exponential distribution (degree-1) on the positive orthant and the Gaussian measure (degree-2). We further show that g is characterized by three variational principles, including a maximum-entropy principle under scaled moments constraints, extending the Gaussian extremality principle to arbitrary even-degree homogeneous actions. Exploiting these identities in a truncatedmoment numerical scheme (known as the Moment-SOS hierarchy), strengthens the standard semidefinite relaxations, and results in a much faster convergence, thus allowing more efficient approximations of the partition function Z(g) as well as moments of $μ$."

The centroid energies of the Fe K$α$ and Fe K$β$ lines tightly constrain the emitting material to be neutral or near-neutral. The observed Fe K$β$/K$α$ ratio, together with the stringent upper limit on the Compton shoulder ($\\lesssim$8--11% of the core flux), disfavour reflection dominated by a homogeneous, classical Compton-thick medium, indicating that most of the neutral Fe K$α$ emission arises in optically thin or moderately Compton-thick gas. The Fe XXV and Fe XXVI emission lines exhibit remarkably large velocity widths, of several thousand km~s$^{-1}$. These broad profiles closely resemble the integrated optical and infrared [O III] and [O IV] lines associated with the large-scale biconical outflow, and are naturally interpreted as the X-ray signature of a more highly ionized, faster, and more spatially confined phase of the same outflow. The iron-K emission of NGC1068 reveals a stratified circumnuclear environment in which neutral and highly ionized components arise in physically distinct regions. The neutral Fe K fluorescence originates predominantly in optically thin or mildly Compton-thick material, despite the persistently Compton-thick line-of-sight obscuration, indicating a geometrically complex cold reprocessor. The highly ionized iron emission lines trace a fast component consistent with a warm bipolar outflow on parsec scales, whose large velocities and inferred energetics suggest that it may represent an efficient channel for feedback in a heavily obscured Seyfert galaxy."

    "abstract": "Generative AI chatbots enable personalized problem-solving, but effective learning requires students to self-regulate both how they seek help and how they use AI-generated responses. Considering engagement modes across these two actions reveals nuanced reliance patterns: for example, a student may actively engage in help-seeking by clearly specifying areas of need, yet engage passively in response-use by copying AI outputs, or vice versa. However, existing research lacks systematic tools for jointly capturing engagement across help-seeking and response-use, limiting the analysis of such reliance behaviors. We introduce RelianceScope, an analytical framework that characterizes students' reliance on chatbots during problem-solving. RelianceScope (1) operationalizes reliance into nine patterns based on combinations of engagement modes in help-seeking and response-use, and (2) situates these patterns within a knowledge-context lens that accounts for students' prior knowledge and the instructional significance of knowledge components. Rather than prescribing optimal AI use, the framework enables fine-grained analysis of reliance in open-ended student-AI interactions. As an illustrative application, we applied RelianceScope to analyze chat and code-edit logs from 79 college students in a web programming course. Results show that active help-seeking is associated with active response-use, whereas reliance patterns remain similar across knowledge mastery levels. Students often struggled to articulate their knowledge gaps and to adapt AI responses. Using our annotated dataset as a benchmark, we further demonstrate that large language models can reliably detect reliance during help-seeking and response-use.

    "abstract": "The melting of metallic nanoparticles is governed by surface pre-melting, a phenomenon traditionally modeled as the isotropic growth of a uniform liquid shell. Challenging this classical view, we report facet-dependent surface pre-melting in hexagonal close-packed Co nanoparticles, arising from the structural heterogeneity of the nanoparticle surface. Characterizing melting in molecular dynamics simulations (500 to 6000 atoms), we observe the onset of surface mobility, starting as low as $0.2\\times T_{M,\\infty}$ (the bulk melting point), driven by the early disordering of stepped $\\{01\\bar{1}1\\}$ facets. We found that these facets consistently melt at temperatures nearly 200 Kelvin lower than flat $\\{0001\\}$ facets, regardless of particle size, and relate facets melting temperatures to the nanoparticle size via a 2D extension of the Gibbs-Thomson relation. We determine a critical liquid layer thickness that triggers the melting of the entire nanoparticle, which is found to be size-dependent. Our results confirm the recent experimental observation of the surface pre-melting effect, and extend it to anisotropic particles with different facet orientations."

    "abstract": "We present a new family of multi-centered rotating black hole solutions in 5D vacuum Einstein gravity, providing explicit examples of cohomogeneity-three spacetimes. It is well known that, in the presence of two commuting Killing vector fields, the theory reduces to 3D gravity coupled to an $SL(3,\\mathbb{R})$ nonlinear sigma model with five scalar fields. We show that the scalar fields of the extremal Myers-Perry solution can be expressed in terms of two harmonic functions on 3D flat space, and that promoting these functions to include multiple sources yields explicit multi-centered extremal Myers-Perry black holes located at arbitrary positions. Each center forms a smooth $S^3$ Killing horizon, provided that the rotation parameters satisfy $|j_i|<1/2$. We further demonstrate that all curvature singularities are hidden behind the horizons and that no closed timelike curves arise on or outside the horizons. The solutions are asymptotically locally Minkowski in the sense that constant-time hypersurfaces are asymptotically locally Euclidean (ALE). As a concrete example, we consider a binary configuration, examine its rod structure, and demonstrate the absence of conical singularities between the two black holes, indicating that they are supported by an intermediate bubble region separating them."

    "abstract": "LLM-based agents are increasingly being deployed in contexts requiring complex authorization policies: customer service protocols, approval workflows, data access restrictions, and regulatory compliance. Embedding these policies in prompts provides no enforcement guarantees. We present PCAS, a Policy Compiler for Agentic Systems that provides deterministic policy enforcement. Enforcing such policies requires tracking information flow across agents, which linear message histories cannot capture. Instead, PCAS models the agentic system state as a dependency graph capturing causal relationships among events such as tool calls, tool results, and messages. Policies are expressed in a Datalog-derived language, as declarative rules that account for transitive information flow and cross-agent provenance. A reference monitor intercepts all actions and blocks violations before execution, providing deterministic enforcement independent of model reasoning. PCAS takes an existing agent implementation and a policy specification, and compiles them into an instrumented system that is policy-compliant by construction, with no security-specific restructuring required. We evaluate PCAS on three case studies: information flow policies for prompt injection defense, approval workflows in a multi-agent pharmacovigilance system, and organizational policies for customer service. On customer service tasks, PCAS improves policy compliance from 48% to 93% across frontier models, with zero policy violations in instrumented runs."

We find that the simplest model that fits the data has a quiescence period between bursts $Δt \\sim 100$~Myrs and the stellar mass in each galaxy grows linearly as a function of time from $z=12$ to $z=5$ (i.e., repeated bursts in each galaxy produce approximately equal mass in stars). The distribution of burst masses across different galaxies follows a power-law $dN/dM_* \\propto M_*^α$ with slope $α\\sim -2$. At $z>9-10$ the observed galaxy population typically had only one or two bursts of stars formation, hence the observed stellar masses at these redshifts (reaching $M_* \\sim 10^{10}$~M$_\\odot$), roughly represent the distribution of masses formed in one burst."

    "abstract": "Visual loco-manipulation of arbitrary objects in the wild with humanoid robots requires accurate end-effector (EE) control and a generalizable understanding of the scene via visual inputs (e.g., RGB-D images). Existing approaches are based on real-world imitation learning and exhibit limited generalization due to the difficulty in collecting large-scale training datasets. This paper presents a new paradigm, HERO, for object loco-manipulation with humanoid robots that combines the strong generalization and open-vocabulary understanding of large vision models with strong control performance from simulated training. We achieve this by designing an accurate residual-aware EE tracking policy. This EE tracking policy combines classical robotics with machine learning. It uses a) inverse kinematics to convert residual end-effector targets into reference trajectories, b) a learned neural forward model for accurate forward kinematics, c) goal adjustment, and d) replanning. Together, these innovations help us cut down the end-effector tracking error by 3.2x. We use this accurate end-effector tracker to build a modular system for loco-manipulation, where we use open-vocabulary large vision models for strong visual generalization. Our system is able to operate in diverse real-world environments, from offices to coffee shops, where the robot is able to reliably manipulate various everyday objects (e.g., mugs, apples, toys) on surfaces ranging from 43cm to 92cm in height. Systematic modular and end-to-end tests in simulation and the real world demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed design. We believe the advances in this paper can open up new ways of training humanoid robots to interact with daily objects."

    "abstract": "Recrystallization is a phenomenon in which a plastically deformed polycrystalline microstructure with a high dislocation density transforms into another that has low dislocation density. This evolution is driven by the stored energy in dislocations, rather than grain growth driven by grain boundary energy alone. One difficulty in quantitative modeling of recrystallization is the uncertainty in material parameters, which can be addressed by integration of experimental data into simulations. In this work, we compare simulated static recrystallization dynamics of a Mg-3Zn-0.1Ca wt.% alloy to experiments involving thermomechanical processing followed by measurements of the recrystallization fraction over time. The simulations are performed by combining PRISMS software for crystal plasticity and phase-field models (PRISMS-Plasticity and PRISMS-PF, respectively) in an integrated computational materials engineering framework. At 20% strain and annealing at 350 °C, the model accurately describes recrystallization dynamics up to a mobility-dependent time scale factor. While the average grain boundary mobility and the fraction of plastic work converted into stored energy are not precisely known, by fitting simulations to experimental data, we show that the average grain boundary mobility can be determined if the fraction of plastic work converted to stored energy is known, or vice versa. For low annealing temperatures, we observe a discrepancy between the model and experiments in the late stages of recrystallization, where a slowdown in recrystallization kinetics occurs in the experiments. We discuss possible sources of this slowdown and propose additional physical mechanisms that need to be accounted for in the model to improve its predictions."

    "abstract": "Interpretability research on large language models (LLMs) has yielded important insights into model behaviour, yet recurring pitfalls persist: findings that do not generalise, and causal interpretations that outrun the evidence. Our position is that causal inference specifies what constitutes a valid mapping from model activations to invariant high-level structures, the data or assumptions needed to achieve it, and the inferences it can support. Specifically, Pearl's causal hierarchy clarifies what an interpretability study can justify. Observations establish associations between model behaviour and internal components. Interventions (e.g., ablations or activation patching) support claims how these edits affect a behavioural metric (\\eg, average change in token probabilities) over a set of prompts. However, counterfactual claims -- i.e., asking what the model output would have been for the same prompt under an unobserved intervention -- remain largely unverifiable without controlled supervision. We show how causal representation learning (CRL) operationalises this hierarchy, specifying which variables are recoverable from activations and under what assumptions. Together, these motivate a diagnostic framework that helps practitioners select methods and evaluations matching claims to evidence such that findings generalise."

We demonstrate that this approach, and security definitions that enable it, carry significant privacy risks for the remaining (undeleted) data points. We present a reconstruction attack showing that for certain tasks, which can be computed securely without deletions, a mechanism adhering to perfect retraining allows an adversary controlling merely $ω(1)$ data points to reconstruct almost the entire dataset merely by issuing deletion requests. We survey existing definitions for machine unlearning, showing they are either susceptible to such attacks or too restrictive to support basic functionalities like exact summation. To address this problem, we propose a new security definition that specifically safeguards undeleted data against leakage caused by the deletion of other points. We show that our definition permits several essential functionalities, such as bulletin boards, summations, and statistical learning."

    "abstract": "The digital services economy consists of online platforms that facilitate interactions between service providers and consumers. This ecosystem is characterized by short-term, often one-off, transactions between parties that have no prior familiarity. To establish trust among users, platforms employ rating systems which allow users to report on the quality of their previous interactions. However, while arguably crucial for these platforms to function, rating systems can perpetuate negative biases against marginalised groups. This paper investigates how to design platforms around biased reputation systems, reducing discrimination while maintaining incentives for all service providers to offer high quality service for users. We introduce an evolutionary game theoretical model to study how digital platforms can perpetuate or counteract rating-based discrimination. We focus on the platforms' decisions to promote service providers who have high reputations or who belong to a specific protected group. Our results demonstrate a fundamental trade-off between user experience and fairness: promoting highly-rated providers benefits users, but lowers the demand for marginalised providers against which the ratings are biased. Our results also provide evidence that intervening by tuning the demographics of the search results is a highly effective way of reducing unfairness while minimally impacting users. Furthermore, we show that even when precise measurements on the level of rating bias affecting marginalised service providers is unavailable, there is still potential to improve upon a recommender system which ignores protected characteristics. Altogether, our model highlights the benefits of proactive anti-discrimination design in systems where ratings are used to promote cooperative behaviour."

Experiments are performed in a Ludwieg tunnel for varying Reynolds numbers ($23000\\leq Re_D \\leq 74000$) based on cavity depth ($D$). The effects of geometry are examined through length-to-depth ratios ($[L/D]=[2,4,6]$) and non-dimensional rear-face height differences ($[Δh/D]=[-0.5,-0.25,0,0.25,0.5]$). Shear layer evolution is interpreted using qualitative schlieren and Planar Laser Rayleigh Scattering (PLRS) along with quantitative unsteady pressure measurements. For all $[L/D]$, the shear layer remains laminar at low $Re_D$ and develops Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) vortices as $Re_D$ increases. For the longest cavity ($[L/D]=6$), transition to turbulence occurs at the highest $Re_D$ due to a longer K-H growth length. Spectral analysis of pressure signals and PLRS intensity shows a shift in dominant frequency from the first Rossiter mode to higher modes for $[L/D]=6$. Except for $[L/D]=6, [Δh/D]=0$, dominant frequencies agree with Rossiter predictions and remain largely Reynolds-number independent. Variation of $[Δh/D]$ leads to mode switching identified using POD of PLRS snapshots. Negative $[Δh/D]$ favors K-H modes (5th-6th Rossiter), whereas positive values promote a strong flapping mode (1st Rossiter) due to pressure build-up inside the cavity. At $[Δh/D]=0$, both modes may coexist depending on $Re_D$. Azimuthal measurements indicate dominant axisymmetric behavior in flapping cases and weaker correlation for K-H dominated shear layers."

Using cultural evolution to model user selection of agents, our simulations reveal a significant risk of convergence to poor societal equilibria, particularly when the relative benefit of cooperation diminishes and population sizes increase.

In such a setting, each robot estimates its relative pose by combining data only from onboard odometry sensors and distance measurements to other robots in the team. Additionally, each robot calculates the control inputs necessary to collaboratively navigate an environment to accomplish a specific task, for example, moving in a desired formation while monitoring an area. We present a block coordinate descent approach to localization that does not require strict coordination between the robots. We present a novel formulation for formation control as inference on factor graphs that takes into account the state estimation uncertainty and can be solved efficiently. Our approach to range-aided localization and formation-based navigation is completely decentralized, does not require specialized trajectories to maintain formation, and achieves decimeter-level positioning and formation control accuracy. We demonstrate our approach through multiple real experiments involving formation flights in diverse indoor and outdoor environments."

    "abstract": "Fast Ewald summation efficiently evaluates Coulomb interactions and is widely used in molecular dynamics simulations. It is based on a split into a short-range and a long-range part, where evaluation of the latter is accelerated using the fast Fourier transform (FFT). The accuracy and computational cost depend critically on the mollifier in the Ewald split and the window function used in the spreading and interpolation steps that enable the use of the FFT. The first prolate spheroidal wavefunction (PSWF) has optimal concentration in real and Fourier space simultaneously, and is used when defining both a mollifier and a window function. We provide a complete description of the method and derive rigorous error estimates. In addition, we obtain closed-form approximations of the Fourier truncation and aliasing errors, yielding explicit parameter choices for the achieved error to closely match the prescribed tolerance. Numerical experiments confirm the analysis: PSWF-based Ewald summation achieves a given accuracy with significantly fewer Fourier modes and smaller window supports than Gaussian- and B-spline-based approaches, providing a superior alternative to existing Ewald methods for particle simulations."

Scientific data pipelines need the equivalent of DevOps -- SciOps -- yet common approaches fragment provenance across disconnected systems without transactional guarantees. DataJoint 2.0 addresses this gap through the relational workflow model: tables represent workflow steps, rows represent artifacts, foreign keys prescribe execution order. The schema specifies not only what data exists but how it is derived -- a single formal system where data structure, computational dependencies, and integrity constraints are all queryable, enforceable, and machine-readable. Four technical innovations extend this foundation: object-augmented schemas integrating relational metadata with scalable object storage, semantic matching using attribute lineage to prevent erroneous joins, an extensible type system for domain-specific formats, and distributed job coordination designed for composability with external orchestration. By unifying data structure, data, and computational transformations, DataJoint creates a substrate for SciOps where agents can participate in scientific workflows without risking data corruption."

The metal plates and the surrounding air are represented as separate immiscible phases governed by independent equations of state. A multifluid Godunov-type (finite-volume) computational algorithm, based on the mechanical-equilibrium Euler equations and incorporating pressure relaxation, is used to numerically describe the evolution of the waves resulting from the collision. The position of the interface (contact discontinuity) between immiscible phases is tracked by means of the volume-of-fluid (VOF) method. The numerical model allows one to account for the existence of tensile stresses in metal and registers them as regions of negative pressure. The computed arrival time of the unloading wave at the interface between the plates agrees with the experimental data and with simulation results obtained via different methods."

We present the discovery and multi-wavelength follow-up of GRB 250818B, detected by the Space Variable Objects Monitor (SVOM) and localised optically by the Gravitational-wave Optical Transient Observer (GOTO). We compile and homogenise X-ray, optical/NIR, and radio data to build broadband light curves and spectral energy distributions. The afterglow is unusually luminous for a nominal short GRB, lying on the bright end of the short-GRB population in X-rays and optical and among the most luminous high-redshift short-GRB afterglows in the radio. MeerKAT detects the source at 3.1 GHz, while ALMA provides deep higher-frequency limits. Keck/LRIS spectroscopy shows continuum and metal absorption (Fe II, Mg II, Mg I), giving $z=1.216$. Synchrotron forward-shock modelling favours a constant-density medium and strongly prefers refreshed (energy-injection) emission, well described by a two-component jet with $E_{K,iso} \\sim 4\\times10^{52}$ erg, $n_0 \\sim 3.6$ cm$^{-3}$, $θ_j \\simeq 0.10$ rad ($\\sim 5.7$ deg), and $p \\simeq 1.64$.

SED fitting of the candidate host suggests a low-mass galaxy.

MerLean achieves end-to-end formalization on all three papers, reducing the verification burden to only the newly introduced definitions and axioms. Our results demonstrate that agentic autoformalization can scale to frontier research, offering both a practical tool for machine-verified peer review and a scalable engine for mining high-quality synthetic data to train future reasoning models.

To address this, we present an automated, two-stage agentic framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract mechanical constitutive equations, calibrated parameters, and metadata from PDF documents. The workflow employs a resource-efficient \"Gatekeeper\" agent for relevance filtering and a high-capability \"Analyst\" agent for fine-grained extraction, featuring a novel Context-Aware Symbolic Grounding mechanism to resolve mathematical ambiguities. Applied to a corpus of over 2,000 research papers, the system successfully isolated 113 core documents and constructed a structured database containing 185 constitutive model instances and over 450 calibrated parameters. The extraction precision reached 80.4\\%, establishing a highly efficient \"Human-in-the-loop\" workflow that reduces manual data curation time by approximately 90\\%. We demonstrate the system's utility through a web-based Knowledge Retrieval Platform, which enables rapid parameter discovery for computational modeling.

A tunable parameter \\(α\\in [0,1]\\) scales these failure probabilities to model different levels of network stress. We evaluate resilience using two key metrics: the minimum-user spectral efficiency, which captures worst-case user performance, and the outage probability, defined as the fraction of users left without any active APs. Simulation results show that FAAS maintains significantly better performance under failure conditions compared to failure-agnostic clustering. At high failure levels, FAAS reduces outage by over 85\\% and improves worst-case user rates. These results confirm that FAAS is a practical and efficient solution for building more reliable CF-mMIMO networks."

However, existing KAN architectures, including spline-, wavelet-, radial-basis variants, etc., suffer from high computational cost and slow convergence, limiting scalability and practical applicability. Here, we introduce Feature-Enriched Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (FEKAN), a simple yet effective extension that preserves all the advantages of KAN while improving computational efficiency and predictive accuracy through feature enrichment, without increasing the number of trainable parameters. By incorporating these additional features, FEKAN accelerates convergence, increases representation capacity, and substantially mitigates the computational overhead characteristic of state-of-the-art KAN architectures. We investigate FEKAN across a comprehensive set of benchmarks, including function-approximation tasks, physics-informed formulations for diverse partial differential equations (PDEs), and neural operator settings that map between input and output function spaces. For function approximation, we systematically compare FEKAN against a broad family of KAN variants, FastKAN, WavKAN, ReLUKAN, HRKAN, ChebyshevKAN, RBFKAN, and the original SplineKAN. Across all tasks, FEKAN demonstrates substantially faster convergence and consistently higher approximation accuracy than the underlying baseline architectures. We also establish the theoretical foundations for FEKAN, showing its superior representation capacity compared to KAN, which contributes to improved accuracy and efficiency."

SymbolicCI provides analytic Hamiltonian matrix elements for efficient large-scale calculations; NOCI-F delivers benchmark-quality couplings. The resulting diabatic Hamiltonians can be coupled to quantum dynamics simulations. Applications to ethylene aggregates and the anthracene crystal reveal CTX configurations as electronic gateways bridging excitonic manifolds, with CT-mediated relaxation pathways competing with conventional annihilation. In H-type aggregates, LECT admixture stabilizes a \"bi-excimer\" analogous to one-particle excimers. By providing first-principles access to biexciton formation, separation, and transport, we hope to stimulate further exchange between electronic structure and quantum dynamics communities toward a predictive understanding of multiexcitonic photophysics."

Disproving termination of non-probabilistic systems requires finding a finite representation of an infinite computation, e.g., a loop of the rewrite system. We extend such qualitative techniques to probabilistic term rewriting, where a quantitative analysis is required. In addition to the existence of a loop, we have to count the number of such loops in order to embed suitable random walks into a computation, thereby disproving termination. To evaluate their power, we implemented all our techniques in the tool AProVE."

We propose a Factor-Adjusted Debiased Mediation Testing (FADMT) framework that enables large-scale inference for individual mediation effects with FDR control under complex dependence structures. Our approach posits an approximate factor structure on the unobserved errors of the mediator model, extracts common latent factors, and constructs decorrelated pseudo-mediators for the subsequent inferential procedure. We establish the asymptotic normality of the debiased estimator and develop a multiple testing procedure with theoretical FDR control under mild high-dimensional conditions. By adjusting for latent factor induced dependence, FADMT also improves robustness to spurious associations driven by shared latent variation in observational studies. Extensive simulations demonstrate the superior finite-sample performance across a wide range of correlation structures. Applications to TCGA-BRCA multi-omics data and to China's stock connect study further illustrate the practical utility of the proposed method."

Rather than proposing novel methods, we focus on several alternative approaches whose potential benefits are widely imaginable, yet have remained largely unexplored. The currently dominant paradigm, which can be termed \"extract then store,\" involves extracting information judged to be useful from experiences and saving only the extracted content. However, this approach inherently risks the loss of information, as some valuable knowledge particularly for different tasks may be discarded in the extraction process. In contrast, we emphasize the \"store then on-demand extract\" approach, which seeks to retain raw experiences and flexibly apply them to various tasks as needed, thus avoiding such information loss. In addition, we highlight two further approaches: discovering deeper insights from large collections of probabilistic experiences, and improving experience collection efficiency by sharing stored experiences. While these approaches seem intuitively effective, our simple experiments demonstrate that this is indeed the case. Finally, we discuss major challenges that have limited investigation into these promising directions and propose research topics to address them."

While most prior work studied this problem under adversarial settings and/or assessed performance in terms of gaps of time-averaged marginal coverage, we instead evaluate performance through training-conditional cumulative regret. We specifically focus on independently generated data with two types of distribution shift: abrupt change points and smooth drift. When non-conformity score functions are pretrained on an independent dataset, we propose a split-conformal style algorithm that leverages drift detection to adaptively update calibration sets, which provably achieves minimax-optimal regret. When non-conformity scores are instead trained online, we develop a full-conformal style algorithm that again incorporates drift detection to handle non-stationarity; this approach relies on stability - rather than permutation symmetry - of the model-fitting algorithm, which is often better suited to online learning under evolving environments. We establish non-asymptotic regret guarantees for our online full conformal algorithm, which match the minimax lower bound under appropriate restrictions on the prediction sets. Numerical experiments corroborate our theoretical findings."

    "abstract": "The RNA inverse folding problem aims to identify nucleotide sequences that preferentially adopt a given target secondary structure. While various heuristic and machine learning-based approaches have been proposed, many require a large number of sequence evaluations, which limits their applicability when experimental validation is costly. We propose a method to solve the problem using a factorization machine with quadratic-optimization annealing (FMQA). FMQA is a discrete black-box optimization method reported to obtain high-quality solutions with a limited number of evaluations. Applying FMQA to the problem requires converting nucleotides into binary variables. However, the influence of integer-to-nucleotide assignments and binary-integer encoding on the performance of FMQA has not been thoroughly investigated, even though such choices determine the structure of the surrogate model and the search landscape, and thus can directly affect solution quality. Therefore, this study aims both to establish a novel FMQA framework for RNA inverse folding and to analyze the effects of these assignments and encoding methods. We evaluated all 24 possible assignments of the four nucleotides to the ordered integers (0-3), in combination with four binary-integer encoding methods. Our results demonstrated that one-hot and domain-wall encodings outperform binary and unary encodings in terms of the normalized ensemble defect value. In domain-wall encoding, nucleotides assigned to the boundary integers (0 and 3) appeared with higher frequency. In the RNA inverse folding problem, assigning guanine and cytosine to these boundary integers promoted their enrichment in stem regions, which led to more thermodynamically stable secondary structures than those obtained with one-hot encoding."

This was an utter boon to strangeness physics investigations, and to date, more than 50 dedicated experiments in kaon photo- and electroproduction have been completed at facilities around the world, leading to a host of experimental observables that have enabled significant advances in the exploration of strongly interacting systems that decay via $s\\bar{s}$ quark pair creation. This review was designed to provide the first-ever in-depth overview of both the experimental and theoretical progress in the field of the electromagnetic production of strangeness. This work looks back over 70 years of past developments, discusses ongoing work and near-term plans, and details future possibilities being considered for third-generation facilities. Throughout this work, the primary impacts of these explorations are highlighted, along with connections to a wide range of related phenomenological applications. An important goal of this review is to provide a complete, self-contained guide into this field prepared at a level that is relevant for both new and seasoned scientists, whether experimentalists, phenomenologists, or theorists, to better understand what has been accomplished by so many dedicated folks-each building on what has come before-and to appreciate the exciting future potential for continued studies in this area.

Here, we report on the surface magnetic properties of FeSb2, utilizing the surface area dependence of magnetic susceptibility to separate the surface Curie-Weiss temperature dependence from the bulk spin-gap susceptibility. We use these results to further extract the surface magnetic anisotropy of a thin, rough-surfaced single-crystal FeSb2 to compare with the observed magnetotransport anisotropy, and find good agreement between the anisotropy in the surface magnetization and surface magnetotransport. We conclude with evidence of an anomalous Hall contribution to the low-temperature surface transport."

Applying the Comparative Agendas Project (CAP) schema to the multilingual ParlaMint corpus of over 8 million speeches from 28 parliaments of European countries and autonomous regions, we follow a teacher-student framework in which a high-performing large language model (LLM) annotates in-domain training data and a multilingual encoder model is fine-tuned on these annotations for scalable data annotation. We show that this approach produces a classifier tailored to the target domain. Agreement between the LLM and human annotators is comparable to inter-annotator agreement among humans, and the resulting model outperforms existing CAP classifiers trained on manually-annotated but out-of-domain data. In addition to the CAP annotations, the ParlaCAP dataset offers rich speaker and party metadata, as well as sentiment predictions coming from the ParlaSent multilingual transformer model, enabling comparative research on political attention and representation across countries. We illustrate the analytical potential of the dataset with three use cases, examining the distribution of parliamentary attention across policy topics, sentiment patterns in parliamentary speech, and gender differences in policy attention."

    "abstract": "Cosmological vector fields are central to many early-Universe phenomena, including inflationary dynamics, primordial magnetogenesis, and dark-matter scenarios. However, constructing models able to generate cosmological magnetic fields while avoiding strong coupling, backreaction, and cosmic microwave background constraints remains challenging. We study a novel mechanism in which brief non--slow-roll phases during inflation amplify primordial magnetic fields at small scales, while maintaining theoretical consistency and observational viability. We incorporate parity-violating interactions in the vector sector and demonstrate, for the first time in a non--slow-roll framework, that chirality can significantly boost magnetic-field amplitudes and imprint distinctive polarization-dependent spectral features. We complement detailed numerical computations with an analytical treatment yielding compact expressions for chiral vector mode functions that reproduce the main spectral properties. We then develop a systematic formalism to evaluate the stochastic gravitational-wave background naturally induced at second order by these amplified fields, identifying both an intensity component and a circularly polarized contribution with characteristic frequency profiles. We discuss detection prospects with future multiband gravitational-wave observatories, showing that chiral signatures could provide a distinctive observational probe. Our results introduce new avenues for enhancing primordial magnetic fields and their associated gravitational-wave signals, opening promising possibilities for their future detection and interpretation, both with cosmological and gravitational wave probes."

Airless planetary bodies are directly exposed to solar wind ions, which can scatter or become implanted upon impact with the regolith-covered surface, while also sputtering surface atoms. Aims. We construct a semi-analytical model for the scattering of ions of hundreds of eV and the sputtering of surface atoms, both resulting in the emission of negative ions from the lunar surface. Our model contains a novel description of the scattering process that is physics-based and constrained by observations. Methods. We use data from the Negative Ions at the Lunar Surface (NILS) instrument on the Chang'e-6 lander to update prior knowledge of ion scattering and sputtering from lunar regolith through Bayesian inference. Results. Our model shows good agreement with the NILS data. A precipitating solar wind proton has roughly a 22% chance of scattering from the lunar surface in any charge state, and about an 8% chance of sputtering a surface hydrogen atom. The resulting ratio of scattered to sputtered hydrogen flux is eta_sc / eta_sp = 1.5 for a proton speed of 300 km/s. We find a high probability (7-20%) that a hydrogen atom leaves the surface negatively charged. The angular emission distributions at near-grazing angles for both scattered and sputtered fluxes are controlled by surface roughness. Our model also indicates significant inelastic energy losses for hydrogen interacting with the regolith, suggesting a longer effective path length than previously assumed. Finally, we estimate a surface binding energy of 5.5 eV, consistent with the observations. Conclusions. Our model describes the scattering and sputtering of particles of any charge state from any homogeneous, multi-species surface. Using NILS data, we successfully applied the model to update our understanding of solar wind interacting with lunar regolith, and the emission of negative hydrogen ions."

As tasks and definitions evolve, such models cannot accommodate emerging distinctions and collecting new annotations and retraining to accommodate such changes is costly. To address these challenges, we introduce category splitting, a new task where an existing classifier is edited to refine a coarse category into finer subcategories, while preserving accuracy elsewhere. We propose a zero-shot editing method that leverages the latent compositional structure of video classifiers to expose fine-grained distinctions without additional data. We further show that low-shot fine-tuning, while simple, is highly effective and benefits from our zero-shot initialization. Experiments on our new video benchmarks for category splitting demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms vision-language baselines, improving accuracy on the newly split categories without sacrificing performance on the rest.

    "abstract": "Determining if an input undirected graph is Hamiltonian, i.e., if it has a cycle that visits every vertex exactly once, is one of the most famous NP-complete problems. We consider the following generalization of Hamiltonian cycles: for a fixed set $S$ of natural numbers, we want to visit each vertex of a graph $G$ exactly once and ensure that any two consecutive vertices can be joined in $k$ hops for some choice of $k \\in S$. Formally, an $S$-Hamiltonian cycle is a permutation $(v_0,\\ldots,v_{n-1})$ of the vertices of $G$ such that, for $0 \\leq i \\leq n-1$, there exists a walk between $v_i$ and $v_{i+1 \\bmod n}$ whose length is in $S$. (We do not impose any constraints on how many times vertices can be visited as intermediate vertices of walks.) Of course Hamiltonian cycles in the standard sense correspond to $S=\\{1\\}$. We study the $S$-Hamiltonian cycle problem of deciding whether an input graph $G$ has an $S$-Hamiltonian cycle. Our goal is to determine the complexity of this problem depending on the fixed set $S$. It is already known that the problem remains NP-complete for $S=\\{1,2\\}$, whereas it is trivial for $S=\\{1,2,3\\}$ because any connected graph contains a $\\{1,2,3\\}$-Hamiltonian cycle. Our work classifies the complexity of this problem for most kinds of sets $S$, with the key new results being the following: we have NP-completeness for $S = \\{2\\}$ and for $S = \\{2, 4\\}$, but tractability for $S = \\{1, 2, 4\\}$, for $S = \\{2, 4, 6\\}$, for any superset of these two tractable cases, and for $S$ the infinite set of all odd integers. The remaining open cases are the non-singleton finite sets of odd integers, in particular $S = \\{1, 3\\}$. Beyond cycles, we also discuss the complexity of finding $S$-Hamiltonian paths, and show that our problems are all tractable on graphs of bounded cliquewidth."

Using the Hermite-polynomial formulation of the Wiener chaos, we obtain easily implementable expressions that enable fast calibration to a target implied-volatility surface. We illustrate the flexibility and expressive power of the resulting model through numerical experiments on both simulated and real market data."

While prior work demonstrates human to robot transfer in constrained settings, it is unclear whether large scale human data can support fine grained, high degree of freedom dexterous manipulation. We present EgoScale, a human to dexterous manipulation transfer framework built on large scale egocentric human data. We train a Vision Language Action (VLA) model on over 20,854 hours of action labeled egocentric human video, more than 20 times larger than prior efforts, and uncover a log linear scaling law between human data scale and validation loss. This validation loss strongly correlates with downstream real robot performance, establishing large scale human data as a predictable supervision source. Beyond scale, we introduce a simple two stage transfer recipe: large scale human pretraining followed by lightweight aligned human robot mid training. This enables strong long horizon dexterous manipulation and one shot task adaptation with minimal robot supervision. Our final policy improves average success rate by 54% over a no pretraining baseline using a 22 DoF dexterous robotic hand, and transfers effectively to robots with lower DoF hands, indicating that large scale human motion provides a reusable, embodiment agnostic motor prior."

    "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) aim to reason by jointly leveraging visual and textual modalities. While allocating additional inference-time computation has proven effective for large language models (LLMs), achieving similar scaling in VLMs remains challenging. A key obstacle is that visual inputs are typically provided only once at the start of generation, while textual reasoning (e.g., early visual summaries) is generated autoregressively, causing reasoning to become increasingly text-dominated and allowing early visual grounding errors to accumulate. Moreover, vanilla guidance for visual grounding during inference is often coarse and noisy, making it difficult to steer reasoning over long texts. To address these challenges, we propose \\emph{Saliency-Aware Principle} (SAP) selection. SAP operates on high-level reasoning principles rather than token-level trajectories, which enable stable control over discrete generation under noisy feedback while allowing later reasoning steps to re-consult visual evidence when renewed grounding is required. In addition, SAP supports multi-route inference, enabling parallel exploration of diverse reasoning behaviors. SAP is model-agnostic and data-free, requiring no additional training. Empirical results show that SAP achieves competitive performance, especially in reducing object hallucination, under comparable token-generation budgets while yielding more stable reasoning and lower response latency than CoT-style long sequential reasoning."

Working initially at a fixed cosmological constant $Λ>0$ and uniformly for $(M,a)$ in a compact slow-rotation set, using the meromorphic/Fredholm framework for quasinormal modes and a semiclassical equatorial labeling proved in a companion paper, we establish a quantitative two-mode dominance theorem in an equatorial high-frequency package: after exact azimuthal reduction, microlocal equatorial localization, and analytic pole selection by entire localization weights constructed from equatorial pseudopoles, the $k=\\pm\\ell$ sector signals are each governed by a single quasinormal exponential, up to an explicitly controlled tail and an $\\mathcal O(\\ell^{-\\infty})$ contribution from all other poles. We then develop a fully deterministic frequency-extraction stability estimate based on time-shift invariance, and combine it with the two-mode dominance result and the companion paper's inverse stability theorem to obtain an explicit parameter bias bound for ringdown-based recovery of $(M,a)$. Finally, using the companion paper's three-parameter inverse theorem and a damping observable based on the scaled imaginary part of one equatorial mode, we propagate the same deterministic error chain to a local bias bound for recovery of $(M,a,Λ)$ on compact parameter sets with $|a|$ bounded away from $0$. As a further consequence, we obtain a localized pseudospectral stability statement for the equatorial resolvent package, quantifying how large microlocalized resolvent norms enforce proximity to the labeled equatorial poles. The resulting estimates clarify the conditioning mechanisms (start time, window length, shift step, and detector nondegeneracy) and provide a rigorous PDE-to-data interface for high-frequency black-hole spectroscopy."

Object-centric (OC) representations, which encode a scene as a set of objects, are often argued to support such generalization, but systematic evidence in visually rich settings is limited. We introduce a Visual Question Answering benchmark across three controlled visual worlds (CLEVRTex, Super-CLEVR, and MOVi-C) to measure how well vision encoders, with and without object-centric biases, generalize to unseen combinations of object properties. To ensure a fair and comprehensive comparison, we carefully account for training data diversity, sample size, representation size, downstream model capacity, and compute. We use DINOv2 and SigLIP2, two widely used vision encoders, as the foundation models and their OC counterparts. Our key findings reveal that (1) OC approaches are superior in harder compositional generalization settings; (2) original dense representations surpass OC only on easier settings and typically require substantially more downstream compute; and (3) OC models are more sample efficient, achieving stronger generalization with fewer images, whereas dense encoders catch up or surpass them only with sufficient data and diversity. Overall, object-centric representations offer stronger compositional generalization when any one of dataset size, training data diversity, or downstream compute is constrained."

Of interest to this work is the case where several communicating satellites each need to maintain a local catalog of communicating and non-communicating objects using angles-only limited field of view (FOV) measurements. However, this introduces the problem of efficiently scheduling and coordinating observations among the agents. This paper presents a decentralized task allocation algorithm to address this problem and quantifies its performance in terms of fuel usage and overall catalog uncertainty via numerical simulation.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong generative capabilities, direct intent-to-code synthesis frequently suffers from the leap-to-code failure mode, where models prematurely emit code without grounding in program structure, constraints, and semantics. This will result in non-compilable tests, hallucinated function signatures, low branch coverage, and semantically irrelevant assertions that cannot properly capture bugs. We introduce SPARC, a neuro-symbolic, scenario-based framework that bridges this gap through four stages: (1) Control Flow Graph (CFG) analysis, (2) an Operation Map that grounds LLM reasoning in validated utility helpers, (3) Path-targeted test synthesis, and (4) an iterative, self-correction validation loop using compiler and runtime feedback. We evaluate SPARC on 59 real-world and algorithmic subjects, where it outperforms the vanilla prompt generation baseline by 31.36% in line coverage, 26.01% in branch coverage, and 20.78% in mutation score, matching or exceeding the symbolic execution tool KLEE on complex subjects. SPARC retains 94.3% of tests through iterative repair and produces code with significantly higher developer-rated readability and maintainability.

The $n$-roots of these models are constructed from connecting loop modules of unidirectional couplings whose geometrical arrangements match that of the corresponding parent system. Their energy spectrum is shown to consist of $n$ rotated and equivalent branches in the complex energy plane, each matching the real spectrum of the parent model when raised to the $n$th power, together with extra zero-energy flat bands (FBs) accounted for by the generalized index theorem. We show how the low-energy Dirac cones of the parent models translate, for an appropriate choice of phase configuration for the couplings of the $n$-root lattices, as what we call an \"exceptional horn\" appearing at each branch, with the central Dirac point (DP) converted into zero-energy exceptional points (EPs) of order $n$ or higher at high-symmetry momenta. These exceptional horns reflect the behavior of low-lying excitations that scale with momentum as $E\\sim\\vert \\mathbf{q}\\vert^{\\frac{1}{n}}$, with $n\\geq 3$, as opposed to the linear massless modes that characterize a Dirac cone. Moreover, we derive analytic expressions for the associated Landau levels (LLs), whose energies scale with magnetic flux as $E\\simφ^{\\frac{1}{2n}}$. For the case of the $n$-root Lieb lattice, the zeroth LL is shown to be exceptional. These results are analytically derived for both $n$-root models and numerically demonstrated for certain values of $n$. Finally, we propose a realistic photonic implementation based on coupled ring resonators with a split configuration of optical gain and loss."

    "abstract": "High-definition (HD) maps are crucial to autonomous driving, providing structured representations of road elements to support navigation and planning. However, existing query-based methods often employ random query initialization and depend on implicit temporal modeling, which lead to temporal inconsistencies and instabilities during the construction of a global map. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel end-to-end framework for consistent online HD vectorized map construction, which jointly performs map instance tracking and short-term prediction. First, we propose a Semantic-Aware Query Generator that initializes queries with spatially aligned semantic masks to capture scene-level context globally. Next, we design a History Rasterized Map Memory to store fine-grained instance-level maps for each tracked instance, enabling explicit historical priors. A History-Map Guidance Module then integrates rasterized map information into track queries, improving temporal continuity. Finally, we propose a Short-Term Future Guidance module to forecast the immediate motion of map instances based on the stored history trajectories. These predicted future locations serve as hints for tracked instances to further avoid implausible predictions and keep temporal consistency. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods with good efficiency."

    "abstract": "AI agents are increasingly deployed to execute important tasks. While rising accuracy scores on standard benchmarks suggest rapid progress, many agents still continue to fail in practice. This discrepancy highlights a fundamental limitation of current evaluations: compressing agent behavior into a single success metric obscures critical operational flaws. Notably, it ignores whether agents behave consistently across runs, withstand perturbations, fail predictably, or have bounded error severity. Grounded in safety-critical engineering, we provide a holistic performance profile by proposing twelve concrete metrics that decompose agent reliability along four key dimensions: consistency, robustness, predictability, and safety. Evaluating 14 agentic models across two complementary benchmarks, we find that recent capability gains have only yielded small improvements in reliability. By exposing these persistent limitations, our metrics complement traditional evaluations while offering tools for reasoning about how agents perform, degrade, and fail."

    "abstract": "p-spin glasses, characterized by frustrated many-body interactions beyond the conventional pairwise case (p>2), are prototypical disordered systems whose ground-state search is NP-hard and computationally prohibitive for large instances. Solving this problem is not only fundamental for understanding high-order disorder, structural glasses, and topological phases, but also central to a wide spectrum of hard combinatorial optimization tasks. Despite decades of progress, there still lacks an efficient and scalable solver for generic large-scale p-spin models. Here we introduce PLANCK, a physics-inspired deep reinforcement learning framework built on hypergraph neural networks. PLANCK directly optimizes arbitrary high-order interactions, and systematically exploits gauge symmetry throughout both training and inference. Trained exclusively on small synthetic instances, PLANCK exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to systems orders of magnitude larger, and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art thermal annealing methods across all tested structural topologies and coupling distributions. Moreover, without any modification, PLANCK achieves near-optimal solutions for a broad class of NP-hard combinatorial problems, including random k-XORSAT, hypergraph max-cut, and conventional max-cut. The presented framework provides a physics-inspired algorithmic paradigm that bridges statistical mechanics and reinforcement learning. The symmetry-aware design not only advances the tractable frontiers of high-order disordered systems, but also opens a promising avenue for machine-learning-based solvers to tackle previously intractable combinatorial optimization challenges."

Here, we report on an efficient evaporative cooling in two-crossed laser beams during parabolic flights. Time-averaged potentials combine the advantages of large capture volume and trap compression, increasing the initial phase space density and collision rate to favor the evaporative process. With this technique we demonstrate the production of an ultra cold gas of $2.5\\times 10^4$ rubidium atoms at a temperature below 100 nK in less than 4 seconds.

    "abstract": "Neural Collapse (NC) refers to the emergence of highly symmetric geometric structures in the representations of deep neural networks during the terminal phase of training. Despite its prevalence, the theoretical understanding of NC remains limited. Existing analyses largely ignore the role of the optimizer, thereby suggesting that NC is universal across optimization methods. In this work, we challenge this assumption and demonstrate that the choice of optimizer plays a critical role in the emergence of NC. The phenomenon is typically quantified through NC metrics, which, however, are difficult to track and analyze theoretically. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel diagnostic metric, NC0, whose convergence to zero is a necessary condition for NC. Using NC0, we provide theoretical evidence that NC cannot emerge under decoupled weight decay in adaptive optimizers, as implemented in AdamW. Concretely, we prove that SGD, SignGD with coupled weight decay (a special case of Adam), and SignGD with decoupled weight decay (a special case of AdamW) exhibit qualitatively different NC0 dynamics. Also, we show the accelerating effect of momentum on NC (beyond convergence of train loss) when trained with SGD, being the first result concerning momentum in the context of NC. Finally, we conduct extensive empirical experiments consisting of 3,900 training runs across various datasets, architectures, optimizers, and hyperparameters, confirming our theoretical results. This work provides the first theoretical explanation for optimizer-dependent emergence of NC and highlights the overlooked role of weight-decay coupling in shaping the implicit biases of optimizers."

This problem was first considered in a 2006 work of Hammett and Pittel, which showed an exponential lower bound and a polynomial upper bound. The lower bound was very recently improved to the subexponential bound of $\\exp(-n^{1/2 + o(1)})$ by Boretsky, Cornejo, Hodges, Horn, Lesnevich, and McAllister.

We present the first determination of the saturation length of SM using experimental and numerical results. The saturation length is the distance over which wakefields reach their maximum amplitude along the plasma. By varying the plasma length and measuring the radius of the transverse distribution of the bunch, we find that the saturation length of SM decreases with plasma density and initial field amplitude, e.g., when seeding. The saturation length is a fundamental parameter of the instability, and these results are key for understanding SM and designing plasma wakefield accelerators driven by long bunches, such as AWAKE, or by long laser pulses for radiation production."

Wavefront tomography is a technique that uses multiple wavefront measurements from various viewing angles to non-invasively measure the 3D density field of a turbulent medium. Existing methods make strong assumptions, such as a spline basis representation, to address the ill-conditioned nature of this problem. We formulate this problem as a Bayesian, sparse-view tomographic reconstruction problem and develop a model-based iterative reconstruction algorithm for measuring the volumetric 3D density field inside a wind tunnel. We call this method WindDensity-MBIR and apply it using simulated data to difficult reconstruction scenarios with sparse data, small projection field of view, and limited angular extent. WindDensity-MBIR can recover high-order features in these scenarios within 10% to 25% error even when the tip, tilt, and piston are removed from the wavefront measurements."

In this work, we study several recently proposed pooling construction methods, as well as a variety of pooled high-throughput screening analysis methods, in order to provide guidance to practitioners on which methods to use. This is done in the context of an application of the methods to the search for new drugs to combat bacterial infection. We discuss both an extensive pilot study as well as a small screening campaign, and highlight both the successes and challenges of the pooling approach."

In this work, we demonstrate quantum teleportation over Deutsche Telekom's metropolitan fiber testbed in Berlin using commercial components deployed at the telecom datacenter. A local Bell-state measurement between 795 nm photons from a weak coherent source and from a bichromatic warm-atom entangled photon source enables conditional state transfer onto an O-band photon, which is transmitted through a 30-km field-deployed fiber loop under real-world environmental conditions. The teleported state is reconstructed after propagation via state tomography, achieving an average teleportation fidelity of 90\\% on the deployed link.

As shown in Li and Song (2017), it enjoys a convergence rate that is independent of the dimension of the predictor, thus avoiding the curse of dimensionality. In this paper we establish an improved convergence rate of GSIR under additional mild eigenvalue decay rate and smoothness conditions. Our convergence rate can be made arbitrarily close to $n^{-1/3}$ under appropriate decay rate and smoothness parameters. As a comparison, the rate of Li and Song (2017) is $n^{-1/4}$ under the best conditions. This improvement is significant because, for example, in a semiparametric estimation problem involving an infinite-dimensional nuisance parameter, the convergence rate of the estimator of the nuisance parameter is often required to be faster than $n^{-1/4}$ to guarantee desired semiparametric properties such as asymptotic efficiency. This can be achieved by the improved convergence rate, but not by the original rate. The sharpened convergence rate can also be established for GSIR in more general settings, such as functional sufficient dimension reduction."

Thus, exploiting the model dynamics to create stronger Membership Inference (MI) attacks and tighter privacy audits are timely questions. Though the literature empirically shows that using a sequence of model updates can increase the power of MI attacks, rigorous analysis of the `optimal' MI attacks is limited to static models with infinite samples. Hence, we develop an `optimal' MI attack, SeMI*, that uses the sequence of model updates to identify the presence of a target inserted at a certain update step. For the empirical mean computation, we derive the optimal power of SeMI*, while accessing a finite number of samples with or without privacy. Our results retrieve the existing asymptotic analysis. We observe that having access to the model sequence avoids the dilution of MI signals unlike the existing attacks on the final model, where the MI signal vanishes as training data accumulates. Furthermore, an adversary can use SeMI* to tune both the insertion time and the canary to yield tighter privacy audits. Finally, we conduct experiments across data distributions and models trained or fine-tuned with DP-SGD demonstrating that practical variants of SeMI* lead to tighter privacy audits than the baselines."

Adults with at least 6 months of valid wearable data in the year before diagnosis were eligible. Incident MDD cases were matched to controls on age, sex, body mass index, and index time (up to four controls per case). Daily step counts and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) were aggregated into monthly averages. Linear mixed-effects models compared trajectories from 12 months before diagnosis to diagnosis. Within cases, contrasts identified when activity first significantly deviated from levels 12 months prior. The cohort included 4,104 participants (829 cases and 3,275 controls; 81.7% women; median age 48.4 years). Compared with controls, cases showed consistently lower activity and significant downward trajectories in both step counts and MVPA during the year before diagnosis (P < 0.001). Significant declines appeared about 4 months before diagnosis for step counts and 5 months for MVPA. Exploratory analyses suggested subgroup differences, including steeper declines in men, greater intensity reductions at older ages, and persistently low activity among individuals with obesity. Sustained within-person declines in physical activity emerged months before incident MDD diagnosis.

Trained on 18,588 basins curated from the CARAVAN dataset, AIFL utilises a novel two-stage training strategy to bridge the reanalysis-to-forecast domain shift. The model is first pre-trained on 40 years of ERA5-Land reanalysis (1980-2019) to capture robust hydrological processes, then fine-tuned on operational Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) control forecasts (2016-2019) to adapt to the specific error structures and biases of operational numerical weather prediction. To our knowledge, this is the first global model trained end-to-end within the CARAVAN ecosystem. On an independent temporal test set (2021-2024), AIFL achieves high predictive skill with a median modified Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE') of 0.66 and a median Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of 0.53. Benchmarking results show that AIFL is highly competitive with current state-of-the-art global systems, achieving comparable accuracy while maintaining a transparent and reproducible forcing pipeline. The model demonstrates exceptional reliability in extreme-event detection, providing a streamlined and operationally robust baseline for the global hydrological community."

Ultimately, our methodology offers novel insights on urban micro-mobility management, helping to tackle the challenges arising from rapid urbanization and thus, contributing to more sustainable, efficient, and livable cities."

    "abstract": "Inference-time algorithms are an emerging paradigm in which pre-trained models are used as subroutines to solve downstream tasks. Such algorithms have been proposed for tasks ranging from inverse problems and guided image generation to reasoning. However, the methods currently deployed in practice are heuristics with a variety of failure modes -- and we have very little understanding of when these heuristics can be efficiently improved. In this paper, we consider the task of sampling from a reward-tilted diffusion model -- that is, sampling from $p^{\\star}(x) \\propto p(x) \\exp(r(x))$ -- given a reward function $r$ and pre-trained diffusion oracle for $p$. We provide a fine-grained analysis of the computational tractability of this task for quadratic rewards $r(x) = x^\\top A x + b^\\top x$. We show that linear-reward tilts are always efficiently sampleable -- a simple result that seems to have gone unnoticed in the literature. We use this as a building block, along with a conceptually new ingredient -- the Hubbard-Stratonovich transform -- to provide an efficient algorithm for sampling from low-rank positive-definite quadratic tilts, i.e. $r(x) = x^\\top A x$ where $A$ is positive-definite and of rank $O(1)$. For negative-definite tilts, i.e. $r(x) = - x^\\top A x$ where $A$ is positive-definite, we prove that the problem is intractable even if $A$ is of rank 1 (albeit with exponentially-large entries)."

    "abstract": "White dwarfs (WDs), the evolutionary endpoints of most stars, can form through both single-star and binary channels. While single-star evolutionary models enable reliable WD age estimates, binary evolution introduces interactions that can accelerate WD formation and result in a variety of exotic WDs, which may exhibit strong magnetic fields, rapid rotation, or even serve as potential gravitational wave sources. Such systems offer valuable insights into magnetic field generation, angular momentum evolution, and compact object physics. Star clusters, with their approximately coeval populations, allow precise age determination of member WDs. If a WD's total age derived from single-star evolution exceeds that of its host cluster, it likely indicates a binary origin. In this study, we use \\textit{Gaia} 5D astrometry to identify 439 WD candidates in 117 open clusters, with 244 likely formed via binary evolution. We discuss the possibility of dynamical ejection for WDs meeting only 2D (proper motion space) membership criteria. Spectroscopic observations further reveal a subset with strong magnetic fields and rapid rotation, supporting their binary evolutionary origin."

    "abstract": "Channeling radiation in oriented crystals arises from transitions between quantized transverse bound states in the MeV regime and is strongly affected by thermal diffuse scattering through population transfer and decoherence. A frozen-phonon multislice propagation framework is developed to track a reduced transverse Hilbert space spanned by selected bound-state manifolds using configuration-resolved projection amplitudes. Beyond reproducing transition energies, the method yields reduced manifold density matrices, thermal population kinetics, and depth-resolved coherence metrics. Applied to axial electron channeling in $\\langle100\\rangle$ diamond at 16.9 MeV, the results show approximately exponential population loss with strongly state-dependent feeding among low-lying manifolds. For an initial coherent superposition in the degenerate 2p manifold, the intra-manifold purity relaxes toward the maximally mixed limit, consistent with thermally induced random basis rotations. Under 1s initial excitation, population transferred into the 2p and 3d manifolds remains close to maximally mixed, while weak cross-manifold coherences persist. The framework enables quantitative analysis of thermal population dynamics, decoherence, and their links to spontaneous and coherently driven emission observables across a broad range of crystal structures."

Rather than relying on a single model selected by an arbitrary criterion, the MSCS identifies a set of models that are statistically indistinguishable from the true data-generating process at a given confidence level. The size and composition of this set reveal crucial information about model selection uncertainty: noisy data scenarios produce larger sets with many candidate models, while more informative cases narrow the set considerably. To study the importance of each model term, we consider numerical statistics measuring the frequency with which each term is included in both the entire MSCS and in Lower Boundary Models (LBM), its most parsimonious specifications. Applied to Italian hourly electricity load data, the MSCS methodology reveals marked intraday variation in model selection uncertainty and isolates a collection of model specifications that deliver competitive short-term forecasts while highlighting key drivers of electricity load like intraday hourly lags, temperature, calendar effects and solar energy generation."

Many attacks exploit long-context hiding, semantic camouflage, and lightweight obfuscations that can evade single-pass guardrails. We present RLM-JB, an end-to-end jailbreak detection framework built on Recursive Language Models (RLMs), in which a root model orchestrates a bounded analysis program that transforms the input, queries worker models over covered segments, and aggregates evidence into an auditable decision. RLM-JB treats detection as a procedure rather than a one-shot classification: it normalizes and de-obfuscates suspicious inputs, chunks text to reduce context dilution and guarantee coverage, performs parallel chunk screening, and composes cross-chunk signals to recover split-payload attacks. On AutoDAN-style adversarial inputs, RLM-JB achieves high detection effectiveness across three LLM backends (ASR/Recall 92.5-98.0%) while maintaining very high precision (98.99-100%) and low false positive rates (0.0-2.0%), highlighting a practical sensitivity-specificity trade-off as the screening backend changes."

    "abstract": "Reliable fall recovery is critical for humanoids operating in cluttered environments. Unlike quadrupeds or wheeled robots, humanoids experience high-energy impacts, complex whole-body contact, and large viewpoint changes during a fall, making recovery essential for continued operation. Existing methods fragment fall safety into separate problems such as fall avoidance, impact mitigation, and stand-up recovery, or rely on end-to-end policies trained without vision through reinforcement learning or imitation learning, often on flat terrain. At a deeper level, fall safety is treated as monolithic data complexity, coupling pose, dynamics, and terrain and requiring exhaustive coverage, limiting scalability and generalization. We present a unified fall safety approach that spans all phases of fall recovery. It builds on two insights: 1) Natural human fall and recovery poses are highly constrained and transferable from flat to complex terrain through alignment, and 2) Fast whole-body reactions require integrated perceptual-motor representations. We train a privileged teacher using sparse human demonstrations on flat terrain and simulated complex terrains, and distill it into a deployable student that relies only on egocentric depth and proprioception. The student learns how to react by matching the teacher's goal-in-context latent representation, which combines the next target pose with the local terrain, rather than separately encoding what it must perceive and how it must act. Results in simulation and on a real Unitree G1 humanoid demonstrate robust, zero-shot fall safety across diverse non-flat environments without real-world fine-tuning.

    "abstract": "The vast majority of biological sequences encode unknown functions and bear little resemblance to experimentally characterized proteins, limiting both our understanding of biology and our ability to harness functional potential for the bioeconomy. Predicting enzyme function from sequence remains a central challenge in computational biology, complicated by low sequence diversity and imbalanced label support in publicly available datasets. Models trained on these data can overestimate performance and fail to generalize. To address this, we introduce GRIMM (Genetic stRatification for Inference in Molecular Modeling), a benchmark for enzyme function prediction that employs genetic stratification: sequences are clustered by similarity and clusters are assigned exclusively to training, validation, or test sets. This ensures that sequences from the same cluster do not appear in multiple partitions. GRIMM produces multiple test sets: a closed-set test with the same label distribution as training (Test-1) and an open-set test containing novel labels (Test-2), serving as a realistic out-of-distribution proxy for discovering novel enzyme functions. While demonstrated on enzymes, this approach is generalizable to any sequence-based classification task where inputs can be clustered by similarity. By formalizing a splitting strategy often used implicitly, GRIMM provides a unified and reproducible framework for closed- and open-set evaluation. The method is lightweight, requiring only sequence clustering and label annotations, and can be adapted to different similarity thresholds, data scales, and biological tasks. GRIMM enables more realistic evaluation of functional prediction models on both familiar and unseen classes and establishes a benchmark that more faithfully assesses model performance and generalizability."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) often struggle to learn from corrective feedback within a conversational context. They are rarely proactive in soliciting this feedback, even when faced with ambiguity, which can make their dialogues feel static, one-sided, and lacking the adaptive qualities of human conversation. To address these limitations, we draw inspiration from social meta-learning (SML) in humans - the process of learning how to learn from others. We formulate SML as a finetuning methodology, training LLMs to solicit and learn from language feedback in simulated pedagogical dialogues, where static tasks are converted into interactive social learning problems. SML effectively teaches models to use conversation to solve problems they are unable to solve in a single turn. This capability generalises across domains; SML on math problems produces models that better use feedback to solve coding problems and vice versa. Furthermore, despite being trained only on fully-specified problems, these models are better able to solve underspecified tasks where critical information is revealed over multiple turns. When faced with this ambiguity, SML-trained models make fewer premature answer attempts and are more likely to ask for the information they need. This work presents a scalable approach to developing AI systems that effectively learn from language feedback."

Numerical simulations reveal a non-trivial topological transition (TT) in the $(Δ, m)$ plane, marking a change from a topologically trivial regime to non-trivial topology. This transition signals the emergence of topological complexity in the model, where higher-order structures develop self-similarly across scales. Beyond this transition, the network exhibits self-similar topological growth, evidenced by a power-law decay in the increments of $Δ$-simplices with $m$-dependent exponents. An analogous transition occurs in the Betti numbers, which display self-similar behavior near the TT and an arctangent dependence farther from it. Based on simulation data, we propose explicit scaling relations describing the behavior of both $Δ$-simplices and Betti numbers near the TT. Overall, the analysis reveals a rich, gapful topological transition structure, where topological quantities exhibit discrete jumps at the transition point."

We explore the use of large language models (LLMs) as imperfect experts for Causal ABA, eliciting semantic structural priors from variable names and descriptions and integrating them with conditional-independence evidence.

The core device is an additive-offset identity: if $W_λ$ solves the discounted travel-cost Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equation, then $W_\\varepsilon:=W_λ+ \\varepsilon$ solves the same PDE with a constant offset $λ\\varepsilon$. This means that a uniform value error is \\emph{exactly} equal to a constant HJB offset. We establish this uniform value error via two routes: (A) a Bellman operator-residual bound, and (B) a HJB PDE-slack bound. Our framework preserves HJ-level safety semantics and is compatible with deep RL. We demonstrate the approach on a double-integrator system by formally certifying, via satisfiability modulo theories (SMT), a value function learned through reinforcement learning to induce provably correct inner and outer backward-reachable set enclosures over a compact region of interest."

Finite contacts with explicit boundary terminations exhibit substantially higher friction yet remain load independent up to a critical load. Load dependence arises only when elastic out-of-plane deformation near the contact line exceeds a critical amplitude, activating additional dissipation channels. These results demonstrate that contact geometry and local elastic compliance, rather than normal load itself, determine the onset and breakdown of load-independent structural lubricity."

Here, we introduce an artificial Kagome superlattice in bilayer graphene, engineered via nanopatterning of the dielectric substrate to create a precisely defined and electrostatically tunable periodic potential. Magnetotransport measurements reveal the emergence of a stack of correlated insulating states at moderate superlattice potentials, characteristic of strong electron-electron interactions within Kagome-induced flat bands. As temperature increases, these correlated gaps collapse, signaling the thermal suppression of interaction-driven states. Continuum-model calculations confirm the formation of multiple flat minibands and reproduce the observed evolution of band reconstruction.

Here we show that urban structural damage exhibits phase-transition phenomena. As hazard intensity increases, the system can shift abruptly from a largely safe to a largely damaged state, analogous to a first-order phase transition in statistical physics. Higher diversity in the building portfolio smooths this transition, but multiscale damage clustering traps the system in an extended critical-like regime (analogous to a Griffiths phase), suppressing the emergence of a more predictable disordered (Gaussian) phase. These phenomenological patterns are characterized by a random-field Ising model, with the external field, disorder strength, and temperature interpreted as the effective hazard demand, structural diversity, and modeling uncertainty, respectively. Applying this framework to real urban inventories reveals that widely used engineering modeling practices can shift urban damage patterns between synchronized and volatile regimes, systematically biasing exceedance-based risk metrics by up to 50% under moderate earthquakes ($M_w \\approx 5.5$--$6.0$), equivalent to a several-fold gap in repair costs. This phase-aware description turns the collective behavior of civil infrastructure damage into actionable diagnostics for urban risk assessment and planning."

    "abstract": "Operational disruptions in retail payments can induce behavioral responses that outlast technical recovery and may amplify liquidity stress. We propose a multi-agent model linking card payment outages to trust dynamics, channel avoidance, and threshold-gated withdrawals. Customers and merchants interact through repeated payment attempts, while customers additionally influence one another on a Watts-Strogatz small-world network. Customers update bounded memory variables capturing accumulated negative experience (scar) and perceived systemic risk (rumor), with merchants contributing persistent broadcast signals that may lag operational recovery. We prove that, under mild conditions on memory persistence and threshold gating, aggregate withdrawal pressure can peak strictly after the outage nadir, including during the recovery phase. Simulations reproduce behavioral hysteresis and confirm delayed peaks of outflows. We further study payment substitution via instant transfer: substitution consistently reduces peak avoidance, yet its effect on cumulative outflows is non-monotonic under realistic merchant broadcast persistence. Robustness experiments across random seeds show stable qualitative behavior. The model highlights why \"status green\" is not equivalent to risk resolution and motivates incident response strategies that address perception, merchant messaging, and post-recovery communication in addition to technical remediation."

    "abstract": "When strain-rate sensitivity (SRS) is negative in metallic glasses, the material becomes weaker as the deformation rate increases, leading to accelerated plastic deformation and, eventually, catastrophic fracture. In this study, we elucidate the mechanism underlying the negative SRS using micromechanics-based kinetic Monte Carlo simulations that couple heterogeneous randomized shear transformation zone (STZ) models for metallic glasses. The model accounted for both the thermomechanical structural rejuvenation and relaxation of the energy barrier for thermal activation of STZs, incorporating a Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts (KWW)-type relaxation function. The present simulations systematically reproduce the dependence of flow stresses on strain rate, temperature, and the form of the relaxation function. The SRS tends to decrease at high strain rates and low temperatures in the simulations, and negative SRS appears when a compressed-exponential relaxation function is employed. Shear localization also appears; however, the conditions under which the observed localization emerges do not fully coincide with those leading to the negative SRS, leaving the dominant factor unclear. To clarify the dominant factor, we introduce a simplified theoretical model that reproduces flow stresses consistent with the simulation results. An analytical expression derived from the theoretical model reveals that negative SRS originates primarily from the temporal evolution of the activation barrier. Specifically, negative SRS arises when the timescale of external loading exceeds that of STZ relaxation."

    "abstract": "Mobile edge computing (MEC) based wireless metaverse services offer an untethered, immersive experience to users, where the superior quality of experience (QoE) needs to be achieved under stringent latency constraints and visual quality demands. To achieve this, MEC-based intelligent resource allocation for virtual reality users needs to be supported by coordination across MEC servers to harness distributed data. Federated learning (FL) is a promising solution, and can be combined with reinforcement learning (RL) to develop generalized policies across MEC-servers. However, conventional FL incurs transmitting the full model parameters across the MEC-servers and the cloud, and suffer performance degradation due to naive global aggregation, especially in heterogeneous multi-radio access technology environments. To address these challenges, this paper proposes Federated Split Decision Transformer (FSDT), an offline RL framework where the transformer model is partitioned between MEC servers and the cloud. Agent-specific components (e.g., MEC-based embedding and prediction layers) enable local adaptability, while shared global layers in the cloud facilitate cooperative training across MEC servers. Experimental results demonstrate that FSDT enhances QoE for up to 10% in heterogeneous environments compared to baselines, while offloadingnearly 98% of the transformer model parameters to the cloud, thereby reducing the computational burden on MEC servers."

    "abstract": "Facility location problems (FLPs) are a family of optimisation problems with significant social impact. This class of problems has been the subject of study since the 1960s, with classical approaches including the Weber problem and the p-Median problem. Currently, more complex variations of these problems are being investigated. In particular, the Induced p-Median Problem with Upgrades (IpMU) represents a variation of the classical p-Median problem, where the concepts of transport cost and time are separated as distinct metrics in the input graph of the problem. Furthermore, the problem includes a budget which allows one to relax the graph costs, reducing the cost of the edges, thus improving the associated routes between the designated medians and the customers. In this study, a metaheuristic algorithm, based on the Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP), is proposed. A two-phase resolution scheme is defined, studying the median problem and the upgrading problem independently. In this approach, a larger set of state-of-the-art instances was analysed to ensure a fair comparison with previous proposals. In addition, the characteristics of the instances were studied to assess their complexity. The results obtained are promising when compared to the state-of-the-art, which is based entirely on mathematical programming models. The execution time was improved on average by two orders of magnitude for the harder instances, and the best known result was obtained in more than 99% of the tested instances."

In this survey, we examine NLP research papers that explicitly address the relationship between LGBTQIA+ communities and NLP technologies. We systematically review all such papers published in the ACL Anthology, to answer the following research questions: (1) What are current research trends? (2) What gaps exist in terms of topics and methods? (3) What areas are open for future work? We find that while the number of papers on queer NLP has grown within the last few years, most papers take a reactive rather than a proactive approach, pointing out bias more often than mitigating it, and focusing on shortcomings of existing systems rather than creating new solutions. Our survey uncovers many opportunities for future work, especially regarding stakeholder involvement, intersectionality, interdisciplinarity, and languages other than English. We also offer an outlook from a queer studies perspective, highlighting understudied topics and gaps in the harms addressed in NLP papers. Beyond being a roadmap of what has been done, this survey is a call to action for work towards more just and inclusive NLP technologies."

We examine whether identical edit instructions yield systematically different outcomes across subject demographics in open-weight I2I editors. We formalize two failure modes: Soft Erasure, where edits are silently weakened or ignored in the output image, and Stereotype Replacement, where edits introduce unrequested, stereotype-consistent attributes. We introduce a controlled benchmark that probes demographic-conditioned behavior by generating and editing portraits conditioned on race, gender, and age using a diagnostic prompt set, and evaluate multiple editors with vision-language model (VLM) scoring and human evaluation. Our analysis shows that identity preservation failures are pervasive, demographically uneven, and shaped by implicit social priors, including occupation-driven gender inference. Finally, we demonstrate that a prompt-level identity constraint, without model updates, can substantially reduce demographic change for minority groups while leaving majority-group portraits largely unchanged, revealing asymmetric identity priors in current editors. Together, our findings establish identity preservation as a central and demographically uneven failure mode in I2I editing and motivate demographic-robust editing systems.

    "abstract": "There are a number of existing studies analysing the convergence behaviour of graph neural networks on large random graphs. Unfortunately, the majority of these studies do not model correlations between node features, which would naturally exist in a variety of real-life networks. Consequently, the derived limitations of GNNs, resulting from such convergence behaviour, is not truly reflective of the expressive power of GNNs when applied to realistic graphs. In this paper, we will introduce a novel method to generate random graphs that have correlated node features. The node features will be sampled in such a manner to ensure correlation between neighbouring nodes. As motivation for our choice of sampling scheme, we will appeal to properties exhibited by real-life graphs, particularly properties that are captured by the Barabási-Albert model. A theoretical analysis will strongly indicate that convergence can be avoided in some cases, which we will empirically validate on large random graphs generated using our novel method. The observed divergent behaviour provides evidence that GNNs may be more expressive than initial studies would suggest, especially on realistic graphs."

In this work, we show that classical symmetries can be systematically exploited as a design principle for QAOA. Focusing on the MaxCut problem with global bit-flip symmetry, we analyze reduced QAOA instances obtained by fixing a single variable and study how this choice affects the associated DLAs. We show that the structure of the DLAs can change dramatically depending on which variable is held fixed. In particular, we construct explicit examples where the dimension collapses from exponential to quadratic, uncovering phenomena that do not appear in the original formulation. Numerical experiments on asymmetric graphs indicate that such reductions often produce DLAs of much smaller dimension, suggesting improved trainability. We also prove that any graph can be embedded into a slightly larger one (requiring only quadratic overhead) such that the standard reduced DLA coincides with the free reduced DLA, in most cases implying exponential dimension and irreducibility on the Hilbert space for reduced QAOA instances. These results establish symmetry-aware reduction as a principled tool for designing expressive and potentially trainable QAOA circuits."

We then focus on Nested Logit choice models, which cluster items into \"nests\" of close substitutes. Whereas existing Nested Logit estimation procedures assume the nests to be known and fixed, we present a new algorithm to identify nests based on collected data, which when used in conjunction with our experiment design, guarantees correct identification of nests under any Nested Logit ground truth. Our experiment design was deployed to collect data from over 70 million users at Dream11, an Indian fantasy sports platform that offers different types of betting contests, with rich substitution patterns between them. We identify nests based on the collected data, which lead to better out-of-sample choice prediction than ex-ante clustering from contest features. Our identified nests are ex-post justifiable to Dream11 management."

Crucially, it reconstructs full 3D geometries including bond angles, overcoming the limitations of 1D radial distribution analysis. The model demonstrates robust out-of-distribution generalization, accurately predicting local structures in amorphous systems despite being trained exclusively on crystalline lattices. Application to experimental O K-edge spectra from α-quartz validates practical applicability.

Most existing work includes all related data sources via simultaneously training a common feature extractor and source-specific heads. It is well understood that data sources with low relevance or poor quality may hinder representation learning. In this paper, we further dive into the question of which data sources should be learned jointly by focusing on the traditionally deemed ``good'' collection of sources, in which individual sources have similar relevance and qualities with respect to the true underlying common structure. Towards tractability, we focus on the linear setting where sources share a low-dimensional subspace. We find that source screening can play a central role in statistically optimal subspace estimation. We show that, for a broad class of problem instances, training on a carefully selected subset of sources suffices to achieve minimax optimality, even when a substantial portion of data is discarded. We formalize the notion of an informative subpopulation, develop algorithms and practical heuristics for identifying such subsets, and validate their effectiveness through both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets."

Retrieval-Augmented Generation attempts to bridge this gap by surfacing relevant documents at inference time, yet similarity-based retrieval often fails to identify context that actually improves task performance. We introduce Evolutionary Context Search (ECS), an evolutionary method that searches context combinations using accuracy on a small development set, requiring only inference calls without weight updates. ECS moves beyond semantic similarity to discover non-obvious context pairings that significantly boost performance. Our empirical results show that ECS improves BackendBench by 27\\% and $τ$-bench airline by 7\\%. The evolved contexts are model-agnostic, as those evolved with Gemini-3-Flash transfer effectively to Claude Sonnet and DeepSeek.

    "abstract": "The increasing development of wireless communication bands has motivated the development of compact, low-loss, and frequency adjustable RF filtering technologies. Acoustic resonators are the ideal solution to these requirements, and tunable implementations offer a path toward reconfigurable front ends. In this work, we investigate epitaxial barium titanate (BTO) grown on silicon as a platform for tunable acoustic resonators operating in the sub-GHz regime. We demonstrate lateral excitation of symmetric lamb (S0) modes in X-cut BTO membranes, in contrast to prior thickness-defined ferroelectric resonators. Devices are designed using finite-element simulations and fabricated with laterally patterned electrodes that enable overtone coupling to multiple resonant modes. Under applied DC bias, ferroelectric domains align, allowing electrical excitation, frequency tuning, and quality-factor enhancement of acoustic modes. Resonances near 300 MHz and 700 MHz exhibit electromechanical coupling up to 8% and bias-dependent frequency tuning, with a distinct transition in behavior near 20 V. These results highlight monolithic BTO on silicon as a promising material system for laterally excited, tunable acoustic resonators for reconfigurable RF applications."

This phenomenon is known as translationese, and it reflects both traces of the source language and characteristic properties of translation itself. In this paper, we study how training on machine-translated data affects small English language models, focusing on how translationese from different source languages shapes linguistic acceptability judgments and language modelling for different domains. We train models on English text translated from 24 typologically and resource-diverse source languages, enabling a systematic analysis of how source language and corpus properties influence what models learn. Our results show that the source language has a clear impact on model behavior: general perplexity is more driven by the lexical diversity of the translated corpus, while grammatical performance is strongly correlated to typological similarity to English, given enough data."

    "abstract": "In long-term multivariate time series forecasting, effectively capturing both periodic patterns and residual dynamics is essential. To address this within standard deep learning benchmark settings, we propose the Hierarchical Patching Mixer (HPMixer), which models periodicity and residuals in a decoupled yet complementary manner. The periodic component utilizes a learnable cycle module [7] enhanced with a nonlinear channel-wise MLP for greater expressiveness. The residual component is processed through a Learnable Stationary Wavelet Transform (LSWT) to extract stable, shift-invariant frequency-domain representations. Subsequently, a channel-mixing encoder models explicit inter-channel dependencies, while a two-level non-overlapping hierarchical patching mechanism captures coarse- and fine-scale residual variations. By integrating decoupled periodicity modeling with structured, multi-scale residual learning, HPMixer provides an effective framework. Extensive experiments on standard multivariate benchmarks demonstrate that HPMixer achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance compared to recent baselines."

This regularity allows for efficient estimation of the conformal metric from a random point cloud with a relative error proportional to the Hausdorff distance between the point cloud and the original domain. We then establish convergence rates of order n^(-1/d) that are close to sharp when the intrinsic dimension d of the domain is large, for an estimator that can be computed in O(n^2 ) time.

We utilise an artificial cochlea that converts time-series signals into sparse event data, reducing memory and computation costs. Our architecture was implemented on a SoC FPGA and evaluated on two open-source datasets. For classification task, our baseline floating-point model achieves 92.7% accuracy on SHD dataset - only 2.4% below the state of the art - while requiring over 10x and 67x fewer parameters. On SSC, our models achieve 66.9-71.0% accuracy. Compared to FPGA-based spiking neural networks, our quantised model reaches 92.3% accuracy, outperforming them by up to 19.3% while reducing resource usage and latency. For SSC, we report the first hardware-accelerated evaluation. We further demonstrate the first end-to-end FPGA implementation of event-audio keyword spotting, combining graph convolutional layers with recurrent sequence modelling. The system achieves up to 95% word-end detection accuracy, with only 10.53 microsecond latency and 1.18 W power consumption, establishing a strong benchmark for energy-efficient event-driven KWS."

    "abstract": "The objective of automata learning is to reconstruct the implementation of a hidden automaton, to which only a teacher has access. The learner can ask certain kinds of queries to the teacher to gain more knowledge about the hidden automaton. The run-time of such a learning algorithm is then measured in the number of queries it takes until the hidden automaton is successfully reconstructed, which is usually parametric in the number of states of that hidden automaton. How can we prove such a run-time complexity of learning algorithms in a proof assistant if we do not have the hidden automaton and the number of states available? In the present paper, we solve this by considering learning algorithms themselves as generalized automata, more specifically as coalgebras. We introduce formal and yet compact definitions of what a learner and a teacher is, which make it easy to prove upper and lower bounds of different kinds of learning games in the proof assistant Agda. As a running example, we discuss the common number guessing game where a teacher thinks of a natural number and answers guesses by the learner with `correct', `too high', or `too low'. To demonstrate our framework, we formally prove in Agda that both the lower and upper bound on number of guesses by the learner is $\\mathcal{O}(\\log n)$, where $n$ is the teacher's secret number."

However such restrictions yield very different formulas to the canonical PSPACE-complete language of Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF). This is despite Bernays-Schoenfinkel having a natural connection to an extension of QBF known as Dependency QBF. Our main contribution is the definition of a PSPACE-complete sub-fragment of Bernays-Schoenfinkel that extends from a translation of QBF, retains a similar two-player game evaluation for its semantics and can be restricted in various ways to obtain other complete problems, particularly those at different levels in the polynomial hierarchy.

We consider the general setting with an alphabet of size $q$ and a resolution parameter $k$, moving beyond the binary ($q=2$) case primarily studied previously. We investigate error-correcting codes for substitution errors and deletion errors under several channel models, including $(e_1,\\ldots,e_k)$-composite error/deletion, $e$-composite error/deletion, and the newly introduced $t$-$(e_1,\\ldots,e_t)$-composite error/deletion model. We first establish equivalence relations among families of composite-error correcting codes (CECCs) and among families of composite-deletion correcting codes (CDCCs). This significantly reduces the number of distinct error-parameter sets that require separate analysis. We then derive novel and general upper bounds on the sizes of CECCs using refined sphere-packing arguments and probabilistic methods. These bounds together cover all values of parameters $q$, $k$, $(e_1,\\ldots,e_k)$ and $e$. In contrast, previous bounds were only established for $q=2$ and limited choices of $k$, $(e_1,\\ldots,e_k)$ and $e$. For CDCCs, we generalize a known non-asymptotic upper bound for $(1,0,\\ldots,0)$-CDCCs and then provide a cleaner asymptotic bound. On the constructive side, for any $q\\ge2$, we propose $(1,0,\\ldots,0)$-CDCCs, $1$-CDCCs and $t$-$(1,\\ldots,1)$-CDCCs with near-optimal redundancies. These codes have efficient and systematic encoders. For substitution errors, we design the first explicit encoding and decoding algorithms for the binary $(1,0,\\ldots,0)$-CECC constructed by Dollma \\emph{et al}, and extend the approach to general $q$. Furthermore, we give an improved construction of binary $1$-CECCs, a construction of nonbinary $1$-CECCs, and a construction of $t$-$(1,\\ldots,1)$-CECCs. These constructions are also systematic."

Dislocation loops are fundamental topological excitations that control the thermodynamic stability of crystals, yet their role in setting universal aspects of melting has remained unclear. Here we show, within dislocation-mediated melting theory, that the free-energy condition for loop proliferation leads to a universal ratio between the energy of a minimal dislocation loop and the thermal energy at melting. For minimal dislocation loops that begin to proliferate at the onset of melting, this ratio takes the purely geometric value $\\mathcal{E}_* = E_{\\rm loop}/(k_B T_m) \\approx 25.1$, independent of elastic moduli and chemistry-dependent details. This result provides a microscopic explanation for recent empirical findings by Lunkenheimer \\emph{et al.}, who identified a closely related universal energy scale $\\approx 24.6$ from viscosity data. The same framework also rationalizes the empirical $2/3$ rule relating the glass-transition and melting temperatures."

A key challenge in this setting is the extremely large cardinality of item spaces, which makes training generative models difficult and introduces a vocabulary gap between natural language and item identifiers. Semantic identifiers (semantic IDs), which represent items as sequences of low-cardinality tokens, have recently emerged as an effective solution to this problem. However, existing approaches generate semantic identifiers of fixed length, assigning the same description length to all items. This is inefficient, misaligned with natural language, and ignores the highly skewed frequency structure of real-world catalogs, where popular items and rare long-tail items exhibit fundamentally different information requirements. In parallel, the emergent communication literature studies how agents develop discrete communication protocols, often producing variable-length messages in which frequent concepts receive shorter descriptions. Despite the conceptual similarity, these ideas have not been systematically adopted in recommender systems. In this work, we bridge recommender systems and emergent communication by introducing variable-length semantic identifiers for recommendation. We propose a discrete variational autoencoder with Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization that learns item representations of adaptive length under a principled probabilistic framework, avoiding the instability of REINFORCE-based training and the fixed-length constraints of prior semantic ID methods."

While ensuring safe and high-performance inter-robot collaboration is critical for effective task execution, it is difficult to pursue in narrow environments where the feasible region is extremely limited. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach for dual-quadruped collaborative transportation via safe reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we model the task as a fully cooperative constrained Markov game, where collision avoidance is formulated as constraints. We introduce a cost-advantage decomposition method that enforces the sum of team constraints to remain below an upper bound, thereby guaranteeing task safety within an RL framework. Furthermore, we propose a constraint allocation method that assigns shared constraints to individual robots to maximize the overall task reward, encouraging autonomous task-assignment among robots, thereby improving collaborative task performance. Simulation and real-time experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior performance and a higher success rate in dual-quadruped collaborative transportation compared to existing methods."

Their performance relies on ultra-stable, narrow-linewidth lasers, frequency stabilized to a compact portable optical cavity. Among various designs, the cubic spacer-based ultra-stable cavity is particularly well-suited for transportable applications due to its low sensitivity to vibrations, owing to its symmetric geometry and robust mounting structure. While longer cavities offer a lower fundamental thermal noise floor, one needs to strike a balance between transportability and size. In this aspect, the 7.5 cm dual-axis cubic cavity offers a lower fundamental thermal noise floor in comparison to smaller counterparts, while still retaining a reasonable SWaP (Size, Weight and Power) for terrestrial and aerial PNT applications. Its dual-axis design also enables multi-wavelength laser stabilization, making it a promising candidate for future transportable clock applications. This work presents a detailed study of the 7.5 cm dual-axis cubic cavity using FEM (Finite Element Method) to evaluate its mechanical and thermal stability. We analyze the impact of various geometric factors, mounting forces, and machining imperfections, while also modelling thermal effects such as conduction, radiation, and mirror heating within a vacuum chamber and thermally shielded environment. Our findings provide design insights for developing robust dual-axis optical reference cavities, advancing the deployment of portable atomic clocks for next-generation applications in PNT, geodesy, VLBI (Very Long Baseline Interferometry) and deep space missions."

Second, we propose an end-to-end multimodal finetuning approach with a thinking mode, which allows audio-language models to produce explicit intermediate reasoning steps before predicting an answer. Third, we investigate the impact of query-conditioned source separation as a preprocessing stage and compare three inference regimes: no masking, an audio grounding model (AGM), and ground-truth masks. Our results show that reasoning amplifies the benefits of source separation, with thinking mode showing significant improvement of +5.1% when a single event is present in the question. These findings highlight the interplay between movement modeling, reasoning, and separation quality, offering new insights for advancing spatial audio understanding."

    "abstract": "One of the most well-known conjectures concerning Hamiltonicity in graphs asserts that any sufficiently large connected vertex transitive graph contains a Hamilton cycle. In this form, it was first written down by Thomassen in 1978, inspired by a closely related conjecture due to Lovász from 1969. It has been attributed to several other authors in a survey on the topic by Witte and Gallian in 1984. The analogous question for vertex transitive digraphs has an even longer history, having been first considered by Rankin in 1946. It is arguably more natural from the group-theoretic perspective underlying this problem in both settings. Trotter and Erdős proved in 1978 that there are infinitely many connected vertex transitive digraphs which are not Hamiltonian. This left open the very natural question of how long a directed cycle one can guarantee in a connected vertex transitive digraph on $n$ vertices. In 1981, Alspach asked if the maximum perimeter gap (the gap between the circumference and the order of the digraph) is a growing function in $n$. We answer this question in the affirmative, showing that it grows at least as fast as $(1-o(1)) \\ln n$. On the other hand, we prove that one can always find a directed cycle of length at least $Ω(n^{1/3})$, establishing the first lower bound growing with $n$, providing a directed analogue of a famous result of Babai from 1979 in the undirected setting."

Gaussian process (GP) models have proven effective in this context by choosing specialized covariance functions for QQ factors. In this work, we extend the latent variable-based GP approach, which maps qualitative factors into a continuous latent space, by establishing a general framework to apply standard kernel functions to continuous latent variables. This approach provides a novel perspective for interpreting some existing GP models for QQ factors and introduces new covariance structures in some situations. The ordinal structure can be incorporated naturally and seamlessly in this framework. Furthermore, the Bayesian information criterion and leave-one-out cross-validation are employed for model selection and model averaging. The performance of the proposed method is comprehensively studied on several examples."

The systemic effects of these loops remain poorly understood, in part due to unrealistic assumptions in existing simulation studies. We propose a feedback-loop model that captures implicit feedback, periodic retraining, probabilistic adoption of recommendations, and heterogeneous recommender systems. We apply the framework on online retail and music streaming data and analyze systemic effects of the feedback loop. We find that increasing recommender adoption may lead to a progressive diversification of individual consumption, while collective demand is redistributed in model- and domain-dependent ways, often amplifying popularity concentration. Temporal analyses further reveal that apparent increases in individual diversity observed in static evaluations are illusory: when adoption is fixed and time unfolds, individual diversity consistently decreases across all models. Our results highlight the need to move beyond static evaluations and explicitly account for feedback-loop dynamics when designing recommender systems."

Following impact, the droplet (with diameter $D_0=50$ or 70\\,$μ$m) undergoes rapid radial expansion and subsequent retraction, resulting in the formation of an axisymmetric jet. Using numerical simulations in tandem with our experiments, we reveal that a delicate interplay between radial flow and the curvature of the retracting droplet governs jet formation. The resulting dynamics is characterized using the impact Weber number, $\\We$ (in the experiments $2 \\lesssim \\We \\lesssim 16$), and a pressure width, W (typically $1 \\lesssim \\W \\lesssim 2$), which describes the angular distribution over the droplet surface of the instantaneous pressure impulse exerted by the transient laser-produced plasma. %, within the range $0-20$. For values $\\We<10$, the droplet presents a pronounced forward curvature during the retraction, leading to the formation of a cavity. The collapse of such a cavity leads to a singular jet that greatly enhances the jetting velocity up to ten times the impact propulsion velocity, an effect that narrowly peaks around $\\We\\sim6-8$, reminiscent of singular jets in droplet-solid impact. We identify a further sensitivity of the jet velocity enhancement on the pressure width W and capture the dynamics in a phase diagram connecting the various deformation morphologies with jet velocity."

    "abstract": "We study matching problems in which agents form one side of a bipartite graph and have preferences over objects on the other side. A central solution concept in this setting is popularity: a matching is popular if it is a (weak) Condorcet winner, meaning that no other matching is preferred by a strict majority of agents. It is well known, however, that Condorcet winners need not exist. We therefore turn to a natural and prominent relaxation. A set of matchings is a Condorcet-winning set if, for every competing matching, a majority of agents prefers their favorite matching in the set over the competitor. The Condorcet dimension is the smallest cardinality of a Condorcet-winning set. Our main results reveal a connection between Condorcet-winning sets and Pareto optimality. We show that any Pareto-optimal set of two matchings is, in particular, a Condorcet-winning set. This implication continues to hold when we impose matroid constraints on the set of matched objects, and even when agents' valuations are given as partial orders. The existence picture, however, changes sharply with partial orders. While for weak orders a Pareto-optimal set of two matchings always exists, this is -- surprisingly -- not the case under partial orders. Consequently, although the Condorcet dimension for matchings is 2 under weak orders (even under matroid constraints), this guarantee fails for partial orders: we prove that the Condorcet dimension is $Θ(\\sqrt{n})$, and rises further to $Θ(n)$ when matroid constraints are added. On the computational side, we show that, under partial orders, deciding whether there exists a Condorcet -- winning set of a given fixed size is NP-hard. The same holds for deciding the existence of a Pareto-optimal matching, which we believe to be of independent interest. Finally, we also show that the Condorcet dimension for a related problem on arborescences is also 2."

Furthermore, the distribution's parameters are generally not directly interpretable and not the key aim of the estimation. We present several orthogonal reparametrisations of the main extreme-value distributions, key in the modelling of rare events. In particular, we apply the theory developed in Cox and Reid (1987) to the Generalised Extreme-Value, Generalised Pareto, and Gumbel distributions.

Traditional frame tracers rely on mechanical tools that need precise positioning and calibration, which are time-consuming and require additional equipment, creating an inefficient workflow for opticians. This work presents a novel approach based on artificial vision that utilizes multi-view information. The proposed algorithm operates on images captured from an InVision system. The full pipeline includes image acquisition, frame segmentation to isolate the eyeframe from background, depth estimation to obtain 3D spatial information, and multi-view processing that integrates segmented RGB images with depth data for precise frame contour measurement. To this end, different configurations and variants are proposed and analyzed on real data, providing competitive measurements from still color images with respect to other solutions, while eliminating the need for specialized tracing equipment and reducing workflow complexity for optical technicians."

    "abstract": "We investigate a concept of passive, vibration-driven locomotion, in which a mechanical system achieves horizontal self-propulsion by resonantly harvesting energy from vertical environmental excitations (e.g. ambient vibrations of underwater pipelines), without a direct propulsive actuation. The system consists of a capsule containing an internal pendulum attached to its base mounted on a vertically vibrating substrate. The underlying locomotion mechanism relies on resonant energy transfer from the vertically vibrating substrate to the internal oscillatory element. Under appropriate forcing conditions and in the presence of asymmetric dissipative interactions, this internal oscillator induces a net unidirectional motion of the capsule. The analysis focuses on regimes of progressive motion arising in the vicinity of parametric resonances. Two asymptotic limits are considered: small-amplitude parametric excitation leading to a (2:1) resonant oscillatory motion of the pendulum, and large-amplitude excitation leading to a (1:1) resonant unidirectional rotational motion of the pendulum. Given the asymmetry of the dissipative force acting on the capsule, both resonant regimes result in a progressive motion of the capsule system. To identify optimal locomotion regimes in both cases, we employ tailored asymptotic approaches based on multi-scale expansions and direct averaging analysis. The resulting slow-flow and averaged-flow models reveal the full bifurcation structure of steady-state solutions associated with forward capsule motion for both low- and high- amplitude excitations. Analytical predictions are shown to be in good agreement with direct numerical simulations of the full capsule-pendulum system."

    "abstract": "Symplectic integrators are the established standard for long-term simulations of nearly-integrable Hamiltonian systems due to their preservation of geometric structures. However, they suffer from an inherent limitation: secular phase-shift errors. While the qualitative ''shape'' of invariant tori is preserved, the numerical solution gradually drifts along the torus, leading to a phase-lag accumulation that degrades long-term positional accuracy. Inspired by the Craig-Wayne-Bourgain (CWB) scheme, originally developed as an analytical tool for infinite-dimensional systems, we introduce a numerical operator that incorporates frequency updates into a dimension-enlarged Newton iteration to compute quasi-periodic solutions. Unlike conventional time-stepping integrators, our alternating numerical procedure eliminates phase-lag accumulation by directly solving for instantaneous positions and phase angles. Theoretically, provided sufficient computational resources, the phase error can be reduced arbitrarily, remaining independent of the total integration time. Our algorithm translates the Nash-Moser iteration into a practical numerical framework, marking a significant departure from traditional Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theory. While KAM provides rigorous existence proofs, its requirement for global Diophantine conditions and the total exclusion of resonant sets render it numerically inaccessible. By employing a ''step-by-step'' exclusion process and incrementally enlarging the dimension, our algorithm resolves irrationality conditions locally. This approach demonstrates that the ''numerical irrationality problem'' is not an intrinsic barrier to computation, offering a constructive, executable alternative to the non-executable nature of global KAM-based methods."

Recently, ring signatures have received additional attention as an ingredient for post-quantum deniable authenticated key exchange, e.g., for a post-quantum version of the Signal protocol, employed by virtually all end-to-end-encrypted messenger services. While several ring signature constructions from post-quantum assumptions offer suitable security and efficiency for use in deniable key exchange, they are currently proven secure in the random oracle model (ROM) only, which is insufficient for post-quantum security. In this work, we provide four security reductions in the quantum-accessible random oracle model (QROM) for two generic ring signature constructions: two for the AOS framework and two for a construction paradigm based on ring trapdoors, whose generic backbone we formalize. The two security proofs for AOS ring signatures differ in their requirements on the underlying sigma protocol and their tightness. The two reductions for the ring-trapdoor-based ring signatures exhibit various differences in requirements and the security they provide. We employ the measure-and-reprogram technique, QROM straightline extraction tools based on the compressed oracle, history-free reductions and QROM reprogramming tools. To make use of Rényi divergence properties in the QROM, we study the behavior of quantum algorithms that interact with an oracle whose distribution is based on one of two different distributions over the set of outputs. We provide tight bounds for the statistical distance, show that the Rényi divergence can not be used to replace the entire oracle and provide a workaround."

It is a key region to study how UV radiation from massive stars drive mass-loss in protoplanetary disks through photoevaporation. Far-UV photons (6<E<13.6 eV) heat up the gas of the disk, forming a photodissociation region (PDRs). We use the NIRCam images from the PDRs4All program combined with those of the GTO program 1256 to extract key information on ONC disks. Specifically, the radii of the disks observed in silhouette against the bright background , the presence and positions of the dissociation fronts (DFs), the presence and positions of ionization fronts (IFs), intensities of Pa $α$ lines, and their near IR SEDs. From those, we construct a typology for ONC disks: Type I show an IF and DF nearly merged at the disk surface; Type II have their DFs at the disk surface and IFs at a distance of several 10s of astronomical units from the disk; and Type III also have their DF at the disk surface, but show no IF. For all disks, we find that PAH emission traces the PDR. We establish that the SEDs of candidate JuMBOs observed as part of the PDRs4All program are similar to the SEDs of Type III ONC disks except for JuMBO24, which is of Type I or II. A detailed look at this SED shows it is compatible with a young low mass binary star with an unresolved ionized disk : a microproplyd binary. We observe that the disk radius of ONC disks increases with increasing projected distance to the ionizing source interpreted as evidence of the truncation of the disks by the photoevaporation. The disk radii measured at IR wavelengths appear larger than at millimeter wavelengths, interpreted as evidence of the dust radial segregation within the disks. The thermal pressure within the PDRs of ONC disk increases with the FUV radiation field, but with a flatter slope."

To reveal performance degradations and method-specific differences in robustness that are hidden under standard machine-wise evaluation, we consider a minimal modification of the ASD evaluation protocol in which test recordings from multiple machines are merged and evaluated jointly without access to machine identity at inference time. Training data and evaluation metrics remain unchanged, and machine identity labels are used only for post hoc evaluation. Experiments with representative ASD methods show that relaxing this assumption reveals performance degradations and method-specific differences in robustness that are hidden under standard machine-wise evaluation, and that these degradations are strongly related to implicit machine identification accuracy."

However, these two material properties are intrinsically linked through the empirical Moss rule, which states that the refractive index of a dielectric decreases as its band gap energy increases. Materials that surpass this rule, termed super-Mossian dielectrics, combine large refractive indices with wide optical transparency and are therefore ideal candidates for advanced photonic applications. This Review surveys the expanding landscape of high-index dielectric and semiconductor materials, with a particular focus on those that surpass the Moss rule. We discuss how electronic band structures with a large joint density of states near the band edge give rise to super-Mossian behavior and how first-principles computational screening can accelerate their discovery. Finally, we establish how the refractive index sets the performance limits of nanoresonators, waveguides, and metasurfaces, highlighting super-Mossian dielectrics as a promising route toward the next performance leap in photonic technologies."

We study this family of fundamental optimization problems under an upper-bound constraint on a supermodular cost function with curvature parameter $γ$. Our notion of supermodular curvature is less restrictive than prior definitions, substantially expanding the class of admissible cost functions. We show that our greedy algorithm that iteratively includes elements maximizing the ratio of the objective and constraint functions, achieves a $\\left(1 - e^{-(1-γ)}\\right)$-approximation before stopping. We prove that this approximation is indeed tight for this algorithm. Further, if the objective function has a submodular curvature $c$, then we show that the bound further improves to $\\left(1 - (1- (1-c)(1-γ))^{1/(1-c)}\\right)$, which can be further improved by continuing to violate the constraint. Finally, we show that the Greedy-Ratio-Marginal in conjunction with binary search leads to a bicriteria approximation for the dual problem -- minimizing a supermodular function under a lower bound constraint on a submodular function. We conduct a number of experiments on a simulation of LLM agents debating over multiple rounds -- the task is to select a subset of agents to maximize correctly answered questions. Our algorithm outperforms all other greedy heuristics, and on smaller problems, it achieves the same performance as the optimal set found by exhaustive search."

    "abstract": "Mobile networks require safe optimization to adapt to changing conditions in traffic demand and signal transmission quality, in addition to improving service performance metrics. With the increasing complexity of emerging mobile networks, traditional parameter tuning methods become too conservative or complex to evaluate. For the first time, we apply safe Bayesian optimization to mobile networks. Moreover, we develop a new safe collaborative optimization algorithm called CoSBO, leveraging information from multiple optimization tasks in the network and considering multiple safety constraints. The resulting algorithm is capable of safely tuning the network parameter online with very few iterations. We demonstrate that the proposed method improves sample efficiency in the early stages of the optimization process by comparing it against the SafeOpt-MC algorithm in a mobile network scenario."

    "abstract": "Learning latent actions from action-free video has emerged as a powerful paradigm for scaling up controllable world model learning. Latent actions provide a natural interface for users to iteratively generate and manipulate videos. However, most existing approaches rely on monolithic inverse and forward dynamics models that learn a single latent action to control the entire scene, and therefore struggle in complex environments where multiple entities act simultaneously. This paper introduces Factored Latent Action Model (FLAM), a factored dynamics framework that decomposes the scene into independent factors, each inferring its own latent action and predicting its own next-step factor value. This factorized structure enables more accurate modeling of complex multi-entity dynamics and improves video generation quality in action-free video settings compared to monolithic models. Based on experiments on both simulation and real-world multi-entity datasets, we find that FLAM outperforms prior work in prediction accuracy and representation quality, and facilitates downstream policy learning, demonstrating the benefits of factorized latent action models."

With a peak magnitude of Mr = -19.55 +/- 0.11 mag, it is among the most luminous in the existing sample and shows similar colours and decline rates to other SNe Icn. The early optical spectra show a blue continuum with narrow C II features (vFWHM ~ 2000 km s^-1), consistent with a typical wind velocity of a Wolf-Rayet star. The absence of C III lambda 5696 emission at the time of explosion is consistent with a Type Ibn supernova; however, the lack of narrow He lines in both the optical and near-infrared spectra supports a SNe Icn classification. Unlike the majority of SNe Icn, we do not detect broad features in the late-time (7-21 days relative to o-band peak) spectral phase of SN 2024abvb. Semi-analytical modelling of the light curves shows that it can be reproduced by ~2.6 Msun of SN ejecta interacting with ~0.3 Msun of circumstellar material (CSM), both larger than other SNe Icn but consistent with rapidly evolving SNe Ibn. The metallicity at the SN location is significantly lower than the global metallicity of its host galaxy, suggesting that line-driven mass loss required to strip the progenitor of its H and He envelopes was likely inefficient. We estimate the star-formation-rate history at the location of SN 2024abvb and find that it lies at the bottom ~5th percentile among SESNe hosts, inconsistent with a Wolf-Rayet progenitor. Based on its spectral features, local and host environment properties, and host-galaxy offset, we favour an 8-10 Msun star stripped by a compact companion as the progenitor, with a sufficient runaway velocity to reach the observed offset."

    "abstract": "The redshifted 21-cm signal emitted by neutral Hydrogen (HI) is a promising probe to understand the evolution of the topology of ionized regions during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The topology of ionized regions allows us to infer the nature and properties of ionizing sources, i.e., early galaxies and AGNs. Traditional Fourier statistics, such as the power spectrum, help us quantify the strength of fluctuations in this field at different length scales but do not preserve its phase information. Analyzing the 21-cm brightness temperature field in the image domain retains its non-Gaussian characteristics and morphological information. One such approach is to track the coalescence of multiple ionized regions to form one contiguous ionized region spanning the universe. This is referred to as percolation, and its onset is quantified by a sharp rise in the value of the Largest Cluster Statistic (LCS) approaching unity. In this work, we carry out a percolation analysis of 21-cm brightness temperature fields by studying the redshift evolution of the LCS along a lightcone to distinguish between several simulated reionization scenarios. We have extended previous results on reionization model comparison from the analysis of coeval 21-cm maps to understand how the lightcone effect biases the observed percolation behavior and affects the distinguishability of the source models. We estimate the LCS of subvolumes of different sizes in the 21-cm lightcone maps and study their redshift evolution for different reionization scenarios using a moving volume approach. We find that the percolation transition inferred from a lightcone approaches that from the coeval box as we increase the bandwidth of the moving volume in all but one reionization scenario."

    "abstract": "The calculation of thermal conductivity in insulating solids at temperatures below the Debye temperature is problematic, due to the breakdown of classical and semi-classical approaches. In this work, we present a fully quantum methodology to compute thermal conductivity based on Path Integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations combined with the Green-Kubo linear response theory. The method is applied to crystalline argon modeled by a Lennard-Jones potential, a paradigmatic system where quantum effects strongly affect both thermodynamic and transport properties. From PIMC simulations, we obtain the temperature-dependent phonon frequencies, lifetimes, and specific heat. From the imaginary time correlations of the energy current, we extract the thermal transport coefficients based on a physically motivated prior. We show that the experimentally observed increase of the thermal conductivity at low temperatures cannot be explained within a standard Peierls-Boltzmann framework or quasi-harmonic approximation using phonon lifetimes alone. Instead, a distinct transport lifetime emerges from the analysis of heat-current correlations. Our results demonstrate that quantum Monte Carlo methods provide a robust, non-perturbative framework to investigate heat transport in insulating solids, beyond the limits of classical molecular dynamics and quasi-harmonic approximations."

Modelling the lens system is key to extracting astrophysical and cosmological information. We present adaptive-optics-assisted high-resolution images of SN Winny (SN 2025wny) in the J and K filters obtained with the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT). The LBT imaging confirms the presence of a fifth point source, whose colour is consistent with that of the other SN images at similar phases, while lens modelling robustly supports its interpretation as an additional image of SN~Winny. We measure the positions of the five SN images with uncertainties varying between 1 and 14 milliarcseconds. We build the first mass models using lenstronomy and GLEE, and explore three classes of mass models for the two lens galaxies G1 and G2. The optimal model class of the three is a singular isothermal ellipsoid for G1, a singular isothermal sphere for G2, and an external shear. We infer the enclosed masses within the Einstein radius as 4.61^{+0.06}_{-0.04} \\times 10^{11}\\,M_\\odot for G1 and 1.01\\pm0.02 \\times 10^{11}\\,M_\\odot for G2. The lensing configuration by the two lens galaxies can produce two additional magnified SN images beyond the five observed ones; the exclusion of such model configurations further constrains the lens model parameters. Our model fits to the observed image positions with an RMS of ~0.0012\" - 0.0025\", within the observed positional uncertainties. The predicted magnifications of the multiple images vary between ~1.6 (for the faintest fifth image E) to ~10 (for the brightest image A). The predicted relative lensing magnifications of the multiple images do not match that of the observed within 2σuncertainties. The differences in the relative magnifications could be due to millilensing/microlensing. Our mass models form the basis for future analyses of this unique system. (abridged)"

Across sessions, the model developed a distinctive style and a coherent corpus, supported by quantitative and qualitative analyses, and it produced a pen name and author image. In a blinded authorship test with 50 humanities students and graduates (three AI poems and three poems by well-known poets each), judgments were at chance: human poems were labeled human 54% of the time and AI poems 52%, with 95% confidence intervals including 50%. After the workshop, a commercial publisher released a poetry collection authored by the model. These results show that workshop-style prompting can support long-horizon creative shaping and renew debates on creativity and authorship."

    "abstract": "This paper motivates and develops a novel and focused approach to variable selection in linear regression models. For estimating the regression mean $μ=\\E\\,(Y\\midd x_0)$, for the covariate vector of a given individual, there is a list of competing estimators, say $\\hattμ_S$ for each submodel $S$. Exact expressions are found for the relative mean squared error risks, when compared to the widest model available, say $\\mse_S/\\mse_\\wide$. The theory of confidence distributions is used for accurate assessments of these relative risks. This leads to certain Focused Relative Risk Information Criterion scores, and associated FRIC plots and FRIC tables, as well as to Confidence plots to exhibit the confidence the data give in the submodels. The machinery is extended to handle many focus parameters at the same time, with appropriate averaged FRIC scores. The particular case where all available covariate vectors have equal importance yields a new overall criterion for variable selection, balancing complexity and fit in a natural fashion. A connection to the Mallows criterion is demonstrated, leading also to natural modifications of the latter. The FRIC and AFRIC strategies are illustrated for real data."

In this work, we address the gap between training with full steps with low-rank projections (SVDLoRA) and LoRA fine-tuning. We propose LoRSum, a memory-efficient subroutine that closes this gap for gradient descent by casting LoRA optimization as a proximal sub-problem and solving it efficiently with alternating least squares updates, which we prove to be an implicit block power method. We recover several recently proposed preconditioning methods for LoRA as special cases, and show that LoRSum can also be used for updating a low-rank momentum. In order to address full steps with preconditioned gradient descent, we propose a scaled variant of LoRSum that uses structured metrics such as K-FAC and Shampoo, and we show that storing the diagonal of these metrics still allows them to perform well while remaining memory-efficient. Experiments on a synthetic task, CIFAR-100, and language-model fine-tuning on GLUE, SQuAD v2, and WikiText-103, show that our method can match or improve LoRA baselines given modest compute overhead, while avoiding full-matrix SVD projections and retaining LoRA-style parameter efficiency."

These investigations show that HHG radiation is, in general, in a nonclassical state of light. However, the quantum optical treatment of HHG from topological nontrivial materials is missing. Here, we aim to address this gap in current knowledge and consider the quantum optical HHG response from the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, a finite chain of atoms with both a topologically trivial and nontrivial insulating phase, the latter supporting edge states. We find that HHG from both topological phases is squeezed at the band-gap frequency. Interestingly, while the harmonic spectrum discriminates the two topological phases of the system, the degree of squeezing only discriminates the phases for smaller chain lengths. We attribute this difference to a relative increase in overlap between bulk and edge states in the topological nontrivial phase for smaller systems. Our findings reveal how the strength of dipole couplings governs the nonclassical HHG response and define new research questions on topologically protected generation of quantum light in strong-field physics."

    "abstract": "The Euclid galaxy survey will provide unprecedented constraints on cosmology, but achieving unbiased results will require an optimal characterisation and mitigation of systematic effects. Among these, the intrinsic alignments (IA) of galaxies are one of the dominant contaminants of the weak lensing (WL) and galaxy-galaxy lensing (GGL) probes. In this work, we assess IA modelling choices for Euclid DR1 3x2pt analyses by comparing the performance of the two most commonly used IA models, nonlinear alignment (NLA) and tidal alignment tidal torquing (TATT), along with several variations. Our analyses combine three perspectives: i) the constraining power on the IA and cosmological parameters for each IA model, ii) the bias that results when the IA analysis model differs from the model used to generate the synthetic data vector, and iii) the degeneracies between IA and photometric redshift (photo-z) nuisance parameters. Among the IA models analysed, the redshift-dependent TATT model (zTATT) provides the most flexible description of IA, with a similar constraining power compared to simpler IA models, making it a well-motivated choice for Euclid DR1 3x2pt analyses."

    "abstract": "Diversity-Generating Retroelements (DGRs) create rapid, targeted variation within specific genomic regions in phages and bacteria. They operate through stochastic retro-transcription of a template region (TR) into a variable region (VR), which typically encodes ligand-binding proteins. Despite their prevalence, the evolutionary conditions that maintain such hypermutating systems remain unclear. Here we introduce a two-timescale framework separating fast VR diversification from slow TR evolution, allowing the dynamics of DGR-controlled loci to be analytically understood from the TR design point of view. We quantity the fitness gain provided by the diversification mechanism of DGR in the presence of environmental switching with respect to standard mutagenesis. Our framework accounts for observed patterns of DGR activity in human-gut \\textit{Bacteroides} and clarifies when constitutive DGR activation is evolutionarily favored."

We adapt the technique to the intuitionistic multi-succedent setting by focusing on the intuitionistic modal logic KM. To do this, we design a novel multi-succedent sequent calculus for this logic which terminates, eliminates cut, and provides a decidability argument for KM. Then, we adapt Pitts' technique to our calculus to construct uniform interpolants for KM, while highlighting the hurdles we overcame. Finally, by (re)proving the algebraisability of KM, we deduce the coherence of the class of KM-algebras. All our results are fully mechanised in the Rocq proof assistant, ensuring correctness and enabling effective computation of interpolants."

While methods for time and frequency synchronization are well established, maintaining real-time phase coherence remains an open requirement for many MIMO systems. Phase coherence in MIMO systems is crucial for beamforming in digital arrays and enables precise parameter estimates such as Angle-of-Arrival/Departure. This work presents and validates a simple local real-time phase calibration method for a digital array. We compare two different approaches, instantaneous and smoothed calibration, to determine the optimal interval between synchronization procedures. To quantitatively assess calibration performance, we use two metrics: the average beamforming power loss and the RMS cycle-to-cycle jitter. Our results indicate that both approaches for phase calibration are effective and yield RMS of jitter in the 2.1 ps to 124 fs range for different SDR models. This level of precision enables coherent transmission on commonly available SDR platforms, allowing investigation on advanced MIMO techniques and transmit beamforming in practical testbeds."

    "abstract": "Automated feature engineering (AFE) enables AI systems to autonomously construct high-utility representations from raw tabular data. However, existing AFE methods rely on statistical heuristics, yielding brittle features that fail under distribution shift. We introduce CAFE, a framework that reformulates AFE as a causally-guided sequential decision process, bridging causal discovery with reinforcement learning-driven feature construction. Phase I learns a sparse directed acyclic graph over features and the target to obtain soft causal priors, grouping features as direct, indirect, or other based on their causal influence with respect to the target. Phase II uses a cascading multi-agent deep Q-learning architecture to select causal groups and transformation operators, with hierarchical reward shaping and causal group-level exploration strategies that favor causally plausible transformations while controlling feature complexity. Across 15 public benchmarks (classification with macro-F1; regression with inverse relative absolute error), CAFE achieves up to 7% improvement over strong AFE baselines, reduces episodes-to-convergence, and delivers competitive time-to-target. Under controlled covariate shifts, CAFE reduces performance drop by ~4x relative to a non-causal multi-agent baseline, and produces more compact feature sets with more stable post-hoc attributions. These findings underscore that causal structure, used as a soft inductive prior rather than a rigid constraint, can substantially improve the robustness and efficiency of automated feature engineering."

We propose TabAgent, a framework for replacing generative decision components in closed-set selection tasks with a compact textual-tabular classifier trained on execution traces. TabAgent (i) extracts structured schema, state, and dependency features from trajectories (TabSchema), (ii) augments coverage with schema-aligned synthetic supervision (TabSynth), and (iii) scores candidates with a lightweight classifier (TabHead). On the long-horizon AppWorld benchmark, TabAgent maintains task-level success while eliminating shortlist-time LLM calls, reducing latency by approximately 95% and inference cost by 85-91%. Beyond tool shortlisting, TabAgent generalizes to other agentic decision heads, establishing a paradigm for learned discriminative replacements of generative bottlenecks in production agent architectures."

In this protocol, agents restricting their reasoning to certified terms (\"core-guarded reasoning\") achieve provably bounded disagreement. We also outline mechanisms for detecting drift (recertification) and recovering shared vocabulary (renegotiation). In simulations with varying degrees of semantic divergence, core-guarding reduces disagreement by 72-96%. In a validation with fine-tuned language models, disagreement is reduced by 51%.

    "abstract": "The recent reconstruction of the Drosophila brain provides a neural network of unprecedented size and level of details. In this work, we study the geometrical properties of this system by applying network embedding techniques to the graph of synaptic connections. Since previous analysis have revealed an inhomogeneous degree distribution, we first employ a hyperbolic embedding approach that maps the neural network onto a point cloud in the two-dimensional hyperbolic space. In general, hyperbolic embedding methods exploit the exponentially growing volume of hyperbolic space with increasing distance from the origin, allowing for an approximately uniform spatial distribution of nodes even in scale-free, small-world networks. By evaluating multiple embedding quality metrics, we find that the network structure is well captured by the resulting two-dimensional hyperbolic embedding, and in fact is more congruent with this representation than with the original neuron coordinates in three-dimensional Euclidean space. In order to examine the network geometry in a broader context, we also apply the well-known Euclidean network embedding approach Node2vec, where the dimension of the embedding space, $d$ can be set arbitrarily. In 3 dimensions, the Euclidean embedding of the network yields lower quality scores compared to the original neuron coordinates. However, as a function of the embedding dimension the scores show an improving tendency, surpassing the level of the 2d hyperbolic embedding roughly at $d=16$, and reaching a maximum around $d=64$. Since network embeddings can serve as valuable inputs for a variety of downstream machine learning tasks, our results offer new perspectives on the structure and representation of this recently revealed and biologically significant neural network."

We investigate how fault interactions influence slip behavior using 3D quasi-dynamic earthquake sequence simulations of two parallel faults with uniform rate-weakening friction, accelerated with hierarchical matrices. Our results identify four slip regimes-periodic earthquakes, coexisting SSEs and earthquakes, only SSEs, and complex sequences-while a single planar fault under the same conditions produces only earthquakes. We quantify fault interaction using the maximum Coulomb stress induced on a target fault by unit, spatially uniform stress drop on a neighboring fault. Because the source stress drop is normalized, the metric depends only on geometry and is independent of friction and nucleation length, and it can be extended to arbitrary fault configurations. The occurrence of SSEs is confined to an intermediate range of interaction strength. We also reproduce the observed moment-duration scaling and show that it depends on event detection thresholds. These results demonstrate that complex fault geometry can naturally generate both slow and fast earthquakes through evolving traction heterogeneities."

We show that equilibria are characterized as follows: In equilibrium, the optimal indemnity function exhibits a layer-type structure, providing full insurance over any loss layer on which the policyholder is more pessimistic than the insurer's pricing functional about tail losses; and no insurance coverage over loss layers on which the policyholder is less pessimistic than the insurer's pricing functional about tail losses. In equilibrium, the optimal pricing distortion function is determined by the policyholder's degree of risk aversion, whereby prices never exceed the policyholder's marginal willingness to insure tail losses. Moreover, we show that both the insurance coverage and the insurer's expected profit increase with the policyholder's degree of risk aversion. Additionally, and echoing recent work in the literature, we show that equilibrium contracts are Pareto efficient, but they do not induce a welfare gain to the policyholder. Conversely, any Pareto-optimal contract that leaves no welfare gain to the policyholder can be obtained as an equilibrium contract. Finally, we consider a few examples of interest that recover some existing results in the literature as special cases of our analysis."

A lightweight convolutional neural network is designed to operate on this representation, achieving competitive performance on the ReMASC dataset with approximately 6k trainable parameters. Experimental results show that acoustic maps provide a compact and physically interpretable feature space for replay attack detection across different devices and acoustic environments."

In characteristic 0 it essentially coincides with this inverse square root, however in general it is quite different, and unlike this inverse square root, it is locally summable. In a sequel work [AGKS] we use this local summability in order to prove the positive characteristic analog of Harish-Chandra's local integrability theorem of characters of representations under certain conditions. The main results of this paper are known in characteristic zero. In fact a stronger result is known: there is a symplectic form on the Hilbert scheme of a plane."

    "abstract": "In indoor assistive perception for visually impaired users, 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) is expected to provide structurally coherent and semantically consistent occupancy under strictly monocular vision for safety-critical scene understanding. However, existing monocular SSC approaches often lack explicit modeling of voxel-feature reliability and regulated cross-scale information propagation during 2D-3D projection and multi-scale fusion, making them vulnerable to projection diffusion and feature entanglement and thus limiting structural stability.To address these challenges, this paper presents an Adaptive Multi-scale Attention Aggregation (AMAA) framework built upon the MonoScene pipeline. Rather than introducing a heavier backbone, AMAA focuses on reliability-oriented feature regulation within a monocular SSC framework. Specifically, lifted voxel features are jointly calibrated in semantic and spatial dimensions through parallel channel-spatial attention aggregation, while multi-scale encoder-decoder fusion is stabilized via a hierarchical adaptive feature-gating strategy that regulates information injection across scales.Experiments on the NYUv2 benchmark demonstrate consistent improvements over MonoScene without significantly increasing system complexity: AMAA achieves 27.25% SSC mIoU (+0.31) and 43.10% SC IoU (+0.59). In addition, system-level deployment on an NVIDIA Jetson platform verifies that the complete AMAA framework can be executed stably on embedded hardware. Overall, AMAA improves monocular SSC quality and provides a reliable and deployable perception framework for indoor assistive systems targeting visually impaired users."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the design of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems assisted by simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RISs), which act as multi-functional programmable metasurfaces capable of supporting concurrent communication and sensing within a unified architecture. We propose a two-stage ISAC protocol, in which the preparation phase performs direction estimation for outdoor users located in the reflection space, while maintaining communication with both outdoor and indoor users in the transmission space. The subsequent communication phase exploits the estimated directions to enhance information transfer. The directions of outdoor users are modeled as Gaussian random variables to capture estimation uncertainty, and the corresponding average communication performance is incorporated into the design. Building on this framework, we formulate a performance-balanced optimization problem that maximizes the communication sum-rate while guaranteeing the required sensing accuracy, jointly determining the beamforming vectors at the base station (BS), the STAR-RIS transmission and reflection coefficients, and the metasurface partition between energy-splitting and transmit-only modes. The physical constraints of STAR-RIS elements and the required sensing performance are explicitly enforced. To address the non-convex nature of the problem, we combine fractional programming, Lagrangian dual reformulation, and successive convex approximation. The binary metasurface partition is ultimately recovered via continuous relaxation followed by projection-based binarization. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed design achieves an effective trade-off between sensing accuracy and communication throughput, by significantly outperforming conventional STAR-RIS-aided ISAC schemes."

Consequently, the rapidity dependence of this observable provides a promising handle to probe the three-dimensional structure of both energy and baryon density profiles. Previous studies have shown that $\\spt$ decorrelation along rapidity is largely insensitive to shear and bulk viscosity; however, its dependence on baryon diffusion, another key transport coefficient in baryonic matter, has not been explored. I find that baryon diffusion has a negligible impact, establishing this observable as a robust probe of the equation of state. Furthermore, I present predictions for identified hadrons and observe a pronounced splitting in the rapidity decorrelation of mean transverse momentum between protons and antiprotons, indicating different transverse flow dynamics for baryons and antibaryons."

We propose a new algorithm that significantly relaxes the requirement on $ε$. Our approach is novel and of technical interest by itself. Our algorithm employs an online learning procedure with carefully designed rewards to construct an exploration policy, which is used to gather data sufficient for accurate dynamics estimation and subsequent computation of an $ε$-optimal policy once the reward is revealed.

We then derive and analyze specialized forms of the resulting equations for collinear reference determinants, for which the two-component formalism decomposes into conventional spin-conserving and spin-flip TDDFT. The resulting working equations are systematically compared with previously proposed theoretical approaches. On the basis of our analysis, $\\langle \\hat{S}^2 \\rangle$ in the excited states is shown to arise from two distinct sources: (i) $\\langle \\hat{S}^2 \\rangle_0$ in the reference state and (ii) additional $Δ\\langle \\hat{S}^2 \\rangle$ introduced by the excitation process itself. Finally, we evaluate the expectation value $\\langle \\hat{S}^2 \\rangle$ by performing two-component TDDFT calculations based on two-component DFT, unrestricted Kohn-Sham (UKS), and restricted open-shell Kohn-Sham (ROKS) reference states, respectively."

As of now, there is no comprehensive study that would evaluate the influence of number representations used for model parameters against electromagnetic fault injection (EMFI) attacks. In this paper, we investigate how four different number representations influence the success of an EMFI attack on embedded neural network models. We chose two common floating-point representations (32-bit, and 16-bit), and two integer representations (8-bit, and 4-bit). We deployed four common image classifiers, ResNet-18, ResNet-34, ResNet-50, and VGG-11, on an embedded memory chip, and utilized a low-cost EMFI platform to trigger faults. Our results show that while floating-point representations exhibit almost a complete degradation in accuracy (Top-1 and Top-5) after a single fault injection, integer representations offer better resistance overall. Especially, when considering the the 8-bit representation on a relatively large network (VGG-11), the Top-1 accuracies stay at around 70% and the Top-5 at around 90%."

Utilizing a total Chandra exposure of 103 ks, we find that the large-scale X-ray morphology is consistent with a dynamically relaxed, cool-core system. The intracluster medium (ICM) shows a central density of 0.08+/-0.01 cm^{-3}, a central pseudo-entropy of 26^{+6}_{-5} keVcm^{2} and a central cooling time of 515^{+96}_{-75} Myr, values typical of massive cool-core clusters. Despite these conditions, no evidence of recent or ongoing star formation is detected in the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting of DES photometry indicates that the bulk of the stellar population formed at z~1.25, with no significant star formation over the past ~3 Gyr, while optical spectra from Magellan show no [O II] emission. Complementary ASKAP radio and Spitzer infrared data indicate a lack of strong current AGN activity in the BCG. SPT J0417 exemplifies massive, relaxed, cool-core clusters in which cooling and star formation appear almost completely quenched, providing valuable insights into how AGN feedback regulates the long-term thermal balance of the intracluster medium."

Our results show that this scenario produces a rich, multi-component GW spectrum consisting of primordial GWs, scalar-induced GWs, and GW emissions from PBH ringdown and binary mergers. We demonstrate that these correlated signatures across different frequency bands provide a novel and powerful avenue to probe or constrain NEC violation during inflation through future multi-band GW observations."

It trivially embeds the $λ$-calculus, although the entire semantics builds on only naive set theory; as a consequence, all constructs including inheritance are inherently commutative, idempotent, and associative; the linearization problem of multiple inheritance simply does not arise. This induces a fully abstract semantics of the lazy $λ$-calculus with respect to Böhm tree equivalence. Overlay-Calculus is distilled from the Overlay language, a practical implementation in which we observed further emergent phenomena: the Expression Problem dissolves, programs are CPS-agnostic, records natively encode random-access memory, and self-reference resolves to multiple targets. These properties suggest applications to configuration languages, dependency injection, object-oriented programming, composable effect systems, modular software architectures, file-system-as-compiler, general-purpose programming, and no-code development."

    "abstract": "Natural birth and death are fundamental mechanisms of population dynamics in ecosystems and have played pivotal roles in shaping population dynamics. Nevertheless, in studies of cyclic competition systems governed by the rock-paper-scissors (RPS) game, these mechanisms have often been ignored in analyses of biodiversity. On the other hand, given the prevalence and profound impact on biodiversity, understanding how higher-order interactions (HOIs) can affect biodiversity is one of the most challenging issues, and thus HOIs have been continuously studied for their effects on biodiversity in systems of cyclic competing populations, with a focus on neutral species. However, in real ecosystems, species can evolve and die naturally or be preyed upon by predators, whereas previous studies have considered only classic reaction rules among three species with a neutral, nonparticipant species. To identify how neutral species can affect the biodiversity of the RPS system when species' natural birth and death are assumed, we consider a model of neutral species in higher-order interactions within the spatial RPS system, assuming birth-and-death processes. Extensive simulations show that when neutral species interfere positively, they dominate the available space, thereby reducing the proportion of other species. Conversely, when the interference is harmful, the density of competing species increases. In addition, unlike traditional RPS dynamics, biodiversity can be effectively maintained even in high-mobility regimes. Our study reaffirms the critical role of neutral species in preserving biodiversity."

Using angle-resolved polarized Raman (ARPR) spectroscopy, we observe a mode-sensitive enhancement of anisotropy, dependent on both flake thickness and Raman shift. A unified model that incorporates the intrinsic Raman tensor, birefringence, and chromatic dispersion accurately reproduces the experimental data, elucidating how cavity resonances at both excitation and scattered wavelengths interact. Within this framework, the intrinsic phonon anisotropy is quantified, providing invaluable insights for accurately predicting ARPR responses and identifying crystallographic orientation. This work provides fundamental insights into birefringence-governed cavities and opens avenues for high-performance birefringent optics and cavity-enhanced anisotropic phenomena."

To address this limitation, we study a Smoothed $ε_n$-Greedy exploration scheme that combines $ε_n$-greedy and Boltzmann exploration, for which we prove a gap-robust regret bound of near-$\\tilde{O}(N^{9/10})$. To analyze these algorithms, we develop a high-probability concentration bound for contractive Markovian stochastic approximation with iterate- and time-dependent transition dynamics. This bound may be of independent interest as the contraction factor in our bound is governed by the mixing time and is allowed to converge to one asymptotically."

The main findings are: (1)Among LOS feature combinations, R_VALUE and AREA_ACR consistently yield the best results. (2)Transformer achieves better performance with combined LOS and vector magnetic field data than with either alone. (3)Models using knowledge-informed features outperform those using magnetograms. (4)While CNN and CNN-BiLSTM outperform their CDR counterparts on magnetograms, CDR-Transformer is slightly superior to its deep learning counterpart when using knowledge-informed features.

    "abstract": "The representation of protein backbone geometry through the discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equation provides a theoretical connection between biological structure and integrable systems. Although the global application of this framework is constrained by chiral degeneracies and non-local interactions we propose that helical peptides can be effectively modeled as piecewise integrable systems in which the discrete Hasimoto map remains applicable within specific geometric boundaries. We delineate these boundaries through an analytic characterization of the mapping between biochemical dihedral angles and Frenet frame parameters for a dataset of 50 helical peptide chains. We demonstrate that the transformation is information-preserving globally but ill-conditioned within the helical basin characterized by a median Jacobian condition number of 31 which suggests that the loss of chiral information arises primarily from local coordinate compression rather than topological singularities. We define a local integrability error $E[n]$ derived from the discrete dispersion relation to show that deviations from integrability are driven predominantly by torsion non-uniformity while curvature remains structurally rigid. This metric identifies integrable islands where the analytic dispersion relation predicts backbone coordinates with sub-angstrom accuracy yielding a median root-mean-square deviation of 0.77\\,Å and enables a segmentation strategy that isolates structural defects. We further indicate that the inverse design of peptide backbones is feasible within a quantitatively defined integrability zone where the design constraint reduces essentially to the control of torsion uniformity. These findings advance the Hasimoto formalism from a qualitative descriptor toward a precise quantitative framework for analyzing and designing local protein geometry within the limits of piecewise integrability."

    "abstract": "Motivated by recent studies on superconducting (SC) diode nonreciprocity, we uncover an unexpected hierarchy of SC-phase decoherence in bilayer superconductors hosting both interlayer Josephson coupling and a Josephson diode effect. Contrary to the conventional single-energy-scale paradigm where Josephson coherence and diode nonreciprocity vanish simultaneously at the SC gap-closing temperature, we demonstrate, using a self-consistent microscopic theory incorporating phase fluctuations, that the system undergoes a sequence of distinct thermal crossovers upon heating: the diode effect disappears first at $T_η$, Josephson coherence is subsequently lost at $T_c$, and the SC gap collapses only at a higher temperature $T_s$. Rather than a direct SC-normal transition, the system thus evolves through successive nonreciprocal, reciprocal, and incoherent Josephson regimes before entering the normal state. Counterintuitively, the separation between these regimes is governed not only by interlayer coupling, but also sensitively by in-plane disorder and carrier density. These findings point to a generic hierarchy of SC decoherence in low-dimensional Josephson systems, and suggest broader relevance to layered superconductors, including cuprates and recently discovered nickelates, as well as to SC qubits."

Therefore, mitigating the adverse effects of low-predictability samples is crucial for time series analysis tasks such as time series forecasting (TSF) and time series classification (TSC). While many deep learning models have achieved promising performance, few consider how to identify and penalize low-predictability samples to improve model performance from the training perspective. To fill this gap, we propose a general Amortized Predictability-aware Training Framework (APTF) for both TSF and TSC. APTF introduces two key designs that enable the model to focus on high-predictability samples while still learning appropriately from low-predictability ones: (i) a Hierarchical Predictability-aware Loss (HPL) that dynamically identifies low-predictability samples and progressively expands their loss penalty as training evolves, and (ii) an amortization model that mitigates predictability estimation errors caused by model bias, further enhancing HPL's effectiveness.

RAM captures diverse time-patch interactions during training and aggregates them via dropout ensemble at inference, enhancing patch-level semantics and enabling MLP-Mixer to better model multi-scale dependencies. MPMC further stacks RAM and MLP-Mixer in a memory-efficient manner, achieving more effective temporal mixing. It addresses semantic gaps across scales and facilitates better multiscale modeling and forecasting performance.

We will use classical methods of constrained optimization to find optimal driving strategies for a fleet of trains subject to limits on total energy consumption during specified intermediate time intervals but with no change to individual journey times.

    "abstract": "Several complex physical systems are governed by multi-scale partial differential equations (PDEs) that exhibit both smooth low-frequency components and localized high-frequency structures. Existing physics-informed neural network (PINN) methods typically train with fixed coordinate system inputs, where geometric misalignment with these structures induces gradient stiffness and ill-conditioning that hinder convergence. To address this issue, we introduce a mapping paradigm that reshapes the input coordinates through differentiable geometric compactification mappings and couples the geometric structure of PDEs with the spectral properties of residual operators. Based on this paradigm, we propose Geometric Compactification (GC)-PINN, a framework that introduces three mapping strategies for periodic boundaries, far-field scale expansion, and localized singular structures in the input domain without modifying the underlying PINN architecture. Extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that this approach yields more uniform residual distributions and higher solution accuracy on representative 1D and 2D PDEs, while improving training stability and convergence speed."

We introduce Temporal-Prior Conditioning (TPC), which elevates time to a first-class modality that conditions the model at multiple depths. TPC attaches a small set of learnable time series tokens to the patch stream; at selected layers these tokens cross-attend to temporal embeddings derived from compact, human-readable temporal descriptors encoded by the same frozen LLM, then feed temporal context back via self-attention. This disentangles time series signal and temporal information while maintaining a low parameter budget. We show that by training only the cross-attention modules and explicitly disentangling time series signal and temporal information, TPC consistently outperforms both full fine-tuning and shallow conditioning strategies, achieving state-of-the-art performance in long-term forecasting across diverse datasets.

However, accurate readings can be challenging due to occlusions, limited viewpoints, or unexpected environmental conditions. We propose a hybrid framework that combines supervised failure classification with anomaly detection, enabling classification of inspection tasks as a success, known failure, or anomaly (i.e., out-of-distribution) case. Our approach uses a world model backbone with compressed video inputs. This policy-agnostic, distribution-free framework determines classifications based on two decision functions set by conformal prediction (CP) thresholds before a human observer does. We evaluate the framework on gauge inspection feeds collected from office and industrial sites and demonstrate real-time deployment on a Boston Dynamics Spot. Experiments show over 90% accuracy in distinguishing between successes, failures, and OOD cases, with classifications occurring earlier than a human observer. These results highlight the potential for robust, anticipatory failure detection in autonomous inspection tasks or as a feedback signal for model training to assess and improve the quality of training data.

    "abstract": "Energy theft poses a significant threat to the stability and efficiency of smart grids, leading to substantial economic losses and operational challenges. Traditional centralized machine learning approaches for theft detection require aggregating user data, raising serious concerns about privacy and data security. These issues are further exacerbated in smart meter environments, where devices are often resource-constrained and lack the capacity to run heavy models. In this work, we propose a privacy-preserving federated learning framework for energy theft detection that addresses both privacy and computational constraints. Our approach leverages a lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP) model, suitable for deployment on low-power smart meters, and integrates basic differential privacy (DP) by injecting Gaussian noise into local model updates before aggregation. This ensures formal privacy guarantees without compromising learning performance. We evaluate our framework on a real-world smart meter dataset under both IID and non-IID data distributions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC scores while maintaining privacy and efficiency. This makes the proposed solution practical and scalable for secure energy theft detection in next-generation smart grid infrastructures."

Prior approaches typically rely on static datasets, either training implicit preference models on interaction history or encoding user profiles in external memory. However, these approaches struggle with new users and with preferences that change over time. We introduce Personalized Agents from Human Feedback (PAHF), a framework for continual personalization in which agents learn online from live interaction using explicit per-user memory. PAHF operationalizes a three-step loop: (1) seeking pre-action clarification to resolve ambiguity, (2) grounding actions in preferences retrieved from memory, and (3) integrating post-action feedback to update memory when preferences drift. To evaluate this capability, we develop a four-phase protocol and two benchmarks in embodied manipulation and online shopping. These benchmarks quantify an agent's ability to learn initial preferences from scratch and subsequently adapt to persona shifts. Our theoretical analysis and empirical results show that integrating explicit memory with dual feedback channels is critical: PAHF learns substantially faster and consistently outperforms both no-memory and single-channel baselines, reducing initial personalization error and enabling rapid adaptation to preference shifts."

Participating teams designed flight control and decision-making algorithms for choosing which BSs to communicate with and how to plan flight trajectories to maximize data download within a mission completion time. The competition was conducted in two stages: Stage 1 involved development and experimentation using a digital twin (DT) environment, and in Stage 2, the final test run was conducted on the outdoor testbed. The total score for each team was compiled from both stages. The resulting dataset includes link quality and data download measurements, both in DT and physical environments. Along with the USRP measurements used in the contest, the dataset also includes UAV telemetry, Keysight RF sensors position estimates, link quality measurements from LoRa receivers, and Fortem radar measurements. It supports reproducible research on autonomous UAV networking, multi-cell association and scheduling, air-to-ground propagation modeling, DT-to-real-world transfer learning, and integrated sensing and communication, which serves as a benchmark for future autonomous wireless experimentation."

Moreover, optimizing for faithfulness and interpretability in reasoning often degrades task performance. To address this tradeoff and improve CoT faithfulness, we propose Reasoning Execution by Multiple Listeners (REMUL), a multi-party reinforcement learning approach. REMUL builds on the hypothesis that reasoning traces which other parties can follow will be more faithful. A speaker model generates a reasoning trace, which is truncated and passed to a pool of listener models who \"execute\" the trace, continuing the trace to an answer. Speakers are rewarded for producing reasoning that is clear to listeners, with additional correctness regularization via masked supervised finetuning to counter the tradeoff between faithfulness and performance. On multiple reasoning benchmarks (BIG-Bench Extra Hard, MuSR, ZebraLogicBench, and FOLIO), REMUL consistently and substantially improves three measures of faithfulness -- hint attribution, early answering area over the curve (AOC), and mistake injection AOC -- while also improving accuracy. Our analysis finds that these gains are robust across training domains, translate to legibility gains, and are associated with shorter and more direct CoTs."

Leveraging the probabilistic local updates mechanism, we propose a communication-efficient Adapt-Then-Combine (ATC) framework, FlexATC, unifying numerous ATC-based distributed algorithms. Under stepsizes independent of the network topology and the number of local updates, we establish sublinear and linear convergence rates for FlexATC in convex and strongly convex settings, respectively. Remarkably, in the strong convex setting, the linear rate is decoupled from the objective functions and network topology, and FlexATC permits communication to be skipped in most iterations without any deterioration of the linear rate. In addition, the proposed unified theory demonstrates for the first time that local updates provably lead to communication acceleration for ATC-based distributed algorithms. Numerical experiments further validate the efficacy of the proposed framework and corroborate the theoretical results."

While prior studies have investigated the potential of integrating large language models (LLMs) into BEMS or building energy modeling, very few studies have examined how user interact with such systems. We conducted a systematic role-playing experiment, where 85 human subjects interacted with an advanced generative pre-trained transformer (OpenAI GPT-4o). Participants were tasked with identifying the top five behavioral changes that could reduce home energy use with the GPT model that functioned as an LLM-integrated BEMS. Then, the collected prompt-response data and participant conclusions were analyzed using an analytical framework that hierarchically assessed and scored human-AI interactions and their home energy analysis approaches. Also, participants were classified into four groups based on their self-evaluated domain knowledge of building energy use and AI literacy, and Kruskal-Wallis H tests with post-hoc pairwise comparisons were conducted across 20 quantifiable metrics. Key takeaways include: most participants employed concise prompts (median: 16.2 words) and relied heavily on GPT's analytical capabilities; and notably, only 1 of 20 metrics, appliance identification rate, showed statistically significant group differences (p=0.037), driven by AI literacy rather than domain knowledge, suggesting an equalizing effect of LLMs across expertise levels. This study provides foundational insights into human-AI collaboration dynamics and promising development directions in the context of LLM-integrated BEMS and contributes to realizing human-centric LLM-integrated energy systems."

We analyzed this dynamic through controlled experiments involving both high-quality SEO-style content and adversarially crafted content. In the SEO scenario, a 67\\% pool contamination led to over 80\\% exposure contamination, creating a homogenized yet deceptively healthy state where answer accuracy remains stable despite the reliance on synthetic sources. Conversely, under adversarial contamination, baselines like BM25 exposed $\\sim$19\\% of harmful content, whereas LLM-based rankers demonstrated stronger suppression capabilities.

Clinical interpretation relies on both slice-driven local features (e.g., sub-centimeter nodules, lesion boundaries) and volume-driven spatial representations (e.g., tumor infiltration, inter-organ anatomical relations). However, existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) remain fragmented in CT slice versus volumetric understanding: slice-driven LVLMs show strong generalization but lack cross-slice spatial consistency, while volume-driven LVLMs explicitly capture volumetric semantics but suffer from coarse granularity and poor compatibility with slice inputs. The absence of a unified modeling paradigm constitutes a major bottleneck for the clinical translation of medical LVLMs. We present OmniCT, a powerful unified slice-volume LVLM for CT scenarios, which makes three contributions: (i) Spatial Consistency Enhancement (SCE): volumetric slice composition combined with tri-axial positional embedding that introduces volumetric consistency, and an MoE hybrid projection enables efficient slice-volume adaptation; (ii) Organ-level Semantic Enhancement (OSE): segmentation and ROI localization explicitly align anatomical regions, emphasizing lesion- and organ-level semantics; (iii) MedEval-CT: the largest slice-volume CT dataset and hybrid benchmark integrates comprehensive metrics for unified evaluation. OmniCT consistently outperforms existing methods with a substantial margin across diverse clinical tasks and satisfies both micro-level detail sensitivity and macro-level spatial reasoning. More importantly, it establishes a new paradigm for cross-modal medical imaging understanding."

To overcome this limitation, we introduce a parameterized canonical representation that unifies a broad spectrum of dexterous hand architectures. It comprises a unified parameter space and a canonical URDF format, offering three key advantages. 1) The parameter space captures essential morphological and kinematic variations for effective conditioning in learning algorithms. 2) A structured latent manifold can be learned over our space, where interpolations between embodiments yield smooth and physically meaningful morphology transitions. 3) The canonical URDF standardizes the action space while preserving dynamic and functional properties of the original URDFs, enabling efficient and reliable cross-embodiment policy learning. We validate these advantages through extensive analysis and experiments, including grasp policy replay, VAE latent encoding, and cross-embodiment zero-shot transfer. Specifically, we train a VAE on the unified representation to obtain a compact, semantically rich latent embedding, and develop a grasping policy conditioned on the canonical representation that generalizes across dexterous hands. We demonstrate, through simulation and real-world tasks on unseen morphologies (e.g., 81.9% zero-shot success rate on 3-finger LEAP Hand), that our framework unifies both the representational and action spaces of structurally diverse hands, providing a scalable foundation for cross-hand learning toward universal dexterous manipulation."

We study the problem of SPIR on graph-replicated database systems, where each node of the graph represents a server and each link represents a message. Each message is replicated at exactly two servers; those at which the link representing the message is incident. To ensure database privacy, the servers share a set of common randomness, independent of the database and the user's desired message index. We study two cases of common randomness distribution to the servers: i) graph-replicated common randomness, and ii) fully-replicated common randomness. Given a graph-replicated database system, in i), we assign one randomness variable independently to every pair of servers sharing a message, while in ii), we assign an identical set of randomness variable to all servers, irrespective of the underlying graph. In both settings, our goal is to characterize the SPIR capacity, i.e., the maximum number of desired message symbols retrieved per downloaded symbol, and quantify the minimum amount of common randomness required to achieve the capacity. To this goal, in setting i), we derive a general lower bound on the SPIR capacity, and show it to be tight for path and regular graphs through a matching converse. Moreover, we establish that the minimum size of common randomness required for SPIR is equal to the message size. In setting ii), the SPIR capacity improves over the first, more restrictive setting. We show this through capacity lower bounds for a class of graphs, by constructing SPIR schemes from PIR schemes."

Experiments on general chemical corpora and patent-specific datasets demonstrate improved diversity, novelty, and controllability, and show that our method recovers realistic analog structures in practical discovery scenarios."

    "abstract": "Learning to manipulate cloth is both a paradigmatic problem for robotic research and a problem of immediate relevance to a variety of applications ranging from assistive care to the service industry. The complex physics of the deformable object makes this problem of cloth manipulation nontrivial. In order to create a general manipulation strategy that addresses a variety of shapes, sizes, fold and wrinkle patterns, in addition to the usual problems of appearance variations, it becomes important to carefully consider model structure and their implications for generalisation performance. In this paper, we present an approach to in-air cloth manipulation that uses a variation of a recently proposed reinforcement learning architecture, DreamerV2. Our implementation modifies this architecture to utilise surface normals input, in addition to modiying the replay buffer and data augmentation procedures. Taken together these modifications represent an enhancement to the world model used by the robot, addressing the physical complexity of the object being manipulated by the robot. We present evaluations both in simulation and in a zero-shot deployment of the trained policies in a physical robot setup, performing in-air unfolding of a variety of different cloth types, demonstrating the generalisation benefits of our proposed architecture."

The method unifies and extends the Helmholtz Gauss families and readily generalizes to nonseparable nondiffracting architectures. Experiments on superposed Bessel Gauss beams confirm the predicted transverse rotations, demonstrating that this operator approach is a fast, transparent, and practical alternative to standard diffraction ntegral treatments"

Adversarial approaches require target-domain adversarial loss during training, which can limit generalization to unseen data, while diffusion-inversion methods often produce low-fidelity translations due to imperfect inversion into noise-latent representations. In this work, we propose the Self-Supervised Semantic Bridge (SSB), a versatile framework that integrates external semantic priors into diffusion bridge models to enable spatially faithful translation without cross-domain supervision. Our key idea is to leverage self-supervised visual encoders to learn representations that are invariant to appearance changes but capture geometric structure, forming a shared latent space that conditions the diffusion bridges. Extensive experiments show that SSB outperforms strong prior methods for challenging medical image synthesis in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings, and extends easily to high-quality text-guided editing."

When the Hall effect is added to the minimum magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), the MHD waves become dispersive and different nonlinear interactions are expected. The emergent turbulent state will thus be expected to be different. For incompressible Hall MHD we develop a reduced model for wave-wave interactions concentrating on those processes that will lead to phase coherent modifications to the linear dispersion of a given wave. We show that these special interactions provide an amplitude-dependent contribution to the linear dispersion relation, which yields nonlinear frequency shifts. The resonance-driven frequency shifts are dominant and add damping or growth to the linear dispersion. The damping/growth rates represent the nonlinear time scales for energy redistribution and can be used in conjunction with a conjecture like the \"critical balance\" to estimate the energy spectral content."

    "abstract": "Polymer literature contains a large and growing body of experimental knowledge, yet much of it is buried in unstructured text and inconsistent terminology, making systematic retrieval and reasoning difficult. Existing tools typically extract narrow, study-specific facts in isolation, failing to preserve the cross-study context required to answer broader scientific questions. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers a promising way to overcome this limitation by combining large language models (LLMs) with external retrieval, but its effectiveness depends strongly on how domain knowledge is represented. In this work, we develop two retrieval pipelines: a dense semantic vector-based approach (VectorRAG) and a graph-based approach (GraphRAG). Using over 1,000 polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) papers, we construct context-preserving paragraph embeddings and a canonicalized structured knowledge graph supporting entity disambiguation and multi-hop reasoning. We evaluate these pipelines through standard retrieval metrics, comparisons with general state-of-the-art systems such as GPT and Gemini, and qualitative validation by a domain chemist. The results show that GraphRAG achieves higher precision and interpretability, while VectorRAG provides broader recall, highlighting complementary trade-offs. Expert validation further confirms that the tailored pipelines, particularly GraphRAG, produce well-grounded, citation-reliable responses with strong domain relevance. By grounding every statement in evidence, these systems enable researchers to navigate the literature, compare findings across studies, and uncover patterns that are difficult to extract manually. More broadly, this work establishes a practical framework for building materials science assistants using curated corpora and retrieval design, reducing reliance on proprietary models while enabling trustworthy literature analysis at scale."

    "abstract": "Evaluating the social intelligence of Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly requires moving beyond static text generation toward dynamic, adversarial interaction. We introduce the Adversarial Resource Extraction Game (AREG), a benchmark that operationalizes persuasion and resistance as a multi-turn, zero-sum negotiation over financial resources. Using a round-robin tournament across frontier models, AREG enables joint evaluation of offensive (persuasion) and defensive (resistance) capabilities within a single interactional framework. Our analysis provides evidence that these capabilities are weakly correlated ($ρ= 0.33$) and empirically dissociated: strong persuasive performance does not reliably predict strong resistance, and vice versa. Across all evaluated models, resistance scores exceed persuasion scores, indicating a systematic defensive advantage in adversarial dialogue settings. Further linguistic analysis suggests that interaction structure plays a central role in these outcomes. Incremental commitment-seeking strategies are associated with higher extraction success, while verification-seeking responses are more prevalent in successful defenses than explicit refusal. Together, these findings indicate that social influence in LLMs is not a monolithic capability and that evaluation frameworks focusing on persuasion alone may overlook asymmetric behavioral vulnerabilities."

Our approach builds on the hop-reduction via shortcutting framework introduced by Li, Li, Rao, and Zhang (2025), which iteratively augments the graph with shortcut edges to reduce the negative hop count of shortest paths. The central computational bottleneck in prior work is the cost of explicitly constructing these shortcuts in dense regions. We overcome this by introducing a new compression technique using auxiliary Steiner vertices. Specifically, we construct these vertices to represent large neighborhoods compactly in a structured manner, allowing us to efficiently generate and propagate shortcuts while strictly controlling the growth of vertex degrees and graph size."

Differential temporal difference (TD) learning algorithms are a major advance for average reward RL as they provide an efficient online method to learn the value functions associated with the average reward in both on-policy and off-policy settings. However, existing convergence guarantees require a local clock in learning rates tied to state visit counts, which practitioners do not use and does not extend beyond tabular settings. We address this limitation by proving the almost sure convergence of on-policy $n$-step differential TD for any $n$ using standard diminishing learning rates without a local clock. We then derive three sufficient conditions under which off-policy $n$-step differential TD also converges without a local clock. These results strengthen the theoretical foundations of differential TD and bring its convergence analysis closer to practical implementations."

    "abstract": "Particle-stabilised emulsions are a cornerstone of soft matter science due to their broad application and fundamental relevance. Computer simulations provide key insights into the formation and behaviour of these emulsions, yet current methods are limited by the spatiotemporal scales accessible for study. The principal issue is that particles are resolved individually. In this work, an alternative strategy is introduced based on phase-field theory, for which we establish the framework. By evolving continuous fields, large-scale dynamics can be simulated in a computationally efficient manner. Our approach is then applied to model the complex formation of a bicontinuous interfacially jammed emulsion gel (bijel) via solvent-transfer induced phase separation (STrIPS). By resolving the coupled dynamics of liquid phase separation and nanoparticle adsorption, the model allows for the characterisation of the influence of nanoparticles on the morphology. Higher concentrations of nanoparticles are found to reduce the average domain size of STrIPS bijels, in line with previous experimental evidence. The presented phase-field model thus represents a promising approach for the morphological investigation of complex particle-stabilised emulsions."

In this paper, Macaulay constants of any finitely generated graded module $M$ over a polynomial ring are introduced by adapting the concept of a cone decomposition to $M$. It is shown that these constants provide upper bounds for the degrees in which the local cohomology modules of $M$ are not zero. The results include an upper bound on the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of $M$ and a generalization of Gotzmann's Regularity Theorem from ideals to modules. As an application, an upper bound on the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of any coherent sheaf on projective space is established. The mentioned bounds are sharp even for cyclic modules. Furthermore, Macaulay constants are utilized to provide a characterization of Hilbert polynomials of finitely generated graded modules."

    "abstract": "In principle, machine learning (ML) can be used to obtain any electronic property of a many-body system from its electron density within density functional theory. However, some physical quantities are highly sensitive to small variations in the density. This 'ill-conditioning' limits the accuracy with which these quantities can be learned as density functionals from a fixed amount of data. We identify sources of ill-conditioning present in density functionals that belong to two ubiquitous classes: 1) Physical quantities that are globally gauge-dependent, meaning they change value if a constant shift is applied to the external potential -- for example, the total energy; 2) Functionals of the N-electron density that have an implicit dependence on the (N+1)-electron density, such as the fundamental gap. We demonstrate that widely used ML models exhibit orders-of-magnitude greater error when applied to these ill-conditioned density functionals compared to other functionals that fall into neither class, even when the global gauge is fixed to prevent constant shifts. Owing to an absence of ill-conditioning in potential functionals, we find that providing the external potential as input to the ML model leads to significantly improved predictions of quantities in these two classes."

Among the factors that define material appearance, gloss, along with color, is widely regarded as one of the most important, and recent studies indicate that humans can perceive gloss independently of the artistic style used to depict an object. To investigate how gloss and artistic style are represented in learned models, we train an unsupervised generative model on a newly curated dataset of painterly objects designed to systematically vary such factors. Our analysis reveals a hierarchical latent space in which gloss is disentangled from other appearance factors, allowing for a detailed study of how gloss is represented and varies across artistic styles. Building on this representation, we introduce a lightweight adapter that connects our style- and gloss-aware latent space to a latent-diffusion model, enabling the synthesis of non-photorealistic images with fine-grained control of these factors. We compare our approach with previous models and observe improved disentanglement and controllability of the learned factors."

Existing approaches typically rely on single judges or aggregate multiple judges assuming equal reliability.

Furthermore, human-labelled supervision for judge calibration may be unavailable. We first empirically demonstrate that inconsistencies in LLM comparison probabilities exist and show that it limits the effectiveness of direct probability-based ranking. To address this, we study the LLM-as-a-jury setting and propose BT-sigma, a judge-aware extension of the Bradley-Terry model that introduces a discriminator parameter for each judge to jointly infer item rankings and judge reliability from pairwise comparisons alone. Experiments on benchmark NLG evaluation datasets show that BT-sigma consistently outperforms averaging-based aggregation methods, and that the learned discriminator strongly correlates with independent measures of the cycle consistency of LLM judgments. Further analysis reveals that BT-sigma can be interpreted as an unsupervised calibration mechanism that improves aggregation by modelling judge reliability."

Automatic summarization can help address this challenge by producing concise summaries for each discussion subject. Despite its potential, research on summarizing discussion subjects in municipal meeting minutes remains largely unexplored, especially in low-resource languages, where the inherent complexity of these documents adds further challenges. A major bottleneck is the scarcity of datasets containing high-quality, manually crafted summaries, which limits the development and evaluation of effective summarization models for this domain. In this paper, we present CitiLink-Summ, a new corpus of European Portuguese municipal meeting minutes, comprising 100 documents and 2,322 manually hand-written summaries, each corresponding to a distinct discussion subject. Leveraging this dataset, we establish baseline results for automatic summarization in this domain, employing state-of-the-art generative models (e.g., BART, PRIMERA) as well as large language models (LLMs), evaluated with both lexical and semantic metrics such as ROUGE, BLEU, METEOR, and BERTScore.

A main interest in recent the literature is identifying the cop number of graph families. The cop number of a graph, $c(G)$, is defined as the minimum number of cops required to guarantee capture of the robber. Determining the cop number is computationally difficult and exact algorithms for this are typically restricted to small graph families. This paper investigates whether classical machine learning methods and graph neural networks can accurately predict a graph's cop number from its structural properties and identify which properties most strongly influence this prediction. Of the classical machine learning models, tree-based models achieve high accuracy in prediction despite class imbalance, whereas graph neural networks achieve comparable results without explicit feature engineering. The interpretability analysis shows that the most predictive features are related to node connectivity, clustering, clique structure, and width parameters, which aligns with known theoretical results. Our findings suggest that machine learning approaches can be used in complement with existing cop number algorithms by offering scalable approximations where computation is infeasible."

    "abstract": "Active photonic integrated circuits (PICs) in the visible spectrum are essential for on-chip applications, requiring low-loss waveguides with broad transparency and efficient, low-power phase modulation. Here, we demonstrate a compact, ultra-low-power phase modulator based on a silicon nitride (Si$_3$N$_4$) waveguide integrated with thin-film lead zirconate titanate (PZT) that actuates a bridge-type MEMS. The suspended actuator exploits PZT's strong piezoelectric effect to induce mechanically driven phase shifts, enabling efficient modulation in a Mach--Zehnder interferometer. For 3~mm and 5~mm modulators, phase shifts of $1.45π$ and $2.5π$ are achieved at 10~V, corresponding to a scalability metric ($V_π\\cdot L$) of 2.25~V$\\cdot$cm at 635~nm. This represents an order-of-magnitude improvement in scalability over stress-optic PZT modulators. The devices also exhibit ultralow power consumption ($\\sim 12\\,\\mathrm{nW}$), $\\sim 5\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ rise time, and optical loss $< 0.75\\,\\mathrm{dB/cm}$. Furthermore, we demonstrate on-chip beam shaping."

In this work, we investigate the statistical and computational landscapes of sparse recovery with $\\ell_\\infty$ error guarantees. This variant of the problem is motivated by \\emph{variable selection} tasks, where the goal is to estimate the support of a $k$-sparse signal in $\\mathbb{R}^d$. Our main contribution is a provable separation between the \\emph{oblivious} (``for each'') and \\emph{adaptive} (``for all'') models of $\\ell_\\infty$ sparse recovery. We show that under an oblivious model, the optimal $\\ell_\\infty$ error is attainable in near-linear time with $\\approx k\\log d$ samples, whereas in an adaptive model, $\\gtrsim k^2$ samples are necessary for any algorithm to achieve this bound. This establishes a surprising contrast with the standard $\\ell_2$ setting, where $\\approx k \\log d$ samples suffice even for adaptive sparse recovery. We conclude with a preliminary examination of a \\emph{partially-adaptive} model, where we show nontrivial variable selection guarantees are possible with $\\approx k\\log d$ measurements."

    "abstract": "This research paper proposes an efficient methodology for the allocation of multiple photovoltaic (PV)-based distributed generation (DG) units in the radial distribution network (RDN), while considering the loading capacity of the network. The proposed method is structured using a two-stage approach. In the first stage, the additional active power loading capacity of the network and each individual bus is determined using an iterative approach. This analysis quantifies the network's additional active loadability limits and identifies buses with high active power loading capacity, which are considered candidate nodes for the placement of DG units. Subsequently, in the second stage, the optimal locations and sizes of DG units are determined using the Monte Carlo method, with the objectives of minimizing voltage deviation and reducing active power losses in the network. The methodology is validated on the standard IEEE 33-bus RDN to determine the optimal locations and sizes of DG units. The results demonstrate that the optimal allocation of one, two, and three DG units, achieved from proposed method, reduces network active power losses by 50.37%, 58.62%, and 65.16%, respectively, and also significantly enhances the voltage profile across all buses. When the obtained results are compared with the results of several existing studies, it is found that the proposed method allows for larger DG capacities and maintains better voltage profiles throughout the RDN."

This decay mode provides a theoretically well-controlled avenue for extracting the CKM matrix element $|V_{us}|$ from the baryon sector. Our estimate of $|V_{us}|$ is obtained by combining our recent lattice-QCD results with recent measurements of the relevant branching fraction reported by BESIII and LHCb."

We establish global linear convergence of these methods to an equilibrium by showing that the LQ game admits an $α$-potential structure, with $α$ determined by the degree of pairwise interaction asymmetry. For pairwise-symmetric interactions, we construct an affine distributed equilibrium by minimizing the potential function and show that independent PG methods converge globally to this equilibrium, with complexity scaling linearly in the population size and logarithmically in the desired accuracy. For asymmetric interactions, we prove that independent projected PG algorithms converge linearly to an approximate equilibrium, with suboptimality proportional to the degree of asymmetry. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results across both symmetric and asymmetric interaction networks."

They promise to support or even collaborate with clinicians and patients in increasingly independent ways. While agentic AI raises familiar moral concerns regarding safety, accountability, and bias, this article focuses on a less explored dimension: its capacity to transform the moral fabric of healthcare itself. Drawing on the framework of techno-moral change and the three domains of decision, relation and perception, we investigate how agentic AI might reshape the patient-physician relationship and reconfigure core concepts of medical morality. We argue that these shifts, while not fully predictable, demand ethical attention before widespread deployment. Ultimately, the paper calls for integrating ethical foresight into the design and use of agentic AI."

    "abstract": "We consider the thin-film equation with linear mobility and a stabilizing second-order porous-medium type term modeling gravity. The model admits self-similar solutions, and our goal is to analyze their stability. We reformulate the problem in mass-Lagrangian coordinates and exploit the underlying gradient-flow structure of the equation with respect to a weighted $L^2$ inner product, where the weight is given by the self-similar source-type profile. This framework allows us to establish a coercivity result for the Hessian (the linearization around the self-similar solution) in a suitably weighted inner product. As a consequence, we prove the convergence of perturbations toward the self-similar profile at an algebraic rate of order $t^{-\\frac 1 5}$, in arbitrary scales of weighted Sobolev norms. The analysis relies on maximal-regularity estimates for the linearized evolution, combined with appropriate estimates for the nonlinear terms. Notably, beyond perturbative regimes and in contrast to previous results for the thin-film equation (convergence to the Smyth-Hill profile) or the porous-medium equation (convergence to the Barenblatt-Pattle solution), our analysis does not rely on an explicit (algebraic) representation of the self-similar profile. Instead, it is based solely on a systematic use of the ordinary differential equation satisfied by the self-similar solution, together with a careful analysis of its boundary asymptotics. As a result, we expect that the approach developed here can serve as a flexible toolbox for the study of more general classes of equations and for the stability analysis of special solutions in future work."

However, most existing Safe RL methods assume benign environments, making them vulnerable to adversarial perturbations commonly encountered in real-world settings. In addition, existing gradient-based adversarial attacks typically require access to the policy's gradient information, which is often impractical in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose an adversarial attack framework to reveal vulnerabilities of Safe RL policies. Using expert demonstrations and black-box environment interaction, our framework learns a constraint model and a surrogate (learner) policy, enabling gradient-based attack optimization without requiring the victim policy's internal gradients or the ground-truth safety constraints. We further provide theoretical analysis establishing feasibility and deriving perturbation bounds. Experiments on multiple Safe RL benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach under limited privileged access."

Within the framework of quantum estimation theory, we investigate whether flavor measurements, the only observables currently accessible experimentally, are optimal for extracting the oscillation parameters. We compute the Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) and the classical Fisher Information (FI) associated with ideal flavor projections for all oscillation parameters, considering accelerator muon (anti)neutrino and reactor electron antineutrino beams propagating in vacuum. Two main results emerge. First, flavor measurements saturate the QFI at the first oscillation maximum for $θ_{13}$, $θ_{23}$, and $θ_{12}$, demonstrating their information-theoretic optimality for these parameters. In contrast, they are far from optimal for $δ_{CP}$. In particular, only a small fraction of the available information on $δ_{CP}$ is extracted at the first maximum; the sensitivity improves at the second maximum, in line with the strategy of ESS$ν$SB, a planned facility. Second, the QFI associated with $δ_{CP}$ is approximately one order of magnitude smaller than that of the mixing angles, indicating that the neutrino state intrinsically encodes less information about CP violation. Nevertheless, this quantum bound lies well below current experimental uncertainties, implying that the present precision on $δ_{CP}$ is not fundamentally limited. Our results provide a quantitative framework to disentangle fundamental from practical limitations and establish a benchmark for optimizing future neutrino facilities."

We investigate CsPbBr3 microcrystals using photoluminescence, Raman and reflectance spectroscopy at low temperature, revealing the simultaneous presence of high-energy and Rashba excitons, each accompanied by distinct phonon replica series. High-energy exciton replicas are uniquely spaced by approximately 9 meV, whereas Rashba exciton replicas exhibit a characteristic approximately 6 meV spacing, indicating the specificity of the exciton-phonon coupling. Unsupervised machine learning applied to a large low-temperature photoluminescence dataset reveals these replica features are prevalent. With increasing temperature, replica features broaden and merge, evolving into a dominant longitudinal optical phonon coupling regime at room temperature. This work establishes direct spectroscopic evidence for concurrent, exciton-specific phonon coupling within a single material, offering new pathways to engineer light-matter interactions for optoelectronic and phonon-photon-based quantum device applications."

We formulate the target learning task as optimization that minimizes squared errors on the target dataset with penalty on the distance of the learned model from the pretrained models. We analytically formulate the test error of the learned target model and provide the corresponding empirical evaluations. Our results elucidate when using more pretrained models can improve transfer learning. Specifically, if the pretrained models are overparameterized, using sufficiently many of them is important for beneficial transfer learning. However, the learning may be compromised by overparameterization bias of pretrained models, i.e., the minimum $\\ell_2$-norm solution's restriction to a small subspace spanned by the training examples in the high-dimensional parameter space. We propose a simple debiasing via multiplicative correction factor that can reduce the overparameterization bias and leverage more pretrained models to learn a target predictor."

    "abstract": "Polarized emission from interstellar dust grains is commonly used to infer information about the underlying magnetic field from the diffuse interstellar medium to molecular cloud cores. Therefore, the ability to accurately determine properties of the magnetic field requires a thorough understanding of the dust alignment mechanism. We investigate the influence of anisotropic radiation fields on the alignment of dust particles by magnetic fields, known as radiative torque (RAT) alignment. Specifically, we take advantage of the unique spatial configuration of the molecular cloud core L43, which contains an embedded yet optically visible star acting as a local source of anisotropic illumination. Based on polarization maps obtained at wavelengths of $154 μ\\mathrm{m}$ (SOFIA/HAWC+), as well as $450 μ\\mathrm{m}$ and $850 μ\\mathrm{m}$ (JCMT/SCUBA-2), which show variations in the degree and angle of polarized emission across all wavelengths, we applied the differential measure analysis method to infer magnetic field strengths and analyze the global polarization spectrum of this source. We derived plane-of-sky magnetic field strengths ranging from approximately 13 to 60 $μ\\mathrm{G}$, varying with wavelength, and find a negative slope of the polarization spectrum. Compared to 3D radiative transfer simulations, this finding can be attributed, at least partially, to variations in dust properties and temperatures along the line of sight. However, the additional influence of variations in the magnetic field orientation along the line of sight cannot be ruled out. Our results favor radiative torques as the primary alignment mechanism, as they indicate that the degree of polarization is dependent on temperature and hence the strength of the local radiation field."

In the first case, we derive an analytical lower bound and later a closed-form expression for the entanglement fidelity of the teleportation channel and analyze its asymptotic behaviour. In the second, we combine semi analytical and numerical methods. Surprisingly, we find that noise-adapted measurements perform worse than the noiseless ones.

However, soft prompts rely on high-dimensional, implicit representations and lack explicit semantics and traceable training behaviors, which limits their interpretability. To address this limitation, we propose a soft prompt tuning optimization method based on topological morphological evolution. Specifically, we employ persistent homology from topological data analysis (TDA) to quantify the structural representations of soft prompts in continuous parameter space and their training process evolution. Quantitative analysis shows that topologically stable and compact soft prompts achieve better downstream performance. Based on this empirical observation, we construct a loss function for optimizing soft prompt tuning, termed Topological Soft Prompt Loss (TSLoss). TSLoss guides the model to learn structurally stable adaptations by quantifying inter-parameter connectivity and redundancy. Extensive experiments show that training with TSLoss accelerates convergence and improves tuning performance, providing an interpretable method to understand and optimize soft prompt tuning from structural and topological perspectives."

The Resolve spectrum revealed a forest of Fe K band absorption lines from the UFO (Mizumoto et al. 2026), comprising of up to six discrete velocity components ranging from $v/c=-0.074$ to $v/c=-0.40$. Here we present the simultaneous XMM-Newton RGS (Reflection Grating Spectrometer) spectrum, where three lower ionization counterparts of the Fe K velocity zones are observed; at $v/c=-0.074, -0.12$ and $-0.33$. The soft X-ray absorbers tend to be somewhat less ionized than their Fe K counterparts, with their opacity mainly arising from Fe L shell lines and highly ionized Oxygen. From comparing the Resolve and RGS absorbers, we show that the outflow can be parameterized with a density profile varying with radius as $r^{-5/3}$, while the lower ionization zones likely originate from denser clumps of gas. Pure electron scattering appears insufficient to provide enough thrust to power the wind, unless sufficient low ionization gas capable of radiative line driving exists outside of the line of sight. Overall, PG 1211+143 provides further evidence for the clumpy nature of accretion disk winds, as was recently revealed in the quasar PDS 456 with XRISM."

We provide a mechanistic unification: looped and depth-grown models exhibit convergent depth-wise signatures, including increased reliance on late layers and recurring patterns aligned with the looped or grown block. These shared signatures support the view that their gains stem from a common form of iterative computation. Building on this connection, we show that the two techniques are adaptable and composable: applying inference-time looping to the middle blocks of a depth-grown model improves accuracy on some reasoning primitives by up to $2\\times$, despite the model never being trained to loop. Both approaches also adapt better than the baseline when given more in-context examples or additional supervised fine-tuning data. Additionally, depth-grown models achieve the largest reasoning gains when using higher-quality, math-heavy cooldown mixtures, which can be further boosted by adapting a middle block to loop. Overall, our results position depth growth and looping as complementary, practical methods for inducing and scaling iterative computation to improve reasoning."

A foundational primitive for such tasks is Bit Commitment (BC), which is known to be impossible to realize without added assumptions. Given the pressing nature of the topic, it is thus important to develop BC systems and prove their security under reasonable assumptions.

    "abstract": "Thermal fluctuations play a central role in fluid dynamics at mesoscopic scales and must be incorporated into numerical schemes in a manner consistent with statistical mechanics. In this work, we develop a fluctuating lattice Boltzmann formulation based on an orthogonal central-moments-based representation. Stochastic forcing is introduced directly in the space of central moments (CMs) and consistently paired with mode-dependent relaxation, yielding a discrete kinetic model that satisfies the fluctuation-dissipation theorem exactly at the lattice level. Owing to the orthogonality of the basis, the equilibrium covariance matrix of the central moments is diagonal, and each non-conserved mode can be interpreted as an independent discrete Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with variance fixed by equilibrium thermodynamics. The resulting formulation guarantees exact equipartition of kinetic energy at equilibrium, preserves Galilean invariance, and retains the enhanced numerical stability characteristic of CMs-based collision operators. Explicit fluctuating schemes are constructed for the D2Q9 and D3Q27 lattices. The extension to reduced-velocity discretisation is discussed too. A comprehensive set of numerical tests verifies correct thermalisation, isotropy of equilibrium statistics, and the expected scaling of velocity fluctuations with thermal energy, density, and relaxation time. In contrast to fluctuating BGK formulations, the present method remains stable and well posed in the over-relaxation regime, including in the immediate vicinity of the stability limit. These results demonstrate that CMs-based lattice Boltzmann methods provide a natural and robust framework for fluctuating hydrodynamics, in which dissipation, noise, and kinetic mode structure are consistently aligned at the discrete level."

    "abstract": "Estimating consumer preferences is central to many problems in economics and marketing. This paper develops a flexible framework for learning individual preferences from partial ranking information by interpreting observed rankings as collections of pairwise comparisons with logistic choice probabilities. We model latent utility as the sum of interpretable product attributes, item fixed effects, and a low-rank user-item factor structure, enabling both interpretability and information sharing across consumers and items. We further correct for selection in which comparisons are observed: a comparison is recorded only if both items enter the consumer's consideration set, inducing exposure bias toward frequently encountered items. We model pair observability as the product of item-level observability propensities and estimate these propensities with a logistic model for the marginal probability that an item is observable. Preference parameters are then estimated by maximizing an inverse-probability-weighted (IPW), ridge-regularized log-likelihood that reweights observed comparisons toward a target comparison population. To scale computation, we propose a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm based on inverse-probability resampling, which draws comparisons in proportion to their IPW weights. In an application to transaction data from an online wine retailer, the method improves out-of-sample recommendation performance relative to a popularity-based benchmark, with particularly strong gains in predicting purchases of previously unconsumed products."

    "source": "arXiv",
    "abstract": "There is growing evidence that independently trained AI systems come to represent the world in the same way. In other words, independently trained embeddings from text, vision, audio, and neural signals share an underlying geometry. We call this the Representational Alignment Hypothesis (RAH) and investigate evidence for and consequences of this claim. The evidence is of two kinds: (i) internal structure comparison techniques, such as representational similarity analysis and topological data analysis, reveal matching relational patterns across modalities without explicit mapping; and (ii) methods based on cross-modal embedding alignment, which learn mappings between representation spaces, show that simple linear transformations can bring different embedding spaces into close correspondence, suggesting near-isomorphism. Taken together, the evidence suggests that, even after controlling for trivial commonalities inherent in standard data preprocessing and embedding procedures, a robust structural correspondence persists, hinting at an underlying organizational principle. Some have argued that this result shows that the shared structure is getting at a fundamental, Platonic level of reality. We argue that this conclusion is unjustified. Moreover, we aim to give the idea an alternative philosophical home, rooted in contemporary metasemantics (i.e., theories of what makes a representation and what makes something meaningful) and responses to the symbol grounding problem. We conclude by considering the scope of the RAH and proposing new ways of distinguishing semantic structures that are genuinely invariant from those that inevitably arise due to the fact that all our data is generated under human-specific conditions on Earth."

    "abstract": "While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable success across a wide range of tasks, long-form video understanding remains a significant challenge. In this study, we focus on video understanding by MLLMs. This task is challenging because processing a full stream of RGB frames is computationally intractable and highly redundant, as self-attention have quadratic complexity with sequence length. In this paper, we propose ReMoRa, a video MLLM that processes videos by operating directly on their compressed representations. A sparse set of RGB keyframes is retained for appearance, while temporal dynamics are encoded as a motion representation, removing the need for sequential RGB frames. These motion representations act as a compact proxy for optical flow, capturing temporal dynamics without full frame decoding. To refine the noise and low fidelity of block-based motions, we introduce a module to denoise and generate a fine-grained motion representation. Furthermore, our model compresses these features in a way that scales linearly with sequence length. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ReMoRa through extensive experiments across a comprehensive suite of long-video understanding benchmarks. ReMoRa outperformed baseline methods on multiple challenging benchmarks, including LongVideoBench, NExT-QA, and MLVU."

Simultaneously inferring the PDFs and nucleon off-shell corrections allows both to be determined consistently, without theoretical assumptions about the isospin dependence of nuclear effects. The analysis provides strong evidence for the need of nucleon off-shell corrections to describe the $A=3$ data, and suggests the presence of both isoscalar and isovector nuclear effects in $A \\leq 3$ nuclei. We find that the extracted EMC ratios of nuclear to nucleon structure functions for $A=2$ and 3 differ from those naively extrapolated from heavy nuclei down to low $A$."

In prior work, NL has been implemented and extensively tested on separable and time series data, and demonstrated its superior performance on both classification and regression tasks. In this paper, we investigate the next step in NL, viz., applying NL to linked data, in particular, data that is represented in the form of knowledge graphs. We integrate linked data into NL by implementing node aggregation on knowledge graphs, and then feeding the aggregated node features to the simplest NL architecture: ChaosNet. We demonstrate the results of our implementation on homophilic graph datasets as well as heterophilic graph datasets of verying heterophily. We show better efficacy of our approach on homophilic graphs than on heterophilic graphs. While doing so, we also present our analysis of the results, as well as suggestions for future work."

    "abstract": "The solar dynamo relies on the regeneration of the poloidal magnetic field through processes strongly modulated by nonlinear feedbacks such as tilt quenching (TQ) and latitude quenching (LQ). These mechanisms play a decisive role in regulating the buildup of the Sun's polar field and, in turn, the amplitude of future solar cycles. In this work, we employ Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) to solve the surface flux transport (SFT) equation, embedding physical constraints directly into the neural network framework. By systematically varying transport parameters, we isolate the relative contributions of TQ and LQ to polar dipole buildup. We use the residual dipole moment as a diagnostic for cycle-to-cycle amplification and show that TQ suppression strengthens with increasing diffusivity, while LQ dominates in advection-dominated regimes. The ratio $ΔD_{\\mathrm{LQ}}/ΔD_{\\mathrm{TQ}}$ exhibits a smooth inverse-square dependence on the dynamo effectivity range, refining previous empirical fits with improved accuracy and reduced scatter. The results further reveal that the need for a decay term is not essential for PINN set-up due to the training process. Compared with the traditional 1D SFT model, the PINN framework achieves significantly lower error metrics and more robust recovery of nonlinear trends. Our results suggest that the nonlinear interplay between LQ and TQ can naturally produce alternations between weak and strong cycles, providing a physical explanation for the observed even-odd cycle modulation. These findings demonstrate the potential of PINN as an accurate, efficient, and physically consistent tool for solar cycle prediction."

Coherent structures are extracted employing a data-efficient multi-taper spectral POD. Dominant modes occur in the Strouhal number range $St \\in [0.1,0.3]$. Surface modes reveal wave-like shock motions that originate near the pylon-wing intersection and propagate inboard towards the fuselage. These shock oscillations are linked to unsteady flow separation downstream of the shock. Additional dominant modes show spanwise oscillations of the separated flow region and shock oscillations phase-linked to shear layer instabilities. The modal analysis of volume data reveals pressure waves connected to these modes traveling upstream above and below the wing."

Bandstop rejection microstrip structures are incorporated at the output end of the BPF to suppress the harmonics outside the passband. This design method is validated with a C-band bandpass filter incorporating an SIW cavity and four units of cycle-mirrored rectangular resonant slots. The measured S-parameters of the designed filter agree with the simulated ones. Leveraging the high-Q SIW cavity and periodic resonant units, the designed filter has achieved desired performance in terms of low insertion loss, sharp roll-off rate and wide stopband."

Existing retrieval models often only attempt to align retrievals within a single semantic space. In this case, the probability of incorrect retrieval increases with the growth of data volume. This paper proposes an alignment method called MPCL(Multi-Plane Contrastive Learning), which tries to project data into different query vectors through cross-attention, enabling data alignment in multiple semantic spaces, thereby greatly improving the accuracy of retrieval. Experimental results show that the retrieval performance of the model improves as the number of query vectors increases."

There are a number of Responsible AI methods, but they frequently don't have a cohesive system in place to match technological design with moral and legal requirements at every stage of the model lifespan. In this research, we present the Regulation-Aware Neural Network Lifecycle (RANNL), a new five-stage paradigm that directly integrates explainability, bias mitigation, and real-time compliance tracking into neural network development. The Compliance Scoring System (CS) in RANNL, in contrast to previous methods, statistically assesses models according to their interpretability, fairness, and regulatory preparedness. The EU AI Act, UNESCO AI Ethics Recommendations, and OECD AI Principles are just a few of the international policies that are linked to each step of the lifespan by a dynamic Regulation Mapping Matrix.Using deep learning architectures and regulatory toolkits like AI Fairness 360, Captum, and SHAP, we apply RANNL to a real-world healthcare prediction problem in order to validate the scheme. Model openness, fairness metrics, and compliance scores are all improved without sacrificing predictive performance in comparison to traditional ML pipelines. These findings demonstrate how well RANNL may bridge the gap between global AI governance and neural network engineering. This paper offers an interdisciplinary, quantifiable, and scalable method for creating reliable AI systems by fusing technical and policy viewpoints."

    "abstract": "The stability evaluation of surrounding rock is a core issue in the safety protection of underground engineering, essentially involving the study of system complexity characterized by multi-factor coupling and non-linearity. Given the limitations of traditional evaluation methods in terms of indicator compatibility, dynamic adaptability, and quantitative expression accuracy, this paper proposes a fractal-interpolation comprehensive evaluation model. First, five key control indicators are selected based on the principles of engineering geomechanics. Second, the fractal characteristic parameters of each indicator are determined using the box-counting dimension method from fractal theory, and an indicator-rating correlation matrix is established through the maximum likelihood criterion. Then, a fractal interpolation function is constructed to transform multi-dimensional indicators into a single fractal dimension evaluation index. Finally, a mapping relationship model between evaluation grades and fractal characteristic values is established. Taking an underground project in a granite area of Tibet as an example, the evaluation results of this method are not only consistent with traditional methods but also enable fine ranking of samples within the same grade through quantitative scoring. The study confirms that this model, by integrating fractal geometric features and interpolation approximation algorithms, effectively addresses the challenges of multi-source uncertainty factor fusion and dynamic evolution law characterization, providing a more accurate basis for decision-making in engineering practice."

Phishing attacks exploit fast, intuitive judgments. Drawing on the Dual Process Theories of Higher Cognition (DPT) of Evans and Stanovich, this original study investigates how cognitive strategies in chess can be applied to cybersecurity threat detection. In this research, chess players significantly outperform non-chess players at phishing detection, building on prior work where the two populations' cognitive abilities, such as cognitive reflection and planning, were studied. Using principles from Signal Detection Theory (SDT), the enhanced accuracy exhibited by chess players in identifying phishing emails appears more attributable to a generalized predisposition toward increased threat anticipation than to a domain-specific capacity to reliably discriminate between phishing and legitimate emails. Framed within the context of the Dual Process Theory and Signal Detection Theory, this perspective offers a novel insight into the cognitive mechanisms underlying cybersecurity decision-making, highlighting a potential role for chess-based cognitive expertise in phishing detection."

A web server from the ESP32 CAM Module was employed to surveil the remote area, and its incorporation into the PyCharm programming environment facilitated image analysis for the identification of unauthorized individuals. Consequently, real-time alerts and alarms were generated simultaneously, allowing users to make informed decisions regarding the need for on-site involvement. These applications served as the primary interface for assessing the security of the remote area safeguarded by the prototypes and the data gathered from the system, utilizing Arduino and Python programming languages.

    "abstract": "Accurate recognition of traffic signs is a foundation of contemporary autonomous driving systems, and it is an important factor in road safety, lawful driving, and informed vehicle control. However, developing high reliability in operational environments is still a significant challenge. Poor weather conditions, partial occlusion by other cars or obstacles, and the small appearance of traffic signs tend to face many challenges and fail to provide consistent detection. Such issues may reduce system performance and undermine safety-critical decisions. This model introduces SignSight, a strong deep learning framework for real time perception of traffic sign and recognition framework to address and direct these challenges through a hybrid deep learning architecture. The approach combines conventional CNNs with Keras for initial classification complemented with a YOLOv8 detection pipeline for accurate spatial localization and real-time prediction. Compared to state-of-the-art models, SignSight includes weather-robust preprocessing methods and taps into small-object detection improvements. Taking cues from recent research such as YOLO-BS and MASG-Net, our approach utilizes multiscale feature learning along with context-aware modules to enhance detection of small sized and blurred traffic signs. Our unified system reached a highest classification accuracy of 97.4%, with real-time performance ensured."

First, an asynchronous data alignment model is constructed using PMU data as the time reference to achieve time consistency mapping and multi-scale unification of SCADA and AMI data. Then, a time-series symbolization model based on the SAX algorithm is established for data discretization and symbolization. By integrating the similarity metric based on Euclidean distance, a dynamic reference sequence fitting mechanism is proposed for identifying anomalies, repairing outliers, and filling missing values. Finally, a fusion estimation model based on distributed Kalman filtering is built to integrate the cleaned multi-source information. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits excellent performance in anomaly detection accuracy, error control, and data fusion, showing strong practical value and engineering adaptability."

The proposed transition structure enhances mechanical reliability by optimizing the termination of the air-filled coaxial line’s inner conductor, thereby eliminating suspended features and reducing deformation risks as well as fabrication sensitivity. It also overcomes bandwidth limitations caused by internal supporting stubs of the inner conductor by introducing a supportless air-filled coaxial architecture, where the inner conductor is inherently supported by the waveguide wall. A Ka-band back-to-back transition prototype, fabricated using Polyjet 3-D printing and electroless copper/silver plating, achieves a return loss exceeding 15 dB and an average insertion loss of 0.78 dB across the full band. These results confirm the proposed design’s potential for high-reliability RF measurement and applications involving 3-D printed air-filled coaxial components."

The mobile robots communicate locally, when they encounter each other in the exploring field, to share the map information to enhance the efficiency of the entire mapping system. Even if some unexplored areas remained, another shape-fitting technique will be applied to the incomplete information obtained, and it enables the system to output the most-likely environment map for the subsequent principal task, such as intended rescue mission. A series of simulations were conducted to verify the proposed cooperative mapping method, and the results of the examination demonstrated its consistency and efficiency."

This task is particularly important for the analysis of hormone receptors in breast cancer, where the status of the progesterone receptor (PR) plays a key role in determining the response to treatment. However, because of differences in nuclear morphology, staining intensity, and overlapping structures, nucleus segmentation in PR-IHC images is still difficult. In order to separate PR-expressing nuclei from high-resolution breast cancer histopathology images, we present an automated instance segmentation frame-work in this work that is based on the Cellpose deep learning model, supported by an entirely novel ground truth (GT) dataset produced by a hybrid pipeline. In order to create the GT, 250 high-resolution PR-IHC images with trustworthy binary nuclei masks were combined with automated segmentation (StarDist), extensive manual corrections, and multiround pathological validation. On the test set, our Cellpose-based approach consistently performs properly, achieving an average F 1 score of 0.8535, precision of 0.8882, recall of 0.8215, and IoU of 0.7445. Strong segmentation of extracted and overlapping nuclei is confirmed by visual results. This study offers a useful resource for future research in hormone receptor quantification and computational pathology, as well as the first automated segmentation benchmark for the PR-IHC dataset."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have gained enormous popularity for processing and generating text. They are a subset of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) that require higher availability of graphical processing unit (GPU) resources for inference services. However, making GPU resources available in a centralized infrastructure is quite challenging. Therefore, recent works have focused on decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) to utilize idle GPU resources, enabling scalable LLM inference services across the decentralized network. These inference services may experience inherent latency (i.e., measured in time per output token (TPOT)) due to communication overhead or time between GPU resources responsible for generating consecutive tokens. The task scheduling algorithm is crucial in decentralized LLM inference services to minimize TPOT and maximize GPU resource utilization, particularly when GPU resources are constrained by computational capacity. This paper introduces two task scheduling algorithms, the improved greedy heuristic shortest path algorithm (IGHSPA) and the dynamic programming-based task scheduling algorithm (DPTSA), for decentralized LLM serving to achieve these objectives. Each task involves assigning a layer to a GPU resource, which IGHSPA and DPTSA accomplish using greedy heuristic and dynamic programming. Both algorithms are extensively simulated and compared with one of the recent algorithms, namely the greedy heuristic shortest path algorithm (GHSPA), in terms of TPOT and execution time (ET). Our simulation results demonstrate that DPTSA improves TPOT up to 47.50% and 35.50% and ET up to 99.95% and 35.00%, compared to GHSPA and IGHSPA."

    "abstract": "Recently, the integration of the efficient feed-forward scheme into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has been actively explored. However, most existing methods focus on sparse view reconstruction of small regions and cannot produce eligible whole-scene reconstruction results in terms of either quality or efficiency. In this paper, we propose FreeSplat++, which focuses on extending the generalizable 3DGS to become an alternative approach to large-scale indoor whole-scene reconstruction, which has the potential of significantly accelerating the reconstruction speed and improving the geometric accuracy. To facilitate whole-scene reconstruction, we initially propose the Low-cost Cross-View Aggregation framework to efficiently process extremely long input sequences. Subsequently, we introduce a carefully designed pixel-wise triplet fusion method to incrementally aggregate the overlapping 3D Gaussian primitives from multiple views, adaptively reducing their redundancy. Furthermore, given the fused 3DGS primitives with accumulated weights after the fusion step, we propose a weighted floater removal strategy that can effectively reduce floaters, which serves as an explicit depth fusion approach that is tailored for generalizable 3DGS methods and becomes crucial in whole-scene reconstruction. After the feed-forward reconstruction of 3DGS primitives, we investigate a depth-regularized per-scene fine-tuning process. Leveraging the dense, multi-view consistent depth maps obtained during the feed-forward prediction phase for an extra constraint, we refine the entire scene's 3DGS primitive to enhance rendering quality while preserving geometric accuracy. Extensive experiments confirm that our FreeSplat++ significantly outperforms existing generalizable 3DGS methods, especially in whole scene reconstructions. Compared to conventional per-scene optimized 3DGS approaches, our method with depth-regularized per-scene fine-tuning demonstrates substantial improvements in reconstruction accuracy and a notable reduction in training time."

A prototype featuring a cluster state cache and an intent analyzer (using AWS Bedrock) was developed. Empirical evaluation demonstrated high LLM parsing accuracy (>95% Subset Accuracy on an evaluation ground-truth dataset) for top-tier models like Amazon Nova Pro/Premier and Mistral Pixtral Large, significantly outperforming a baseline engine. Scheduling quality tests across six scenarios showed the prototype achieved superior or equivalent placement compared to standard Kubernetes configurations, particularly excelling in complex and quantitative scenarios and handling conflicting soft preferences. The results validate using LLMs for accessible scheduling but highlight limitations like synchronous LLM latency, suggesting asynchronous processing for production readiness.

    "abstract": "Dockless micromobility systems provide essential flexibility for urban mobility but face significant operational challenges, primarily the supply-demand imbalance where vehicles are unavailable in high-demand areas while remaining idle elsewhere. Although significant research has been conducted in the literature to address this imbalance using spatial optimization models such as the Maximal Covering Location Problem (MCLP), they often fail to accurately model users' walking behavior to access a vehicle. Specifically, existing approaches neglect the combined influence of distance and topographical factors such as slope, leading to suboptimal vehicle placement. This paper proposes a novel Walking Behavior-Based MCLP (WB-MCLP) model. This approach integrates a more realistic representation of user behavior by simultaneously modeling walking characteristics as a function of both distance and slope to optimize vehicle deployment. The proposed WB-MCLP was validated using historical ride data from stationless shared e-scooter systems and benchmarked against existing models, including Distance Tolerance MCLP (DT-MCLP) and slope-aware variant (DT-MCLP+S), as well as genetic algorithm (GA) and random placement (RP) strategies. Results demonstrate that the WB-MCLP achieves superior performance in 14 out of 20 tested scenarios in terms of walking distance and 11 out of 20 scenarios in terms of coverage rate, providing more effective vehicle coverage that aligns with realistic user access behavior. The findings confirm that incorporating both distance and slope provides a more accurate model of user behavior, leading to significant improvements in system efficiency. This research offers a valuable decision support framework for service providers and urban planners to enhance the performance and sustainability of dockless shared mobility systems."

To remedy this, we propose to augment continuous trajectory generation by simultaneously generating a high-level symbolic plan. We show that this requires a novel mix of discrete variable diffusion and continuous diffusion, which dramatically outperforms the baselines. In addition, we illustrate how this hybrid diffusion process enables flexible trajectory synthesis, allowing us to condition synthesized actions on partial and complete symbolic conditions."

To address these limitations, we propose BMchain, an end-to-end SBC that innovates in data structure and collaboration model. BMchain maintains a lightweight main chain (under 2 MB per block) by recording only Bloom filters and Merkle roots of transactions. This design allows users to transact without being constantly online and enables regulators to verify data completeness and correctness solely from <sc xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">on</small>-chain information. Experimental results show BMchain achieves over 10 000 TPS throughput, reduces annual account storage to around 200 MB, and confirms transactions within 2 min at scale—significantly outperforming existing solutions. Unlike accumulator-based approaches, BMchain fundamentally decouples local state updates from global ledger changes, offering a practical and regulatory-friendly SBC architecture."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate task offloading and computing in an urban mobile edge computing (MEC) system assisted by an aerial intelligent reflecting surface (AIRS). To enhance information freshness while saving energy, we formulate a joint optimization problem to minimize the weighted sum of average age of information (AoI) and total energy consumption by jointly optimizing task offloading decisions, resource allocation, and AIRS configuration including its deployment position, phase shifts, and panel size, subject to offloading quality and computing deadline constraints. To tackle the resulting mixed-integer and nonconvex problem, we develop a hierarchical optimization framework based on the objective priority and variable coupling relations. Under this framework, the problem is solved in two stages using quadratic penalty, numerical analysis, and convex optimization techniques. Specifically, an AoI-aware task offloading policy is first designed to maximize information freshness; subsequently, given the obtained offloading policy, an AIRS configuration and resource allocation scheme is proposed to minimize energy consumption. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms benchmark schemes in reducing both AoI and energy consumption, while exhibiting superior convergence performance."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in deep learning (DL) have shown promising results in the identification of malignant lung nodules from computed tomography (CT) scans. However, conventional DL models primarily rely on spatial features and often lack clinical interpretability and the ability to incorporate domain-specific priors. To address these limitations, we integrate Bayesian diameter posterior probabilistic knowledge, allowing the model to leverage the well-established correlation between nodule size and malignancy likelihood. To enhance interpretability, we introduce a new deep-texture-shape (DTS) scoring scheme that offers oncologists a transparent, component-wise justification for malignancy prediction. Furthermore, relying solely on spatial features may overlook critical textural patterns, which play a significant role in malignancy assessment. To overcome this, we utilize local binary patterns (LBP), histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), and gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) to extract rich textural features, capturing the fine-grained patterns that contribute to malignancy characterization. This multi-faceted approach not only improves prediction accuracy but also enhances the model’s robustness. The proposed method, probabilistic knowledge-based decision fusion (ProKDF), is evaluated on two public datasets: the Lung Image Database Consortium and Image Database Resource Initiative (LIDC-IDRI) and the International Society for Optics and Photonics and American Association of Physicists in Medicine (SPIE-AAPM). It achieves an F1-score of 87.48% (95% CI: 85.93%–89.03%) and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 92.56% (95% CI: 91.70%–93.42%) on LIDC-IDRI. Our findings suggest that integrating shape-based probabilistic knowledge and texture information enhances model performance and interpretability in detecting nodule heterogeneity."

    "abstract": "Pseudo points offer dimensional alignment between camera and LiDAR data for multi-modal 3D object detection. However, the pseudo points are irregularly and densely distributed, while LiDAR point distribution becomes sparse. Because the aliasing of different distributions can lead to redundancy or deficiency in objects, thereby causing size errors. Existing methods neglect the factor of consistent distribution representation across modalities, which compromises performance. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-phase consolidated fusion (MPCF) framework, a multimodal network favoring consistent feature distribution for 3D object detection. Specifically, we propose a region fusion strategy with cross-modal distribution alignment. This strategy utilizes matrix interactions and parameter sharing to align the inherent spatial distributions of each modality. Subsequently, multiple identical layers are employed to refine the channel distribution. This process organizes the features distribution from different modalities into a consistent representation. Furthermore, we restructured the pseudo-point branch, where conservative color weighting and extraction minimize interference with the feature distribution. Extensive experiments conducted on the KITTI and nuScenes benchmarks have demonstrated the remarkable performance and efficiency of MPCF. In the KITTI 3D detection test leaderboard of car, the MPCF has achieved 1st place among all single-use data methods.

    "abstract": "The limitations of seismic vertical resolution pose significant challenges for the identification of thin beds. Improving the vertical resolution of seismic data using deep learning methods often encounters challenges related to unrealistic outputs and limited generalization. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that improves the fidelity and generalization of seismic super-resolution. Our approach begins with the generation of realistic synthetic training data that aligns with the structural and amplitude characteristics of field surveys. We then introduce an enhanced 2D network with 3D awareness, which builds on the 2D Swin-Transformer and 3D convolution blocks to effectively capture 3D spatial features while maintaining computational efficiency. This network addresses the limitations of traditional 2D approaches by reducing stitching artifacts and improving spatial consistency. Finally, we develop a prior-informed fine-tuning strategy using field data without the need for labels, which incorporates a self-supervised data consistency loss and a spectral matching loss based on prior knowledge. This strategy ensures that the super-resolution results preserve the original low frequency information while yielding a spectral distribution as expected. Experiments on multiple field datasets demonstrate the robustness and generalization capability of our method, making it a practical solution for seismic resolution enhancement in diverse field datasets."

While chest X-ray (CXR) imaging is a valuable diagnostic modality for early TB screening, the manual interpretation of radiographs often introduces variability. It depends heavily on the availability of skilled radiologists. In response to this challenge, we propose a novel deep convolutional neural network (CNN) designed to classify CXR images as TB-positive or TB-negative automatically. The architecture integrates a residual-style framework comprising dual-branch convolutional layers featuring both 3 × 3 and 1 × 1 convolutions to facilitate effective feature extraction and enhance representational depth. LeakyReLU (LR) activation functions and batch normalization (BN) are employed throughout the model to improve training stability and mitigate gradient degradation. A global average pooling (GAP) layer is used for spatial dimension reduction, followed by a fully connected classification head. The model is trained and evaluated on publicly available TB CXR datasets using standard performance metrics, including accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and F1-score. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior performance compared to prior methods. Given its computational efficiency and reliability, the model shows promise for integration into real-time, low-resource diagnostic settings as a supportive tool for TB screening."

Using data covering the timeframe of five years (2021-2025), the objective behind this research is to understand the interdependent nature of the electric demand and different external conditions of the environment. Preliminary analysis indicates that the demand for electricity varies based on the time of the day, the season and the day of the week. Peak demand is at noon in winter at 27,000 units and declines to 22,000 units during post-midnight. Electric demand positively correlated with temperature and humidity, where a notable increase in demand was detected when temperature increased from 5°C to 8°C and when humidity increased from 60% to 66% The wind speed variation of the demand shows that the demand is less than <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$2 ~\\mathrm{m} / \\mathrm{s}$</tex> and higher than <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$5 ~\\mathrm{m} / \\mathrm{s}$</tex>.

Additionally, a transition from the TE<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">10</inf> mode of rectangular waveguide to the TM<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">01</inf> mode of circular waveguide is designed to feed the antenna. To validate the design, a prototype is fabricated and measured. The measurement results show that the proposed antenna achieves omnidirectional RHCP characteristics with horizontal roundness lower than 2.5 dB and axial ratio lower than 3.5 dB from 35.2 to 36.4 GHz. Furthermore, the elevation beam covers from -10° to +30°, which is preferred by low-altitude UAVs."

    "abstract": "The performance of dynamic comparators significantly influences the efficiency, speed, and accuracy of Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs), especially in modern low-power and high-speed applications. Traditional design methodologies relying on exhaustive simulations and manual tuning are inefficient and fail to adapt to process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations. This paper proposes a comprehensive data-driven optimization framework that leverages machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance dynamic comparator performance across key metrics. The framework introduces a four-stage pipeline comprising feature extraction from simulation and measurement data, supervised learning for offset voltage prediction, reinforcement learning (RL) for adaptive calibration, and Bayesian optimization for automated sizing of circuit components. These methods collectively reduce design complexity, improve accuracy and power efficiency, and enable real-time adaptability. While integration with Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools remains a future direction, the proposed framework lays the foundation for scalable, intelligent comparator design targeting applications such as IoT, biomedical systems, and high-speed communications."

    "abstract": "In response to the challenges of Counter-UAV (C-UAV) target detection in the security domain—specifically the small size of UAVs and their susceptibility to background interference—this paper proposes an improved YOLOv11-based algorithm, termed AAP2-YOLO, to enhance the detection performance of small UAVs. The proposed method incorporates three key optimization strategies: (1) the introduction of the ADown module into the backbone as a down-sampling component, which reduces parameter count while mitigating feature loss during extraction; (2) the replacement of the original neck with a more efficient ASF network, enabling effective multi-scale feature fusion; and (3) structural modifications involving the removal of the large-scale detection head and its associated neck layers, along with the addition of a P2 detection layer, which substantially improves small-object detection performance. Experimental results on the DUT ANTI-UAV dataset demonstrate that AAP2-YOLO outperforms YOLOv11n, achieving an 11.6% increase in Recall and a 9% improvement in mAP50, while simultaneously reducing parameter count by 36%. To further validate the generalization ability of the proposed model, we included additional inference experiments on the TIB-Net UAV dataset in the comparative analysis. The results further demonstrate that, for small-object detection, the proposed model achieves superior performance compared with mainstream approaches. Although inference complexity increases, the overall frame rate remains within the real-time range, making the method suitable for deployment on embedded devices."

To solve this challenge, this paper proposes a data-driven framework that leverages a lightweight convolutional neural network to predict NR-BPFs modulation parameters from S-parameter magnitude and phase responses. The proposed deep learning model incorporates an inverted residual with linear bottleneck to reduce computational cost while maintaining high prediction accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated by extracting modulation parameters of microstrip line NR-BPF and comparing with harmonic balance simulated results."

At the same time, blockchain provides a decentralized and immutable ledger that enhances security and traceability, and AI powers predictive analytics, allowing us to optimize our decision-making processes. The study investigates the opportunity of leveraging these two technologies to provide a more efficient and transparent way of managing resources and optimizing supply chain transactions. Combining AI-based predictive models with the transparent and secure features of blockchain will allow for further in-depth analyses of demand forecasting, inventory management, production scheduling, and risk assessment which reduce inefficiencies, and enhances decision-making from end-to-end supply chain processes. We examine the roles of blockchain-based AI-powered predictive analytics to carry out different applications such as demand forecasting, fraud detection, route selection, and supplier selection, which are all key components to improve the performance of an effective supply chain operation. For cutting-edge data analysis, algorithms based on AI make predictions about future trends and behaviors in order to optimize decision-making to take place in such a way that avoids risk and maximizes the effectiveness of resource allocation. Being able to record all transactions transparently and securely on the distributed ledger of the blockchain is a powerful feature by itself that ensures the integrity of the data and increases the trust of all supply chain participants, enhancing collaboration and allowing for more accurate forecasting. In addition, the combination of these technologies provides solutions to traditional problems like counterfeiting, data manipulation, and delay in transaction confirmation. It prepares us to delve into the potential and limitations of AI and blockchain in enhancing compatibility, actual trade activity with cryptocurrencies and financial arrangements, the appropriate utilization of money related valuables and contrasts in decentralized ID and records, and secure exchanges in various settings. If correctly implemented, the partnership between blockchain and AI can revitalize economies and relatively decrease resource robbery and waste by reinforcing the control and efficacy of each transactions going on in the supply chain."

Thus, self-checkouts using barcode scanning have been developed in pursuit of shorter checkout times. However, some customers find these systems to be tedious to use. Furthermore, there is a gap in implementation when it comes to non-barcoded items which require weighing and manual code entry. Thus, deviating from the barcode system and eliminating the need for manual barcode scans may simplify the checkout process by eliminating the need for packaging, weighing, and labeling in advance. This research aims to develop a semi-automated self-checkout system for shopping item classification and price calculation of non-barcode items such as fresh proteins and produce. This was done by developing a computer vision module using YOLOv8 trained on a custom dataset, a timebased digital scale module for real-time weight reading, a price calculation module, and a hardware configuration."

First, its general capability for key node identification was validated on a suite of diverse, established complex networks, demonstrating superior performance against several state-of-the-art baselines in propagation tasks. Second, its specific efficacy for behavioral analysis was tested on a substantial corpus of professional multi-agent system simulation records, assessing its performance across the distinct strategic dimensions of agent confrontation, technological development, and resource regulation. Expert validation with domain specialists was conducted to gauge the practical utility and actionable insight of the system’s output.Expert validation confirms the framework’s practical utility, with 83% of identified key nodes receiving professional endorsement and 76% of behavioral suggestions deemed actionable.

    "abstract": "In order to meet the demand for high frequencies above the Q-band in non-terrestrial communication networks in 5G and Beyond 5G, we prototyped a flip-chip mounted Q-band bandpass filter on an alumina substrate MIC with an integrated shield structure. There are problems due to spatial radiation from the resonators in high frequency filters, and loading of shield plates or packaging are usually adopting at the expense of increasing size. An integrated shield structure is realized by using vias and a GND layer inside the resin substrate on which other devices can be mounted. The proposed structure could solve both the radiation problem and miniaturization. The prototype showed high rejection characteristics outside the passband, and sufficient steepness. The simulation and measurement of the prototype showed good agreements, confirming the effectiveness of the integrated shield structure."

    "abstract": "This study proposes an AI-based Fault diagnosis and prediction algorithm that analyzes variations in the key electrical parameters of a power semiconductor switch to identify degradation progression and incipient fault symptoms. The proposed algorithm employs a hybrid neural architecture that combines a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to enable fault diagnosis detection and prediction for the power switch. MLP is configured to learn the static characteristics at each time step, LSTM is simultaneously to learn the dynamic changes over time. This approach enables high accuracy classification of MOSFET gate oxide degradation, packaging related degradation and normal operating states. In addition, modeling non-linear relationships with a polynomial regression model enables effective prediction of early degradation trends preceding fault occurrence. Based on MATLAB Simulink and NASA’s Open Data-Set, normal, degraded and fault states were collected. Consequently, the proposed algorithm was demonstrated by simulation results with a small gap between training and validation losses and a diagnostic accuracy exceeding 96%."

    "abstract": "Indoor scene recognition has achieved significant progress with deep learning, but existing methods often suffer from imbalanced modality contributions, neglect of feature differences across modalities, and insufficient cross-scale semantic consistency. To address these issues, we propose Mul-DGM, a multi-modal dynamic interaction model for indoor scene recognition. Mul-DGM employs a dual-branch architecture with ResNet-50 for RGB feature extraction and Swin Transformer for normal map feature extraction. A dynamic modality interaction enhancement (DMIE) module adaptively balances modality contributions through bidirectional attention and dynamic routing, while a global adaptive cross-modal attention (GACMA) module leverages multi-head attention to effectively capture complementary characteristics across modalities. Furthermore, a multi-scale modality contrastive loss (MSMCL) is introduced to enforce semantic consistency across different scales. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that Mul-DGM achieves superior accuracy and generalization compared to state-of-the-art approaches, validating the effectiveness of the proposed modules in robust multi-modal feature fusion for indoor scene recognition."

Heart-related conditions that affect the organ's structure and operation collectively go under the umbrella term “heart disease.” Whenever the heart's arteries cannot adequately supply the organ with oxygen-rich blood, coronary heart disease, a kind of heart disease, develops. In the discipline of medicine, machine learning is crucial. The performance of heart disease prediction is improved in this study using ensemble learning techniques. A wrong diagnosis can kill, but being able to predict heart disease correctly can lower major health risks. This study analyses the outcomes and analyses of the University of California at Irvine Machine Learning Cardiovascular Syndrome Dataset by a range of machine learning and deep learning approaches. The dataset consists of the 14 key characteristics that will be employed in the investigation. It is possible to verify some encouraging results using accuracy and confusion matrices. The study's findings were contrasted with those of the most recent, state-of-the-art research, with an emphasis on how well they predicted heart disease. In this study, a deep learning technique called “neural networks” is forecast the probability of cardiovascular ailment in a patient.

However, most public datasets, such as the Waymo Open Motion Dataset and Argoverse, are collected in Western road environments and do not reflect the unique traffic patterns, infrastructure, and driving behaviors of other regions, including South Korea. This domain discrepancy leads to performance degradation when state-of-the-art models trained on Western data are deployed in different geographic contexts. In this work, we investigate the adaptability of Query-Centric Trajectory Prediction (QCNet) when transferred from U.S.-based data to Korean road environments. Using a Korean autonomous driving dataset, we compare four training strategies: zero-shot transfer, training from scratch, full fine-tuning, and encoder freezing. Experimental results demonstrate that leveraging pretrained knowledge significantly improves prediction performance. Specifically, selectively fine-tuning the decoder while freezing the encoder yields the best trade-off between accuracy and training efficiency, reducing prediction error by over 66% compared to training from scratch. This study provides practical insights into effective transfer learning strategies for deploying trajectory prediction models in new geographic domains."

    "abstract": "The rapid proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) exposes heterogeneous and resource-constrained devices to an increasingly diverse and evolving range of network attacks. Conventional centralized intrusion detection systems (IDS) and complex machine learning models often experience high computational and communication costs while lacking the capability to detect unknown threats. This paper proposes a lightweight distributed IDS framework that integrates multi-stage data compression, including feature selection, dimensionality reduction, and clustering-based sample compression, with lightweight classifiers and ensemble-based decision fusion. The framework is evaluated under two scenarios: (i) an extreme seven-client setting, where each client is trained on a single attack type, and (ii) a realistic five-client setting with heterogeneous attack distributions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly reduces training cost and energy consumption while maintaining high detection performance. In the seven-client case, recall remains above 90% even with only 10% of samples retained under extreme heterogeneity, whereas in the five-client case, recall exceeds 97% under the same compression level. On the Raspberry Pi platform, total energy consumption decreases from 0.002015 kWh (without compression) to 0.000145 kWh, corresponding to a 92.8% reduction, while the prediction throughput reaches 7,117 to 173,005 samples per second across the five clients, ensuring real-time applicability. Ensemble strategies further improve robustness and enable effective detection of rare and zero-day attacks. These findings highlight the framework’s ability to balance performance, power consumption, and efficiency, making it well-suited for practical lightweight IoT deployments."

    "abstract": "Underwater object detection plays an important role in marine safety and defense, particularly in identifying explosive-like or hazardous materials lying on the seabed. This study proposes a knowledge distillation (KD) framework to enhance the underwater object detection performance of sonar systems by leveraging an additional sensing modality. High-resolution camera images act as the teacher modality, whereas sonar images serve as the student modality. The proposed method was designed to handle heterogeneous modalities with fundamentally different structures, resolutions, and geometric representations. A YOLOX-based detection architecture equipped with a Cross-Model Object-Level Distillation (CMOLD) module was employed to transfer the object-level knowledge from the camera to the sonar. A key motivation of this study is that sonar-based detection alone often struggles with low-contrast, ambiguous, or noisy underwater returns. Although cameras may fail in deep, dark, or turbid environments, the availability of paired camera–sonar data during training enables the sonar model to learn richer high-level feature representations that cameras naturally provide. As a result, the distilled sonar model becomes more capable of detecting targets in real-world conditions where no camera input is available at inference time. This capability is particularly valuable for defense and security applications, where Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) must operate reliably in visually degraded environments. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model improves the performance of the sonar compared to conventional sonar-only baselines and sonar-based KD methods. These findings highlight the potential of multimodal knowledge distillation to enhance the operational performance of underwater sensing systems and provide a practical solution for real-time autonomous underwater applications."

    "abstract": "High-precision mapping of soybeans, a globally significant oil and protein crop, has long been constrained by the limitations of traditional remote sensing methods, particularly regarding their inefficiency in fusing spatio-temporal information and suboptimal classification accuracy. Consequently, the rigorous demands of modern precision agriculture for crop monitoring have often not been adequately addressed. To address these challenges, a novel hybrid model was developed in this study for soybean identification using multi-temporal remote sensing imagery. This model is built upon an improved three-dimensional (3D) U-Net architecture, which synergistically integrates Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) networks and Random Forest (RF) algorithms. This integration enables the effective extraction of multi-level features and subsequent integrated classification. A notable innovation of this research involves the incorporation of the Greenness-Water Content Composite Index (GWCCI) into the feature set. GWCCI quantifies canopy greenness and water status, improving discrimination of soybean phenology. Experimental validation was conducted within the primary soybean production region of Hailun City, Heilongjiang Province. The results demonstrated that the proposed model significantly outperformed 10 baseline methods (including standard 3D U-Net, CNN, and RF) across four key metrics: Overall Accuracy (OA), User Accuracy (UA), F1-score, and Kappa coefficient. Specifically, when benchmarked against a standard 3D U-Net, the developed model exhibited a 3.2% increase in OA, a 9.3% increase in UA, a 2.6% improvement in F1-score, and a 6.4% increase in the Kappa coefficient. These quantitative improvements highlight its enhanced capability in distinguishing soybeans from background crops. Ultimately, this research not only provides a novel methodological framework for precise crop classification but also contributes a viable multi-dimensional feature fusion strategy directly applicable to crop monitoring and intelligent agricultural management."

To estimate the unknown perturbation, a novel perturbation observer nested with a parameter adaptive law is first designed. Subsequently, a coupling performance index function relevant to the synchronization error and the control policy with the quadratic form is constructed. By utilizing the distributed adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) technology with a single-critic architecture, the optimal control policy is designed by solving the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation associated with the coupling performance index function. Meanwhile, an adaptive OCS control policy with a single-critic neural network (NN) updating law is further proposed, and it is proven that the designed adaptive OCS control policy constitutes the generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) point of the MCG. Based on the Lyapunov extension theorem, all signals of the closed-loop MASs are ensured to be bounded. Finally, a simulation example is presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive OCS control method."

Accurate monitoring of plantations, particularly tree count and health, is essential for effective management and yield estimation. However, traditional field-based methods are costly and labor-intensive, and while UAVs and very high-resolution satellite imagery offer precision, they are often limited by high cost, limited coverage, and technical constraints such as altitude variation and image mosaicking. This study proposes a scalable and cost-effective pipeline that utilizes UAV imagery implementing two tree-counting approaches Template Matching, serving as a classical baseline, and YOLOv8, a deep learning object detection model chosen for its high accuracy and inference speed. The oil palm tree density was classified into High, Medium, and Low category for easy result observation. Preliminary results demonstrate promising True Positive Rate (TPR), False Negative Rate (FNR), and Estimation Error (EE) values, with YOLOv8 achieving its best performance in medium-density regions (TPR: 109.54%, FNR: 9.50%, EE: 12.91 %) and Template Matching showing the weakest performance in low-density areas (TPR: 305.45%, FNR: 205.45 %, EE: 205.45 %). These results indicate that the proposed approach offers a practical, real-time, and resourceefficient solution for large-scale oil palm monitoring, although improvements are still required in low-density plantations."

    "abstract": "This paper considers video and audio transmission using carrier aggregation of Sub6 and millimeter-wave (mmWave) in a 5 G cellular environment. mmWave offers wideband frequency resources and enables high throughput communications and simultaneous connection of multiple devices. However, owing to its high frequency, mmWave has drawbacks such as large propagation loss, vulnerability to blockage by buildings and persons, and a short communication distance. As a practical communication method, it is unreliable in indoor and dense urban environments. To address the weaknesses of mmWave, we consider introducing carrier aggregation, which combines mmWave and Sub6. Although Sub6 has a narrower bandwidth than mmWave, it has excellent propagation characteristics, wide coverage, and stable communication quality. Carrier aggregation can complement the characteristics of both bands, promising communication stability and improving QoE. We perform computer simulations to evaluate and compare the application-level QoS of video and audio transmissions among Sub6 alone, mmWave alone, and carrier aggregation that combines mmWave and Sub6. Furthermore, we generate video and audio from the simulation results and evaluate the QoE."

    "abstract": "Quantum machine learning (QML) is an emerging field that synergistically combines quantum computing principles with classical ML techniques. With quantum principles like superposition and entanglement, QML has the potential of offering speedups for real-time optimization, classification, and generative modeling. While still in its infancy, QML has seen progress especially in hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, variational quantum circuits, and quantum kernel methods. Leading tech companies (IBM, Google, Xanadu) and startups are actively developing QML tools like Qiskit, TensorFlow Quantum, and PennyLane, enabling experiments on both simulators and early-stage quantum hardware. Recent breakthroughs include quantum advantage demonstrations in specific tasks, such as quantum-enhanced feature spaces and optimization problems. However, challenges remain due to noise in near-term quantum devices (NISQ era), limited qubit coherence, and significant error rates. Some researchers are exploring error-mitigation techniques and hybrid models that leverage classical ML to compensate for quantum hardware limitations. Key applications of QML that have shown promise include drug discovery and materials science (e.g., quantum chemistry simulations), finance (e.g., portfolio optimization and decision support), AI acceleration (e.g., quantum neural networks). While fault-tolerant and error-resistant quantum computers are still under development, QML is advancing through classical-quantum hybrid algorithms, making it a promising but rapidly evolving field. Investment from academia, industry, and governments suggests QML could play a transformative role in AI's future when hardware matures. This paper provides a primer on quantum principles as they relate to QML and takes a snapshot of the current status of QML development with an emphasis on quantum neural networks (QNNs) and highlights recent advances in automated QML (AutoQML)."

This study investigates the rhythm characteristics of Beijing Mandarin, across different speaking styles and compares them with American English, a representative stress-timed language. The findings show that read speech exhibits features typical of syllable-timed languages, with evenly distributed syllable durations. In contrast, spontaneous speech demonstrates greater rhythm variability, tending toward stress-timed patterns, influenced by prosodic, syntactic, and pragmatic factors. The rhythm of Beijing Mandarin is context-dependent and dynamic, with patterns that lie along a continuum between syllable-timed and stress-timed languages. This study thus provides new evidence that rhythm patterns form a continuum from stress-timed to syllable-timed languages. When analyzing speech rhythm, in addition to language and dialect type, it is important to consider speaking style and situational factors."

    "abstract": "In recent years, the application of micro-drones has been rapidly expanding in fields such as logistics, security, and inspection. In these environments, it is essential for drones to safely avoid dynamic obstacles, such as moving pedestrians. Furthermore, revisions to aviation regulations have increased the demand for lightweight micro-drones with a mass under 100 grams. This paper proposes a dynamic-obstacle-avoidance framework for micro-drones equipped with only a monocular camera. By integrating monocular depth estimation with Model Predictive Control, the proposed method demonstrates a high avoidance success rate. In evaluation experiments, where dynamic obstacles were modeled as pedestrians, the method achieved a $\\mathbf{1 0 0 \\%}$ avoidance success rate in scenarios involving a single person moving in the forward and lateral directions, and a $91 \\%$ avoidance success rate in scenarios involving three people moving simultaneously."

    "abstract": "Recently, federated learning (FL) has gained momentum because of its capability in preserving data privacy. To conduct model training by FL, multiple clients exchange model updates with a parameter server over the Internet. To accelerate the communication speed, it has been explored to deploy a programmable switch (PS) in lieu of the parameter server to coordinate clients. The challenge to deploy the PS in FL lies in its scarce memory space, prohibiting running memory consuming aggregation algorithms on the PS, like TopK. To overcome this challenge, we propose Federated Learning In-Network Aggregation with Global TopK Model Updates (Fed-GTopK) algorithm, consisting of two phases: voting and aggregating. In the voting phase, clients efficiently upload their votes for top model updates to the PS for selecting global top ones. Note that the voting phase consumes little memory or communication resources by only exploring the sparsity of top model updates without transmitting any model update values. In the aggregating phase, clients can reach the consensus to upload global top model updates such that the PS can swiftly aggregate global top model updates in a streamline manner without consuming much memory cost. Compared with existing works, our study is the first one accelerating in-network aggregation for FL by sparsifying model updates, and hence achieving the highest compression rate and the best learning performance. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments by using public datasets to demonstrate that Fed-GTopK remarkably surpasses the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both model accuracy and communication traffic."

    "abstract": "This work explores the electroluminescence performance and long-term stability of silver contact nanostructured silicon Schottky junction LEDs under prolonged DC bias. Si-based LEDs are increasingly sought for all-silicon integrated photonic circuits due to their compatibility with monolithic CMOS integration technology. Although their external quantum efficiency remains lower than that of commercial LEDs, NSi-based LEDs show promise for applications in quantum optics, including quantum random number generation and high-speed on-chip optical communication systems. While numerous studies have addressed factors influencing electroluminescence in nanostructured silicon devices, such as work function and transparency of the contact, injection, radiative recombination, and light extraction efficiencies, long-term spectral stability remains largely unexplored. A key factor is the non-stoichiometric native oxide layer that forms on nanostructured silicon and gets modified due to Joule heating under prolonged electrical bias. This alteration influences charge injection dynamics and affects overall device performance over time. In this study, we systematically investigate how this oxide layer governs injection efficiency and temporal stability of EL emission, including peak energy and intensity. A simple equivalent circuit is employed to account for current components associated with injection and heating. Our results indicate that the oxide layer modulates carrier injection as well as plays a stabilizing role in the output spectrum over extended operation. The calculated luminescence characteristics of the LEDs qualitatively align with experimental findings that offer valuable insights into mechanisms affecting the performance and reliability of silicon nanodevices."

An active reduction-bias cleaning (RBC) scheme is implemented to electrochemically reduce surface silver sulfide (Ag₂S) back to metallic silver, thereby mitigating sulfur-induced electrode fouling and preserving sensor sensitivity. The sensor exhibits a linear detection range of 0.05–800 μM, a sensitivity of approximately 251.6 nA·μM⁻¹·cm⁻², and a limit of detection (LOD) of ~0.03 μM, corresponding to a 150% increase in sensitivity and a 75% reduction in LOD, respectively.

Nonetheless, the presence of actuator dynamics and of significant delays, particularly in the steering actuation, can significantly hamper the applicability of this technique. This article proposes an extension to an input-output linearization approach presented in the literature, which allows for including the actuator dynamics into the linearization law, and to compensate for the effect of delays and nonidealities on the linearized system, introducing a further control action, designed with the advanced gain scheduling technique. As a result, a linear time-invariant decoupled system is obtained, which allows us to design the trajectory tracking controller using linear control tools. Simulation results, based on three different vehicle simulators, ranging from a single-track model with linear and nonlinear tire models to a dual-track model, are also presented. The performance and robustness of the inner controller, composed of the linearizing law and the advanced gain scheduling controller, are thoroughly analyzed and compared with the results obtained using the former input-output linearization available in the literature. Furthermore, the results of the application of the proposed control framework as part of a trajectory tracking controller show the efficacy of the proposal."

    "abstract": "Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) collaboration constitutes an emerging paradigm for advancing autonomous driving. However, the integrated collaboration of perception, communication, and computation within V2I system remains a critical challenge. To address it, we propose a Software-Defined Network (SDN)-based collaborative approach for Autonomous Vehicle and Road Infrastructure Network (AVRIN). The architecture designates road infrastructures as road nodes and autonomous vehicles as dynamic vehicle nodes, establishing AVRIN through SDN. The control plane dynamically maintains global network topology and distributed flow tables by continuously evaluating node accessibility, while the forwarding plane is responsible for packet transmission via the OpenFlow protocol. In the perception module, road nodes divide the perception range into spatial units, whereas vehicle nodes dynamically align these units with their drivable areas across temporal sequences. Through coordinated communication and computation modules, road nodes strategically allocate dedicated bandwidth and computational resources. Building on this approach, we develop a particle swarm-based multi-objective optimization algorithm to achieve balanced co-optimization across perception, communication, and computation. Experimental validation demonstrates its superior collaborative Bird's Eye View (BEV) detection performance on the V2X-Sim 2.0 dataset, outperforming existing approaches by 10.37% in mean Average Precision. Furthermore, evaluations on the newly collected Jiading dataset, from a real-world urban roadway, confirm the approach's robustness with 1.823-second computation time under dynamic network conditions."

With the advancement of machine learning (ML) techniques, there is growing interest in leveraging computational models to enhance diagnostic accuracy across various medical imaging modalities. This study examines the use of machine learning (ML) algorithms for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound, and mammography in the identification of breast cancer. Core ML concepts, including supervised learning algorithms such as logistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT), support vector machines (SVM), random forest (RF), artificial neural networks (ANN), and convolutional neural networks (CNN), are applied and evaluated on publicly available datasets. The classification performance of each model is analyzed based on accuracy. SVM achieved the highest accuracy of 96.50%, followed closely by LR, ANN, and bagging ensemble methods, each with 95.10%. DT and RF classifiers demonstrated accuracies of 93.72% and 93.71%, respectively. In contrast, the CNN model yielded a comparatively lower accuracy of 62.93%, likely due to a lack of spatial structure in the dataset. These findings highlight the suitability of SVM and ensemble methods for breast cancer classification tasks in structured data environments. Beyond performance metrics, the study discusses clinical challenges such as data privacy, algorithmic bias, and model interpretability. Future research directions include integrating multimodal data sources and developing personalized risk prediction models. Additionally, imaging features were extracted from both cancerous and noncancerous samples, resulting in effective classification. This work contributes to advancing ML-based diagnostic tools and supports improved breast cancer screening practices."

This study proposes an intelligent fundus image enhancement system based on the RealESRGAN super-resolution algorithm. By integrating multi-scale vessel enhancement, adaptive illumination correction, and a multi-dimensional quality assessment module, a lightweight visual interactive interface is built relying on the Tkinter framework. The system achieves automated full-process optimization of fundus images, covering preprocessing, super-resolution reconstruction, and post-processing enhancement. The core innovation of the system lies in the design of customized algorithms for the anatomical characteristics of fundus images, including green channel directional enhancement and multi-scale Frangi vessel extraction. Through the collaborative integration of traditional image processing and deep learning models, the system improves image resolution while accurately preserving key clinical structures such as blood vessels and the optic disc. Fifty clinical fundus images (including normal fundus, diabetic retinopathy, and glaucoma cases) were selected for testing. Experimental results show that the system can increase image sharpness by an average of 53.9%, contrast by 65.1%, and illumination uniformity by 19.1%. The comprehensive quality score rises from 0.58 to 0.88, providing high-quality image support for subsequent clinical diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) has emerged as a global pandemic, affecting millions of people worldwide. This is primarily characterized by dysregulated insulin signalling and elevated blood glucose levels. The increased glucose level in the body fluid can damage various tissues and organs in the human body. Metformin is the first-line treatment used to manage high blood glucose levels in patients with T2D. In this study, we performed transcriptomic analysis followed by tissue-specific metabolic modelling to uncover metabolic alterations in the blood cells of metformin-treated T2D patients. To understand the metabolic consequences, we integrated transcriptomic data into the HumanGEM model using the tINIT algorithm. The reconstructed models were subjected to Differential Flux Analysis (DFA) to map the altered metabolism in blood cells. The DFA revealed improved flux through carbohydrate metabolism, including glucose, sucrose and galactose metabolism. This indicated the improved glucose metabolism and insulin signalling in blood cells of metformin-treated T2D patients. In addition, the blood cells also showed an improved amino acid metabolism, which may lead to the synthesis of cellular proteins and enzymes. Further, there is reduced activity in fatty acid oxidation, leukotriene metabolism, and vitamin biosynthesis pathways in treated cells. These alterations suggest reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, and overall improved cellular metabolic health. This study demonstrates how integrating transcriptomics with genome-scale metabolic modelling provides insight into metabolic shifts in blood cells under metformin treatment. These key metabolic alterations may serve as potential therapeutic targets or biomarkers for T2D progression."

To address these challenges, this paper proposes a blockchain based mobile theft detection system using Hyper ledger Fabric, a permissioned blockchain platform. The system assigns each mobile device a unique identifier (UID) upon registration and securely stores metadata, such as location and status, on the blockchain. In case of theft, the owner can report the incident, triggering smart contracts to update the device's status and notify network participants in real time. This decentralized approach ensures that stolen devices are flagged and blocked across participating networks. Additionally, the system supports secure ownership transfer, reducing fraud and enhancing trust in the mobile ecosystem."

This makes analyzing a large number of thermal images ineffective. This research presents a novel method for machine learning-based object identification by practically applying formulas to increase accuracy considering all the factors. The proposed method can dynamically adjust the emissivity values based on the characteristics on the materials and the environmental conditions.

    "abstract": "A dual-band dual-polarized meta-lens antenna is proposed for Sub-6-GHz wireless communications in this paper. The meta-lens antenna consists of a newly designed wideband meta-lens and a dual-band dual-polarized feed antenna operating at 1.7-2.2 GHz and 3.4-3.8 GHz. The meta element of the meta-lens integrates tightly coupled and real-time distance delay lines to achieve broadband transmission performance, aiming to address the narrow bandwidth limitation in traditional dual-band meta-lenses. To enhance transmission performance for oblique incidence, a copper rod and two layers of Frequency Selective Surfaces (FSS) are introduced to the meta element. The proposed meta-lens antenna demonstrates high-gain performance across the dual operation bands."

    "abstract": "The advent of deepfake content has been an enormous challenge in digital media security that necessitates an effective detection system. This study proposes a deepfake detection model based on ResNet50V2 with an associated machine unlearning (MUL) approach to enable selective forgetting of generated data. The model is trained and evaluated on the FaceForensics- 1600 dataset, which consists of real and deepfake video frames, and then undergoes a retraining phase, excluding the forgetting set. Performance before and after unlearning is quantified in terms of classification reports, confusion matrices, and ROC curves. Experimental results show that the model maintains an accuracy of 96% and ROC-AUC of 97% even after unlearning. These findings suggest that MUL can complement model adaptability in dynamic data environments. It also supports compliance with data privacy laws requiring data deletion. The results demonstrate that practical unlearning can be applied to deepfake detection systems without impacting performance, offering a promising solution for ethically adaptive and privacypreserving AI."

Private blockchain solutions are emerging due to their transparency, immutability, and customization features. A consortium-based permissioned blockchain is an optimal solution to provide the security of healthcare data. However, ensuring privacy and scalability is important and challenging as well. For scalability, different Layer-2 blockchain approaches have been discussed.

Each participant completed two empirical tasks: syntactic disambiguation test and music test. Accuracy and reaction time in the two tasks were measured and analyzed. The results showed: firstly, most children at this age cannot yet fully obtain adult-like transfer benefits from their music competence to complex linguistic tasks, and such benefits may diminish without constant music training. Secondly, despite the imperfect transfer, a strong relationship between musicianship and the resolution of homophonous sentences was exhibited among the child participants. Finally, from a developmental perspective, children's syntactic processing competence developed with age, with girls processing ambiguous sentences more efficiently than boys."

However, a critical bottleneck for vision-language models lies in understanding local regions, where global image-level perception struggles to respond to specified areas and local representations are easily confounded by background interference. To address this, this paper proposes a novel architecture that integrates negative sample learning with hierarchical semantic alignment. We first design a panoptic negative sample learning mechanism, which constructs highly correlated hard negative pairs by mining semantic relationships between different regions within the same image, thereby effectively enhancing the model's discriminative capability for local details. Concurrently, we introduce a hierarchical semantic pyramid alignment framework, which establishes independent contrastive learning objectives across four semantic levels: global image, scene components, object instances, and attributes/materials, achieving comprehensive semantic alignment from macro to micro perspectives. Experimental validation on benchmark datasets for tasks like image categorization and cross-modal retrieval confirms the superiority of our method over existing solutions, with notable improvements in accuracy and robustness."

To attain these objectives, a load-carrying initialization encoding, grounded in a splitting strategy, is introduced. To enhance computational efficiency, we incorporate the inter-zone handling processes derived from the splitting strategy into a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model, solving it with CPLEX. The algorithm framework utilizes an adaptive iterative neighborhood search algorithm (S-AILS) rooted in a splitting strategy, proposing various transformation search strategies both within and across regions. We introduce interval optimal records to store the currently found optimal solution, using this saved solution as the starting point for iterative optimization, thus eliminating redundant searches.

    "abstract": "Event detection (ED) is defined as the process of identifying events through the extraction and annotation of specific trigger words. The hallucination problem of large language models (LLMs) has been shown to lead to suboptimal performance in event detection tasks. To address the issues LLMs encounter when processing specialized domains, this paper proposes an event detection framework called ClassiED, which achieves this by synergistically integrating BERT-based text classification with LLMs reasoning capabilities. The method adopts a two-stage architecture: first, a BERT-based event discriminator filters out non-event sentences to prevent LLMs from producing false positives due to domain knowledge limitations; subsequently, an event detector optimizes prompt engineering to extract text inputs that generate results consistent with the event ontology, enabling zero-shot event type and trigger factor identification using LLMs without domain-specific fine-tuning. Comprehensive evaluations on the MNEE dataset, characterized by a large number of non-event sentences in the military domain, demonstrate that ClassiED achieves an event distinction accuracy (Acc) of 81.83%, an event identification F1 score (EI) of 93.33%, and significant improvements in trigger detection metrics."

It is challenging to assess air quality with a single machine learning model when the AQI varies. A genetic algorithm-based enhanced extreme learning machine (GA-KELM) prediction approach fixes this. Kernel approach generates hidden layer output matrix kernel matrix. Kernel limit learning machine hidden nodes and layers are improved using genetic algorithms. This overcomes the problem of the typical limit learning machine's too many hidden nodes and unpredictable thresholds and weights making training difficult. Root mean square error, weights, and thresholds comprise the fitness function. Lastly, least squares is used to figure out the model output weights. Genetic algorithms find the best answer in the search space and improve model performance by optimising it over and over again. The optimised kernel extreme learning machine predicts SO2, NO2, PM10, CO, O3, PM2.5 concentrations, and AQI compared to CMAQ, SVM, and DBN-BP using basic data from a Chinese metropolitan monitoring station's longterm air quality prediction. Results demonstrate the suggested model trains quicker and predicts better. BILSTM extension optimises feature weight both ways."

This study introduces a new integrated framework for assessing climate vulnerability in Indonesia by combining the Framework for the Development of Environment Statistics and the Driving Forces-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) model. The framework leverages diverse data from 2014 to 2023, integrating socio-economic statistics and satellite-derived environmental indicators mapped to the DPSIR structure for analysis. To analyze causal relationships among vulnerability components, Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling was applied, revealing significant pathways along the DPSIR sequence. Notably, socio-economic drivers exerted strong direct effects on environmental pressures, while environmental degradation indirectly influenced institutional responses through its link to climate-related risks such as flooding and drought. A composite Integrated Climate Vulnerability Index was developed using the Entropy Weight Method to quantify spatio-temporal vulnerability patterns across Indonesian provinces. Results show a national decline in vulnerability between 2014 and 2020, followed by a modest rebound in the years following the COVID19 pandemic. However, regional disparities persisted; eastern provinces, including Papua and East Nusa Tenggara, consistently exhibited high vulnerability. The evaluation demonstrates that integrating structured frameworks with statistical modeling supports evidence-based, region-specific climate adaptation and sustainable development planning."

Traditional shake tables that exist provide one or two-dimensional motion where it limits the capability of three-dimensional (3D) movements in experiments conducted by engineers, researchers and users. This paper presents the design and development of a cost-effective 3-axis shake table which has the ability to produce independent motions in the X, Y and Z directions. The shake table consists of three dynamic plates, each axis supported by dual linear guides and driven by separate DC motors with a 12V voltage rating. This independent configuration of the axis allows the users for a precise control and generation of vibrations across all three axes, making it suitable for a wide range of testing applications. The design utilizes motor drivers for varying power to the motors and control the movement of the dynamic plates independently, which omits the requirement of encoders and reduce the production cost. The developed shake table offers a versatile and cost-effective solution for laboratories, earthquake engineering and structural health monitoring, where 3D motion capabilities are essential."

Traditional IoT communication models are mostly based on centralized cloud infrastructure, which leads to significant energy consumption and communication latency, especially in the large-scale implementation. The proposed research project addresses these issues by proposing an Energy-Conscious EdgeAssisted IoT Communication Framework that holistically combines 5G connectivity and Artificial Intelligence (AI)driven optimization mechanisms. In the proposed framework, edge intelligence is used, in which AI models at the network edge do predictive load balancing, adaptive bandwidth allocation, energy-aware task offloading to reduce redundant transmissions and optimize power consumption. A deep reinforcement learning (DRL) module changes resource allocation policies in real time based on traffic and channel circumstances, giving it realtime adaptability. With the help of experimental analysis in different network conditions, it is seen that the proposed system would have saved around 42 percent of energy consumption, 35 percent improved data throughput, and 28 percent reduced communication latency in contrast to conventional cloud-centric IoT structures. These results indicate that AI-powered decision intelligence and edge and 5G networks can create a scalable, sustainable, and high-performance communication model that is appropriate in the future IoT environments in smart cities, health, and industrial automation."

The proposed model is able to take both the spatial and sequential data into consideration. Transfer Learning makes training faster and provides a better generalization of the model, whereas Reinforcement Learning makes the model fit the real-time data, which allows risk forecasting to keep improving constantly. PyTorch was used to develop the model, and provides a flexible and scalable model to large datasets. The experimental findings have shown that the H-DNN model is more accurate and has a smaller Mean Absolute Error (MAE) when compared with the conventional methods including the Random Forest, Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The suggested methodology is prospective in promising the optimization of risk prognostication in variable and intricate management situations."

    "abstract": "Driven by the strategic goals of “carbon peaking and carbon neutrality,” the energy structure transformation of power systems is deepening. As the primary load-smoothing force, thermal power units' frequent variable-load operation imposes higher demands on the dynamic performance and robustness of coal feed control. Addressing the challenges of parameter tuning and insufficient adaptability in traditional PID controllers when dealing with the nonlinearity, time delays, and complex disturbances inherent in thermal power units, this paper proposes a PID control strategy for variable load coal feed based on an improved gray wolf optimization algorithm. Two typical operating conditions—slow load increase and rapid load change—were designed to comprehensively evaluate the steady-state tracking and dynamic response performance of the control strategy. Simulation results demonstrate that compared to conventional threshold PID control, the proposed IGWO-PID strategy significantly reduces tracking errors and fluctuations in main steam pressure and unit power during steady-state conditions. Under rapid load-change conditions, it effectively suppresses overshoot and accelerates response. This research provides an effective solution for enhancing control quality and operational safety in thermal power units during flexible peak-shaving operations."

This research has aimed to create a system that allows measuring air quality in different environments of the city in order to provide quantitative aspects that facilitate taking actions in favor of decontamination. The proposed system is based on LSTM neural networks to model a real-time prediction of air quality that allows the metropolitan municipality of Lima to take action on environmental policies. The results have shown that LSTM outperforms other models such as DTR and SVR by better capturing temporal dependencies, so the validations of the system have been very satisfactory and based on them it has been possible to generate policies on vehicle access in places with a high degree of pollution, which benefits citizens."

This paper has proposed a Robust Quantum-Enhanced Hybrid Approach (QEHA) which integrates quantum feature embedding and classical deep neural networks to increase the learning speed, enhance the stability and improve the model robustness. The architecture uses feature Encoding The architecture uses angle encoding and quantum kernels to project input data into a high-dimensional Hilbert space, in between CNNTransformer layers. Quantum Natural Gradient Descent (QNGD) is used to achieve optimization across hybrid layers so that it is efficient in updating parameters. The experimental results prove that the proposed QEHA has an average accuracy of 97.85, which is higher than the CNN-Transformer baseline (94.12) and PQC-only model (91.54). In addition, the hybrid model demonstrates a convergence time decrease of 32% and energy efficiency increase of 26% with a robustness ratio of more than 0.93 in noisy quantum environments. These findings validate the excellence of the offered hybrid structure in the context of accuracy, speed and reliability. The article also finds that quantum-classical connections are scalable and robust AI systems that can be deployed on edge-based quantum collaborative systems, where data dimensionality and energy limits are still significant issues."

    "abstract": "Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental condition that persists into adulthood and is often challenging to diagnose due to the subjectivity of traditional assessment methods. While neuroimaging and EEG-based approaches have gained popularity in ADHD research, they are often resource-intensive and less accessible. In contrast, physiological signals such as Heart Rate Variability (HRV) offer a non-invasive and cost-effective alternative that remains underexplored, particularly in adult populations. This study investigates the potential of HRV-derived features for distinguishing adults with ADHD from healthy controls using Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Time-domain, frequency-domain, and wavelet-domain features were extracted from RR interval data. To identify the most informative features, we employed Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) using a Random Forest Classifier, selecting the top five features contributing most to classification performance. Among various models evaluated, the XGBoost classifier achieved the best performance with 91% recall 83% accuracy and f1-score. The results highlight that HRV-based metrics can provide meaningful insights into autonomic nervous system irregularities associated with ADHD in adults. The proposed approach demonstrates a viable path for scalable and accessible ADHD screening using physiological biomarkers. Future work will focus on expanding the dataset and incorporating advanced feature engineering and deep learning for improved accuracy."

The WSN contains Lot of sensor nodes which is interconnected to the communication medium holds lots of energy due to inappropriate routing. However, the dynamic nature of WSNs, sensor nodes, poses significant energy challenges, traffic, and non-supported feature limits in routing, leading to poor routing. Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANET) routing protocols have emerged as a promising solution to address these challenges, offering adaptability, self-organization, and energy efficiency. Most of exiting methodologies concerns doesn't make logical dependencies in energy efficient routing. To consider this problems and limitations, to develop an Energy Efficient Routing Protocol based Fuzzy Optimized Self-Schedule Routing (EERP-FOSSR) to improve the lifetime in SN. The Energy-Efficient Routing Protocol (EERP) is used to analyze the sensor node energy consumption in the routing to choose the best consumption rate. To obtain maximum routes, the Fuzzy Optimized Self-Schedule Routing (FOSSR) is applied to choose the optimal features in the route. Based on the routing performance, the Optimal Queuing Energy-Resistant Protocol (OQERP) manages communication routing to schedule the transmission flow to improve the routing. The proposed system improves the performance of the MANET routing by considering lifetime maximization in Qom as well as packet delivery ratio, delay tolerance, latency, time complexity."

    "abstract": "The rapid expansion of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations has created new opportunities for global navigation and positioning. Navigation based on LEO Signal of Opportunity (SOP) effectively complements the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) owing to their high received power and wide coverage. However, most LEO satellites suffer from orbital errors of several hundred to a thousand meters, while uncertain signal transmission times further degrade positioning accuracy. Existing orbit determination approaches and differential positioning methods can improve performance but remain limited: the former rely on long-term observations, limiting responsiveness to frequent orbital maneuvers, whereas the latter experience degraded performance over long baselines due to weakened spatial correlation of orbit errors. To address these challenges, this study introduces a real-time orbit correction method based on LEO satellite SOP from multiple stations. By anchoring satellite time references to a network of ground stations, the method imposes a strong constraint on transmission time and decouples onboard spatiotemporal reference errors. Joint processing of time–frequency observations from multiple stations enables real-time orbit error correction without long-term data accumulation. Experimental validation using Iridium NEXT SOPs shows that, within a 953 km² area, the proposed method achieves two-dimensional and three-dimensional positioning accuracies of 13.8 m and 27.5 m, improving by 36% and 21.4%, respectively, compared with existing differential approaches."

    "abstract": "Real-world image dehazing is a challenging task due to the collection of aligned hazy/clear image pairs under unpredictable and complex environments. To address this limitation, we propose a Physical-Guided Posterior Sampling (PGPS) method that designs a dehazing reconstruction posterior to sample an RGB and depth from pre-trained unconditional diffusion generation process. First, we introduce a Hybrid Degradation Atmospheric Scattering Model (HD-ASM) to adapt the diffusion model, enabling the generation of high-fidelity dehazed images from posterior samples without relying on the aligned hazy/clear image pairs. Second, we propose a two-stage sampling strategy with piecewise loss to improve sampling quality and stability, along with a post-processing technique to remove JPEG compression artifacts amplified by dehazing. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in image dehazing, and in the RTTS dataset’s complex human-vehicle environment. Additionally, our approach also surpasses other benchmarks in object detection, exhibiting superior generalization performance."

However, the unidirectional conduction characteristic of the diodes makes it has poor reactive power compensation capability under conventional control. In this article, the reactive power compensation capability of the Vienna rectifier is enhanced by applying a current distortion elimination method, and the corresponding feasible power factor is discussed in detail. By considering the coupling characteristics between impedance angle, modulation index, and power factor angle, the relationship between the reactive power compensation capability and the currently transmitted active current is more accurately described. Besides, a carrier-based discontinuous pulse width modulation (CB-DPWM) strategy with integrated reactive power compensation capability is proposed, the advantage of the proposed CB-DPWM is that the reference voltage has a longer clamping region with maximum absolute current, which is much helpful for reduction of switching losses. Simulation and experiments results verified the correctness of the theoretical analysis on maximum reactive power compensation capability and the superiority of the proposed CB-DPWM strategy."

    "abstract": "Radar signal frequency spectrum is a key parameter for radar systems, which decides the upper limit of the performance of a radar system. However, when a radar signal propagates through the plasma sheath, due to the dissipative and dispersive properties of plasma sheath, the radar signal frequency spectrum characteristic will be distorted. Therefore, this article has conducted research on the frequency spectrum fluctuation of linear frequency modulation (LFM) radar signals under a plasma sheath. First, this article proposes a numerical computation method for the frequency spectrum characteristics of a radar signal based on the scatter matrix method. The radar signal frequency spectrum characteristics with and without plasma sheath are computed. By comparing the radar signal frequency spectrum characteristic with and without plasma sheath, the frequency spectrum attenuation characteristic and frequency spectrum fluctuation within the bandwidth are discovered. In order to describe these two phenomena clearer, the two variables called attenuation within bandwidth (attn_band) and fluctuation within bandwidth (inband_fluc) are defined. The influence of electron density, collision frequency, carrier frequency, bandwidth, and incident angle on radar signal frequency spectrum fluctuation characteristics is analyzed. The results demonstrate that when the radar signal carrier frequency is close to the cutoff frequency of electron density, there exists a local peak point of frequency spectrum fluctuation characteristics when collision frequency is low. The radar signal frequency spectrum shows a decreasing trend when the electron density and collision frequency is high and carrier frequency is low."

    "abstract": "The development of self-healing materials is often hindered by the high costs and material waste associated with traditional characterization methods. Current approaches to toughness prediction, primarily based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are limited by their tendency to capture only surface-level features, which can lead to biased predictions. Moreover, working with small datasets, which is common in materials science, further increases the risk of biased training due to overfitting, posing a critical challenge to the reliability and generalizability of predictive models. This study introduces an unbiased residual learning framework designed explicitly for predicting self-healing interface toughness under limiteddata conditions. Our approach, ResNet-inspired approach for predicting self-healing material toughness, named Res-SH, used the power of residual networks to capture deeper, more complex patterns in the data, thereby addressing critical challenges in materials research. Res-SH minimises resource consumption and experimental overhead by focusing on unbiased learning, achieving accurate predictions with fewer training epochs and lower R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> score and root mean square prediction errors compared to conventional CNN and lightweight model MobileNetv2.

This paper presents a novel middleware system architecture that harnesses Large Language Models (LLMs) to translate natural language queries (NLQs) into executable SQL statements, enabling seamless interaction with relational databases without requiring technical expertise. To bridge a critical gap in existing research, the proposed system integrates a robust security framework featuring multi-factor authentication and fine-grained, role-based access control. A comprehensive evaluation was conducted using over 813,000 real spatio-temporal IoT samples from the H2020-AFarCloud international project, comparing both general-purpose LLMs and models fine-tuned for NLQ-to-SQL translation. Two complementary evaluation metrics—Execution Accuracy (EX) and Valid Efficiency Score (VES)—were employed to assess syntactic correctness, semantic fidelity, and runtime efficiency. Experimental results show that GPT-o3 mini-high achieves the highest overall performance in terms of average VES, while DeepSeek R1 exhibits the most consistent behavior across heterogeneous query scenarios, as reflected by lower performance variability. These findings underscore the interplay between model capability and computational efficiency, demonstrating the potential of LLM-driven middleware to democratize structured data access and enhance data-driven decision-making."

Existing few-shot DST models face challenges in effectively leveraging semantically related information and exhibit limited adaptability to dialog scenarios. To address these challenges, the dual-teacher and dual-prompt pool model for few-shot DST (DDP-DST) is proposed. Specifically, by enhancing key semantic information and syntactic structure, dual teacher models are constructed to generate pseudolabels from complementary perspectives. Self-training is employed to further improve state value generation. Besides, considering the intrinsic symmetry between slot and state value generation tasks, a dual-prompt fine-tuning strategy is designed. A dynamic prompt pool is constructed to adaptively generate prompts. Reconstruction errors (REs) are fed back into the DDP-DST model, leading to improved accuracy in DST. Experimental results on the MultiWOZ 2.1 dataset demonstrate that DDP-DST outperforms baseline models such as SM2-3b, DS2, and SVAG with average improvements of 4.3%, 2.4%, and 2.0% in the metric of joint goal accuracy (JGA). Notably, with fewer than 1 billion parameters, DDP-DST achieves competitive performance in few-shot settings, even outperforming models with up to 10 billion parameters."

The perturbation functions that can be discontinuous, and the neutral logics expressed by the difference operators, are addressed by new approaches. Several novel Lyapunov inequalities with indefinite functions are proposed, where detailed estimations of the settling-time (ST) are obtained by discussing the different values of the exponents of the Lyapunov functions, which can include the existing results. Considering that the states generally cannot converge to the origin accurately under finite-time control in real applications, practical FxT stability lemmas with indefinite functions are established for the first time, in which the bounded condition imposed on the indefinite function is more practical than the previously unbounded ones. By designing the adaptive control strategies, the FxT and practical FxT synchronization control are investigated based on the Lyapunov–Krasovskii functionals (LKFs), which show the delay characteristic via the adaptive update law containing delay values. Notably, the theoretical deficiency arising from the Lyapunov function when studying the FxT stability of real systems with delays by using the FxT stability lemmas with indefinite function is solved in a successful way. Finally, the validity of the main results is verified by numerical simulations on an electrical device containing an <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">LC</i> transmission line."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a robust bidirectional platoon control method based on coupled relative posture errors to achieve mesh stability of connected vehicles under kinematic and dynamic disturbances. Platoon control for connected and automated vehicles must guarantee safe intervehicle distances and desired heading angles on a two-dimensional (2D) plane, even in the presence of modeling uncertainties and external disturbances. However, most existing studies focus on string stability in either the longitudinal or lateral direction; consequently, bidirectional error propagation on a plane, combined kinematic and dynamic disturbances, and path departure during curved maneuvers are not sufficiently addressed. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a robust platoon control framework that guarantees mesh stability and asymptotic convergence of relative posture errors to zero using only relative posture information. Coupled relative posture error dynamics are derived to analyze error propagation on a 2D plane, and a novel robust bidirectional platoon controller employing an adaptive integral sliding mode disturbance observer (AISMDOB) is proposed to ensure asymptotic convergence of both relative spacing and heading angle errors to zero while compensating for kinematic and dynamic disturbances. In addition, an extended look-ahead strategy based on relative posture errors is introduced to prevent path departure during curved maneuvers while relying solely on local onboard sensors instead of global positioning information. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method reduces average relative spacing errors by approximately 29% in simulation and 25% in experiments, and heading angle errors by approximately 9% and 29%, respectively, compared with existing methods."

Based on quantitative data collected from 249 undergraduate students at FPT University, Can Tho Campus, the study applies multiple regression and moderation testing using PROCESS Model 1 to analyze both direct and interaction impacts of AI Learning Tools (AILT), AI Ethics Awareness (AIEA), Learning Engagement (LE), Educational Environment (EE), and Sustainability Literacy (SL). Results indicate that AILT, LE, and EE significantly enhance SSR, emphasizing the role of active learner involvement, supportive educational settings, and AI-enabled tools in fostering responsible and sustainability-oriented behavior. Conversely, AIEA and SL do not present a significant direct influence on SSR, suggesting that ethical awareness and sustainability knowledge alone may be insufficient to trigger behavioral change without contextual or practical reinforcement. The moderation findings show that SL weakens the effects of both AIEA and LE on SSR. This outcome suggests that students with higher sustainability literacy tend to demonstrate responsibility through internal motivation rather than depending on external encouragement or ethical prompts. Theoretically, this study contributes by integrating AI-enabled learning, ethics, and sustainability literacy into a comprehensive analytical model. From a practical perspective, it recommends that universities develop AI-augmented educational environments that prioritize learner engagement, contextual guidance, and early integration of sustainability training. Such an approach can nurture intrinsic responsibility and equip learners to manage ethical challenges in AI-driven educational contexts, while also supporting broader sustainability objectives."

    "abstract": "For high Doppler scenarios, intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) systems exhibit enhanced performances in terms of bit-error rate (BER), achievable rate (AR), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), etc. These performances can be achieved by optimally designing the IRS coefficients through solving proper optimization problems. Note that in the existing literature, for IRS-OTFS systems, the optimal reflection coefficients were designed by minimizing the BER, which may not achieve a highly spectral-efficient system. Therefore, in this work, we design reflection coefficients by developing an AR optimization framework. We propose a root-mean squared propagation (RMS-prop) approach to solve this optimization problem. On the other hand, OTFS system comprises a high dimension delay-Doppler matrix, which can increase the computational complexity of linear equalization techniques. Thus, in this work, we also design low-complexity linear-minimum-mean-squared-error (LMMSE) equalizers, for OTFS system (with and without IRS), which relies on the principle of Cholesky-based decomposition. Our simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed AR optimization framework and low-complexity equalizers in terms of AR, BER and computational complexity, compared to the existing state-of-the-art techniques."

The system is not only learning from the environment, but also responds to potential threats by learning the best deception policies that trick the attackers and give infiltration a longer time barrier. The framework that has been suggested is not static, instead, it is designed in such a way that it can incorporate intelligent deception parts that change according to the behavior of the attacker, and therefore it can be a proactive type of defense rather than a reactive one. The reinforcement learning agent is still there and it has the opportunity to observe and learn the behavior of the threats, so it can better allocate the decoys, fake assets, and the misleading paths that it needs. This adaptive mechanism facilitates the system in ensuring a minimum level of exposure of the critical resources and at the same time, it creates a dynamic, unpredictable environment that significantly increases attackers' complexity. This work's contribution lies in the fusion of cyber deception and the learning model, which is self-improving, thus it opens up a strong and scalable option for the cloud security domain. The suggested method is not only capable of improving the security of cloud environments but also can be very efficient in handling and reducing the impact of complicated threat vectors instantaneously."

In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive filtering algorithm called LHCAF with variable center (LHCAF-VC), which is robust against impulsive noise with non-zero mean, as it considers central order moments of the error distribution rather than origin-based moments. To further enhance convergence performance and adaptability in dynamic environments, a variable step-size (VSS) mechanism is also integrated into LHCAFVC, resulting in a new VSS-LHCAF-VC algorithm. Simulation results for the channel estimation task under Gaussian-mixture noise conditions demonstrate that the proposed LHCAF-VC and VSSLHCAF- VC algorithms achieve superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods."

    "abstract": "Early insulation faults in distribution lines may result in instantaneous abnormalities in voltage and current waveforms or harmonic distortion of discharge pulses. These issues not only affect the operational stability of the power network but may also cause malfunctions in power equipment. Therefore, a DTU terminal sensing method for early insulation faults in distribution lines based on transient waveform recording and FDTW decomposition is proposed. The insulation fault signal is processed using transient waveform recording and FDTW decomposition to improve the DTU terminal triggering mechanism. On this basis, the energy spectrum characteristics of the decomposed signal are matched with the sensing mode of the DTU terminal triggering mechanism, thus completing the design of the DTU terminal sensing method for early insulation faults in distribution lines under transient waveform recording FDTW decomposition. Experimental results show that this method can effectively analyze the instantaneous abnormal performance of voltage and current waveforms and accurately monitor the distorted waveform of discharge pulse harmonics, demonstrating outstanding value in ensuring the operational stability of distribution lines."

    "abstract": "In recent years, with the wide application of new energy vehicles, the operation data of charging piles, as a key facility for energy replenishment of electric vehicles, has increased sharply. However, the expansion of data scale has also increased the complexity of charging demand, posing new challenges to power grid dispatching and load balancing. To enhance the accuracy of charging load prediction, this paper addresses the deficiency that traditional methods are difficult to effectively depict temporal correlations and constructs a time series prediction model based on Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM). This paper selects key indicators such as time, electricity consumption, electricity charges and service fees from the charging dataset, takes the total daily charging volume as the prediction target, and uses the LSTM model to capture the temporal dependence characteristics of charging behavior to model and predict future charging loads. The experimental results show that this model can fit the real load curve well, has a low root mean square error (RMSE), and its prediction performance is superior to traditional methods. The research results can provide reference basis for the capacity planning, power dispatching and operation optimization of the charging network."

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the issue of achieving optimal consensus control for multi-agent systems (MASs) with uncertain dynamics and proposes a reinforcement learning approach that incorporates an event-triggering mechanism. First, the MASs are modeled as directed graphs, with local and global inconsistency errors defined. Second, a distributed control strategy based on Nash equilibrium is designed to minimize the local performance index function(PIF). To reduce computational overhead and energy consumption, an event-triggering mechanism based on the energy function is introduced. By dynamically adjusting the triggering conditions, the controller is updated only when necessary, significantly reducing the update frequency. Third, the reinforcement learning(RL) algorithm within the Actor-Critic framework is employed, where the actor neural networks(NN) approximates the optimal control policy, and the critic neural networks(NN) estimates the performance index, enabling iterative optimization of the control strategy. Finally, In the theoretical analysis, the Lyapunov method is utilized to prove the convergence of system errors and network parameters, ensuring system consensus and stability. Numerical simulations demonstrate that, compared to the traditional periodic triggering method, the proposed method reduces computational costs while achieving rapid convergence and efficient operation."

First, a two-dimensional analysis using Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients identifies five key features significantly correlated with electricity prices—including renewable energy output and total power generation—to reduce dimensionality and eliminate redundancy. Next, K-means clustering combined with Dynamic Time Warping selects similar days to construct a high-quality training dataset. Subsequently, VMD decomposed the electricity price sequence into 11 stationary eigenmode functions to reduce complexity. Finally, CNN extracted spatial features while LSTM uncovered long-term temporal dependencies, completing prediction and result reconstruction. Experimental results on a northwest China electricity price dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significantly lower prediction errors and more stable performance compared to baseline models, validating its effectiveness."

An experimental platform is established for this purpose. Key parameters, including the partial discharge inception voltage and flashover voltage, are measured and compared between conditions with and without bubbles. The entire surface discharge development process is recorded using a high-speed camera. The formation and role of white streaks are identified and analyzed. The results indicate that thermally induced bubbles significantly reduce both the discharge inception voltage and the flashover voltage. These bubbles also promote the initiation and growth of white streaks. The surface discharge development process is divided into four distinct stages. The presence of bubbles is found to guide the discharge channel and accelerate the overall process, while simultaneously making the associated electrical signals more difficult to detect. This study provides a theoretical basis for assessing the threat of bubble defects to transformer insulation."

Therefore, this paper proposes a technology to ensure the safety of elderly powered wheelchair users by detecting hazardous obstacles on pathways and providing their precise location information. The proposed method utilizes an RGB-D camera and machine learning for object detection. It then performs a 3D transformation on the detected object’s location within the image, based on the RGBD depth value. This transformation provides the obstacle’s direction and distance relative to the camera’s position, thereby assisting the user’s cognitive perception of the obstacle. Quantitative verification of the proposed technology demonstrates an average position estimation error of 2%."

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of Internet technology and the explosive growth of the e-commerce industry, e-commerce platforms generate massive volumes of order data every day. How to efficiently extract valuable information from such data, especially the real-time identification of high-value users, has become an important means of enhancing enterprise competitiveness. Traditional offline processing methods can no longer meet the dual requirements of real-time performance and accuracy demanded by modern e-commerce applications. To address this challenge, this paper designs and implements a real-time e-commerce order processing and high-value user identification system based on the stream processing engine Apache Flink.The system adopts a loosely coupled and scalable distributed architecture, integrating multiple core big data components such as Flume, Kafka, Flink, Redis, and HDFS to establish a complete processing pipeline from data collection, message transmission, and real-time computation to result storage. In the data collection phase, Flume monitors system logs generated by business servers and transmits data concurrently to Kafka and HDFS via channels, achieving both real-time data transmission and offline backup. In the real-time processing phase, Flink continuously consumes order stream data from Kafka, applies event-time semantics for windowing, and utilizes KeyedProcessFunction together with state management mechanisms to dynamically aggregate user consumption data and identify the top two high-value users in real time. For result storage, the system writes the processed data into Redis, enabling real-time visualization on the front-end interface and supporting subsequent data-driven decision-making.Furthermore, this paper conducts an in-depth study on key technical challenges in Flink’s state fault-tolerance mechanism, window processing strategies, and optimization of integrations with external systems (such as Redis and Kafka). It also proposes corresponding optimization strategies for practical issues such as data skew and state inflation that may occur in real-world scenarios.Through deployment testing and performance evaluation, the system demonstrates high throughput and low latency, while reliably identifying and updating the list of high-value users in real time. The research results provide an effective technical solution for building real-time operational analytics systems in e-commerce platforms and offer valuable insights for other industries requiring real-time data processing, such as financial risk control and intelligent manufacturing."

Despite the European Commission's ambitions to promote secure and trusted digital interactions, existing digital identity frameworks lack sufficient provisions for managing these legal complexities in a decentralized environment. Using descriptive legal research and qualitative content analysis, the study examines EU regulatory texts, EBSI white papers, and international standards such as those from W3C. It also compares self-sovereign identity (SSI) models with traditional digital identity systems to identify critical legal and operational distinctions. Findings reveal that, while EBSI and the emerging Europeum-EDIC initiative signal substantial progress toward a digitally unified Europe, issues of legal harmonization, data governance, and technical interoperability persist. Theoretically, these challenges underscore the tension between decentralization and centralized legal frameworks. Practically, they highlight the need for clear regulatory guidance and technical standards to enable cross-border trust and functionality. This paper makes a unique contribution by offering legal recommendations tailored to blockchain-based digital identity systems within the EUDI context."

    "abstract": "Facial recognition technology (FRT) is important for quick identity checks at airport e-gates. However, it relies on fixed biometric templates, which can expose travellers to privacy violations and replay attacks. Once a template is hacked, it cannot be cancelled, leading to potential long-term abuse. This work mitigates these risks by combining live electrocardiogram (ECG) signals with FRT to create dynamic, session-specific keys that encrypt facial templates at the time of capture. During face acquisition, a short ECG segment is captured using a wearable or handheld sensor, preprocessed and converted through \"R-R(peak-to-peak)\" interval quantization and Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit (SHA-256) hashing into a high-entropy key. This key encrypts the facial feature vector with Advanced Encryption Standard – Galois/Counter Mode (AES-GCM) before secure transmission, ensuring confidentiality, freshness and unlinkability. A formal threat model addresses man-in-the-middle interception, replay and insider compromise, demonstrating that ECG-derived keys render intercepted templates useless beyond their session. This method requires no changes to FRT algorithms, adapts to continuous passenger flow and ensures that post-verification data is invalidated. It balances operational efficiency with strong biometric privacy."

    "abstract": "Document parsing is an important research direction in the field of computer science and artificial intelligence. Its core goal is to transform unstructured or semi-structured documents (such as contracts, academic papers, invoices, etc.) into machine-readable structured data through algorithms. The current mainstream method consists of three AI driver modules: preprocessing, detection and recognition. In the preprocessing stage, the document image quality is optimized through tilt correction, denoising, contrast enhancement and binarization, providing standardized input for subsequent AI models. In the detection phase, relying on computer vision technology (such as convolutional neural network and transformer Architecture), the layout analysis and spatial positioning of semantic elements such as text areas, tables and formulas are realized, while preserving the context of the document structure. In the recognition phase, natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning model are combined to complete content extraction, logical relationship modeling and semantic understanding. In recent years, with the continuous breakthroughs in machine learning algorithms and computing frameworks, the robustness of document parsing technology in complex layout processing has been significantly improved, and has played a key role in intelligent document management, automated knowledge extraction and AI driven enterprise solutions. This review systematically summarizes the development of the current technology path, and discusses its frontier applications and challenges in the field of computer and artificial intelligence."

To address these, we propose a novel transformer-based architecture named LSST (Local-Global Spectral-Spatial Transformer), which effectively captures both local spatial relationships and global spectral dependencies. The LSST framework introduces a multi-scale spectral-spatial encoding mechanism using self-attention modules and hierarchical feature aggregation to enhance contextual understanding. By integrating local and global feature learning, LSST improves class discrimination, particularly in spectrally similar and spatially heterogeneous regions. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark HSI datasets, including Pavia University and Botswana, demonstrate the superior performance of LSST over several state-of-the-art models such as HyperES<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>T, MSST, and SSFCT. The proposed method achieves significant improvements in Overall Accuracy (OA), Average Accuracy (AA), and Kappa coefficient across all test cases. Confusion matrix analysis and visual results further validate the robustness and generalization capability of LSST.

    "abstract": "Wind speed forecasting is important in broad areas such as renewable energy management, disaster prediction, aviation safety and agricultural planning. Nevertheless, the prediction of the wind speed is a complicated problem which is highly non-linear, stochastic and chaotic and depends on a variety of environmental factors. The study introduces an enhanced deep learning-based wind speed analytics model based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and multi-head attention models, coupled with residual connections and a specially designed peak-sensitive loss. The model was trained and validated using real-time and historical data collected with meteorological sensors and IoT-based deployments in the different geographical and climatic settings. The model showed significant progressions compared to the conventional approaches like ARIMA and bare LSTM, with a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$1.38 ~\\mathrm{m} / \\mathrm{s}$</tex> and a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$1.05 ~\\mathrm{m} / \\mathrm{s}$</tex>, having a R2 value of 0.95 and a maximum wind detection accuracy of 94.3%. This performance is owed to the architectural improvements that focus on the short-term changes and peak winds. Also, the hyperparameter tuning was done with Bayesian Optimization, so that optimal configuration is achieved automatically. The suggested architecture is lightweight and can be deployed on edge computing platforms, which would be appropriate to real-time forecasting.

    "abstract": "The high rate of Internet of Things (IoT) gadgets development in 5G networks has prompted an immediate demand of ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) and energy efficiency at the same time. The traditional optimization methods tend to be unable to balance latency, reliability, and power consumption as they are both static and heuristic. In response to these constraints, this study will present an Energy Optimization Framework of URLLC-based IoT communications in 5G networks that will be based on Machine Learning. The model proposed combines the Reinforcement Learning (RL) to adaptively control power, Deep Neural Networks (DNN) to predict the traffic and channel conditions, and Federated Learning (FL) to update the model distributed across the IoT nodes in a privacy-preserving manner. Using the adaptability of learning, the system will dynamically allocate network resources and network transmission power to reduce the energy expenditure without negatively affecting the latency or reliability. It will be trained and validated with the datasets like the IoT network dataset, the ITU-R M.2412 and the 5G NR simulation data created by Network Simulator 3 (NS-3). Performance assessment will be conducted in parameters like energy consumption, end-to-end latency, packet delivery ratio (PDR), throughput, reliability and spectral efficiency. The projected results will be 25-35 percent of energy consumption and 15- 20 percent of latency performance improvement relative to the current 5G energy management schemes. In general, the suggested intelligent optimization model will improve scalability, adaptability, and sustainability in the large-scale IoT environments, which will go a long way in the creation of energy-aware and intelligent communication systems of 6G."

    "abstract": "In real-world automation systems, factors such as dynamic environmental changes, equipment degradation, and operational mode shifts can induce continuous changes in data distribution—a phenomenon known as concept drift—which leads to progressive deterioration in the performance of deployed models and jeopardizes control accuracy and operational reliability. To enable timely detection and early warning of model performance degradation, this paper proposes a semi-supervised concept drift detection framework based on boundary sample selection. The approach employs contrastive learning to construct a highly discriminative embedding space and utilizes gradient-based response analysis to accurately identify critical samples near the decision boundaries for selective annotation. This allows for early detection of model failure risks under limited labeling resources. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively identifies various types of concept drift without relying on fully labeled data. While maintaining competitive detection accuracy compared to fully supervised approaches, it significantly reduces labeling overhead, offering a practical and efficient solution for sustaining the reliable operation and adaptive maintenance of machine learning models in automation systems."

    "abstract": "Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a complex condition that often continues into adulthood. It can negatively affect academic, social, and emotional functioning. Traditional methods for diagnosis, such as clinical interviews and behavioral assessments, rely heavily on subjective judgment. This can lead to significant variability and potential misdiagnosis. To close this gap, this work suggests a hybrid diagnostic framework. It combines psychometric data from the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). This way, it integrates both ADHD-related and anxiety-related behavioral markers. The methodology follows a two-stage approach. In the first stage, a lightweight one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) automatically extracts features. This captures hidden behavioral patterns from questionnaire data. In the second stage, the extracted features are classified using common machine learning algorithms, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), and Random Forest (RF). The dataset consists of structured responses from standardized self-report questionnaires. It was preprocessed, normalized, and validated using stratified k-fold cross-validation to ensure reliability. The experimental results show that the hybrid approach achieves high accuracy and consistent performance across several classifiers. CNN-based feature extraction significantly improves predictive power. Visual analyses reveal dataset imbalances, such as the low number of ADHD cases compared to non-ADHD cases, and provide insights into patterns of gender distribution. The study concludes that combining anxiety features with ADHD self-report scales creates a cost-effective, scalable, and interpretable method for early ADHD screening. This work not only enhances diagnostic reliability but also highlights the potential of merging deep learning with traditional machine learning in mental health applications."

In this study, we developed a machine-learning-based system for estimating home prices using the Ames Housing Dataset. The system is capable of providing predictions from regression models (predicting exact price) and classification models (grouped into price ranges) comprising multiple models from both regression and classification categories, including single regression techniques: linear regression, lasso, and ridge regression, and advanced techniques such as support vector machines (SVM) and random forest. A key contribution of this study is the development of a unified system that leverages Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for efficient dimensionality reduction and simultaneously addresses both the exact price prediction (regression) and price categorization (classification) tasks to provide comprehensive real estate insights. Overall, the random forest provided the best estimates for price across all of the models tested, and SVM was classified into the best price groups. Multiple graphs were employed, including heatmaps, scree plots, and price prediction graphs, to visualize the model's performance and identify key features. There are substantial potential applications for this system because it can provide a buyer, seller, or investor with explicit price estimates. Exploring potential future work and improvements with that system included options such as adding time trends, adding location-based variables, deep learning models (and future versions), and a real-time app that can increase the value of price prediction and be used in multiple cities or markets"

    "abstract": "The Satellite Range Scheduling Problem (SRSP) involves task types such as Telemetry, Tracking, and Command (TTC) and Data Transmission (DT), which are essential for ensuring satellite operation and mission completion. With the rapid expansion of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) constellations, the demand for TTC and DT, driven by massive mission requirement data, has increased significantly. However, existing methods lack scalability in handling large-scale and complex data and fail to address the integrated scheduling of TTC and DT tasks, rendering them inadequate for meeting the scheduling requirements of an integrated TTC and DT ground station network. To address this issue, this study develops a mixed-integer programming model that captures the scheduling relationship between TTC and DT tasks under shared resources and proposes a big-data-oriented intelligent scheduling method—Advantage Actor-Critic with Large Neighborhood Search (A2C-LNS). The method employs multi-policy networks to learn and optimize the destruction ratio, task selection, and repair strategies, driven by large-scale task and resource data. Experiments conducted on multiple large-scale simulation and data-driven scenarios demonstrate that A2C-LNS achieves superior performance in terms of mission profit and operational efficiency."

In future IoT networks, intelligent service function chaining (SFC) orchestration framework is significant to handle massive real-time services. Our framework introduces proactive classifiers and request handlers with enabling high-dimensional state learning for optimal action configuration in software-implemented service functions. These mechanisms enable service function forwarders to efficiently distribute IoT network services while ensuring optimal utilization.

    "abstract": "Permanent magnet synchronous linear motor (PMSLM) is widely used in modern logistics and manufacturing owing to their long-travel capability and the potential of multi-mover operation on a shared track to reduce cost and improve efficiency. However, in the absence of effective cooperative control, safe inter-mover spacing cannot be guaranteed, making collisions likely. To address this challenge, this article proposes a cooperative control algorithm for multi-motor movers based on model predictive control (MPC), aiming to achieve precise spacing maintenance during high-speed motion. We begin by modeling an individual mover in the PMSLMs system and detailing its speed control strategy. Building upon the above, we construct a longitudinal motion model for multi-motor movers adopting a predecessor–following (PF) topology. Finally, we propose an improved variable time headway (IVTH) strategy and use it to design the MPC-based cooperative control algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves high-precision tracking control of spacing and velocity. Notably, even under sudden conditions such as emergency braking, the system can respond rapidly and maintain safe spacing. This research provides a feasible solution for achieving low-cost, high-efficiency cooperative control of multi-motor movers in long-travel transportation systems."

Accurate forecasting of EV charging demand is crucial for optimizing charging infrastructure and ensuring grid reliability. This study evaluates two time series forecasting models: the Long ShortTerm Memory (LSTM) network and the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. The LSTM model, based on deep learning, captures complex, time-dependent, and nonlinear patterns in EV charging data, whereas ARIMA, a statistical approach, models linear trends and seasonality. Both models were trained on 90% of the dataset and tested on the remaining 10%, with performance evaluated over 30-, 60-, and 9 0 - d a y forecasting horizons using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The results show that the LSTM model achieved significantly higher forecasting accuracy than ARIMA. These findings demonstrate the potential of deep learning approaches to capture complex, nonlinear patterns in EV charging behavior, providing a more reliable framework for demand forecasting in smart grid applications."

A key technology evolution path in the field of photovoltaic inverter is obtained: research on DC-AC conversion method of inverter → research on improvement of inverter efficiency and power quality → research on intelligent and scene application of inverter → research on low voltage ride through control of photovoltaic inverter. The empirical results show that the proposed framework effectively identifies critical technology evolution pathways within specialized domains."

    "abstract": "Event Argument Extraction (EAE) is a fundamental information extraction task, focuses on pinpointing event participants and categorizing their specific roles. While prompt-based methods leveraging Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have set high performance standards, their reliance on static, predefined prompts limits their effectiveness in complex scenarios involving long-distance dependencies or semantic ambiguity. To address this, we propose LLM-Enhanced Focus for Prompts (LEFP), a novel framework that enhances prompts with dynamic, contextual focus. LEFP employs the Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze the input document and distill the most salient textual evidence for each argument role, which we term a \"focus snippet\". This snippet is then encoded and fused with the original role representation at the feature level, creating a context-aware prompt. Extensive evaluation on three challenging datasets indicates that LEFP consistently improves performance. Further ablation studies validate our design, confirming that feature-level fusion is significantly more effective than simple textual concatenation. Our work demonstrates that leveraging LLMs to generate auxiliary focus information is a promising direction for enhancing smaller, specialized models, effectively combining the reasoning power of LLMs with the efficiency of fine-tuned PLMs."

To mitigate this representational bias, we present a novel Scale-Equalization Decoder (SED). Unlike traditional approaches, SED dynamically modulates local feature responses within shallow layers to equilibrate the semantic weight of objects regardless of their size. By effectively amalgamating these rectified features with deep semantic information, our method significantly improves segmentation fidelity without incurring substantial computational costs.

As performance and efficiency become increasingly critical, conventional MAC architectures face limitations due to sequential accumulation delays, increased area, and underutilized hardware. This work addresses these challenges by proposing a high-speed and area-efficient MAC unit that eliminates loop delays through a compressor-based architecture. The design integrates accumulation directly within the multipliers summation network using 4:2 and 5:2 compressors, supported by Half and Full Adders and a Carry Save Adder (CSA), thus avoiding idle cycles and improving throughput. An 88-bit MAC unit was modeled in Verilog HDL, functionally verified through simulation, and synthesized on the Nexys 4 DDR (Artix-7) FPGA using the Vivado Design Suite. The architecture achieves a reduction in area utilization and an improvement in critical path delay compared to existing designs, with a moderate increase in power due to the parallel compression logic. This trade-off makes it highly suitable for real-time, performance-critical applications.

By annotating a massive amount of data, reinforcement learning algorithms are utilized to inject data features into the model. When the model's parameter scale reaches a certain level, the phenomenon of intelligent emergence occurs. This has been widely applied to a variety of tasks such as text-to-image generation, virtual scene recognition, robotic arm control, and manufacturing. However, reinforcement learning has the challenge of poor generalization ability in agent inference when the environment changes. During the agent's training process, the action rewards are generated based on an environment model. In practical applications, when the environmental factors continuously change, the reward function may also vary. It’s leading to the issues with the agent's action strategy. This paper proposes a reinforcement learning method that integrates large models into the agent's situational awareness loop. The processed information is used as the state for the agent's actions, guiding the agent to generate behaviors in its operational work. Finally, the miniworld experiments are used to verify the correctness of the proposed reinforcement learning agent training method. This work also provides a new approach for agent decision-making methods in practical applications when the agent faced with environmental changes."

While CAI and kurtosis showed no significant differences between PAIR & CG, CD (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$P_{G M}=0.04$</tex>), SE (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$P_{M H}=0.04$</tex>) and Skewness (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$P_{G L}=0.03$</tex>) demonstrated significant difference based on the Mann-Whitney U test at a 95% confidence level. Therefore, the proposed study enhances the understanding of the dynamics of selected EMG features and emphasizes their importance in the objective, quantitative assessment of rehabilitation progress after post-ACL injury reconstruction."

This study aims to measure and analyse suitable parameters that represent rainfall intensity and latency to evaluate their relationship. Rainfall data was collected using a tipping bucket rain sensor and subsequently processed to determine rainfall rate. Latency data was collected by connecting the received signal of SES 12 from the antenna to a computer via a router and a ‘ping’ operation was performed to obtain the needed latency values. Both sets of data were collected from July to December 2024. Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) were plotted for rainfall rate and latency. The CDF analysis implied that Ku-band affected by rainfall rates higher than 50 mm/h. This study shows rainfall rate significantly affect the latency and network reliability of the Ku-Band satellite link."

The design is informed by a prior evaluation of a Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT), which identified gaps in automation, knowledge management, and learning from everyday IR processes.

    "abstract": "The purpose of Federated class incremental learning (FCIL) is to enable the federal learning (FL) system to continuously learn new tasks through dynamically evolving classes, while retaining the knowledge of previous classes. However, existing FCIL methods often require access to past task data to consolidate old knowledge and fail to address challenges arising from inter-client data heterogeneity, limiting their generalization capability in real-world applications. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes CDFFCIL: a Comprehensive framework for Data-Free Federated Class-Incremental Learning. We introduce a novel dual correction-based knowledge distillation strategy that enables clients to preserve their initial strong capability for learning new classes throughout continual learning. Furthermore, we develop a federated NCM classifier based on anisotropic Mahalanobis distance, which significantly enhances the global model's predictive performance under non-stationary data distributions. Experimental results demonstrate that CDFFCIL effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting and heterogeneity impacts while outperforming state-of-the-art FCIL methods."

The proposed self-supervised learning framework of structural integrity assessment reduces the reliance on labelled data and still provides adaptability with changing operating conditions. The methodology incorporates a wavelet-based noise removal (DWT with soft-thresholding) on the vibration signals and acoustic signals before selecting the information-rich and non-redundant features mRMR-based feature selection. The features chosen are identified under LightGBM with high accuracy, precision, and recall on the damages and degradation identification. Accelerated training up to multi-GPU, mixed-precision optimization, and on-board deploy ability to resource-constrained UAV systems are some of the advantages of implementation using PyTorch Lightning. Testing the method, experimental data showed the number of key thicknesses to be detected improved dramatically compared to conventional supervised strategies. The suggested method offers a scalable, interpretable, and real-time UAV structural health monitoring system on long-range tasks."

While /l/ exhibits enhanced high-frequency energy, /n/ displays a more skewed spectral shape with energy concentrated in the lower frequency region. The frequency-related features of /n/ and /l/ play a relatively minor role in distinction. Generally /n/ and /l/ share similar formant patterns, but the formant values of /l/ show more variation in different vowel contexts, presumably due to more coarticulation with the following vowel. There is no apparent tonal context effect on the acoustic properties of the two coronal consonants"

    "abstract": "Sericulture industry supports rural livelihoods and contributes significantly to the Indian economy. This industry faces severe challenges from silkworm diseases, among which Grasserie, caused by the Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV), is one of the most devastating. Current diagnostic methods, such as microscopy, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), though reliable, are time-consuming, costly, and require laboratory facilities, making them impractical for field-level disease management. Electronic nose (e-nose) technology has emerged as a promising non-invasive tool for rapid disease detection. In this study, we designed a low-cost e-nose system using four metal oxide gas sensors integrated with an Arduino Uno. A total of 101 samples, comprising 54 healthy and 47 Grasserie-infected silkworms, were collected and analyzed. Data were preprocessed using baseline manipulation, followed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature extraction. Classification was carried out using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) with three-fold cross-validation. Results showed that the developed e-nose can effectively discriminate healthy silkworms from the infected silkworms, with SVM achieving the highest accuracy of 91.42%. The study demonstrates that e-nose technology is a rapid, cost-effective, and practical tool for early detection of Grasserie disease, offering significant benefits for sustainable sericulture."

To improve detection accuracy while meeting communication quality of service, this paper proposes a two-phase cooperative target detection algorithm that relies on Capon-based adaptive beamforming and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)-based hypothesis testing. Specifically, based on Capon’s detection results, the two BSs first scan targets with an omnidirectional beam and then track targets with a directional beam. Subsequently, multiple hypotheses regarding the locations of targets are established based on the detection results of the Capon method, and the MLE is employed for hypothesis testing to filter out ghost targets. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves more precise angles-of-arrival estimation of multiple targets than conventional single-BS sensing, and enables high-precision localization by eliminating ghost targets."

Optimally enforcing state constraints [in this case, the battery state of charge (SoC)] allows the battery to be used more efficiently, enabling a reduction in its capacity without increasing energy consumption. The proposed algorithm, therefore, provides greater flexibility in the design and sizing of the vehicle’s energy architecture."

    "abstract": "Detailed electromagnetic transient models of off shore wind farms incorporate the individual wind turbine dynamics and controls of many wind turbines (WTs), resulting in substantial computational burdens. This limits their practicality for large-scale system studies. While aggregation techniques re duce this burden, they often compromise accuracy, particularly in capturing dynamic behaviour during power system disturbances. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes a gaussian mixture model clustering with information-theoretic averaging to group similar WTs and derive representative aggregated models. A structured eigenvalue sensitivity analysis is conducted to identify the control parameters that have the greatest impact on system dynamics, reducing the dimensionality of the parameter space. Additionally, an improved multi-objective gradient descent optimisation strategy is developed to identify and provide optimal values of system and control parameters under varying wind conditions and fault scenarios to ensure accuracy. The proposed modelling applicability is further demonstrated through assessment on an HVDC connected offshore wind farm under large disturbance and weak grid conditions in the time and frequency domains. Finally, the aggregated model's performance is validated against the detailed benchmark to ensure UK's grid compliance on modelling, confirming its ability to replicate key dynamic and steady-state characteristics with substantially reduced computational effort."

    "abstract": "To address the energy efficiency (EE) optimization challenge in post-disaster space-air enhanced integrated access and backhaul networks (SAE-IABN), a multi-agent global trust region local policy optimization (MA-GTRLPO) based resource allocation (RA) strategy is proposed. This strategy adopts a hybrid hierarchical architecture, decoupling global RA into centralized authorization and decentralized allocation to manage the multi-layer structured SAE-IABN's resources efficiently. MA GTRLPOenhances local contributions through a sequential local policy update rule, which helps stabilize convergence and avoids joint policy degradation risk. The general global performance difference bound theorem provides theoretical convergence guarantees for MA-GTRLPO. This theorem also offers a coordination mechanism for the Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization coefficient and learning rate, improving global rewards by 6.9% compared to a heuristic hyperparameter baseline. Next, the global reward with the dynamic feedback framework and triple normalization is proposed to optimize EE further. The feedback framework with quality of service (QoS) constraints is introduced to prevent over-allocation. Then, the triple normalization helps agents clarify the contribution of EE, QoS guarantee, and energy constraint to the global reward. Simulations demonstrate that MA-GTRLPO outperforms the baselines in all metrics. It shows good scalability, robustness, and timeliness under varying network densities and topologies, guaranteeing QoS for user equipment (UE) and ensuring the endurance of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) remains above the minimum endurance bound."

    "abstract": "The apparel industry has witnessed a significant shift toward 3D virtual design, driven by advances in simulation and digitization technologies. Central to this transformation are digital twins, which allow designers to test and refine garment designs virtually, reducing reliance on physical prototyping. A critical aspect of this process is accurately capturing the drape behavior of fabrics, as it impacts both the aesthetic and functional properties of garments. Traditional fabric digitization methods involve mechanical testing of fabric samples, but they are labor-intensive, costly, and require specialized equipment. Recently, AI-based digitization techniques have emerged, offering potential advantages in terms of cost and logistics, though their accuracy remains uncertain. This study addresses the gap in knowledge regarding the accuracy of AI-based fabric digitization by utilizing the Cusick drape test—a standardized method for assessing fabric drape behavior. We introduce a reference digitization pipeline based on traditional mechanical testing and perform a comprehensive comparative study of six commercially available digitization methods, including both traditional and AI-based approaches. Using a diverse set of fabrics, we evaluate the accuracy of the digitized fabrics against real-world measurements. Our results demonstrate that AI-based methods can achieve competitive accuracy, while also highlighting areas for further improvement. We present a publicly available dataset containing real fabric properties, their digitized versions, as well as their corresponding real and digital drape metrics, which can serve as a valuable resource for further research and development in fabric digitization."

To address the limitations of existing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAVs) and wall‑climbing robots during bridge visual inspections, a novel annular vision acquisition system based on a climbing robot is proposed. To overcome the limitations of the conventional 3D gaussian splatting (3DGS) algorithm—namely its inability to train in parallel and its low efficiency when handling large scale bridge pier scenes—this paper introduces a novel Momentum-GS based reconstruction method, Momentum-Octree-GS. The proposed algorithm achieves efficient parallel training and markedly improves rendering performance by integrating an octree data structure and a level of detail (LOD) hierarchy into the Momentum-GS framework. Experiments on bridge pier datasets demonstrate that Momentum-Octree-GS attains state-of-the-art (SOTA) results, and the reconstructed models faithfully reproduce the pier surfaces' geometric shapes and defect distributions. This work offers an efficient technical solution for bridge digital inspection and the generation of digital twin bases."

    "abstract": "In modern warfare, the complex dynamics of combat systems demand sophisticated decision-making processes to accurately identify critical targets and maximize damage to enemy capabilities. This study introduces a novel algorithm specifically designed to evaluate target threats within a unified coordinate framework. The algorithm systematically quantifies the threat levels of firepower nodes while assessing the significance of auxiliary nodes within the broader combat network. The analysis begins by identifying a simple circle from the combat network, characterized by the largest chord length, calculated as the circumference divided by the total number of nodes. A reference node is then selected within this circle, assigned a weight of zero. Nodes connected to this reference are granted weights based on the length of the longest path leading to it in the network. Subsequently, a diffusion model is employed to allocate weights to previously unweighted operational units, utilizing the established weights of firepower nodes across the local network. This approach ensures that all combat units receive comparable weights. To further validate the utility of our approach in combat scenarios, we developed an assessment prototype that simulates commanders’ strategies based on our weight assessments. This tool effectively demonstrates the algorithm’s capability to prioritize targets. The results highlight its potential to enhance decision-making in fast-paced combat scenarios, enabling commanders to maximize their operational impact."

This paper examines the essential elements, characteristics, and advantages of modern billing systems that utilize cutting-edge technology, including cloud computing, mobile integration, and point-of-sale (POS) systems. These new ideas all make the billing process easier, make operations more efficient, and make the customer experience better by allowing speedier transactions, real-time inventory management, and detailed reporting. This study incorporates machine learning (ML) methodologies for anomaly detection and predictive analytics to enhance reliability and intelligence. We used a Random Forest Regressor to anticipate billing because it can handle complicated, non-linear data well. We also used an Isolation Forest model to find strange patterns in transactional data. We also used advanced ensemble and neural models like XGBoost, LightGBM, and LSTM to see how well they worked with different metrics. We used 5-fold cross-validation to check the results using R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>, RMSE, MAE, MAPE, Precision, Recall, and PR-AUC. The results show that the XGBoost model had the best overall performance, with a R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> of 0.884 and an RMSE of 0.307, which was better than other baselines. The suggested edge-aware framework is good for real-time POS billing situations since it has a low latency of 0.02 seconds (20 ms). The addition of an integrated anomaly detection module makes sure that fraud is stopped and operations are open. The study shows that there is a single, smart billing system that can give accurate, low-latency, and reliable results in restaurants with limited resources."

Effective rainy image synthesis is essential for advancing robust autonomous driving systems. This paper introduces a novel methodology to bridge this gap by generating synthetic datasets simulating adverse weather conditions, particularly rainfall, using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We introduce a newly curated dataset of Kathmandu road scenes to provide diverse, real-world clear-weather imagery. Leveraging these datasets, we employ advanced deep learning techniques to synthesize high-quality rainy road scenes. In experiments, RFDETR achieved a mean Average Precision of 0.405 (averaged over IoU <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$0.50-0.95$</tex>) on the RainGAN-augmented dataset 0.605 at IoU 0.50 and 0.416 at IoU 0.75 demonstrating that our augmentation preserves detection performance under simulated rainfall. Proposed GAN also outperforms existing GAN variants, achieving an FID of 8.34 and LPIPS of 0.12 (versus DCGAN 18.45/0.29, Pix2Pix 15.32/0.24, and StyleGAN 10.57/0.18), indicating realism in the generated imagery Generated outputs are evaluated using Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) and Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) metrics to ensure realism and perceptual fidelity. The paper outlines the data creation pipeline, model implementation, evaluation strategy, and broader implications, offering a robust framework for weatheraffected scene synthesis and road safety research."

    "abstract": "The aviation industry has been growing rapidly, and the success of the sector depends heavily on pilots receiving rigorous training, which guarantees the safety of air travel. During various flight states of an aircraft, pilots encounter different situations; to anticipate and manage potential hazards, pilots must possess detailed knowledge of these flight regimes and maintain appropriate control. This study employs an ensemble clustering approach on flight data simulated through Monte Carlo Simulations to determine and recognize crucial flight states of an aircraft, providing the basis for assessing pilot performance within each state. The clustering performance of various individual algorithms and their combinations is evaluated. Among single clustering models, Shared Nearest Neighbor (SNN) achieved the highest performance with ACC of 0.83, ARI of 0.69, NMI of 0.69, and FMI of 0.83. While ensemble clustering models further enhanced clustering performance, the combination of SNN and Fuzzy C-means performing particularly well with ACC of 0.97, ARI of 0.89, NMI of 0.84, and FMI of 0.95. When comparing individual and ensemble approaches, it is observed that ensemble methods detect and distinguish flight states more accurately than any single clustering algorithm. This research marks a significant advancement in the use of ensemble approaches to improve the diagnosis of pilot performance during specific flight states, thereby enhancing training and flying safety."

    "abstract": "Smart cities use sophisticated information and communications technologies (ICTs) in an interconnected way across sectors, including transportation, energy, healthcare, and public safety, to create a more efficient community and improve people's quality of life. However, integrating technologies and data from different sectors increases the attack surface and creates additional vulnerabilities in connected systems, exposing them to threats that grow in sophistication. Furthermore, the traditional boundaries that define our security perimeters cannot satisfactorily restrict movement in this complex environment. This paper introduces a comprehensive Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) specifically for smart city infrastructures, utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) to authenticate identities and devices continuously through risk-based analysis. Our design continuously enforces the principle of \"never trust, always verify,\" and accesses controls are modified based on contextual risk changes. We propose a layered methodology, which shows potential, including secure micro segmentation architecture, behavior analytics in real-time, and federated identity management. Our proof-of-concept implementation showed that machine learning classifiers can detect anomalies during authentication attempts, resulting in a reduction of 35% in false positives and preventing two simulated attacks in an IoT network of municipalities. We analysed performance overhead, scalability, and resiliency concerning interacting with attacking systems. As a result, our AI-enabled ZTA had a significantly higher threat detection rate and still maintained a reasonable latency for smart city operations. This research presents a foundation for municipalities seeking to strengthen their city’s connected infrastructure against risk."

This study investigates the influence of AI ability, eco-digital education, sustainable orientation, and environmental awareness on students' sustainable learning capacity. Utilizing a structured questionnaire distributed to university students and analyzed through quantitative methods (regression models), the findings reveal several key relationships. Students with higher AI skills and a stronger commitment to sustainability tend to engage more actively in sustainable learning behaviors. Eco-digital education was identified as a key mediator, significantly shaping students' values and attitudes toward sustainability. Furthermore, environmental awareness emerged as a critical factor driving motivation for long-term learning outside formal education settings. These results underscore the necessity of incorporating digital literacy and sustainability awareness into curricula to foster resilient and responsible learners.

To address this challenge, we propose a novel Hypergraph-based shared Representation Fusion recommendation model, named HrFuse.Specifically, we first learn the representation of structured data through hypergraphs, while leveraging a pre-trained language model to vectorize the unstructured data. Subsequently, we introduce a HrFuse module to disentangle cross-modal shared features from modality-specific features.Finally, we evaluate our model on a real-world global dataset collected from one of the largest job recruitment platforms in China. Experimental results demonstrate that HrFuse outperforms all baseline models across all evaluation metrics.

Comparisons were made among cognitively healthy speakers with intelligible speech (CH I) or with slightly unintelligible speech (CH SU), and speakers with dementia and slightly unintelligible speech (DM SU). Both CH SU and DM SU exhibited significantly increased frequency of non-speech intervals and reduced speaking rates relative to CH I speakers. Additionally, DM SU speakers demonstrated greater standard deviation in two vowel formants compared to CH I, which could suggest increased articulatory instability associated with dementia. For the plosive-containing syllable, CH I speakers showed longer vowel duration and higher consonant-to-vowel duration ratio than both of SU groups, indicating a potential acoustic correlation of reduced intelligibility."

The conventional window width control method was limited in precise control due to its large variation in coupling strength. Therefore, this study introduces resonator spacing as an additional parameter. By simultaneously adjusting the window width and resonator spacing, more precise control of coupling becomes possible within the same process. The fabricated SIW BPF on a MEGTRON8 substrate achieved an insertion loss of 5.5 dB, a return loss better than 13.8 dB, and a bandwidth over 18 GHz (141–159 GHz). These results show that the proposed method enables flexible and practical wideband filter design without complex processes, making it suitable for next-generation high-frequency applications."

Real-time psychological evaluation is made possible by social media platforms, where people often share their ideas, feelings, and actions. This study compares the effectiveness of the CNN, XGBoost, BRDT, and NB models and uses sentiment analysis on Reddit data to try and identify mental illness. The CNN model was found to have the best overall performance with an F1 Score, accuracy, recall, and precision of 95.7%, making it highly effective in detecting depression based on text post data from both the pre- and post-pandemic periods. Despite having a somewhat lower accuracy of 95.6%, the XGBoost model actually has the lowest error rate, at 0.052734. The BRDT and NB model had the highest error rate and the lowest accuracy. These results demonstrate the potential of machine learning and sentiment analysis in detecting mental health problems on social media, and they imply that improved models can enhance early detection and intervention initiatives."

The study proposes a two-phase research methodology in which both phases complement each other. Phase 1 employs bibliographic analysis using VOSviewer to map keyword co-occurrence networks. The mapping results reveal three main clusters: (1) AI teaching and learning practice clusters (e.g., chatbots and generative AI); (2) learning approaches, including active learning, cooperative learning, and individual learning; and (3) cross-dimensional issues related to information security and AI ethics, which are essential for ensuring credibility in educational contexts. Phase 2 synthesizes relevant literature to define the components of three main dimensions: AI-enhanced learning, engineering communities of practice, and engineering education. The proposed framework integrates bibliographic analysis and literature synthesis and highlights how AI-powered personalization, intelligent tutoring systems, and adaptive analytics can be leveraged to create more sustainable learning experiences. CoP facilitates knowledge exchange and mutual learning among learners, while the CDIO (Conceive–Design–Implement–Operate) approach strengthens problem-solving skills and engineering innovation. In addition, the integration of emerging technologies supports active learning, real-time assessment, and scalable infrastructure for engineering education. The findings indicate that the implementation of the Engineering CoP framework can enhance learner engagement and improve the efficiency of knowledge sharing."

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the enhancement of power quality of a distribution system by using the Marine Gravitational Search Optimization (MGSO) algorithm to optimize the sizing and the location of Unified Power Quality Conditioners (UPQC). The main goal is to alleviate typical problems of power quality which include sagging, swelling of voltages, harmonic distortions as well as load imbalances. Based on natural acting of marine lives, which is influenced by gravitational forces, MGSO is implemented to compute the most effective structure of the UPQC units in a distribution network. The formulation of the optimization process is to minimize the overall cost of installation and operation and maximise the correction of the disturbances in the power quality. The findings of the simulation, which is executed with the help of MATLAB, prove that MGSO is effective to determine the optimal size and location of the UPQC devices, as well as to promote considerable power quality improvements at minimum costs of the systems. The approach is a strong solution to the improvement of the power quality of contemporary electric grids."

    "abstract": "Value-based deep reinforcement learning algorithms—exemplified by Deep Q-Network (DQN) and its successors—have demonstrated substantial empirical achievements. Nonetheless, training instability and sample inefficiency remain unresolved challenges, especially when reward signals are sparse or the state space is high-dimensional. These difficulties are exacerbated by the discount factor, conventionally treated as a fixed hyperparameter, which propagates bootstrap targets that may be overly optimistic and adapt slowly once the learning policy settles into local optima. Motivated by human cognition, wherein exploratory planning gradually gives way to exploitative decision-making, we introduce a dynamic-discount mechanism that anneals the effective planning horizon as a function of both training progress and episodic return. By embedding this schedule within Double DQN, we obtain J-Double DQN, an off-policy algorithm that (i) mitigates Q-value overestimation, (ii) accelerates convergence, and (iii) markedly reduces variance across random seeds. Comprehensive experiments on CartPole-v1 show that J-Double DQN surpasses both DQN and Double DQN in convergence speed and stability. Due to its model-agnostic design, the proposed method can be easily integrated into existing value-based reinforcement learning frameworks with minimal modification."

We utilize adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) in conjunction with a critic neural network to approximate the optimal control policy. This approach effectively circumvents the curse of dimensionality typically encountered when dealing the Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equation. We then establish the convergence properties of ADP and the identifier, demonstrating that the system state, along with the weights of the RNN and critic neural network, will converge to a finite neighborhood of equilibrium.

Convolutional layers distill localized information from charge-discharge cycles, bidirectional LSTMs describe long-range temporal behavior, and physicsinformed heads keep the network's predictions aligned with Arrhenius temperature sensitivity and Peukert's rate-capacity law. Evaluations on the NASA PCoE dataset and auxiliary synthetic profiles report an overall accuracy of 87.5 % with balanced precision and recall above 0.93 for both healthy and degraded cells. Beyond the scores, PI-BiLSTM is packaged for deployment: the loss term is transparent, the model ports cleanly to cloud or edge targets, and the output can be interpreted by battery engineers. The study demonstrates that lightweight physics regularization provides a practical path to humantrustworthy RUL estimation."

A Graph Neural Network (GNN) models the vehicle-RSUMBS communication topology to extract global representations, which are integrated as attention biases into a Transformerbased predictor for accurate content popularity forecasting.

    "abstract": "The fast development of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems made it possible to monitor and control the work of the industry in real-time; nevertheless, the traditional ways of fault detection, which rely on thresholding and rule-based approaches, do not usually allow working with the massive heterogeneous sensor data and changing operating conditions. Current models, like Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, and simpler and simpler Neural Networks, do not have an adaptive learning quality and are not very competent in holding their own in non-stationary settings. In overcoming these shortcomings, the current study presents a Machine Learning-based predictive diagnostics framework (ML-PDF) to IIoT systems to detect faults early and predict them. The suggested architecture incorporates combined feature extraction with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Autoencoders based dimensionality reduction, and a stacked ensemble architecture comprising of the Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (GBM), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to recognize temporal fault patterns. Moreover, an adaptive anomaly scoring system proposed on the principles of Bayesian inference reflects the fault probabilities dynamically so that the system could be reliable and resilient. The model is trained and tested on real-time IIoT data of industrial machines (e.g. rotating motors, pumps, compressors) and benchmark datasets of NASA turbofan engine degradation dataset. The experimental findings prove that the suggested MLPDF allows achieving a fault detection rate of 98.6 %, a 35 % decrease in the false alarm rate, and a 42 % increase in predictive maintenance scheduling efficiency in contrast to traditional ML methods. The importance of the work is that it allows conducting proactive diagnostics and practical decision-making, reducing downtime, minimizing maintenance expenses, and providing continuity of operations in smart industry settings. The proposed framework can also be used as a scalable and smart base of the next-generation self-healing IIoT infrastructures."

We developed and evaluated a system integrating a commodity 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi module and a 24 GHz continuous-wave (CW) Doppler radar, collecting respiration data from ten participants. The systems achieved a mean breathing rate accuracy of 92.01% (Wi-Fi) and 93.95% (radar), validated against a medical-grade chest belt. A cost-performance analysis indicates that Wi-Fi sensing offers a highly cost-effective solution, providing comparable accuracy to radar at a fraction of the hardware cost, making it suitable for scalable deployment in low-income regions, such as Bangladesh."

    "abstract": "Solar irradiance prediction is important in order to optimize photovoltaic (PV) systems in microgrids. Although Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) is used because it is simple to measure, Global Tilted Irradiance (GTI) is more physically appropriate when tilted PV panels are used but has not been extensively used in data-driven modeling. This paper compares and contrasts the GHI and GTI prediction with three machine learning regression algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Tree and Rand-Forest. The models were trained and evaluated using real-world solar and meteorological data sourced from Solcast. Performance was assessed using standard metrics (RMSE, MAE, R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>) on both validation and test sets. Results show that GTI prediction, while slightly more challenging due to its geometric and diffuse complexity, achieves high accuracy with Random Forest (R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> = 0.998).

Finally, a closed-loop control system was constructed by combining state feedback control law. The experimental results show that for high- frequency sine wave signals at 10 Hz and triangular wave signals at 10 Hz, the root mean square errors are 0.004, 2008 μ m, and 0.00277 μ m.

For pure edible oils, the sensor exhibits near-unity absorptivity at a specific resonance frequency, which is first calculated for the empty cavity. In the case of adulterated oils, the resonance frequency shifts and the absorptivity changes due to variations in their refractive indices. This sensor is a four element structure having dimensions 78 × 78 mm<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> and each unit cell consist of two concentric metallic split rings carved over FR4 substrate having thickness 0.8 mm (with dielectric constant 4.4 and loss tangent 0.02). This portable low cost sensor has very high sensitivity having Q factor 76.97%.The simulation to find the absorptivity of the oil sample is performed using Floquet mode analysis in CST Microwave Studio. A prototype has been fabricated and tested using microwave test bench setup in laboratory by observing the VSWR variation. Their affordable price and small size make them suitable for real-time tracking in healthcare, the agriculture industry, and manufacturing industries, especially when it comes to food safety."

    "abstract": "Deep learning models have been widely used in image recognition tasks due to their superior feature learning capabilities. The Vision Transformer (ViT), a mainstream deep learning architecture, uses a self-attention mechanism that effectively captures global feature dependencies compared to traditional convolutional neural networks. However, existing ViT models, because of their single-scale nature, suffer from poor interpretability when target features vary in location and size. This paper proposes a purity-based multi-granularity single-stage transformer model designed to precisely locate key regions that influence classification decisions. This approach first uses a convolutional network to decompose the input image into multiple subimage patches of varying granularity, which are then fed into the ViT module for feature extraction and classification. Using the output of the attention weight matrix from the attention layer, this paper constructs an undirected graph structure with high-attention image patches as nodes. A single-stage random walk algorithm is then used to generate interpretable analysis results. Compared to traditional multi-stage random walk methods, this single-stage strategy significantly reduces computational complexity while effectively maintaining the advantages of multi-granularity feature importance analysis and enabling the quantification of the importance of feature combinations."

In an N-path harmonic mixer with N number of paths, the noise figure (NF) can be improved by canceling the folded noise due to harmonics of the LO signals of orders other than multiples of the number of paths N. To verify the NF improvement, an N-path mixer was fabricated using a 45 nm SOI-CMOS process with the number of paths switchable from 1 to 4. By achieving wideband input matching, the mixer demonstrated operation with the widest relative bandwidth in the 1.75-43.75 GHz band, corresponding to the 1st to the 12th harmonics of the LO signal in 1-path mode. Additionally, an NF improvement of 5.1 dB was achieved by switching the number of paths from 1 to 4.

The traditional computer-aided diagnosis systems tend to use handcrafted features and shallow learning models which restrict their ability to process the complex spatial structure of CT images. In the present investigation, we suggest a Transfer Learning-Based Convolutional Framework, which is a convolutional structure, which is pre-trained on ImageNet, to extract the deep features representations of the lung CT slices automatically. The model utilizes fine-tuning and sophisticated methods of data augmentation based on domain-specificity to improve robustness and generalization. Prediction of the abnormality classes is achieved by passing the preprocessed CT images through a frozen CNN backbone which is ended by a global average pooling layer and a fully connected softmax classifier. The model was tested on a five-fold cross-validation scheme on an annotated dataset based on LIDC-IDRI. The model with a classification accuracy of 94.62, an average F1-Score of 92.8, and an AUC-ROC of over 97% had a higher classification accuracy than the baseline models, such as ResNet50, VGG16, and CNNs trained by themselves. Grad-CAM visualizations are added, which makes it interpretable and highlights the important pathological areas. Our findings reveal that domain adaptation transfer learning is very effective in CT based diagnostics of the lungs. This framework provides a scalable and precise instrument of early identification in clinical environments eliminating the use of manual radiological evaluation and enhancing diagnostic rates."

Our approach addresses the challenges of coordinated grasping and object transport by decomposing the task into two sequential stages. In the first stage, a single policy is trained using the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm to simultaneously control both arms and the torso to perform object grasping. In the second stage, a separate SAC policy is trained to move the grasped object to a specified target location. To improve learning efficiency, we incorporate human demonstration data during training. This integration of expert guidance with sample efficient deep reinforcement learning enables the system to achieve robust, coordinated manipulation behavior. Further validation of the simulation results were tested by putting the Poppy robot joint trajectories generated from the simulation results.

    "abstract": "Rapid urbanization in the Philippines, particularly in highly urbanized cities such as Cebu City, has altered land cover patterns and intensified development pressure on natural landscapes. The Mahiga River watershed, located within Cebu City, has seen urban expansion encroach on natural waterways and disrupt terrain, contributing to frequent flooding in several key areas during heavy rainfall. This study analyzes and projects decadal land cover changes in the watershed using remote sensing and GIS. Land cover data for 2000, 2010, and 2020 were mapped and processed, with a 2030 projection generated using the MOLUSCE plugin in QGIS, which integrates cellular automata and artificial neural networks. Results show built-up areas expanding from <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$9.33 ~\\text{km}^{2}$</tex> in 2000 to a projected <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$13.19 ~\\text{km}^{2}$</tex> in 2030, while wooded (5.34 to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$3.98 ~\\text{km}^{2}$</tex>), covered (3.51 to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$1.16 ~\\text{km}^{2}$</tex>), and bare (0.17 to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$0.02 ~\\text{km}^{2}$</tex>) lands declined. These trends highlight the rapid urban growth within the watershed and demonstrate the utility of geospatial modeling for monitoring land cover transformation in floodprone urban environments."

    "abstract": "Utilizing a Digital Signal Processor (DSP) as the core control chip can effectively ensure the closed-loop control performance of the attitude control flywheel. The acquisition speed of analog quantities, such as current, is a critical factor influencing this performance. Employing a polling transmission mechanism for data transfer between memory and the Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) presents issues of low transmission efficiency and extended control cycles. Utilizing an interrupt-based transmission mechanism introduces problems like interrupt response latency and jitter; furthermore, frequent interrupt responses increase system uncertainty. To address these issues, a high-performance data transmission method based on Direct Memory Access (DMA) is proposed. This method configures the Multi-channel Buffered Serial Port (McBSP) as an SPI peripheral and utilizes DMA to facilitate data transfer, enabling ADC-acquired data to be transmitted directly to system memory without CPU intervention. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to polling and interrupt-based data transmission methods, the attitude control flywheel employing the proposed method achieves an improvement in speed control precision (3σ) of no less than 18.41% and 18.42%, respectively, and an improvement in torque control precision (3σ) of no less than 20.18% and 51.18%, across its entire operational envelope."

A wiper model is described as a three-inertia resonance system to realize second mode oscillation characteristics. The control is designed based on H-infinity control theory to track the target motor angle and suppress the oscillation of the angular speeds of the driver's side arm and passenger's side arm. Verification is carried out with a wiper test rig using five types of rubber blades with different deterioration levels under a wide range of rainfall conditions. The effectiveness of the proposed control is demonstrated by comparing with the results of the conventional control designed based on optimal regulator theory. The experimental results are investigated from the viewpoints of suppressing the second mode oscillation and the accuracy of the reversal motor angle which determines the wiping range of the arms."

    "abstract": "With the expansion of cloud computing scale and the increase in computing density, high-temperature anomaly issues in cloud resource pools have become increasingly prominent. However, traditional static threshold-based detection methods suffer from delayed responses, inefficient fault isolation, and poor adaptability.This study develops the DK-CBLOF hybrid anomaly detection algorithm.The algorithm integrates the Cluster-Based Local Outlier Factor (CBLOF) to realize clustering and anomaly identification of multi-dimensional operational indicators, and introduces reinforcement learning to optimize dynamic K-Sigma threshold adjustment—solving the problem of missed detections and false detections caused by fixed K values in traditional algorithms when dealing with fluctuating data. Experiments based on real-network data from four resource pools of Shandong Mobile’s network cloud show that the DK-CBLOF algorithm achieves an average accuracy of approximately 90%, outperforming traditional algorithms such as CBLOF, LOF, and KNN by nearly 15 percentage points. The proposed system has been deployed in China Mobile’s data centers across 16 provinces, covering about 200,000 network devices. It can issue early warnings 10-15 minutes before high-temperature alarms are triggered, effectively resolving the impact of cross-regional differences and scattered anomalies on algorithm accuracy, and demonstrating strong practicality for real-network deployment."

    "abstract": "Migraine is a common neurological disorder that substantially affects quality of life (QoL) and is associated with altered cortical activity. While advanced neuroimaging has enhanced understanding of migraine-related brain changes, such methods are often costly and not widely accessible. This study investigates the feasibility of using a low-channel, wearable electroencephalography (EEG) device to assess migraine severity in a non-clinical population of university students. Fifty-three participants were stratified into four groups based on the Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) questionnaire. Resting-state EEG data were recorded with the Muse 2 headband and processed via EEGLAB in MATLAB. Power spectral density (PSD) analysis focused on alpha (α, 8–12 Hz) and beta (β, 13–30 Hz) activity in frontal and temporal regions. Although statistical analysis using one-way ANOVA did not yield significant differences, a decreasing trend in α and β power was observed with increasing migraine severity. Participants also completed the Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (MSQv2.1), which showed no significant differences among the groups. The findings support the feasibility of using consumer-grade EEG systems for non-invasive assessment of migraine severity and provide a foundation for future studies involving larger cohorts and advanced signal analysis."

    "abstract": "The substantial scale variation of objects in remote sensing imagery presents a persistent challenge to high-precision detection. While existing deep learning methods have advanced, they remain constrained by the static receptive fields of convolutional neural networks, struggling to preserve fine-grained details for small objects while maintaining extensive contextual information. To address this limitation, this paper proposes YOLO-RSNet. The backbone incorporates a Lightweight Feature Enhancement Block (LFEB) module that employs lightweight high-order feature interactions to enhance representation of complex objects. The neck network is redesigned with an MultiScale Fusion Assembly (MSFA) as its core, which actively reinforces edge and high-frequency texture information to effectively mitigate detail degradation during multi-scale fusion. On the DOTA 2.0 dataset, it achieves a $\\mathbf{m A P}_{50: 95}$ of $\\mathbf{6 4. 5 \\%}$, surpassing the baseline model by 6.0 percentage points; on the NWPU VHR-10 dataset, it attains a mAP<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">50</inf> of $85.9 \\%$, representing an improvement of 3.1 percentage points.

Given the dynamic and nonlinear nature of financial markets, accurately predicting volatility remains a persistent challenge. Traditional econometric models often struggle to capture the complex patterns and time-dependent behaviors present in market data. This research presents a Residual Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (ResBiLSTM) model-based deep learning framework for VIX price prediction. By integrating residual connections and bidirectional temporal processing, the model is able to successfully capture intricate patterns found in financial time series data. A complete array of 64 designed features, comprising technical indicators and wavelet-denoised inputs, was employed to train and assess the model. The suggested ResBiLSTM surpasses conventional models, including LSTM, GRU, CNN, BiLSTM, and Residual LSTM, across multiple criteria. The performance was additionally confirmed using 5-fold cross-validation and statistical significance assessment via paired t-tests across many experimental iterations. The findings illustrate the model's resilience, precision, and applicability for implementation in practical volatility forecasting scenarios."

Avoiding death-causing diseases like end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requires early detection. The primary risk factors for renal failure are high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, and a family history of renal illnesses. Predictive diagnosis might develop with the use of machine learning in the healthcare industry. This work aims to identify sequential patterns from patients' clinical history by proposing a deep learning-based CKD classification algorithm. Several methods, including correlation-based, info gain, gain ratio, and relief score algorithms, are used to carry out feature selection. Proposed method begins with 25 attributes, along with the target, and it ends with the 10 most significant attributes to identify CKD. Different activation functions (ReLU, Tanh, Sigmoid, and LReLU) are also explored. When evaluated using several validation procedures, including data splits of 80:20 and K-Fold set to 20 and 25, respectively, the accuracy rate of the proposed model is 98.75%. The models' efficacy is evaluated for the diagnosis of positive instances by assessing their accuracy, examining confusion matrix statistics, and computing recall, F1-Score, precision, cross-entropy loss function. Experimental results are useful for healthcare practitioners in making timely decisions towards the prediction of CKD disease."

    "abstract": "Detecting fraudulent credit card transactions remains a major challenge in financial analytics due to the highly imbalanced nature of real-world datasets. Effective fraud detection requires models that can recognize rare fraudulent patterns without being biased toward the majority class. In this research, a comparative study between two deep learning models Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Tab Net is conducted using a real credit card transaction dataset. To handle class imbalance, the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is employed to enhance the representation of minority (fraudulent) cases. The models are evaluated based on classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{F 1}$</tex>-score, along with computational efficiency. Experimental findings reveal that both models achieved high recall (0.78) for fraudulent transactions, indicating strong sensitivity in identifying frauds. However, precision values were comparatively low (MLP: 0.07, Tab Net: 0.08), suggesting the presence of false positives. Tab Net slightly outperformed MLP in terms of F1-score (0.14 vs. 0.12), reflecting a marginally better balance between recall and precision. Although both models reached an overall accuracy of about 96%, this metric was less reliable due to the inherent data imbalance. The outcomes highlight the importance of recall in fraud detection and demonstrate Tab Net advantage in structured data modeling when compared to conventional neural architectures such as MLP."

This work focuses on the modeling and control of a 4-DOF robotic manipulator composed of a planar two-link manipulator mounted on a mobile base capable of translating along the dual axes. The dynamic behavior of the manipulator is derived using the Euler-Lagrange equation, which effectively captures the dynamic coupling between the manipulator and the base. Additionally, kinematic analysis is conducted to accurately determine the end-effector's position during operation. One of the main challenges in this setup lies in dealing with the system's nonlinear characteristics, external disturbances, and the need to manage the dynamic interactions between the base and the manipulator components. To address these challenges, a Sliding Mode Control (SMC) strategy is adopted, chosen for its well-known resilience to system uncertainties and external perturbations. The proposed control framework is implemented within the MATLAB Simulink and Simscape environments, where the entire 4-DOF system is modeled to reflect realistic dynamics and base-manipulator interactions. Through simulation, the effectiveness of the controller in achieving robust and precise motion control is demonstrated."

The current accelerator architectures (GPUs and FPGAs) are powerful but have high energy consumption, high data movement latency, and a high level of scalability, which does not allow simultaneous processing of many modalities. In order to overcome these shortcomings, this study adopts a Low-Power VLSI Accelerator Architecture that has been tuned to run AI-based real-time audio and video processing in the network edge. The proposed model integrates the hierarchical dataflow, adaptive clock gating, and multi-core neural processing unit (NPU) that is tuned to systolic array-based computing with the dynamic voltage-frequency scaling (DVFS) that ensures the efficiency of the workload balancing with lesser energy leakage. Moreover, the architecture uses on-chip memory compression and shared buffer reuse techniques that reduce redundancy in accessing memory; this improves the throughput besides bandwidth use. The experimental analysis shown that the proposed model performs well with the improvement in reduction of power consumption, reduction of latency and improved energy consumption of a GPU. The results of this study should play a significant role in the implementation of intelligent, scalable, and sustainable edge computing systems to next-generation IoT and multimedia applications that would allow real-time decision-making with a low latency and power consumption."

Experimental results on the publicly available SubT-MRS dataset demonstrate that HMA-LIO achieves significantly higher trajectory estimation accuracy than mainstream comparison algorithms in complex maneuvering scenarios. Further verification through quadruped robot simulation experiments confirms that HMA-LIO can provide real-time, robust, and high-precision localization outputs and 3D map construction capabilities.

We test LSTM, CNN, and two hybrid versions of deep learning architectures, implemented with embedding layers and trained on tokenized product review datasets. Sequence learning and convolution-based feature extraction work together so the models can capture contextual patterns in the text and make accurate sentiment predictions. Through the direct learning of meaningful representations from the input, deep learning (DL) techniques have significantly improved the processing of raw textual data. This study evaluates four architectures developed in our project: a CNN that uses word embeddings to extract spatial features, an LSTM network that captures sequential dependencies, a CNN–LSTM hybrid model that combines convolutional feature extraction with temporal context learning, and a CNN–Bidirectional LSTM (CNN–BiLSTM) that learns dependencies from both past and future word sequences. These models are trained on pre-processed and tokenized product review datasets to perform sentiment classification. All models were implemented using the TensorFlow Kera's framework and trained on a labelled dataset using GloVe embeddings for word representation. These findings indicate that CNN–BiLSTM achieved the highest accuracy (97%), outperforming CNN–LSTM (92%), LSTM (91%), and CNN (88%)."

    "abstract": "Postural sway control has traditionally been targeted through lower-limb or ankle-based interventions, especially critical for individuals with chronic low back pain (CLBP), older adults, and those with neurological disorders. This paper introduces a strap-based soft active back-support exoskeleton that applies corrective torque directly across the trunk and shoulders using pneumatic actuation. Trunk sway is detected via an inertial measurement unit (IMU) mounted on the sternum via nylon straps, with corrective action triggered through a lightweight ESP32-based threshold control algorithm. Fifteen healthy adults were evaluated across four static stance conditions, with the Tandem Stance Eyes Closed (TSEC) posture representing the greatest challenge to balance. When the exosuit was active, the centre of pressure (CoP) pathlength decreased by <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{5 1. 5 \\%}$</tex>, while RMS sEMG activity was reduced by 51.2 % in the rectus abdominis, 38.3 % in the external oblique, and 41.8 % in the erector spinae. These results highlight the feasibility of a trunk-focused active exosuit for improving static balance control, offering a complementary alternative to conventional ankle or limb-based corrective strategies. These findings suggest the exosuit's potential as a practical tool for assisting static balance."

The circuit mainly consists of a control logic block, a current detection circuit, and a comparator. By introducing a sampling delay based current detection method into the driver, the conduction current of the low-side power MOSFET can be monitored in real time, effectively preventing false triggering caused by transient current spikes during turn on. When the detected voltage signal exceeds a predefined threshold, the control logic circuit immediately turns off the power transistor, and the driver automatically resumes operation after 15 clock cycles. Simulation results show that under a supply voltage of 600 V and an operating frequency of 50 kHz, when the load current exceeds 10 A, the proposed overcurrent protection circuit promptly activates the protection mechanism and rapidly shuts down the power transistor, demonstrating fast response and high reliability."

Post quantum cryptographic algorithms have been developed and standardized which are resistant to attacks using quantum computing techniques. However, new algorithms are under development and the implementations of the new standards are, relative to established algorithms such as RSA or ECDSA, immature and untested in the field. For this reason, hardware manufacturers must be prepared for the fact that the definition of these algorithms may change in the near future. This paper proposes a field-upgradeable mechanism which enables post quantum algorithm implementations within a hardware Root of Trust for Detection. The proposed mechanism ensures a secure boot flow while allowing for new algorithms to be deployed or vulnerabilities which emerge in existing algorithms or their implementations to be rectified in the field."

We build a simple model that adjusts the value of each target point by adding the worth of nearby points and their distances, guiding the drone to visit high-value clusters first. On top of this, we join the POMO algorithm with beam search in an end-to-end framework: POMO creates strong route options, and beam search quickly refines them, lifting path quality while keeping response fast. Tests on tasks ranging from 20 to 100 nodes show that our POMO-CM method clearly beats classic optimizers like ACO, PSO and ALNS, and also tops the deep baseline AM+POMO. It raises solution quality by more than 8.59 % on average and cuts computing time by over twenty-fold. Adding beam search lets the method move even closer to the global best. This approach gives a solid basis and ready-to-use tool for real-time decisions in power-limited drones working in logistics, reconnaissance and monitoring."

Continuous analytical inner and outer surface potentials are derived in a cylindrical coordinate system under various inner-gate (IG) bias conditions, including depletion and accumulation operation modes, with self-adaptive algorithm selection based on physical behavior. The analytical solutions of surface potentials demonstrate excellent agreement with numerical results and ensure the model’s efficiency and convergence by avoiding complicated functional forms. Besides, the procedure is examined for capturing the geometric dependence of surface potentials, e.g., critical diameter (CD) and material thickness, indicating the awareness of intrinsic asymmetries. Furthermore, the complete model is developed and validated with experimental data by incorporating transport theories. Finally, this model is implemented in Verilog-A and successfully enables simulations of logic circuits and a multibit 2T0C DRAM cell, indicating the potential for future M3D circuit design applications."

This article discusses the efficiency optimization of a multiple-to-one WPT system with phase-shift modulation. Then, a novel online parameter identification method for multiple-to-one WPT systems based on the concept of voltage transient detection is proposed. By inserting a sensor inductor into the primary resonant tank and monitoring its voltage response to the rising and falling edges of the square voltage inputs, both mutual inductance and output voltage can be accurately identified without a communication link. The identification principle and sensitivity are analyzed to demonstrate robustness, and the extendibility to different primary compensation structures is discussed. Afterward, constant voltage output and efficiency optimization can be achieved via the identified results. Experiment results show an identification accuracy exceeding 97% and a combined identification and closed-loop control response time of approximately 2.2 ms. Moreover, the efficiency fluctuation is limited to within 1% over a wide range of misalignments, compared with over 15% without control."

    "abstract": "While recent advancements have demonstrated remarkable progress in general 3D shape generation, the challenge of automatically generating wearable 3D assets remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we present BAG — a Body aligned Asset Generation method that produces 3D wearable assets which can be automatically fitted onto given 3D human bodies. This is achieved by controlling the 3D generation process using human body shape and pose information. Specifically, we first construct a general single-image-to-consistent-multi-view diffusion model, and train it on the large-scale Objaverse dataset to ensure diversity and generalizability. We then train a body conditioned multi-view ControlNet to guide the generator toward producing body-aligned multi-view images. The control signal leverages multi-view 2D projections of the target human body, where pixel values represent the XYZ coordinates of the body surface in a canonical space. The resulting body-conditioned multi-view diffusion outputs body-aligned images, which are subsequently fed into a native 3D diffusion model to reconstruct the 3D shape of the asset. Finally, we recover the similarity trans formation using multi-view silhouette supervision and mitigate asset-body penetration using physics-based simulation, ensuring accurate asset fitting onto the target body. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of prompt adherence, shape diversity, and shape quality."

This focus limits the utility of a visualization to other groups working with the same data. While tasks elicited from other groups can present a design pitfall if not disambiguated, they also present a design opportunity—namely, the development of visualizations that support multiple groups. This development choice presents a trade-off of broadening the scope but limiting support for the more narrow tasks of any one group, which in some cases can enhance the overall utility of the visualization. We investigate this scenario through a design study where we develop Guidepost, a notebook-embedded visualization of data that helps scientists assess compute wait times, machine learning researchers understand prediction accuracy, and system maintainers analyze usage trends. We adapt the use of personas for visualization design from existing literature in the HCI and design domains, applying them to categorize tasks based on their uniqueness across stakeholder personas. Under this model, tasks shared between all groups should be supported by interactive visualizations and tasks unique to each group can be deferred to scripting with notebook-embedded visualization design. We evaluate our visualization through real-world case studies and a task-focused evaluation with nine participants. We observe that together, Guidepost's visual encodings, interactions, and export capabilities support the tasks of our differing personas."

However, it remains challenging due to occlusions, complex dynamics, and the absence of direct physical measurements. Existing vision-based approaches often impose rigid or simplified motion priors, limiting their generalisability and physical interpretability. In this paper, we introduce a vision-guided, physics-informed framework that predicts multi-step 3D deformation by integrating stereo disparity, optical flow, and tracked keypoints into a spatio-temporal graph. Motion features, including velocity, acceleration, and directional strain, are encoded as node and edge attributes and processed via a graph network. The model is trained end-to-end with self-supervised objectives promoting geometric alignment, temporal coherence, and motion consistency.

Improved forecasting reduces reserve requirements and thermal plant activation, yielding both economic and environmental benefits. This study proposes an original methodological framework for short-term wind power forecasting at an hourly temporal resolution, with horizons of up to one month ahead, with emphasis on operational application by Independent System Operators (ISOs), particularly in Brazil. The framework considers the regulatory environment, international best practices, and sector-specific challenges. It employs a deterministic approach that integrates global numerical weather prediction models with historical wind farm data, enabling accurate representation of wind generation variability. The methodology is scalable and can be adopted by the Brazilian Independent System Operator (ISO) as well as other ISOs worldwide. The results demonstrate robust forecasting performance, achieving an average systematic error of approximately 4.5% for hourly forecasts one day ahead. For weekly aggregations, errors remain close to 3.4% in the first forecast week and gradually increase to 6.3% by the fifth week. These outcomes highlight the effectiveness of the proposed framework in supporting short-term operational planning and enhancing system reliability, efficiency, and sustainability in contexts with high penetration of wind power."

    "abstract": "In this paper, a novel SiC–Si hybrid half-bridge topology is proposed, in which an auxiliary low-voltage (LV) half bridge is integrated at the midpoint of a conventional SiC MOSFET–Si IGBT direct-parallel configuration. The control strategy introduces a pre-switching low-voltage step to accelerate residual carrier recombination in the IGBT during turn-off and to softly turn off the Si fast recovery diode (FRD) before turn-on, thereby mitigating dominant loss mechanisms in conventional direct-parallel schemes. Experimental evaluation with a 600V/50A hybrid bridge test platform showed total-switching-loss reduction of 32% at 50A-load and 45% at 25A-load compared with traditional approaches. The auxiliary capacitor is charged at turn-off transition and discharged at turn-on transition, and charge balancing is achieved by pulse duration control, eliminating the need for an external power supply. The proposed scheme is suitable for inductive load with bidirectional current involving both hard turn-on and hard turn-off, and can also provide benefits in cases requiring only hard turn-on."

    "abstract": "As the central bank digital currency (CBDC) is rapidly becoming operational, there are both opportunities for financial inclusion and efficiency, as well as problems of security threats and anti money laundering (AML), particularly due to concerns about user anonymity. In order to address the risks associated with anonymous transactions, this research proposes a multi-layered security framework for CBDC that makes use of smart contracts built on the Ethereum platform, taint analysis, and machine learning (ML) models. The solution makes use of programmable smart contracts to automate policy enforcement and transaction validation within the CBDC ecosystem. Taint analysis techniques are incorporated to track the movement of illicit funds and identify questionable transaction patterns across the blockchain network. This is further enhanced by ML models that are optimized to learn from transaction data in order to reliably identify anomalous or illicit actions before they occur. We have generated two synthetic datasets that include two case scenarios and trained six ML models to evaluate them comparatively. Of them, random forest had the highest level of accuracy, 91.11%, in the cross-border case, whereas the support vector machine had a accuracy of 93.12% in the case of real estate transactions. In addition, we conducted a performance comparison of five environments; traditional banking, CBDC with baseline blockchain, CBDC with blockchain, CBDC with ML, and CBDC with blockchain, taint analysis and ML. Weused different metrics to test the performance of our proposed scheme and found that our AML tracking algorithm took an average of 0.55 s inference time, which is faster than the underlying reference method. According to our results, the proposed combined framework ensures high-level protection that improved risk detection in digital currencies, with a significantly reduced risk of money laundering and related hazards when using CBDC systems."

The study uses game theory models to analyze the effects of reference price and quality on the dual-channel remanufacturing supply chain involving the manufacturer and retailer. Under the framework of Stackelberg game, the centralized and decentralized models of traditional and dual-channel systems are discussed, and the revenue sharing (RS) and two-part tariff (TPT) contracts are designed. Market consumers are divided into new product consumers and remanufactured product consumers. The results show that: 1) Dual-channel system is more beneficial to the manufacturer under specific remanufacturing costs; 2) Reference price has a positive impact on supply chain members; 3) The reference quality may adversely affect the manufacturer’s profit; 4) The manufacturer may choose different coordination contracts according to different channels. This study sheds light on the rule of reference effects in dual-channel supply chain decision making, which provides some guidance for firms’ decision making and practices."

    "abstract": "The Future Load Profile Nomination (FLPN) framework is introduced as a novel approach to enhance power system load forecasting by enabling proactive participation from the demand side. As a specific application of the broader concept of Future Behavior Nomination (FBN) within power systems, FLPN addresses a key limitation of traditional forecasting methods, which depend primarily on historical and real-time data and often fail to anticipate deviations driven by future-oriented consumer behavior. FLPN empowers consumers to voluntarily nominate their anticipated electricity consumption in advance, effectively shifting the demand side from reactive to proactive. Mathematical models are developed at both the individual and system-aggregated levels, incorporating dynamic parameters such as participation rates, forecast blending, and time-varying accuracy. A simulation of a non-historical load anomaly validates the framework, demonstrating a significant reduction in forecast error even with imperfect user input. FLPN contributes to the broader objective of Proactive Energy Management (PEM) and directly supports the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) by promoting efficient grid operations that reduce reliance on carbon-intensive spinning reserves (SDG 13), increase the hosting capacity for renewables (SDG 7), and empower consumers for responsible consumption (SDG 12)."

First, data from the open loop system is collected in real-time. In particular, data corresponding to the two measured outputs are recorded in response to an input. This input-output data is used for identifying a model of the system. The identified model is compared with the given model for correctness. Once verified, the identified model is used to synthesize a linear quadratic regulator by solving linear matrix inequalities. It is known that the weighting matrices play a crucial role in the LQR design. The effect of the choice of the weighting matrices in the LQR design is examined, and accordingly a suitable pair of weighting matrices are chosen for the design. Thus, a state-feedback controller, based on measured input-output data is obtained. The design is experimentally validated by implementing the controller in real-time."

    "abstract": "The rapid adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) and the emergence of distributed renewable energy resources are driving the need for efficient power management solutions in DC microgrids. Conventional microgrid architectures often struggle with voltage instability, inefficient energy utilization, and high dependency on the central grid when subjected to the highly dynamic demand of EV fast-charging stations. This study presents a better power management system that incorporates renewable energy systems, hybrid energy storage system and sophisticated control systems to improve reliability and efficiency. The architecture uses the strategies of bidirectional DC/DC converters, model predictive control (MPC) and demand response to optimize real time power flow between distributed resources, storage and charging loads. The outcomes of the simulations indicate that the proposed system can provide an improvement in the voltage stability of 50.6, a reduction in charging time by 24.6, and an improvement of system efficiency to the tune of 4.4 % over traditional models. There was growth in the use of renewable energy by 14.5 and a decrease of 23.7 in grid dependency and an overall operational efficiency in fulfilling the dynamic load requirement of 96.2 %. The findings demonstrate that the system can support peak charging conditions without degrading performance. In this research paper, it can be concluded that the combination of hybrid storage and predictive optimization has allowed sustainable, resilient, and cost-effective EV fast-charging in DC microgrids. The framework offers a scaled route of future smart transportation ecosystems through minimized carbon emission, better grid resilience, and grid stability."

    "abstract": "With the widespread use of mobile devices and the development of indoor positioning technology, predicting user movement trajectories within indoor settings have emerged as a research focus over the past few years. Although most prediction methods based on kinematic or statistical models demonstrate satisfactory performance in outdoor scenarios, their effectiveness is notably diminished in indoor settings. In response to this challenge, the paper presents a hybrid approach integrating crested porcupine optimization (CPO) and long short-term memory (LSTM), and self-attention mechanism. The process begins with the model optimizing the LSTM network’s hyperparameters through CPO, ensuring that the LSTM processes the input data with the optimal configuration. The LSTM network is then leveraged to extract temporal features from the input data, identifying dependencies across short and long timeframes. Subsequently, the self-attention mechanism is introduced, which adaptively assigns different weights to different time steps, enhancing the model’s focus on key time points and effectively capturing important information in the time series. Finally, the predicted results of the indoor trajectory are output through the fully connected layer. Comparative experiments and ablation studies are conducted on a real indoor dataset to evaluate the predictive performance of the model. The experimental results show that the prediction performance and evaluation indicators of the model are better than those of the benchmark model and other optimization algorithm combination models, which verifies that the combined model has good prediction performance and generalization ability and can be applied in practical scenarios."

However, traditional gradient-based methods, such as backpropagation, have drawbacks, including early convergence, high dependence on initial parameters, and a leaning to quickly become stuck in local optima. To address these limitations, this study proposes COA-MLP, a novel hybrid model that employs the coyote optimization algorithm (COA) to optimize the weights and biases of multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural networks. COA is a population-based meta-heuristic inspired by the social behavior of coyotes, offering a balanced trade-off between exploration and exploitation. This research presents the first implementation of COA for MLP training. The proposed model is evaluated on five benchmark datasets from the UCI repository and compared against eight state-of-the-art meta-heuristic algorithms. Results demonstrate that COA-MLP achieved the highest classification accuracy on three out of five datasets in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. These outcomes confirm the superior generalization capability and optimization efficiency of the COAMLP model. The findings underscore the value of meta-heuristic approaches in enhancing ANN performance for medical informatics applications."

Multiple classifiers' outputs are combined by an inference mechanism through majority voting, whereas a support vector machine (SVM) regressor that considers, among other things, torque and shear sensor responses is used for security estimation. The metrics of the performance to measure accuracy, precision, and F1-score were put in comparison with the existing models such as BCIEH, MLULM, GMPRF, and the proposed CPHFGO model. The high error rate is less than that of the existing models, CPHFGO with 20 % error rate. After we perform the speed calculation, we get 0.61 ms which is relatively higher, F1-Score at 86 %, the validation accuracy from 95 % to 96 % and the linear SVM got 75 % accuracy that was increased by RBF kernel to 85 % accuracy."

Specifically, an active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) system is incorporated into the speed loop to strengthen the anti-disturbance capability of the original strategy. In the presence of inductance mismatch, the current tracking performance can still satisfy the requirement of following the reference current without overshoot within 2 control cycles, thereby further improving the model's robustness. Additionally, the current ripple is reduced and the settling time is shortened, which leads to a significant improvement in transient performance. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is validated through simulations."

Traditional local window-based methods often suffer from edge fattening and texture inconsistency, leading to inaccurate depth estimation. This paper proposes a Segment-Side Window-Based (SWB) algorithm that integrates segment-based cost aggregation to address these challenges. The SWB method combines Truncated Absolute Difference (TAD), Gradient Magnitude (GM), and Census Transform (CT) for robust matching cost computation, followed by Superpixel Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) segmentation and Side Window Filtering (SWF) for edgepreserving aggregation. The final stage involves postprocessing and disparity refinement to enhance the accuracy of the disparity map with left-right consistency checking (L-R Check) and median filter. Experimental results on the Middlebury dataset demonstrate that SWB achieves superior performance, reducing the average bad pixel error to 24.7 % (All) and 14.6 % (Nonocc), outperforming state-of-the-art methods like Bilateral Filter (BF), Guided Filter (GF), and Median Filter (MF)."

To address this gap, the study introduces a POS tagging system for Waray-waray utilizing a Modified Viterbi Algorithm, which also incorporates a strategy for handling unfamiliar words. Evaluated on a corpus of 50,000 religious text datasets, the algorithm demonstrates outstanding performance-achieving an accuracy of 93%, precision of 90%, recall of 90.52%, and an F 1 score of 92%. These results underscore the algorithm's effectiveness in navigating linguistic challenges across specialized genres. Beyond technical contributions, the study promotes linguistic diversity and fosters inclusive language technologies, advancing the goals of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Specifically, it enhances language learning and literacy among Waray-waray speakers, supports inclusive education through computational tools for minority languages, and aligns with SDG 4 by providing foundational resources for mother-tongue instruction and educational content development.

By applying the WHT to convert symbols from the delay-sequence domain to the delay-time domain for transmission, the modulation and demodulation processes involve only simple addition and subtraction operations, without requiring any complex multiplication or division, owing to the properties of the Walsh-Hadamard matrix. Furthermore, a frequency-domain equalization algorithm is proposed and compared with the commonly used zero force algorithm. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed frequency-domain equalization algorithm achieves a higher performance gain."

    "abstract": "Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) are systems that belong to dynamic and spectral-limited conditions, which require smart methods to detect vacant spectral bands, referred to as spectrum holes. Traditional spectrum sensing methods in cognitive radio-based VANETs have low detection and high false alarm rates, especially during high mobility and dynamic signal-tonoise ratios (SNR). To deal with these issues, this paper suggests a Cooperative Spectrum Sensing (DA-CSS) framework based on the Dragonfly Algorithm which intelligently adjusts sensing thresholds and fusion weights to enhance spectrum opportunities detection. The algorithm is implemented in a multidimensional space of sensing parameters by emulating the swarming motion of dragonflies as a way of global optimization. The suggested solution utilizes a hybrid signal detection technique that integrates energy and cyclostationary signals and allows mobile vehicles to make mutually beneficial decisions through a Roadside Unit (RSU) which will serve as a fusion center. Experiments with simulations indicate that DA-CSS can have a detection probability as high as 95.2 with a false alarm as low as 6.5 and an average improvement in throughput 23.4 times that of conventional CSS. Moreover, up to 2.5 ms reduction in sensing delay is provided and faster spectrum access decisions can be made in latency-sensitive vehicular networks. Such developments make DA-CSS an effective, scalable, and low-complexity platform to update the next-generation cognitive vehicular communication systems. The described framework has a potential to manage spectrum in real-time within a dense traffic environment, increasing the level of safety, infotainment, and autonomous functions."

The first part of this research is a comparative analysis of Embedded Heat Pipes and Loop Heat Pipes for effective battery cooling in cell, module and pack levels. To increase model reliability, preprocessing techniques like, thermal data normalization and removing of outlier as per sensor readings, were used to the model. The performance was assessed with key thermal features taken off-Heat flux, temperature gradients, material thermal conductivity and system level resistance. Adecision tree and random forest classifiers were used to predict the optimal thermal management configuration(EHP or LHP) using machine learning method based on the EV classification, power requirements and thermal load conditions. Exemplary results demonstrate the ability of EHPs to conduct efficient heat acquisition at the integration level and that LHPs are more suitable for conducting heat flow at the system level. These findings show a hybrid two phase cooling strategy that tremendously improves thermal reliability, lowers the risk of overheating and lengthens battery cycle life."

To mitigate these risks, this paper presents a two-tier secure IJTAG architecture that combines dynamic priority arbitration with a parallel CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check)-protected scan core. The arbitration module restricts scan participation to instruments with valid configuration bits and priority tokens, providing fine-grained access control. However, while effective against unauthorized access and path manipulation, it cannot detect data tampering. To address this, lightweight checksums are appended at scan-in and verified at scan-out to detect data modifications. Together, these mechanisms block a wider range of attacks and ensure end-to-end scan data integrity. Simulations show that the architecture effectively prevents attacks such as data sniffing and tampering, even when malicious instruments are embedded within the scan path. When implemented in 65 nm CMOS technology, the design incurs less than 35% area overhead, offering robust security with minimal impact on IJTAG compatibility and performance."

    "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in medical diagnostics, yet their accuracy is severely constrained when diagnosing visually confusable skin diseases. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a promising paradigm to address this issue without fine-tuning. However, applying this paradigm to fine-grained diagnostic tasks through the standard Visual RAG framework reveals two critical bottlenecks: poor retrieval quality from general-purpose models lacking domain specificity, and ineffective context presentation stemming from rigid context lengths and uncertainty over optimal prompt design. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Visual Retrieval-Augmented Diagnostic Framework (AVR-ADF). The crux of our framework lies in a novel retriever fine-tuning strategy, which combines Supervised Contrastive (SupCon) learning with domain-specific data augmentation and is optimized using our proposed Clinical Confusion Rate (CCR) metric. This is complemented by SN-EA-k, a hyperparameter-free adaptive context selection algorithm that dynamically determines the optimal number of examples, alongside the finding that a simple In-Context Learning (ICL) prompt is more effective than complex Chain-of-Thought (CoT) counterparts for this task. Experiments on the public PAD dataset show that AVR-ADF substantially boosts the diagnostic accuracy of the baseline model from 53.75% to 83.75% for pigmented lesions and from 55.64% to 76.32% for keratotic lesions. The framework's superiority and generalizability are further validated against state-of-the-art specialized vision-language models, such as PanDerm, and on the public ISIC 2019 benchmark, confirming its effectiveness."

By processing text, speech intonation, and facial micro-expressions in parallel, our pipeline achieves robust emotion detection across diverse contexts.

By integrating the impedance matching network (IMN) and the tunable BPF into a single structure, the proposed BPF allows direct connection to a low-noise amplifier (LNA), eliminating the need for additional IMN. The filter employs multiple PIN-diode-switched capacitor banks to achieve independent tuning of both the termination impedance and the center frequency under high-power conditions. To validate the concept, a reconfigurable filter with complex termination impedance (50-to-(40+15j) Ω) along with an LNA without input IMN is manufactured and measured. The passband frequency of the BPF can be tuned from 100 MHz to 180 MHz (57.15%) with the insertion loss variation from 1.81 dB to 2.52 dB. When directly connected to the LNA, the system results in a gain of 28.5–30 dB and a noise figure (NF) consistently below 5 dB, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method in enhancing the overall performance of the RF front-end."

In realtime scenarios, this object classification or labeling latency should be minimal. In these applications, the accuracy of detection also plays a vital role. So, this paper proposes a hybrid algorithm to reduce detection latency while improving the accuracy of detection. The proposed approach uses a hybrid of feature selection, clustering, and classifiers to achieve the highest accuracy and lowest latency. The results show that the proposed method achieves better performance as compared to other algorithms. It can complete the classification in 2 msec while the detection latency of other deep learning or machine learning techniques is in the range of seconds. This algorithm also has the highest accuracy among all the existing classification models."

As there are other possible biometric parameters, this study explores Wi-Fi CSI sensing in HIR where the subjects perform three physical (static) and two behavioral (dynamic) biometric parameters. A CSI dataset involving samples collected from six subjects in a controlled indoor environment was preprocessed using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and principal component analysis (PCA). Different parameter-specific HIR models were trained and tested and the HIR model based on the ‘draw triangle’ behavioral parameter achieved the highest HIR accuracy of 98.61 %.

Modern translation systems can now analyse and analyse spoken or written language with amazing speed and accuracy thanks to the use of potent AI models, such as machine learning and neural networks. In contrast to conventional techniques, these systems enable more nuanced and contextually relevant translations by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to comprehend context, syntax, and semantics. Real-time translation systems are being incorporated more and more into industries including international business, education, healthcare, and travel. Examples of these techniques include wearable technology, AI-powered mobile apps, and speech recognition software.

    "abstract": "To achieve smoother torque output and further improve permanent magnet synchronous motor(PMSM) performance, this paper proposes a non-uniform air gap structure for torque ripple suppression. Specifically, the rotor profile is optimized to realize a sinusoidal air gap magnetic field distribution, which in turn suppresses torque ripple. Two non-uniform air gap configurations—direct circular arc cutting and segmented arc eccentricity—are comparatively analyzed. Based on the segmented arc eccentricity configuration, a parametric study of the eccentricity of rotor segmented arcs is carried out to clarify the effect of different eccentricities on the motor's electromagnetic performance. Subsequently, the optimal eccentric design is obtained by adjusting the eccentricity value and eccentric angle. The finite element method (FEM) is utilized to simulate and compare the air gap flux density, back electromotive force (Back-EMF), and torque ripple. Simulation results indicate that the torque ripple of the optimized motor is reduced by 72.2%. Finally, a prototype is fabricated, and experimental measurements are in good agreement with simulation data, confirming the correctness and feasibility of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "To address the issue of temperature non-uniformity in lithium-ion batteries under high-rate discharge conditions (5C and 7C), this study proposes and investigates a composite cooling strategy based on gradient porous metal foam combined with phase change material (PCM) to enhance both temperature uniformity and thermal stability of the battery system. The results demonstrate that, compared to pure PCM, the gradient porous metal foam-supported composite PCM not only reduces the maximum temperature difference but also shortens the phase change duration, thereby enabling a faster thermal response. Specifically, under 5C and 7C discharge rates, the reverse gradient design (with a gradient index of n = 2) reduces the maximum temperature difference by an average of 36.1% and 52.9%, respectively, compared to the pure PCM cooling scheme, indicating its strong capability to suppress temperature differences and significantly improve temperature uniformity under high-rate discharge conditions. Further analysis reveals that the flow rate of the liquid cooling plate also plays a crucial role in the thermal management performance. An appropriate flow rate can minimize the maximum temperature difference while ensuring the latent heat absorption capacity of the PCM, thus achieving optimal temperature uniformity for the lithium-ion battery."

    "abstract": "Image restoration is a crucial task in computer vision, and Transformer-based models like Restormer have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance, particularly in removing continuous noise such as Gaussian noise. Although their performance remains reasonably robust, Restormer are not fully optimized for non-continuous, high-frequency distortions such as impulse noise. This is attributed to their architectural characteristics, which focus on learning global context and are vulnerable to the extreme pixel value variance introduced by impulse noise. In this paper, we propose the Frequency Aware Restormer (FA-Restormer), a novel dualpath architecture designed to enhance robustness against impulse noise. While preserving the original Restormer’s spatial domain processing path, we introduce a parallel, memoryefficient frequency domain processing path that transforms the image into frequency domain to effectively filter noise patterns using a convolution block. The outputs from both paths are then intelligently integrated using an attention-based fusion module. Experimental results on standard denoising benchmarks (Set12, BSD68, Urban100) show that the proposed FA-Restormer consistently outperforms the baseline Restormer for impulse noise image restoration, validating the effectiveness of our hybrid spatial and frequency domain approach."

    "abstract": "Change point detection is the task of specifying sudden changes in the distribution of bit timing data. Real-life timing data acquisition is susceptible to noise and other interference in the environment, resulting in a decrease in the detection accuracy of the change-point detection algorithm. If the original timing data is smoothed and filtered, it is easy to lose effective data features. In addition, algorithms that only model the time domain information of the timing data also have a certain impact on the detection accuracy of change points due to the lack of effective information that can be extracted. To alleviate these problems, this paper proposes a change-point detection algorithm based on unsupervised adversarial autoencoders with time-frequency analysis. A time-frequency analysis framework is introduced based on dual autoencoders, which combines time and frequency domain features to extract potential feature representations of the original timing data, and information such as potential periodicity and frequency components of the data can be obtained while enriching the data features. Unsupervised adversarial training is then utilized to improve the robustness of the model against interference, such as noise in the real environment, and reduce the false alarm rate. Experimental results show that the algorithm achieves excellent detection accuracy on the public datasets USC-HAD and HASC."

This review surveys AI deployment in offensive and defensive roles across kinetic battlefields and digital domains, examines shifting geopolitical dynamics and ethical debates, evaluates security risks and vulnerabilities, and extrapolates emerging trends. AI-enabled targeting systems, autonomous drones, and cyber defense platforms saw practical use in disputes (Ukraine, Middle East), offering unprecedented speed and efficiency while introducing vulnerabilities including adversarial attacks, algorithmic bias, and eroded accountability. Major powers accelerated AI integration, driving a global arms race. Simultaneously, urgent ethical and legal questions arose about autonomous lethal decision-making. AI tools unveiled capabilities for strengthening defenses and enabling new offensive tactics like automated malware generation, enhancing the AI attacker-defender duel. Looking ahead, generative AI, multidomain hybrid warfare, and fully autonomous systems will transform warfare while policymakers grapple with ensuring meaningful human control and international law compliance."

This approach enhances the accuracy of predictions and efficiency of decision-making when investing in venture capital by integrating the use of the sentiment analysis using LSTM with the use of traditional financial models.

However, the lack of pixel-level labels and the difficulty of accurately detecting object boundaries in thermal scenes limit the performance of traditional supervised methods. We present InfraRedSeg, a point-guided segmentation framework that combines a vision-language model with a zero-shot segmentation module. Qwen2.5-VL is used to generate semantic point prompts, which are passed to SAM2 for initial mask prediction. To improve point selection, we apply a reinforcement learning strategy (Group Relative Policy Optimization, GRPO) that iteratively refines Qwen’s behavior through multi-round feedback. We further introduce a dual-point prompting mechanism (positive + negative) to improve foreground-background discrimination and mask quality. To address annotation scarcity, we construct a large-scale pseudo-segmentation dataset from the WIT-UAS benchmark using our proposed framework. This pipeline enables high-quality mask generation from bounding-box annotations with minimal human intervention. Extensive experimentation with our dataset supports the superior performance of our method. Our results show that integrating multimodal prompting with reinforcement learning offers an effective solution for infrared segmentation under zero-shot or low-data conditions."

First, the trend and correlation functions are constructed to incorporate both qualitative and quantitative factors. Regularized terms on regression coefficients and correlation parameters are introduced as penalties to simultaneously screen significant qualitative and quantitative factors. Subsequently, an iterative algorithm is presented to solve for the maximum likelihood estimation of the model parameters. In this process, a cross-validated grid search algorithm is employed to compute the regularization parameters of the penalty function. While a nested optimization algorithm is used to determine the regression coefficients and correlation parameters of the Kriging model. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm is validated on five commonly used benchmark numerical functions. The results demonstrate that the proposed method addresses the problem of surrogate modeling with mixed qualitative and quantitative factors and significantly improves model accuracy compared to other types of Kriging models."

We use Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) to analyse and visualise feature importance in neural distinguishers, giving signed contributions and absolute rankings. Signed contributions show whether, and how strongly, specific bit positions influence the model's decision, while absolute rankings reflect their importance regardless of sign. To study interactions beyond single bits, we introduce a Systematic Masking Approach to reveal relations among bits by testing if chosen combinations of masked bits alter classification accuracy. On Gohr's 8-round SPECK32/64 distinguisher, masking up to four-bit combinations shows that decisions involve multi-bit interactions rather than isolated single-bit effects. Although LIME highlights strong single-bit signals, masking reveals interaction patterns consistent with differential cryptanalysis. These findings clarify model behaviour in neural cryptanalysis and show XAI's value for exposing and visualising interaction structure in ciphertext features and decisions."

Herein, the spatial light distribution of a laser-driven phosphor-in-glass film (PiGF) with a transmissive type was systematically studied for the first time, and its spatial light uniformity was enhanced by integrating an aluminum reflective cup. The YAG:Ce PiGFs with various thicknesses were printed and sintered on sapphire substrates. The PiGF was tightly bonded on the sapphire and maintains a high quantum yield (QY) of 91.9%. With the increase in PiGF thickness, the luminous flux of laser-driven PiGFs initially increases and then decreases, while the correlated color temperature (CCT) gradually decreases. The spatial irradiance and CCT of common laser-driven PiGFs show a strong central peak and rapid radial attenuation. By integrating the aluminum reflective cup, the laser-driven PiGFs emit white laser light with uniform irradiance. The related CCT increases from 6164 K at 0° to 9493 K at 25°, corresponding to a balanced warm-to-cold white emission. The work provides valuable guidance for testing and optimizing of spatial light distribution in high-brightness laser-driven lighting."

    "abstract": "Accurate and efficient extraction of thin-film transistor (TFT) parameters is critical for large-scale device characterization. However, manual methods are time-consuming, and existing machine learning approaches often generalize poorly across different TFT types. To address this, we propose a deep learning (DL) model that casts the TFT transfer curve as a time series for automated parameter extraction in both linear and saturation regimes. Trained on a diverse dataset encompassing indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO) and both p- and n-type organic TFTs, the model demonstrates strong generalizability across these distinct semiconductor technologies. The model employs a recurrent sequence network to extract sequential features from the TFT transfer curve, followed by fully connected layers for parameter prediction. After benchmarking various architectures, a gated recurrent unit (GRU)-based network is selected as the optimal backbone. The model achieves superior performance on linear-regime TFTs, with average relative errors of 0.72% in threshold voltage, 6.81% in subthreshold swing (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">SS</i>), and 4.27% in mobility; for saturation-regime TFTs, the corresponding errors are 1.38%, 10.74%, and 9.79%, respectively, outperforming other data-driven baselines. Furthermore, we integrate instrument control, device classification, and parameter extraction into a unified software interface to enable fully automated measurement. This work offers a scalable solution for industrial TFT array characterization, effectively bridging the gap between physics-based modeling and data-driven automation."

    "abstract": "Missing data remain a critical challenge in data analysis, often leading to biased estimates and reduced reliability. Many imputation methods, operating under the assumption that similar instances share similar feature values, overlook the pivotal role of the feature associated with the missing value. Consequently, they apply uniform strategies to all missing values within an instance, often resulting in suboptimal neighbor sets and less accurate predictions. In this paper, we adopt a structural causal perspective to examine data imputation, revealing that once the target feature guides neighbor selection, it acts as a confounder and biases subsequent missing-value estimations. Building on this insight, we propose Structural Causal Imputation (SCImputation), a strategy that leverages both instance-level and feature-level information to refine neighbor selection, and applies a back-door adjustment formula that reweights local estimates with the global distribution, thereby mitigating the confounding introduced by the target feature. We integrate SCImputation with KNNimpute and LLSimpute, and evaluate the resulting variants on five datasets (NACC, three NCBI microarrays, and the Turkiye Student Evaluation) with ablation studies. In comparative evaluations against 12 baselines, SCImputation achieves 3.0%–4.6% gains in accuracy and 0.009–0.059 reductions in RMSE over the established approaches, and demonstrates competitive performance against leading deep learning baselines across diverse missingness mechanisms. These results suggest that SCImputation provides a causally grounded strategy for data imputation in both biomedical and general applications."

    "abstract": "The phase derived from the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is a critical parameter for soil moisture (SM) monitoring with the Global Navigation Satellite System Interferometric Reflectometry (GNSS-IR) technique. While most existing studies have focused on the impact of environmental factors on phase estimation, little attention has been paid to non-environmental phase biases. For the first time, this study provides a detailed analysis of two non-environmental phase bias sources: one arising from the nonlinear least squares (NLS) estimation method and the other from satellite revisit trajectory variations. To mitigate the two phase biases, we propose a reparameterized phase estimation (RPE) method and an adjacent-day SNR correlation-based phase bias correction (ASC-PBC) method. Their performance is evaluated using nearly one year of in situ observations from four GNSS stations with varying topography and vegetation cover. Experimental results demonstrate that the RPE method provides more stable and accurate phase estimates than the conventional NLS method, thereby enhancing SM retrieval accuracy. Specifically, the NLS method only yields 12 satellite trajectories with phase–SM correlation coefficients above 0.5, while the RPE method produces 34, a nearly twofold increase. Accordingly, the root mean square error (RMSE) of SM retrieved by each trajectory decreases from 0.068 cm3/cm3 to 0.058 cm3/cm3, with the mean absolute error (MAE) declining from 0.056 cm3/cm3 to 0.046 cm3/cm3. Meanwhile, the ASC-PBC method reduces the RMSE of SM retrieved from the trajectories affected by satellite revisit trajectory variations by 4.3%–10.9% and the MAE by 4.0%–13.2%. Overall, after mitigating the non-environmental phase biases, the average RMSE and MAE of SM retrieved from all trajectories at four stations decrease by 25.6% and 23.5%, respectively. This confirms that the performance of GNSS-IR-based SM retrieval can be significantly improved by mitigating non-environmental phase biases, even in a complex observation environment."

    "abstract": "Change detection from high-resolution remote sensing images lies as a cornerstone of Earth observation applications, yet its efficacy is often compromised by two critical challenges. First, false alarms are prevalent as models misinterpret radiometric variations from temporal shifts (e.g., illumination, season) as genuine changes. Second, a non-negligible semantic gap between deep abstract features and shallow detail-rich features tends to obstruct their effective fusion, culminating in poorly delineated boundaries. To step further in addressing these issues, we propose the Frequency-Spatial Synergistic Gated Network (FSG-Net), a novel paradigm that aims to systematically disentangle semantic changes from nuisance variations. Specifically, FSG-Net first operates in the frequency domain, where a Discrepancy-Aware Wavelet Interaction Module (DAWIM) adaptively mitigates pseudo-changes by discerningly processing different frequency components. Subsequently, the refined features are enhanced in the spatial domain by a Synergistic Temporal-Spatial Attention Module (STSAM), which amplifies the saliency of genuine change regions. To finally bridge the semantic gap, a Lightweight Gated Fusion Unit (LGFU) leverages high-level semantics to selectively gate and integrate crucial details from shallow layers. Comprehensive experiments on the CDD, GZ-CD, and LEVIR-CD benchmarks validate the superiority of FSG-Net, establishing a new state-of-the-art with F1-scores of 94.16%, 89.51%, and 91.27%, respectively. The code will be made available at https://github.com/zxXie-Air/FSG-Net after a possible publication."

    "abstract": "Conventional adaptive dynamic beam steering schemes suffer from excessive complexity, large volume, and high power consumption. Meanwhile, dynamically tunable metasurfaces lack mature material systems optimized for high frequency terahertz (THz) operation, restricting their practical application. To solve these limitations, we propose a polarization multiplexed cascaded metasurface (PMCM) for adaptive THz beam steering. The joint phase distribution of this design strategy is realized via the linear superposition of the phase distributions of the two cascaded layers, which obviates the need for complex local phase adjustment using active components. One with rectangular pillars enable spin-decoupled phase modulation, allowing lens phases, gradient phases, and vortex phases to be embedded in orthogonal circular polarization (CP) channels; the other type is cylindrical dielectric pillars, which are used to maintain polarization-insensitive propagation phase control. By controlling the rotation angle between layers, not only can dynamically beam steering within each independent polarization channel be achieved, but the movement trajectory of the focused spot on the focal plane can also be further regulated. The experimental results obtained based on the probe-type near-field imaging system are in good agreement with the simulation results, with a measured maximum displacement difference of up to 4.23λ within the target rotation range and an average focal length of 8.8 mm. This low cost, multi-dimensional solution paves the way for compact integrated THz systems for high-precision applications such as real-time reconfigurable imaging."

Traditional calibration methods employ different mathematical models to correct intrinsic parameter errors. However, these methods rely on fitting the observations and are constrained by ambiguous physical interpretations, failing to satisfy the requirements of high-precision applications. To address this problem, a novel star sensor calibration method is proposed in this paper. Based on the wavefront properties, a new physical model is developed to characterize the imaging coordinates of star spots as affected by intrinsic parameters. Subsequently, a corresponding parameter model is derived using Zernike polynomials to relate wavefront aberrations to intrinsic parameter errors, providing a clear physical interpretation for their sources. In addition, a multi-order sequential optimization strategy is designed for parameter calibration to obtain better calibration results. Experimental results confirmed the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed method for different star sensors. Compared with traditional calibration methods, the proposed method achieves better calibration accuracy with fewer parameters and lower parameter orders."

    "abstract": "Fatigued driving is a major societal risk factor in the road safety system, affecting the efficiency of the entire transportation network and public safety. Fatigue detection methods based on multimodal physiological signals can objectively reflect a driver’s neurocognitive state, offering higher monitoring reliability. However, existing methods face two main challenges: 1) the high cost of annotating high-quality physiological signals leads to challenges in learning with limited data; and 2) the signal-to-noise ratio of multimodal physiological signals is variable, leading to imbalances in the confidence in the decision between modalities. To address these issues, this article proposes the meta-evidential dual-stream network (MEDS-Net), which integrates a meta-learning framework with evidential deep learning to establish a solution for driver fatigue detection for the first time. Specifically, MEDS-Net employs a dual-stream evidence generation network to extract heterogeneous features from multimodal physiological signals and uses a Dirichlet distribution to quantify cognitive uncertainty for each modality. Additionally, MEDS-Net introduces a meta-learning framework to enhance the model’s ability to handle data scarcity through the design of task simulation mechanisms and a two-layer optimization strategy. Extensive experiments on the SEED-VIG dataset demonstrate that MEDS-Net outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in terms of effectiveness and generalizability. Furthermore, MEDS-Net can precisely quantify the importance of global features in explaining modal contributions and average activation patterns."

    "abstract": "In the low earth orbit (LEO) mega-constellation, dynamically reconstructing resources to enhance the on-orbit efficiency and flexibility of payloads remains a critical challenge. Network slicing (NS), a core concept in 5G communications, offers a promising solution by deploying end-to-end customized and logically isolated virtual networks over shared infrastructures. However, existing methods overlook the survivability of satellite nodes and the impact of load balancing of satellites and inter-satellite links (ISLs) on subsequent slicing processes. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-stage survivable NS (MS-SNS) method based on load balancing for LEO mega-constellations. The method adopts a hybrid heuristic-reinforcement learning (RL) framework, decomposing the problem into multiple stages. First, a multi-constraint “load coefficient” indicator is proposed for constellation target area planning and selection using a greedy algorithm. Second, a soft actor-critic (SAC)-based algorithm is proposed for slice mapping within the selected target region. Finally, a survivable NS remapping algorithm is proposed, where a multi-constraint “remapping cost” indicator is proposed to guide the selection of remappable LEO satellite nodes, ensuring service continuity during node failures. Extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of MS-SNS."

    "abstract": "Accurate non-invasive characterization of complex brain dynamics, especially aberrant network activity in epilepsy, is crucial yet challenging due to the invasiveness of iEEG and limitations of noninvasive MEG. We introduce DiffLSTM-MTE, a novel deep learning framework that reconstructs virtual iEEG (ViEEG) from MEG recordings. This framework synergistically integrates an LSTM for temporal modeling of MEG with a conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) for synthesizing realistic iEEG. Our physiologically-informed training objective incorporates losses for noise prediction, spectral fidelity, and Interictal Epileptiform Discharges (IEDs) preservation. Evaluated on data from five epilepsy patients, DiffLSTM-MTE demonstrates high temporal fidelity (mean Pearson <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R</i> = 0.71 ± 0.08), preserves spectral characteristics (The mean PSD RMSE is < 0.071), reconstructs spatial coherence (mean correlation 0.92 ± 0.04), and accurately characterizes IEDs (76% ± 7% alignment). These results highlight DiffLSTM-MTE’s potential as a non-invasive tool to enhance epilepsy diagnostics and pre-surgical assessment by providing richer, patient-specific neurophysiological insights."

    "abstract": "Accurate state of energy (SOE) estimation of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is critical for providing feedback on the remaining range of electric vehicles, which is one of the most concerning metrics for drivers. The power integration (PI) method is a simple approach for SOE estimation and serves as the foundation for other modeling techniques. The performance of the PI method, however, is limited by its cumulative error. To tackle this issue, this article proposes an SOE estimation method with energy compensation, and the method employs a data-driven approach to reduce the cumulative error of the PI method. The causes of the cumulative error are first analyzed, and a variable maximum energy metric is presented to improve the accuracy of the cumulative discharge energy calculation. The parameters characterizing the energy errors between the maximum energy and the reference energy are extracted via data-driven methods. To use data-driven parameters for reducing cumulative error, an energy-compensated SOE estimation method is proposed by designing the scaling mechanism that considers multiple discharge factors. In addition, a dropout technique is introduced into the compensation method to prevent overcorrection under unknown working conditions. The experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method under complex working conditions, with satisfactory estimation results."

This work presents a receding horizon control framework for optimizing heat production in district energy systems under real-world operational conditions. The proposed controller minimizes production costs while considering electricity market prices, which significantly affect the economic performance of heat generation units. The system coordinates multiple heterogeneous generation assets under mixed-integer programming constraints. To support the controller, we develop a forecasting framework that combines transformer and gated recurrent unit (GRU) architectures to improve prediction accuracy. This hybrid model utilizes multivariate input features, including ambient temperature and historical thermal output, to generate robust and probabilistic forecasts. The Transformer captures long-range dependencies in the data, while the GRU models temporal sequences and cyclical behavior. Experimental results on real-world data demonstrate that this method can reduce total operational costs by 16.3% and enhance resource efficiency in thermal energy production, providing a scalable solution for smart energy management."

Tidal energy is highly predictable, stable, and environmentally friendly, offering a reliable alternative to conventional energy sources like coal and natural gas, which are often subject to price volatility and environmental concerns. The study focuses on the Visayas region, a prime candidate for tidal energy development due to its dense population centers, major seaports, and high energy consumption. Integrating tidal energy into the national grid could reduce the Philippines' reliance on fossil fuels and lower carbon emissions. This research explores tidal stream turbines' potential, addressing challenges like maritime traffic and environmental considerations, while suggesting strategies for overcoming these obstacles.

This study proceeds to survey the impact of the three pillars of sustainable education (including economic, social, and environmental sustainability) on students' Sustainable Futures Orientation, while analyzing the moderating role of Artificial Intelligence Application (AIA). Using a quantitative survey design, data were collected from 251 university students in Can Tho, Vietnam, and analyzed using SPSS through Cronbach’s Alpha reliability tests, Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), multiple linear regression, and moderation techniques. The results reveal that all three sustainability pillars positively and significantly affect Sustainable Futures, with Environmental and Social Sustainability showing the strongest influences. However, the moderating effect of AI is negative and statistically significant, suggesting that excessive or unstructured AI use may weaken the positive impact of sustainability education. The study extends the theoretical framework of Education for Sustainable Development by introducing AI as a moderating variable, highlighting the need for ethical and reflective AI integration in higher education. It provides practical implications for educators and policymakers to design curricula that balance technological efficiency with humanistic and ethical values, fostering interdisciplinary learning for sustainable development."

    "abstract": "The complexity of modern networked environments has increased the risk of advanced cyber threats, making effective Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) essential. Deep learning has improved anomaly detection, but many models still lack robustness and interpretability. We propose the Hierarchical Feature-Splitting Variational Autoencoder (HFS-VAE), a novel architecture that partitions network features into semantic groups and encodes them through parallel branches, followed by classifier fusion. This design enhances transparency in the latent space and improves anomaly localization compared to conventional VAEs. Experiments on CICIDS2017 demonstrate an Average Precision of 0.8412 and an F1-score of 0.7463, while tests on NSL-KDD confirm adaptability with an AP of 0.9234 and an F1 of 0.7371. Robustness is validated through PCA-based latent visualizations, Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), and boundary complexity analysis. Although recall remains lower than precision in some cases and evaluation is limited to CICIDS2017 and NSL-KDD, HFS-VAE provides a practical balance of interpretability and accuracy. Compared with prior approaches, it achieves competitive detection performance and superior anomaly separation, offering a structured and interpretable solution for enterprise-scale cybersecurity."

To complement this setup, a neoTRNG-based ring oscillator RNG is incorporated to enhance the randomness of the generated numbers. By combining these elements, the CSRNG can achieve a high level of unpredictability crucial for cryptographic applications. Moving to the system's backend, utilizing the BLAKE2s hash function is pivotal in counteracting any potential biases introduced by the frontend components. This hashing function ensures that the output random numbers remain robust and secure, free from discernible patterns or vulnerabilities. In essence, the methodology outlined in this paper offers a comprehensive guide to conceptualizing and implementing a cost-effective CSRNG. The challenges inherent in generating cryptographically secure random numbers can be effectively navigated through a meticulous integration of hardware components and cryptographic techniques.

The study focuses on predicting petrophysical properties in reservoir characterization, a real-world regression problem. A ResNet model, pre-trained on a related classification task within the domain, is adapted to regression by transferring learned parameters. This imposes an inductive bias that enhances model generalization. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves regression performance compared to conventional approaches, particularly in lowdata conditions.

    "abstract": "Photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals are highly susceptible to motion artifacts, baseline wander, and powerline interference, which severely degrade the accuracy of physiological and heart rate variability (HRV) analysis. Conventional filtering techniques such as Butterworth, Savitzky-Golay, Moving Average, and Wavelet filters often fail to remove complex noise components and preserve the fine morphological features of PPG waveforms. To address this limitation, this paper proposes an attentionenhanced one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1DCNN) for robust PPG signal denoising. Synthetic PPG data were generated using a MATLAB-based double Gaussian model that emulates systolic, diastolic, and dicrotic peaks, with controlled noise sources added to simulate real-world conditions. The proposed encoder-decoder CNN incorporates attention mechanisms and an HRV-preserving loss to maintain both temporal and spectral fidelity. The model outperforms classical filters, as demonstrated by performance evaluation on synthetic, public, and locally collected datasets. On synthetic data, it achieves an average SNR of 27.88 dB, RMSE of 0.012, PRD of $4.58 \\%$, and correlation of 0.998, while maintaining high fidelity on real-world datasets with SNR up to 48.93 dB. Additionally, frequency-domain analysis revealed moderate retention in the powerline and high-frequency bands and strong preservation in the low-frequency band. The model’s capacity to suppress noise without altering cardiovascular dynamics was validated by HRV parameter analysis, which also confirmed that SDNN had minimal preservation errors. These findings validate the suggested CNN as a successful denoising framework for precise and trustworthy physiological monitoring based on PPG."

Therefore, in order to achieve accurate modeling of drone flight energy consumption, discrete drone movement variables are difficult to apply. This article considers the movement variables of unmanned aerial vehicles as continuous variables (flight direction and speed), and designs trajectory planning and unloading strategies for unmanned aerial vehicles to optimize the overall energy efficiency of the system. This article models the weighted sum of total energy consumption of drones and equipment as the optimization objective. In order to achieve flexible and accurate movement control of drones and model their energy consumption, the movement variables are relaxed into continuous variables. This problem is a long-term stochastic optimization problem and belongs to mixed integer nonlinear programming. As the action space increases, centralized learning algorithms require an increase in network complexity, making it difficult for the algorithm to converge. Therefore, a distributed federated learning architecture is adopted for network training, and model parameter sharing is used to promote network convergence. After distributed training, the network model at each drone can make independent real-time decisions. Finally, the proposed algorithm is validated through simulation experiments."

    "abstract": "Although existing diffusion Transformer-based video generation models can synthesize high-quality dynamic portraits, they still face significant challenges in maintaining identity consistency across long sequences. We identify that the root cause lies in the model’s difficulty in decoupling stable identity features (such as facial structure) from transient appearance details (such as lighting and expressions) in reference images. To address this issue, we propose a lightweight Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) module based on Facial Structure Injection, which can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained video generation models in a plug-and-play manner. Specifically, we first construct a portrait video-text dataset containing one million samples. Subsequently, we extract and render a \"structure map\" from the reference image that contains only the core facial topology, thereby eliminating the interference of appearance information. Finally, this structure map is utilized to guide the LoRA module, providing explicit and stable geometric priors to the base model at each step of the denoising process. Without any modifications to the large foundation model, our approach achieves significant improvements in identity preservation metrics by training only our compact LoRA module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method enhances identity consistency while maintaining the original model’s robust video fidelity and text controllability, providing a practical, efficient, and scalable solution for addressing identity drift issues in controllable portrait generation."

    "abstract": "To address challenges in professional-domain image classification tasks, such as labeled data scarcity, limited computing resources, and high deployment thresholds, this paper proposes a lightweight image classification method based on the TensorFlow.js framework. By integrating data augmentation, transfer learning, and model compression techniques, the method establishes a complete technical workflow. This workflow includes intelligent image preprocessing, configurable convolutional neural network (CNN) model training, real-time classification inference, and cross-platform model migration. The core innovation lies in the implementation of end-to-end model training and deployment within a web browser environment, thereby effectively reducing the technical and resource thresholds for AI applications in professional domains. Application validation in typical scenarios — including geographic information recognition and preliminary medical image screening — demonstrates that the method not only ensures classification accuracy but also significantly enhances system convenience and scalability. It thus provides a feasible lightweight solution for the intelligent upgrading of professional domains."

    "abstract": "Multimodal fake news detection has gained significant traction as deceptive content proliferates across diverse online platforms. Strategies that naively fuse visual and textual embeddings often fall prey to spurious correlations introduced by superficial image–text matching, resulting in erroneous predictions when semantics between modalities diverge. To address this, we introduce VLCF (Visual–Linguistic Causal Filtering), a novel framework that harnesses causal inference to deconfound each modality and enhance detection accuracy. VLCF comprises two bias correction modules: a visual bias correction module that disentangles confounding visual patterns through a combination of local patch sampling and global attention, and a textual bias correction module that mitigates contextual distortions using vocabulary calibration and cross-modal attention. During training, these modules implement front-door interventions to learn purified representations; at inference, the deconfounded visual and textual embeddings are integrated via a multimodal fusion layer for robust classification, effectively breaking the spurious link between surface image–text alignment and news veracity. We evaluate VLCF on two public benchmarks, demonstrating significant gains over state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy, F1-score, and AUC. Ablation studies and robustness tests confirm the individual and joint impact of each bias correction component."

    "abstract": "Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a condition that affects the coronary arteries. In this disease, the arteries become narrowed or blocked, reducing the blood supply to the heart. This can lead to serious complications such as heart attacks (myocardial infarctions), heart failure, and other cardiovascular issues. One of the major challenges in identifying CAD is that many patients may not exhibit explicit symptoms like chest pain. Instead, they may experience non-specific symptoms or silent ischemia, making early detection difficult. Moreover, diagnosing CAD using X-ray coronary angiography images poses additional challenges due to the complexity of the visual data.In this paper, we propose a solution using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for the diagnosis and prediction of region-based coronary artery disease. We also apply segmentation techniques and morphological operations to highlight the affected arteries in X-ray coronary angiography images. By utilizing CNNs, along with morphological operations such as dilation and segmentation techniques like thresholding, we aim to effectively process the angiographic image dataset. This approach enhances the accuracy of CAD detection and clearly highlights the affected regions in the images."

    "abstract": "Online question answering (QA) systems typically handle streaming data that evolves over time. The distribution of this data may vary, resulting in cross-temporal transfer and a decline in performance of online neural networks. Therefore, online QA models are typically designed to be smaller in scale to ensure quick response time. However, they are required to have better out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization when dealing with changing streaming data. On the contrary, large language models exhibit strong OOD generalization, but their response speed may slow down when faced with high-concurrency requests. A dynamic knowledge distillation framework is proposed in this paper to enhance the OOD generalization of small models under cross-temporal transfer, which dynamically extracts knowledge from a large pre-trained language model to provide guidance for training a much smaller model that is better suited for online deployment and rapid response. To showcase the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing the OOD generalization of small models in cross-temporal transfer scenarios, we collect a medical QA dataset named cMed2022. The distribution of its test sets differs from the dataset used to train the models. Experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement in OOD generalization of models through our method. Furthermore, by employing ensemble learning, the student models can match the teacher model on the extreme shifted dataset, with minimal increase in inference time."

However, prolonged operation with repeated exposures in localized regions leads to progressive film wear, which may compromise print quality. In this study, machine learning was applied to monitor and predict the health condition of the inhibiting film. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was adopted due to its suitability for image-based analysis. Images of the inhibiting film were captured and corrected prior to training. Initial training on the full dataset yielded limited accuracy due to illumination effects and the overrepresentation of healthy-film images. To mitigate these issues, data selection strategies were explored, including varying image acquisition locations and excluding early-layer images. Model performance, evaluated by MAE, <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathrm{R}^{\\mathrm{2}}$</tex>, and accuracy, improved notably when early-layer images (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$&lt;400$</tex> layers) were excluded.

Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS) have emerged as a promising solution to optimize energy consumption, reduce costs, and minimize environmental impact. These systems utilize advanced technologies and algorithms to monitor, control, and manage energy usage within households. Recent advancements in optimization techniques have introduced novel approaches to enhance the performance of HEMS. This paper explores the application of two powerful metaheuristic algorithms, the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) and the Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) algorithm. The objective of this paper is to minimize the energy consumption cost and simultaneously satisfy the operational constraints of residential appliances, which include demand limits, minimum usage frequency, and energy requirements. To meet the constraints, penalty functions are inculcated. The GWO, inspired by the social hierarchy and hunting behavior of grey wolves, and the HHO, which mimics the cooperative hunting strategy of Harris hawks, have shown promising results in optimizing the energy consumption cost by scheduling the loads effectively."

    "abstract": "Squirrel-cage Three-phase Asynchronous Motors are widely used, and frequent starting is often required in industrial production. Therefore, it is necessary to select the most suitable starting method based on specific industrial scenarios. This paper employs an empirical research method. Two typical starting methods for squirrel-cage three-phase asynchronous motors—direct starting and autotransformer reduced-voltage starting—were selected for comparison. Using MATLAB simulation software, motor starting control systems for direct starting and autotransformer reduced-voltage starting were separately established. Through the simulation platform, the curve characteristics of starting current, starting torque, and rotational speed during the two starting processes (direct starting and autotransformer reduced-voltage starting) were obtained. By comparing the starting performance of direct starting and autotransformer reduced-voltage starting, it was concluded that the starting current and torque of the autotransformer reduced-voltage starting are both lower than those of direct starting, while the rotational speed rises more slowly. Due to their distinct characteristics, direct starting and autotransformer reduced-voltage starting are suited for different application scenarios: the former, with its high starting current, is only suitable for low-capacity, light-load starts; the latter is applicable for high-load, infrequent starting operations."

Conventional droop control methods often fail to ensure accurate power sharing and voltage stability under these dynamic conditions. To overcome this, we propose an intelligent hybrid microgrid integrated with a novel control strategy. The methodology employs an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) to dynamically regulate the virtual impedance of inverter interfaces, thereby enhancing conventional droop control. This allows for communication-free, real-time coordination between solar photovoltaic and wind energy systems. Major findings from simulations confirm that the ANFIS-based controller delivers superior transient response, enhanced voltage stability, and more accurate reactive power sharing compared to conventional and fuzzy-based methods, while simultaneously ensuring MPPT and power quality. The significance of this study lies in validating a robust, intelligent control framework that is particularly suitable for off-grid and remote applications, providing a resilient and efficient solution for leveraging high-penetration renewable energy in dynamically varying environments."

Each method entails data cleansing, entity extraction and relation identification that results into a knowledge graph whose entities are nodes while the edges are relationships that connect those nodes together. Different techniques help visualize these networks clearly. Users may query the knowledge base using languages such as NetworkX and Cypher which allows them to pose natural language questions thereby improving health-related text mining through enhanced search and analysis."

    "abstract": "Being somewhat natural and hands-free, voicecontrolled systems are gaining high importance in humancomputer interaction. This paper discusses the design and implementation of a voice-activated scheduling system on an Intel Cyclone-IV Field Programmable Gate Array hardware platform. Setting alarms or reminders by voice commands is converted into text by a custom-created Python speech-to-text framework and is sent to the FPGA board for further processing using serial communication over UART. The Cyclone-IV FPGA receives the times of setting, decodes them, stores them momentarily, and compares them continuously with its internal system clock; when a match occurs, it signals an alarm. Intuitive voice commands fused with deterministic parallel processing power of FPGA hardware gives rise to a dependable scheduling system capable of real-time operations. Simulation was done to verify the system, and then the implementation was carried out on a Cyclone-IV board to prove that the design is sound, accurate, and efficient during operation."

In our model, CNN extracts local features. BLSTM learns bidirectional dependencies. GRU further improves temporal feature learning for better accuracy. Evaluations on public Bit-brain and Alibaba datasets show our model outperforms several baselines.

    "abstract": "Power system state estimation is highly sensitive to the quality of input data, particularly in distribution grids where consumer-driven load variability can introduce significant discrepancies between expected and actual power usage. Traditional residual-based detection methods, including classical cumulative sum (CUSUM), often misclassify these natural fluctuations as anomalies due to their reliance on static baselines and lack of normalization. This study proposes an enhanced anomaly detection framework that integrates Future Load Profile Nominations (FLPNs) into a modified two-sided CUSUM structure. The method evaluates normalized residuals relative to time-aware, user-declared load expectations, and incorporates drift compensation to suppress the accumulation of small benign deviations. Simulation results on the IEEE 14-bus system across 100 trials revealed that the Modified CUSUM with FLPN achieved up to 82% reduction in false alarm rate and up to 69% reduction in missed detection rate compared to traditional CUSUM (without FLPN) approach. This underscores the efficacy of integrating FLPNs and normalization in enhancing anomaly detection performance under dynamic consumer load behavior."

    "abstract": "RF-DNA, just like human fingerprints, is a unique signal feature with a certain degree of temporal stability inherent in each individual RF radiation source. It can serve as an identity marker for RF devices and boasts the advantage of being difficult to forge, thus holding broad application prospects in fields such as national defense security and civil communications. However, in practical applications, RF fingerprints are highly susceptible to the influence of factors like wireless fading channels, which leads to a decline in recognition accuracy. To address the aforementioned issue, this paper proposes an RF fingerprint recognition method based on a Domain Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) in wireless channels. This method adds a domain discriminator branch to the traditional IQ-GRU model. By constructing a DANN deep learning model, it directly extracts RF fingerprints from IQ signals and performs automatic 13features and time-domain features contained therein to improve recognition accuracy. Additionally, a gradient reversal layer is employed to confuse source domain samples and target domain samples, enabling the mapping of both types of samples to the same feature space. This approach can enhance the performance of RF fingerprint recognition in wireless fading channels without the need for prior knowledge of the signals. Experimental results demonstrate that this method can achieve an RF fingerprint recognition accuracy of 91.75% in wireless fading channels."

    "abstract": "To address the issues of insufficient self-healing capability, high computational complexity, and poor engineering applicability in traditional distribution network topology optimization, this paper proposes a modular topology optimization technology for distribution networks based on graph theory and graph search. The technology decomposes the optimization process into four core modules: spanning tree genetic optimization, BFS-based path combination, XML/SVG standardized modeling, and GIS spatial fusion, realizing full-process optimization from algorithm design to engineering visualization. Specifically, the spanning tree genetic optimization module uses Kruskal algorithm for valid tree screening and multi-objective genetic algorithm for optimization, maximizing load recovery while ensuring N-1 security; the BFS-based path combination module simplifies the topology by merging electrical zones and generates a limited reconstruction structure set to reduce the solution space; the XML/SVG modeling module extends core tags to uniformly describe equipment parameters, spanning tree status, and path combination information; the GIS fusion module achieves \"geography-logic\" integrated display through bidirectional data synchronization. Experiments on IEEE-33 node and 64-node actual distribution network systems show that compared with traditional methods (BPSO, heuristic algorithm), the proposed technology reduces active power loss by over 31.2%, increases node voltage by 7.73%, shortens solution time by more than 80%, and compresses the topology decision space from 215 to 26 feasible structures. It effectively balances optimization performance and engineering applicability, providing a reliable technical solution for the digital transformation of distribution networks in highdensity power supply areas."

As solar photovoltaic (PV) systems and battery storage systems (BESS) proliferate, their contribution toward increasing system resilience and offering frequency response is becoming critical. This research focuses on frequency regulation and assesses how BESS increases stability by modifying the droop coefficient in primary frequency control. We present a simulation-based analysis for different droop settings and construct a BESS sizing algorithm to mitigate a 0.5 Hz frequency dip and advocate a partial load-shedding approach with BESS aid. In addition, the integration of PV systems contributed to a significant reduction in the required size of the BESS, as the PV systems were able to directly supply a portion of the energy demand. The findings demonstrate that adaptive droop improves frequency response, optimal BESS size enhances energy efficiency, and load-shedding with BESS support reduces the burden of excessive load shedding to increase reliability and balance in the system."

However, deep learning-based wildfire extraction typically depends on large quantities of training samples to achieve good performance. Existing methods face challenges in fully learning deep semantic features of parcels when training samples are limited or in complex scenarios. This leads to poor extraction results in scenarios with blurred fire boundaries, smoke obscurity, and abundant terrain features. To address this challenge, we propose a multi-task dual-branch network (DBNet) based on the visual foundation model Fast-SAM, capable of extracting precise wildfire boundaries from complex mountain imagery. DBNet utilizes Fast-SAM to extract rich deep semantic features of wildfires. These features are then used as inputs to the mask prediction branch and boundary prediction branch. We developed a Boundary Prior-Guided Module (BPM) to refine wildfire contours. We also developed a Multi-Scale Feature Enhancement Module (MFEM) to enhance wildfire recognition across varying shapes and sizes. We evaluated our approach on the Fire-Segmentation-Dataset. Results show that DBNet exhibits the highest attribute accuracy and lowest geometric error. Our method effectively extracts wildfires of varying sizes, shapes, and spectral characteristics, even under conditions of limited sample."

Real-time crop development, patterns of weather and health of soil monitoring are made measurable by IoT-based sensor networks, which facilitate quicker and more effective farm operations.

The collection includes vital soil parameters required for the best crop growth as well as important climate variables like temperature, humidity, and rainfall. The goal is to create precise models that can forecast crop production by using sophisticated ML methods and Robotics on this dataset.

    "abstract": "The current Internet architecture based on IP addresses to identify routers and hosts is inefficient for large-scale content delivery. Named Data Networking (NDN), proposed as a future Internet architecture, enables efficient data dissemination through name-based data forwarding and in-network caching. A key challenge in realizing NDN lies in the fast processing of Longest Name Prefix Match (LNPM) operation for Forwarding Information Base (FIB), given variable-length hierarchical names. A Name Prefix Trie (NPT) conventionally used for name lookup results in increased trie depth and empty nodes as the number of name components increases, leading to inefficiencies in both memory usage and lookup latency. A Binary Search Tree (BST), which eliminates empty nodes by comparing the magnitudes of variable-length prefixes, encounters degraded lookup performance due to the structural imbalance of the tree. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a Weighted Binary Search Tree (WBST), which selects a pivot based on the cumulative weights of prefixes, where the weight of each prefix is derived from prefix nesting relationships. This enables balanced tree construction, and hence the average depth of the tree and lookup cost are reduced. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms both NPT and BST in terms of memory efficiency and lookup performance."

Previous research focused on measuring the similarity between speech embeddings related to emotion or prosody, which may not accurately capture the emotional contents. This study proposes more direct approaches by evaluating emotion preservation using metrics derived from speech emotion recognition (SER), including balanced accuracy ratio, emotion preservation rate, and Cohen's Kappa. The results show that about half of the original emotion is preserved in the translation process in the MELD-ST dataset, with metrics such as balanced accuracy ratio, valence-arousal similarity, and pause rate serving as reliable indicators of emotion preservation. We also found that high similarities between emotion embeddings do not necessarily mean emotion preservation, since the same acoustic embeddings used for SER lead to distinct performance. The analysis highlights the challenges of maintaining emotional consistency during speech-to-speech translation."

Manufacturers typically use commercial switches and diodes to create modules suitable for specific vehicles. In other words, while capacitance-voltage characteristics for single IGBT devices are provided by manufacturers, module-level capacitance characteristics need to be separately verified and analyzed during the module manufacturing. This study compares the capacitance differences between single IGBT devices and modules based on measurements, and analyzes how these differences in capacitance affect electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) and contribute to noise sources that cause electromagnetic interference (EMI) in switching systems.

We believe our approach will support to enhance the patient care as well democratization on AI technology for community."

    "abstract": "Precise segmentation of histopathology images is a vital part of automated tissue analysis. It is important for diagnosing diseases, planning treatments, and advancing medical research. Recently, Deep learning has shown remarkable success as a method for facilitating advancements in medical applications, often yielding better results than traditional techniques. Recently, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been used to improve segmentation tasks by providing additional contextual knowledge. However, its usefulness is limited due to shallow features, noisy retrieval, and weak spatial alignment in complex medical images. This work introduces an improved RAG model focused on boosting semantic segmentation performance in histology images. We demonstrate its effectiveness through a detailed comparison with four traditional segmentation models: U-Net, U-Net++, Attention U-Net, and classical RAG. These models are tested on two benchmark datasets: GlaS and PanNuke. The improved RAG model tackles significant issues found in the classical RAG model by adding dynamic memory indexing, support-based retrieval, and attention-driven feature fusion. The proposed approach delivers improved performance across both datasets. Compared with the standard U-Net model, it achieves higher IoU, Dice coefficient, and accuracy by 24%, 13%, and 12% on the GlaS dataset, and by 19%, 10%, and 4% on the PanNuke dataset. This shows its strong generalization for various tissue types. Finally, this paper reviews modern deep learning-based segmentation methods and showcases the potential of retrieval-augmented techniques for building more reliable and accurate AI systems in digital pathology."

    "abstract": "Compression of vaporized refrigerant is the essential process of the refrigeration cycle which is performed by using a compressor. The amount of power consumed by a refrigeration system is governed by the work input given to its compressor, which also determines the COP of the system. By reducing the work input given to the compressor, the power consumption of refrigerator is reduced along with the improvement in its COP. Nowadays, nanoparticles have emerged as the new generation additives in various working fluids because of their remarkable ability to improve the heat transfer, tribological and other thermo-physical properties of the base fluid. In such a vein, we propose a compressor oil-based nanofluid prepared by dispersing nanoparticles into the conventional compressor oil. In the present study, four mixtures of nanoadditive compressor oil were prepared by dispersing the nanoparticles like <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\text{Al} 2 \\mathrm{O} 3, \\text{TiO} 2$</tex> and ZnO into the conventional mineral oil as a lubricant. The thermophysical and tribological properties of these four mixtures were studied, out of which Mixture 4 was chosen because of its better lubrication and heat transfer properties which are considered as one of the key parameters for reducing work input to the compressor. This can result in reduced power consumption, with enhancement of COP. These results are analysed experimentally by carrying out performance and exergy analysis in a Vapour Compression Refrigeration System (VCRS), using R600a as a refrigerant. The experimental results show that there is an improvement of COP by 14.6% and exergy efficiency by 7.51%. Also, the efficiency defect in the major components of VCRS has been reduced effectively. The results of the performance tests done as per BIS show an improvement in the energy conservation by 27.5%."

The insurance claims are fed into the system and processed in low latency by utilizing the real-time streaming data features of Kafka. The claims information is subsequently loaded into a Snowflake data warehouse via Snowpipe which makes the data loading seamless and serverless. To detect fraud, a machine learning model, e.g., an XGBoost, is trained on past claims data to detect the trends of fraud in terms of features such as claim amounts, claimant behavior, and frequency of claims. Upon deployment, the model does real-time inference and marks suspicious claims when it processes them. This system will enable an automated scalable solution to fraud detection that will save insurers losses and enhance operational efficiency. Kafka streaming architecture, Snowpipe to store information in real-time and XGBoost to predict the presence of frauds will guarantee that the process of fraud claims to the insurance company is real-time and would streamline the process of insurance claim."

The proposed approach integrates a fixed-time extended state observer (FTESO), a resistance-compensated integral controller, and an energy-optimal torque distribution strategy. First, the FTESO is developed to estimate system states and lumped resistances within a settled time. Based on the observer outputs, a resistance-compensated integral controller is designed to track the reference velocity. The tracking error is uniformly ultimately bounded, with the bound adjustable via observer gain parameters. To enhance energy efficiency, a torque distribution strategy is formulated to allocate optimal torque to each wheel by minimizing overall energy consumption. MATLAB simulations confirm the validity of the proposed method in achieving accurate velocity tracking and reliable state estimation."

This paper focuses on dielectric loss that occurs in transmission channels during high-speed signaling and proposes a novel printed circuit board (PCB) structure to effectively mitigate such loss. To evaluate the feasibility of the proposed structure, electromagnetic simulations were conducted to analyze the electrical characteristics of the PCB. Furthermore, in order to reduce additional manufacturing costs, a practical PCB fabrication method that does not require high-end equipment was developed, and a prototype was manufactured. Finally, using a vector network analyzer (VNA), the electrical performance and signal quality improvement of the prototype were thoroughly evaluated. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed structure can effectively reduce dielectric loss in the transmission channel while minimizing the need for expensive low-loss dielectric materials, making it a cost-efficient solution for high-speed PCB applications."

    "abstract": "Children are the most promising segment of society, but birth disorders can significantly impact a child’s growth and societal presence. Among these, Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a prominent neurodevelopmental condition characterized by difficulties in social interaction, communication, and repetitive behaviors. Its early detection and proper support can greatly improve the mental conditions of children. There are various detection methods, including eye movement analysis, facial features, questionnaires, etc. Among these, Q-Chat-10 and AQ-10 are widely used for effective screening and assessment. Manual detection of ASD is prone to human-biasness, delayed results, and subject to error based on the stress level of the doctor. As a result, Machine Learning (ML) came into play, but was limited due to manual feature engineering techniques and the inability to deduce hidden relationships. To address it, a Tabular Network (TabNet)-based ASD detection model for children has been proposed that is trained on the autism screening dataset. The model was equipped with Adam optimizer, LRScheduler, early stopping, etc., to ensure proper training. Various experiments were also conducted to gain insight into the dataset and the performance of the classifier that were found to be missing in various studies. An ideal accuracy for multiple split ratios was achieved that demonstrates suitable performance across both balanced and imbalanced datasets. It demonstrated faster training times, enhanced interpretability, efficient feature selection through sparse attention and the ability to handle mixed data types seamlessly."

The approach is based on a Cross-Silo FL design where involved hospitals receive training on a common deep learning framework locally on their individual dental images (e.g., panoramic X-rays, CBCT). The model does not transfer raw data, but instead the update of the data is consolidated at a central server and sensitive data about the patient is kept confidential. In order to solve the problem of data heterogeneity and unbalances among hospitals, the research uses Federated Proximal (FedProx) a technique that becomes used to stabilize learning and enhances the convergence of the models when the data distributions are uneven. The experiment is conducted with the help of the TensorFlow Federated (TFF) framework of the model creation and coordination, which promotes efficient distributed learning and safe aggregation. The findings indicate that FL as implemented in dental diagnostics could facilitate cross-hospital training and keep privacy intact and the accuracy of diagnosis increased."

    "abstract": "Green hydrogen, produced through water electrolysis using energy from renewable sources, represents a sustainable pathway to decarbonization of numerous sectors. However, there are challenges associated with efficiency, durability and cost of operation, arising from the inherent variability in renewable power and operational behavior of electrolyzers. This study presents a predictive control framework for proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers, employing an Artificial Intelligence methodology, incorporating machine learning models and model predictive control (MPC) to optimize hydrogen yield, losses, energy input and equipment health. First, a surrogate model encapsulating the biological and non-linear dynamics of the electrolyzer stack was developed using the available data from the stack, which accounts for a range of temperature, pressure and current conditions experienced. Next, the MPC algorithm was calculated in the short term for the renewable generation forecast, leveraging the surrogate model, finding the setpoint of the current, optimizing the setpoint of the current against the production target and degradation of the system. Simulations of this adaptive predictive controller were rendered using realistic solar and wind profiles, demonstrating up to +12% energy efficiency and up to -20% degradation of the system due to cycling (renewable use) than that provided by traditional PID control. In addition, we performed a sensitivity analysis on forecast errors and associated parameter uncertainties, and showed sufficient robustness. The proposed methodology opens up a future of more intelligent operation of the electrolyzer and combining renewable energy, beyond that of more historical controls, enhancing utilization of green energy, improving operational lifetime of the equipment, and lower levelized cost of hydrogen, etc."

Smart transportation systems (ITS) might work better after this radio is put in. The project’s goal is to use Dedicated Short-Range Communication (DSRC). The FSS layer’s two most important jobs are to increase the antenna’s gain and stop radiation from going in other directions. The fractal design, on the other hand, encourages radiation, which makes things work better and makes them smaller. The low-profile design is easy to adapt to and works with both vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) technologies. The simulation showed that the DSRC spectrum for V2I communication has the right impedance matching, a higher gain, and stable radiation characteristics. You can see many of these events in the spectrum. The design shown here strikes a satisfactory balance between size, functionality, and usability, which makes it a great choice for use in modern ITS settings. This is what makes them perfect to use."

    "abstract": "As data dimensionality increases, the adverse effects of data noise become substantially amplified, leading to significant degradation in the learning accuracy of conventional causal discovery algorithms. This degradation primarily manifests through the introduction of spurious dependencies and the confounding of genuine causal pathways. While large language models (LLMs) offer the potential to mitigate these issues through implicit knowledge extraction, existing approaches predominantly concentrate on causal directionality, neglecting the critical role of non-causal priors. To address this limitation, we propose LLM-Augmented Causal Discovery (LACD) in this work, a model-agnostic framework that integrates LLM-derived non-causal priors into continuous optimization to suppress error edges. Our framework formalizes non-causal relationships via a structured prompting mechanism, thereby penalizing spurious dependencies in the adjacency matrices of causal graphs. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate that LACD achieves (1) a significant reduction in false discovery rates (FDR), (2) improved structural Hamming distance (SHD) metrics for causal discovery in high-dimensional settings, and (3) enhanced algorithmic robustness through its model-agnostic architecture."

However, in highly turbid inland and coastal waters, traditional AC algorithms typically require shortwave infrared (SWIR) or ultraviolet (UV) bands, thereby limiting their applicability to sensors that lack such bands (e.g., HY-3A CZI). To address these limitations, we introduce ACTransNet, an end-to-end deep learning model based on the Transformer architecture. This model directly retrieves Rrs from satellite digital numbers (DNs), bypassing the explicit radiometric calibration (RC) process. The model is trained on synthetic datasets derived from Sentinel-2 MSI, with reference Rrs generated using a combined strategy that involves the POLYMER and ACOLITE-DSF algorithms. The training data span 40 distinct regions, covering diverse water environments ranging from clear open ocean to turbid coastal and inland waters. These data undergo a strict quality control process to ensure their representativeness and reliability. Application results using CZI data demonstrate that ACTransNet performs robustly across seven spectral bands, with <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R<sup>2</sup></i> values ranging from 0.61 to 0.97. In the visible bands, ACTransNet substantially reduces the mean absolute percentage difference (MAPD), with an average reduction of ∼ 82% relative to ACOLITE-DSF and ∼ 74% relative to NIR-bio. Comparisons with quasi-synchronized Sentinel-2 MSI imagery further confirm that the model maintains strong spatial consistency (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R<sup>2</sup></i> > 0.96) across two contrasting water environments (the eastern coast of the Bay of Bengal and Lake Hulun). In a separate evaluation, the model also outperforms traditional multi-step AC algorithms, such as DSF and NIR-bio. Overall, ACTransNet integrates the strengths of both POLYMER and DSF, offering enhanced accuracy and robustness across diverse water environments. This model provides a practical and generalizable solution for AC tasks, particularly for sensors with limited spectral bands, and offers valuable references for remote sensing applications on other similar satellite platforms."

    "abstract": "The transient electromagnetic (TEM) method is recognized as a highly efficient geophysical prospecting technique for rapid acquisition of subsurface resistivity distribution. Conventional gradient-based iterative inversion for TEM usually adopts finite-difference (FD) to compute the Jacobian matrix to minimize the loss function and update the model parameters. However, when inverting large datasets for complex geological models, FD-based Jacobian computations not only could compromise gradient accuracy, but also incur substantial computational costs. To address the demand for rapid inversion of field TEM data, we propose ADABFM—a novel TEM inversion method that integrates automatic differentiation (AD) with adaptive Born forward mapping. Leveraging the gradient-calculation capability of AD, ADABFM can use essentially error-free gradients to update model parameters, and obtain highly accurate resistivity models. Furthermore, ADABFM embeds system response characteristics directly into the forward modeling kernel functions. This design eliminates the complexities associated with explicit system response modeling, and enhances the robustness of inversion. To validate the new method, we first conduct systematic tests with synthetic datasets. Then, we apply ADABFM to two distinct field datasets: 1) the open-source tTEM20AAR dataset collected in Aare Valley, Switzerland, and 2) an dataset acquired by our proprietary TEM system for the Quaternary overburden in Urumqi, China. For the tTEM20AAR dataset, the results obtained by ADABFM are essentially consistent with the those obtained by the conventional FD-based iterative method with spatial constraints, while revealing more detailed subsurface features. For the Urumqi dataset, the inversion results also demonstrate satisfactory consistency with the direct borehole measurements. Benefiting from the improvement in computational efficiency, ADABFM enables rapid inversion from multiple initial models, which can effectively alleviate the local minima issue inherent in iterative inversion. The ADABFM method proposed in this study should provide an accurate, efficient and robust solution for rapid TEM inversion."

    "abstract": "Explainable AI (XAI) has become essential in computer vision to make the decision-making processes of deep learning models transparent. However, current visual explanation (XAI) methods face a critical trade-off between the high fidelity of architecture-specific methods and the broad applicability of universal ones. This often results in abstract or fragmented explanations and makes it difficult to compare explanatory power across diverse model families, such as CNNs and Transformers. This paper introduces the Self-Confidence and Analysis Networks (SCAN), a novel universal framework that overcomes these limitations for both convolutional neural network and transformer architectures. SCAN utilizes an AutoEncoder-based approach to reconstruct features from a model’s intermediate layers. Guided by the Information Bottleneck principle, it generates a highresolution Self-Confidence Map that identifies information-rich regions. Extensive experiments on diverse architectures and datasets demonstrate that SCAN consistently achieves outstanding performance on various quantitative metrics such as AUC-D, Negative AUC, Drop%, and Win%. Qualitatively, it produces significantly clearer, object-focused explanations than existing methods. By providing a unified framework that is both architecturally universal and highly faithful, SCAN enhances model transparency and offers a more reliable tool for understanding the decision-making processes of complex neural networks."

    "abstract": "Multimodal human conversational interactions are characterized by individual differences, ambiguity, and complex socio-cultural and situational dynamics. Modeling session structured affective interactions, including emotion expression during communicative exchanges presents challenges for centralized machine learning approaches. Traditional machine learning pipelines for identifying these behaviors typically rely on learning a single generalizable model across all individuals in the dataset. However, data heterogeneity suggests that a single centralized model cannot capture individuals' respective nuances. To confirm this, we analyze multimodal behavioral datasets of expressive emotive interactions and demonstrate the statistical heterogeneity in individuals' data distributions. This serves as motivation for our focus on personalization. To achieve that, we turn to federated learning (FL). FL offers a compelling framework that enables integrating a centralized model (for shared behavioral trends) and client models (for individualized behavioral expressions), while additionally offering privacy preservation. However, so far, FL research has often focused on image benchmarks with non-IID partitioned data among the clients, ignoring the heterogeneity of naturalistic interactions. To address this gap, we propose FedSession, a novel personalized federated learning (PFL) strategy that accommodates heterogeneous data distributions by explicitly modeling sessions as structured interaction units, where each client corresponds to a real individual participating in a conversation-based affective interaction. FedSession incorporates an additional tier to capture how interlocutors align their behaviors to one another in interactions. Experiments on affect recognition tasks involving dyadic sessions demonstrate that FedSession outperforms existing PFL strategies. Unlike prior PFL strategies, which often struggle to outperform even localized training performance, FedSession effectively addresses the challenges of personalization in heterogeneous, interactive emotion recognition settings."

    "abstract": "This article investigates the problem of observer-based prescribed-time tracking control (OPTC) for a class of nonlinear systems with uncertain nonvanishing disturbances. First, a prescribed-time observer (PTO) with a well-designed time-varying high gain is constructed to achieve zero-error observation of the uncertain nonvanishing disturbances within the prescribed observation time. Subsequently, a two-stage controller design framework is proposed to construct the desired control input, which consists of two distinct components: the first-stage controller and the second-stage controller. The first-stage controller is established to compensate for the effects of the system’s nonlinear dynamics, thereby providing a relatively satisfactory tracking performance. The second-stage controller, on the other hand, is constructed based on a sophisticated switching mechanism of the control gains, which not only ensures that the tracking error converges to zero within the prescribed tracking time but also guarantees a smooth transition between the two-stage controllers. Finally, the simulation example involving a disturbed single-link flexible-joint robotic manipulator is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy."

    "abstract": "In this article, we investigate a decentralized constrained optimization problem over time-varying directed networks. The nodes in the network aim to collaboratively minimize the aggregate of all locally known convex cost functions, subject to local nonidentical and multiple constraint sets, inequality constraints, and equality constraints. Problems of this nature arise in a number of applications in real networks, such as facility location in wireless sensor networks and image deblurring in machine learning. To address these types of problems, we propose an efficient subgradient-rescaling-based decentralized fixed-random projection (SR-DFRP) algorithm, named the SR-DFRP algorithm. In particular, the SR-DFRP algorithm employs Polyak’s random projection to handle nonidentical and multiple constraints, which reduces computational load by avoiding the formulation of complex subproblems. Furthermore, by utilizing dynamically constructed row-stochastic matrices, the algorithm employs a subgradient rescaling strategy to mitigate the imbalance induced by the time-varying directed networks. Rigorous theoretical analyses are provided to establish that the SR-DFRP algorithm converges almost surely to the optimal solution. Extensive simulations on facility location and image deblurring problems are presented to validate the efficacy of the algorithm and the validity of the theoretical results."

    "abstract": "Most research on flexible job shop scheduling assumes constant processing speeds. However, in real production, machines need to operate at variable speeds to achieve energy-efficient scheduling, which requires balancing multiobjective between production efficiency and green development. Such tradeoffs thus trigger the phenomenon in which massive solutions converge to identical objective values (i.e., the multimodal property), which is often neglected in scheduling problems. To address the above challenges, this work introduces a knowledge-enhanced evolutionary multitasking memetic algorithm (KEMMA) to solve the multimodal multiobjective flexible job shop scheduling problem considering speed (MMFJSP-S). First, self-paced learning motivated us to construct a simple auxiliary task and employ an evolutionary multitasking (EMT) framework to tackle the complex MMFJSP-S. Moreover, a knowledge enhancement and explicit transfer strategy is designed to reduce the effects of negative transfer by reinforcing and sharing beneficial knowledge across tasks. Finally, a mapping transformation mechanism is proposed to handle the multimodal property of the MMFJSP-S in the decision space. By comparing with ten advanced algorithms, the experimental results verify the remarkable superiority ofthe proposed KEMMA in solving MMFJSP-S and reveal the significance of studying the multimodal property."

    "abstract": "Storage of a compressed deterministic scan-based test set in an on-chip memory allows compact test sets with complete fault coverage of target faults to be applied in-field.With in-field test periods varying in duration, short in-field test periods should detect the faults that are the most likely to occur as a chip ages. This can be addressed by a procedure that generates a test set such that subsets with increasing numbers of tests detect subsets of increasing numbers of the faults that are the most likely to occur with aging. Such a procedure was described for a two-cycle scan-based transition fault test set. This article suggests for the first time the use of multicycle scan-based tests for this purpose. A multicycle test has several functional capture cycles between scan operations. A larger number of functional capture cycles allows a multicycle test to detect more faults. In the context of this article, more of the faults that are the most susceptible to aging are detected with each additional test. The test data compression logic used in this article allows both scan-in states and primary input sequences of multicycle tests to be compressed together. However, it also requires compressed tests to be generated directly, and the aging aware test generation procedure must continue increasing the fault coverage as it addresses aging. The procedure was implemented in an academic simulation environment and applied to transition faults in benchmark circuits to demonstrate its effectiveness."

First, the algorithm uses vSLAM to determine the UAV’s exact location and build a map. A key innovation to enhance this process is the use of an SVD-aided Kalman filter within vSLAM, which significantly improves map point update accuracy and efficiency by reducing noise. The system precisely defines the landing area using image segmentation andWatershed Transform for real-time vSLAM data, and find important landmarks. This visual data feed the linearized MPC, which computes the optimal control inputs-longitudinal acceleration, yaw rate, and vertical velocity to guide the UAV along the landing trajectory. While both MPC and Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) were tested and showed successful guidance capabilities, simulation results confirm the effective performance of our integrated vSLAM-MPC architecture in precisely guiding the UAV to the landing zone."

While deep learning techniques-particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs)-have achieved substantial success in medical image analysis, existing models often struggle with issues such as overfitting, channel redundancy, and insufficient focus on clinically salient features. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a deep learning framework that integrates an Adaptive Feature Aggregation (AFA) block into the DenseNet121 architecture. The proposed AFA module learns to emphasize important feature channels by modeling inter-channel dependencies through a lightweight attention mechanism, thereby improving the network's ability to distinguish between benign and malignant tissue patterns.

Evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix analysis confirm the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method for breast cancer classification."

This study establishes an fuzzy-driven hybrid framework that combines traditional statistical modeling with fuzzy logic reasoning to predict Alzheimer’s disease (AD) risk employing two serum compounds-25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10). Serum samples from 32 AD patients and 32 cognitively healthy controls were analyzed by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Both levels of the two substances were significantly lower in AD patients compared with controls (p < 0.001). Logistic regression identified 25(OH)D (OR = 0.51) and CoQ10 (OR = 0.45) as independent protective factors, yielding an AUC of 0.86. The fuzzy logic model, based on the Mamdani inference system with nine IF–THEN rules, achieved an accuracy of 81.3% and an AUC of 0.785, indicating stable and explainable performance on a small-scale data. The proposed fuzzy framework effectively bridges quantitative biostatistics and qualitative reasoning, offering a transparent and data-efficient method for biomarker-based AD risk estimation. This explainable AI strategy may provide a good alternative for future applications in accuracy medicine and biomarker-driven disease screening in situations where available are small."

In this paper, we propose a Skyline Cardinality Estimation Model (SCEM) that aims at estimating the skyline cardinality of skyline queries over incomplete data. Also, the Spearman correlation coefficient (SCC) is integrated into the SCEM model to identify the data distribution type of an incomplete database. Extensive experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real incomplete datasets demonstrate that the SCEM model, built upon an ensemble learning algorithm, achieves the most effective and efficient performance in estimating skyline cardinality, while the SCC can identify the type of data distribution with high accuracy."

Detailed EMG analysis has been performed on the acquired data to track the onset of fatigue and decide the corresponding time threshold.

    "abstract": "Autonomous inspection technology of substation utilizing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is pivotal for ensuring the reliability of the power grid. An accurate UAV dynamic model constitutes the key to implementing this technology. Although existing data-driven modeling methods have achieved significant progress, their high computational costs render them difficult to deploy directly on inspection UAVs. Furthermore, these methods neglect the impact of accumulated errors over extended prediction horizons, which can easily result in the failure of long-term predictions. To this end, we propose a dynamic modeling method based on lightweight temporal convolutional identifier. Specifically, to reduce the computational cost of the dynamic model, we introduce a context-aware downsampling-based temporal convolution strategy that maintains model accuracy while enhancing its lightweight property. A decoupled dynamics learning framework is presented to simplify the learning process and improve the modularity. In addition, to explicitly mitigate the issue of compounding prediction errors in long-term prediction, a multi-step prediction loss is incorporated into the training objective. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated on real flight datasets, and the results demonstrate that it exhibits the characteristics of low computational cost, fast inference speed, and high modeling accuracy."

The proposed model comprehensively considers the phase-locked loop (PLL) angle disturbance induced by grid voltage perturbations and establishes the relationship between AC-side disturbances and power/DC voltage variations. A small-signal model is derived to relate power disturbances and DC voltage fluctuations to grid voltage amplitude and phase perturbations. Simulations in Simulink validate the derived model, showing the frequency-dependent behavior of key matrix elements under wide-frequency disturbances. The impact of control parameters such as PLL and DC voltage regulator gains on system stability is analyzed, and suggestions for mitigating wide-frequency oscillations are provided."

The experiment validates the effectiveness of the proposed method. The system achieves a position error of 2.38 ± 1.36 mm and an orientation error of 3.4± 1.6 °.

    "abstract": "With the rapid proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and the increasing use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in dynamic environments, the need for adaptive, reliable, and energy-efficient communication protocols has become paramount. Conventional routing and spectrum assignment algorithms find it difficult to address the non-stationary and decentralization of such networks. In order to address them, this paper suggests the Bio-Inspired Neuro-Swarm Communication Protocol (BNSCP) in combination with Dynamic Spectrum Intelligence to optimize communication in the UAV-assisted IoT networks. The protocol models neuro-swarm agent nodes with spiking neural network logic of forwarding packets and ant colony optimization and energy-wise mobility and relative positioning. Multi-Armed Bandit learning is used to improve spectrum sensing to allow real-time selection of channels and the neuro-immune anomaly detection layer guarantees security and reliability in adversarial environments. It has been shown in experiments that the proposed model is much more effective than the traditional protocols such as AODV, LEACH, and even the newest learning-based models. In particular, BNSCP delivers packets with a Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) of 94.7, end-to-end delay per packet is reduced to 139 ms, spectrum is used more efficiently up to 86% and energy consumption is reduced by 20% over current baselines. Further, the neuroimmune model has an accuracy of 96.5% in intrusion detection with a false alarm rate of 4.8% false alarm rate. BNSCP is a powerful and scalable solution to the next-generation IoT-UAV ecosystems as a combination of the bio-inspired intelligence with the dynamic spectrum learning. This is a prospective implementation base of adaptive mission-critical systems of smart agriculture, disaster response, and real-time surveillance."

    "abstract": "Composite robots are high-performance systems that integrate various cutting-edge intelligent technologies. They have been widely applied in multiple fields, driving the deep development and innovation of intelligent applications. With the continuous advancement of technologies like deep learning, machine vision, and pattern recognition, composite robots are now capable of efficiently perceiving complex environments. This capability opens up more possibilities for autonomous decision-making and the execution of advanced tasks. The control precision of the end-effector is particularly critical, as it directly influences the range of complex tasks it can perform. To address this, this paper proposes a high-precision tracking control method for a six-degree-of-freedom robotic arm that integrates PID (Proportional–Integral–Derivative) control with sliding mode control. The aim is to enhance the accuracy of intelligent robotic systems in dynamic environments. The system’s uncertainties are modeled and compensated, and the Extended High-Gain Observer (EHGO) is used to estimate system disturbances in real time. This ensures the asymptotic convergence of the closed-loop system error, enabling high-precision synchronous tracking control. Experimental results confirm that the proposed control algorithm achieves outstanding performance on both simulation and practical validation platforms. It proves capable of effectively addressing complex dynamic environments and multi-task scenarios."

The intricate and non-linear coupling of operational limitations, end-user behavior, and network efficiency needs to be addressed in the forecast. Classical models are made inadequate by the time-varying and high degree of interdependence of telecom data. The network topology of this research consists of the Transformer-Bi-LSTM-Attention Network (TBLA-Net) for multi-dimensional feature embedding, a bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) for temporal sequence modeling, and an attention layer for dynamic feature relevance weighting. An extensive dataset is used for model training and evaluation, including operational KPIs, consumer metrics, and innovation of services indicators. After normalization, the target variable is assigned to the Service Innovation Outcome (SIO). The Transformer-only, GRU-Attention, and CNN-LSTM baselines are better than TBLA-Net in prediction accuracy, which is proven by experiments. The approach can notably reduce the value of RMSE and MAPE while keeping the accuracy rate at 98.64% and the <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$R^{2}$</tex> value at 0.976.

The CMOS chip incorporates advanced noise suppression techniques to minimize signal interference. Specifically, the circuit is designed to capture signals reflected from the MEMS and uses a chopping clock to alternately select the reference path and the sensing path, thus suppressing common-mode noise (such as environmental coupling) and low-frequency receiver noise (such as flicker noise) while enhancing system performance. This first-of-its-kind IR sensors exhibit a responsivity of ~ 0.036 V/W at wavelength of 6 , a metric very competitive with IR photodetectors, and operates at room temperature without relying on expensive cooling facilities. We envision that this technology will greatly outperform IR photodetectors in the near future and will pave its way into fields like biosensing, spectroscopy, and, environmental monitoring, among others."

High thermal stress and ripple are common problems for traditional boost converters, which can reduce battery longevity and compromise reliability. This paper introduces a four-phase interleaved step-up converter (FPISC) intended to reduce ripple and increase efficiency in EV applications in order to address these issues. The suggested design balances the load, lowers thermal stress, and guarantees smoother power delivery by coordinating switching across several phases. A more stable power supply results from the efficient cancellation of input and output current ripple through the application of phase shift control. Through simulations under various load scenarios, the converter's performance is assessed, and important factors including ripple reduction, voltage gain, and overall efficiency are examined. Power MOSFETs are used to construct a hardware prototype, and real-world testing is used to verify the simulation results."

Ten mechanical damage levels ($\\mathbf{0 - 1 0 0 \\%}$) were implemented, and reflection signals were acquired using a Gaussian-enveloped linear chirp. A Transformer encoder was employed to learn local and global temporal patterns.

This paper presents a high-speed ATE-based test method that utilizes the Voltage Source Current Measure (VSIM) function in the parametric measurement unit (PMU) to detect read eye margin failures. By measuring the net current during DQ data toggling, the proposed method can capture both eye-height and eye-width defects without exhaustive shmoo scanning. Experimental validation on 40 LPDDR5 devices at 8.5 Gbps demonstrates that defective chips exhibit distinct positive or negative net-current offsets due to driver imbalance or duty-cycle distortion, whereas normal devices converge to nearly zero net current. Compared with conventional margin tests, the proposed method reduces test time by approximately 74% while maintaining comparable failure coverage. These results confirm that current-based margin detection is both efficient and production-practical, enabling reliable and cost-effective testing of high-speed, lowpower DRAM products in mass production."

    "abstract": "A high proportion of grid-connected renewable energy in power systems represents an economically viable and reliable pathway toward achieving clean and low-carbon power systems. However, the safe and efficient integration of unstable and uncontrollable renewable energy sources remains a significant challenge for power grid operators. Moreover, indiscriminate investment in flexible resources may result in suboptimal resource utilization. Drawing on operational experiences from the power dispatching and controlling center of China Southern Grid (PDCC-CSG), this paper demonstrates how PDCC-CSG mobilizes flexible resources through dispatch mechanisms such as hierarchical coordination, multi-timescale coordination, and “power market plus dispatch” coordination approaches to enable the efficient utilization and consumption of renewable energy in scenarios where new energy accounts for more than 20 % of the total power generation. Furthermore, in order to cope with the scenarios with an even higher share of renewable energy, the future application of advanced cooperative and intelligent dispatch technologies is envisioned."

    "abstract": "Multi-view clustering (MVC) has garnered significant attention as a prominent unsupervised learning paradigm dedicated to multi-source data analysis. However, conventional clustering methods often exhibit limited capability in capturing expressive features from complex and large-scale datasets. To address this limitation, deep clustering frameworks have risen to prominence recently, attributed largely to their potent feature extraction mechanisms. Despite the progress, existing deep MVC methods still struggle to effectively handle the heterogeneity across views and often fail to produce prototypes that are adaptable to diverse data distributions. Therefore, we propose a novel framework named Dynamic Prototype Adaptation Deep Multi-view Clustering (DPAMVC), which jointly performs representation learning and clustering by dynamically aligning and adapting prototypes across multiple views. Specifically, compact latent representations are first extracted using view-specific encoders, followed by a prototype generation module and a high-level feature extraction layer. Through contrastive learning guided by adaptive fusion weights, view-specific prototypes are dynamically aligned to enhance consistency across views. A prototype shrinkage mechanism is introduced to improve intraclass compactness and inter-class separability, while view-specific decoders are employed to reconstruct latent features and preserve view characteristics. The model is optimized end-to-end by jointly minimizing contrastive, shrinkage, and reconstruction losses. Comprehensive empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks validate that DPAMVC significantly outperforms current leading algorithms."

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of new energy and the improvement of economic dispatch standards in power systems, accurately forecasting photovoltaic (PV) power generation data is crucial for power system scheduling and planning. To address the challenges of low prediction accuracy caused by the uncertainty and nonlinearity of PV power output, this paper proposes a PV data forecasting algorithm that combines an improved Gray Wolf Optimization (IGWO) algorithm with a CNN-BiLSTM-Attention model. First, the BiLSTM captures the bidirectional dependencies in the PV data time series, combined with CNN to extract local spatial features, and an attention mechanism is introduced to dynamically allocate parameter weights, enhancing the response coefficients of key parameters. Meanwhile, to overcome the conventional GWO algorithm’s tendency toward local convergence and low optimization efficiency, new individuals with information memory are introduced, and the convergence factor is non-linearly modified based on integrating the attention mechanism into the information transmission process. Finally, the IGWO algorithm is used to optimize the hyperparameters of the CNN-BiLSTM-Attention model to improve prediction accuracy and stability. Ablation experiments are conducted using classic PV power generation data and compared with six mainstream existing forecasting algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms others across five prediction metrics, achieving higher accuracy in PV power forecasting and providing a solid foundation for optimizing power dispatch and ensuring stable operation of power systems"

Among critical tasks, the timely and accurate prediction of feed and water intake is essential for ensuring animal health, early disease detection, and sustainable resource management. Traditional manual methods are labor-intensive, error-prone, and lack responsiveness to dynamic conditions, while existing smart solutions often rely heavily on cloud infrastructure that introduces latency, increasing operational costs, and limiting usability in rural or resource-constrained areas. This paper presents a lightweight, edge-compatible machine learning (ML) model for real-time prediction of livestock feed and water intake using multimodal sensor data. The proposed approach emphasizes optimizing the model size to minimize dependence on cloud infrastructure to make it suitable for deployment in connectivity-limited farm environments. The use of systematic feature selection and correlation-based modeling enhances the interpretability and accuracy of the ML models, including Random Forest, CatBoost, XGBoost, and Neural Networks. Experimental results validate the performance of the proposed solution for feed and water intake prediction that enables timely and autonomous interventions and promotes operational efficiency, sustainability, and scalability in modern farming practices."

    "abstract": "In this paper, various NN driver architectures are compared and analyzed to address the VOH-drift problem occurring in TSV (Through-Silicon Via)-based HBM (High Bandwidth Memory) interfaces. To mitigate the slew rate degradation and power increase caused by the large parasitic capacitance of TSVs, three structures are compared: conventional NN driver, NN driver with a leaker NMOS, and the NN driver with a VOH drift controlled pre-driver. Simulation results show that the conventional NN driver exhibits significant VOH-drift, while the leaker NMOS structure can eliminate the drift but causes a considerable increase in static power consumption. The VOH drift controlled pre-driver improves power efficiency. However, it introduces an undershoot phenomenon. Moreover, reducing the main driver voltage effectively suppresses VOH drift, but a trade-off relationship exists in which the drift increases as the pre-driver voltage decreases. This study provides a design direction for simultaneously improving power efficiency and signal integrity in HBM interfaces."

    "abstract": "As a core task of Optical Character Recognition (OCR), end-to-end scene text spotting aims to detect and recognize text instances from natural images in a unified framework. It has significant applications in many fields such as autonomous driving and industrial automation. Recent methods based on query-based iterative refinement have achieved remarkable success, yet they often suffer from slow convergence and potential inaccuracy stemming from randomly initialized queries. Concurrently, the synergy between detection and recognition, crucial for handling arbitrarily-shaped text, has been paid much attention. G-SwinTextSpotter, a novel framework that enhances a synergistic text spotter with a guidance-initialized mechanism is proposed in this paper. The proposed approach addresses the \"cold start\" problem of the iterative detector by introducing a lightweight, coarse-grained guidance generator which can provide high-quality initial proposals. These proposals can provide a rather good initialization for a multi-stage refinement process, which is deeply coupled with the recognition task via a synergistic conversion module. This design allows the proposed model to benefit from both robust initialization and profound synergy between localization and recognition. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks, including Total-Text and CTW1500, demonstrate that G-SwinTextSpotter significantly outperforms benchmark methods, showcasing superior performance and faster convergence."

    "abstract": "In industrial furnace heat treatment, temperature critically affects the grain structure, phase transformation, and resulting properties of metallic materials, making precise control essential. Indirect combustion furnaces typically employ radiant tubes for indirect heating, but prolonged operation under fixed flame conditions can cause localized heat concentration, tube fatigue, or rupture. Auxiliary fans are often used for thermal mixing; however, fixed-speed operation may still result in uneven heat distribution and reduced combustion stability. This study develops subsystem and control models of the furnace and proposes a uniform temperature control strategy that integrates pulse combustion with variable-speed fan regulation. Flame size and duty cycle adjustments equalize heat distribution within the radiant tube, mitigating local flame effects and extending tube service life, while adaptive fan speed control improves temperature uniformity and enhances workpiece quality. Simulation results show that the proposed strategy maintains furnace temperature within <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\pm 10^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$</tex> of the setpoint and limits radiant tube variation to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$80{ }^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$</tex>, demonstrating both effectiveness and practical industrial applicability."

    "abstract": "Designing efficient parallel programs is a nontrivial task that requires one to have an in-depth knowledge of the underlying parallel architecture, memory hierarchy and programming model besides other aspects. This may require considerable efforts, time, and cost. To improve the programmers' productivity, there is a need for parallel abstractions that can simplify the programmers job of first specifying the computation and then optimizing it for performance. Powerlist [1] is one such potential parallel abstraction that is able to exploit both parallelism and recursion at the same time, resulting in succinct representations of computations. In this work, we propose the use of Powerlist as a Domain Specific Language (DSL) and implement it as a Source-to-Source compiler that translates the high-level powerlist specification into sequential and parallel C++ programs. Several new powerlist specifications were also devised for computations and in this process, the powerlist notation was also enriched. The proposed framework considerably improves the programmers' productivity by providing a high-level abstraction resulting in succinct and intuitive specification of computations, absolving them of the task of exploiting parallelism and tuning for performance, which is taken care of by the implementation."

Here, the data is represented in the form of coordinates extracted using Google MediaPipe from individual frames of video. The extracted features through this representation are fed to the Classifier. Here, the random forest machine learning algorithm is used as a classifier. The experimental results reveal that the Sign Language Recognition (SLR) system using Random Forest Classifier (RFC) achieved an accuracy of 99.777%.

It innovatively proposes a hybrid recommendation algorithm based on deep learning, organically integrating collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation strategies. This approach not only uncovers common user preferences but also accurately matches individual needs, overcoming the limitations of single strategies and achieving complementary advantages. Furthermore, a bidirectional feedback mechanism allows for real-time capture of users' dynamic interests during role-playing games to match current needs before recommendations are made, and for optimization of recommendations based on user feedback afterward, ensuring continuous improvement in book recommendation effectiveness with each interaction.Comparative experiments demonstrate that the hybrid recommendation model has excellent comprehensive recommendation performance, avoids the shortcomings of a single recommendation model, and can help traditional libraries achieve AI empowerment and improve the level of personalized services."

To achieve a balance between model performance and complexity, this paper proposes a lightweight multi-task frequency attentive network that leverages 128-point fast Fourier transform spectral features derived from radar echoes. The proposed network architecture integrates a convolutional encoder-decoder with a lightweight classification head, where input features are first extracted by the encoder with adaptive frequency attention using multi-scale depthwise convolutions. Latent features are then jointly optimized within a collaborative multi-task framework involving both the decoder and the classifier, enabling compact and efficient end-to-end learning.

Although machine learning has shown promise in automating lung sound classification, most existing models are either focused on binary lung sound classification or have a narrow subset of abnormal sounds, hindering their diagnostic utility. This study addresses these limitations by developing a high-SNR, multiclass, and accurate classification model capable of identifying normal lung sounds and five abnormal types: wheezes, crackles, stridor, rhonchi, and pleural rubs. Various feature extraction techniques were compared, including the standard Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) model, an enhanced-MFCC (eMFCC) model, and a hybrid Discrete Wavelet Transform-Short-Time Fourier Transform (DWT-STFT). The input-output Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) analysis confirmed a significant improvement in signal quality, with median SNR increasing from 16 dB (MFCC) to 35 dB (eMFCC), validating the effectiveness of the enhancement techniques. Classification was performed using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), with the highest accuracy of 97.69 % and 98.34 %, respectively, achieved using eMFCC mean features. The results demonstrate the robustness of the proposed high-SNR feature-based model for accurate multiclass lung sound classification."

In this study, we examined the current-voltage characteristics of AlGaN/GaN high-electron-mobility transistors subjected to electrical stress. Stress application induced a kink effect, which became more pronounced with increasing gate reverse-bias stress and stress application duration. This observation indicated that local lattice strain, caused by the inverse piezoelectric effect, degraded the device performance. When combined with lattice vibrations owing to heat, this strain led to further degradation. However, the combined effect eventually reached saturation. Moreover, lattice vibrations likely suppressed electron trapping and strain during stress application, resulting in a nonlinear performance degradation trend. The inverse piezoelectric effect was sensitive to thermal fluctuations, resulting in instability. Furthermore, transient response measurements of the drain current revealed a long-term current recovery process, indicating a variation in the interaction between polarization and thermal fluctuations."

    "abstract": "With the emergence of the \"right to be forgotten\" and increasing privacy awareness, efficient data unlearning in federated learning (FL) has become a key research issue. Although FL avoids centralized storage of raw data, the global model may still retain sensitive local information, posing privacy risks. Federated unlearning (FU) aims to remove the influence of specific data from an existing model, but current methods are often inefficient and lack comprehensive unlearning capabilities. This paper proposes MGFU, a scenario-driven multi-granularity federated unlearning method. In sample-level and client-level unlearning scenarios where only a minority of clients require unlearning, the unlearning clients adopt a dual-head model. We design an adaptive interpolation strategy for this model to achieve rapid forgetting and optimal unlearning performance without disrupting normal training. In class-level unlearning scenarios, as well as sample-level and client-level unlearning scenarios where a majority of clients require unlearning, the unlearning clients retain only the unlearning head. To further reduce communication overhead and unlearning training time, we introduce the LoRA strategy and a data compression algorithm. Extensive experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that MGFU achieves effective unlearning while maintaining model accuracy."

    "abstract": "The proposed study is dedicated to the application of the sentiment analysis to identify and label extremist affiliations on social media. The suggested solution uses spaCy to normalize and tokenize the text and provide a high quality of data input. We use Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) using scikit-learn to select only the most relevant features eliminating duplication and improving model efficiency. The main part of the model is an optimized BERT classifier, which is implemented using the library Hugging Face Transformers, and it enables the proper sentiment analysis and detection of extremist content. The model development, training, and deployment are done with the help of TensorFlow, it has scalability and is capable of processing in real-time. The model is very accurate, precise, recalls and the F1 scores are high indicating that the model is very successful in detecting extremist content on the social media platforms. This paper will aid in the enhancement of the online content regulation as well as improving the security using the automated detection algorithms."

    "abstract": "Achieving an optimal trade off between comfort and energy consumption in smart buildings remains a complex challenge, especially under dynamic occupancy conditions. Traditional optimization frameworks often neglect occupancy variation, resulting in energy inefficiencies or compromised occupant comfort. This study presents an occupancy aware optimization framework in which the objective weight between Comfort Index (CI) and Energy Gain (EG) remains fixed, while environmental constraints are dynamically adjusted based on occupancy. The approach is tested using three metaheuristic algorithms: Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO), Slime Mould Algorithm (SMA), and Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm (AOA), on a real world smart office dataset comprising 528 hourly observations. Results show that HHO achieved the highest average CI during occupancy <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(0.9341)$</tex> with comparatively low energy consumption <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(1327 \\text{kWh})$</tex>, whereas SMA delivered the highest CI during non occupied periods (0.7195) with an average energy consumption of 1311 kWh. These findings validate the effectiveness of incorporating occupancy signals into smart building control, improving comfort satisfaction and energy efficiency without adjusting the objective weight."

Efficiency losses caused by coil misalignment in inductive links and electrode spacing in capacitive links motivate a millimetre-scale inductive/capacitive hybrid coupler (ICCH-WPT). Electromagnetic field simulations of a realistically constructed layered abdominal model show a <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$7.5\\ \\text{mm} \\times 7\\ \\text{mm}$</tex> coupler delivering 5.85 mW at <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$1 \\text{MHz}-66 \\%$</tex> higher than a capacitive-only design-while meeting stringent international human-safety limits. The energy is effectively confined near the coupler, indicating negligible deep-tissue exposure in surrounding biological tissues with minimal unintended radiation.

However, informed consent for the processing of this data is not always obtained, raising ethical concerns about data protection, privacy, user trust, and even regulatory compliance with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). An Artificial Intelligence (AI) chatbot can address the gap between online security and informed consent, by acting as an intermediary between users and their web browser. A sentiment analysis chatbot using machine learning (ML) was developed to classify user input as positive, negative, or neutral, employing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Testing on public datasets helped select the best model based on classification accuracy. The sentiment analysis concept serves as the baseline for the SIEM Consent chatbot, where a deep learning (DL) model expands on the idea of classifying user input sentiments to include classifying user inputs associated with topics related to the consent process, e.g., SIEM, data usage, and consent itself. User authentication is mandatory, with their authentication timestamped and recorded in a SQLite database, providing an audit trail. The chatbot integrates with Wazuh Cloud SIEM for log collection via Wazuh agents and the Wazuh RESTful API. Built-in web browsers (Chrome/Edge) are locked through their Access Control Lists; browser access is only allowed by providing consent through the Chatbot."

To address these issues, this study presents a Shunt Active Power Filter (SAPF) controlled by a Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) for effective PQ improvement. The system integrates both conventional PI and FLC schemes to regulate the DC-link voltage of the Voltage Source Inverter (VSI). Using instantaneous reactive power (p–q) theory, reference currents are generated, and a hysteresis current controller provides fast and accurate switching for the VSI. The MATLAB/Simulink-based model is tested under varying load and harmonic conditions. Results show that the FLC-based SAPF achieves better transient performance, reduced Total Harmonic Distortion (THD), and improved voltage stability compared to the PI-controlled system. Additionally, power quality analysis of a single-phase AC–DC converter feeding a DC motor demonstrates the controller’s capability to maintain stable operation under different load and firing conditions."

Traditional methods face challenges such as insufficient texture feature extraction and the difficulty in balancing accuracy and deployment efficiency. This paper proposes an improved model (YOLOv5-GCB) based on YOLOv5 that integrates GhostConv convolution and Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) to simultaneously develop detection accuracy and model lightweight performance. The combination of these two modules helps maintain feature representation capability while reducing the computational burden during high-resolution image processing and minimizing background interference. To verify the effectiveness of YOLOv5-GCB, we construct a dataset containing 41 ceramic-related categories and compared it with the original YOLOv5, YOLOv5-GhostConv, and YOLOv5-CBAM models under the same conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves a mAP@0.5 of 87.2%, a 5.1% improvement over the original YOLOv5s. The parameter count is reduced to 3.6M, a decrease of approximately 48.6% compared to the original YOLOv5s. The inference speed is 7.0 ms per image, enabling optimized and efficient deployment. YOLOv5-GCB offers a effective and dependable technical solution for the digital recording of ceramic artifacts and quality inspection in ceramic production."

The detection algorithm analyzes portions of video to affirm the species identification with a 90.25% accuracy upon confirmation by three specialized coders. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approach was used for detection efficiency using annotated orthomosaics as inputs to the computational method. The CNN approach integrated an F1 score classification. A Linear Mixed Model (LMM) approach was used to test differences in the accuracy measures amongst temperature variation. A compound loss metric, sparse convolutional enhanced feature extraction module was developed to improve classification and localization. The revised loss metric function emphasizes difficult samples (Focal Loss (FL)) while the Complete Intersection over Union (CIoU) loss metric improved spatial accuracy of the tracked or detected objects. A Sparse Convolution Enhanced Feature Extraction Module improved effective portions of images, and reduced unnecessary computations and memory usage. The tracker algorithm used in this model ranked detections to ensure consistent tracking despite uncertain detections through the use of a Visual Particle Filter (VPF) utilizing FN on previous locations of particles initialized with bounding boxing center locations. The system computed features Local Binary Pattern (LBP) features within the Region of Interest (ROI) at 4 scales to return a 36-dimensional feature vector for effective target threat identification."

    "abstract": "An arduous task in medical image analysis is the automated segmentation of infected regions in a organ (for example, in lungs, segmentation of lung lesion), which is crucial for assessing the volumetric severity of infections and evaluating the effectiveness of subsequent treatments. The affected regions in diseased lung cases, called lung lesions, vary widely in their intensity, texture, contrast, location, and size. The similarity of intensities between the lesion and the healthy surrounding tissue bordering the lung makes lung as well as lesion segmentation more challenging, especially by classical image processing techniques. One solution is machine learning (ML) or deep learning (DL)-based methods, that learn segmentation models from datasets with lung lesion labeled by experts. Unfortunately, acquiring any labeled data in the healthcare sector for ML/DL algorithms is prohibitively costly due to the participation of skilled clinicians. Hence, the current study proposes a Random Forest (RF) based ML-method that utilizes a significantly reduced number of expert-labeled data for lung lesion segmentation. Eight different experiments with varying amounts of labeled data from two challenging benchmark datasets demonstrated encouraging results, comparable to state-of-the-art methods, reaching the highest precision values of 86.4 %, recall value of 78.1 %, and F1 score of 82.0 %."

    "abstract": "Gesture recognition is a key component in developing intuitive and efficient human-computer interaction systems, enabling machines to interpret human intentions through body movement analysis. A common approach employs the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm to compute similarity between keypoint sequences extracted via pose estimation from both reference and live video streams. While effective and flexible, DTW has limitations, including high space complexity and sensitivity to keypoint misidentification often seen in pose estimation. To address these issues, we propose two enhancements to the DTWbased gesture recognition pipeline. First, we apply a space compression technique to reduce memory usage without sacrificing performance. Second, we introduce a frame-skip mechanism to mitigate the impact of incorrectly detected keypoints on recognition results. To evaluate our method, we construct a dataset of traffic gestures commonly used in Taiwan. Experimental results show that the proposed enhancements improve the efficiency, scalability, and accuracy of gesture recognition, making the approach more suitable for real-time use in constrained environments."

To address the challenges such as inconsistent multi-source data benchmarks and low storage efficiency, this study conducts in-depth research on full-space information-driven distributed management technology for spatiotemporal big data. A \"Three-Layer and Four-Dimension\" technical framework is constructed: the Data Layer adopts \"Three-Domain Identification\" for multi-source data encoding, and realizes storage optimization by combining LOD technology with HBase; the Engine Layer is based on the Flink framework and achieves parallel processing of 100-million-level features through custom spatiotemporal grids; the Service Layer adopts a microservice architecture and provides open services in compliance with OGC standards. Key technologies, including hybrid indexing, multi-source data collaborative processing, and dynamic data processing, are being developed. Experiments are conducted based on public datasets such as OpenStreetMap. The results show that: the hybrid index increases 3D query speed by 217% and trajectory retrieval speed by 150%; the multi-source data processing accuracy reaches 86.3% with a speed increase of 243%; the distributed architecture improves throughput by 38% and achieves a concurrent success rate of 97.2%.

    "abstract": "This paper presents an optimal estimation of adjacent waves based on observed wave data using a Kalman filter for wave monitoring system. The proposed method is implemented using a Kalman filter based on the two-dimensional shallow water equation(SWE). A grid-based state-space model is implemented using the SWE, and the state vector is dynamically estimated using observable variables such as the significant wave height and surface current velocity. At unobserved grid points, wave states are predicted via a state propagation model incorporating diffusion terms. The validity and accuracy of the method are demonstrated through simulations based on marine wave radar measurements."

This paper selects landslides in a certain town as the research object and aims to improve the accuracy and timeliness of early warning and support disaster prevention and mitigation work by constructing a multi-model fusion early warning system. Firstly, it studies the multi-threshold early warning model by optimizing the indicator system based on disaster characteristics; secondly, it formulates specific early warning thresholds and response strategies; finally, it verifies the effect of this method through actual cases. The results of the case show that this method can effectively identify disaster risks and issue early warnings in advance, thereby significantly improving the scientific accuracy and timeliness of geological disaster early warning and providing reliable technical support for disaster prevention and mitigation decisions."

In this paper, we investigate whether Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), and instrumental time-aligned labels from ASR decoding paths, can be used to improve speaker diarization in domain-specific data. We utilize NVIDIA's Canary 1B ASR model within the WhisperX framework in order to improve AT performance, word level alignment and speaker segmentation. Canary 1B has generally shown stronger performance based on average WER and RTFx in the previous evaluation. Using experimental dataset from an English broadcast with several speakers, our proposed model achieves 0% Diarization Error Rate (DER), 2.2% Word Error Rate (WER), and 0.04% Character Error Rate (CER). These results demonstrate that by integrating Canary 1 B transcription model with our search-based decoder can provide a more effective and efficient transcription system for live news applications."

Among interposer materials, glass is a strong candidate due to low signal loss, dimensional stability, and process compatibility. This paper presents the design and signal integrity (SI) analysis of high-speed interconnects in 2.5D/3D glass interposer-based packages. Transmission line structures with multiple signal-to-ground configurations are explored to support 32 Gbps data rates. We analyzed insertion loss (IL), eye diagram characteristics, and crosstalk through 3D electromagnetic (EM) simulation across routing schemes. The frequency-domain Voltage Transfer Function (VTF) is used as the primary SI metric to reflect unterminated signaling typically seen in advanced packaging. Results confirm that the proposed multi-ground guiding structure achieves low IL, reduced crosstalk, clear eye openings. All configurations meet the transmission specifications presented in the UCIe standard for VTF and high-speed channel SI performance."

These self-configuring, decentralized networks are used in various applications, such as disaster recovery, military operations, and mobile conferencing, where efficient data transmission is critical. Ensuring the effective operation of MANETs is therefore essential, particularly in terms of Quality of Service (QoS), which encompasses factors like delay, packet loss, and throughput. This study presents an innovative technique aimed at enhancing QoS in MANETs by combining the mathematical concept of fractals with the optimization power of genetic algorithms. Specifically, the research focuses on developing an improved packet scheduling algorithm-a core element in achieving better QoS. The proposed system classifies packets into service classes based on their priority levels and acceptable delay thresholds. Following classification, a modified genetic algorithm is applied to schedule packets efficiently. To assess the effectiveness of this approach, simulations were performed using the NS3 network simulator, and the results were thoroughly analyzed."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress with Transformer-based architectures. However, the quadratic complexity of the multi-head attention (MHA) mechanism imposes significant computational and memory bottlenecks, limiting scalability for long-context reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose Multi-Head Latent Linear Attention (MDLA), a unified attention architecture that integrates low-rank joint compression, linear attention, and a state space model (SSM)-based reconstruction mechanism. MDLA inherits the memory-efficient design of multi-head latent attention (MLA) while introducing a linearized attention formulation to achieve computational scalability and an SSMbased reconstruction module to restore sequential dependencies lost during compression. This hybrid design effectively balances efficiency and expressiveness, reducing both FLOPs and memory usage without compromising representational quality. Experimental results demonstrate that MDLA achieves up to 63.6% reduction in total computation compared with MLA at a 16 K -token sequence length, while maintaining competitive performance across language understanding benchmarks such as MMLU, HellaSwag, ARC, and TruthfulQA. These results confirm that MDLA provides an efficient and scalable foundation for next-generation large language models requiring long-context processing."

This paper examines concept drift types from the perspective of model accuracy and defines hybrid concept drift. It also introduces a novel method to detect drift from hybrid concepts. This method determines the occurrence of concept drift according to the change in the accuracy of the model and the type of drift according to the degree of recovery of the accuracy of the new model. Experimental analysis shows that the proposed method can accurately judge the drift type with hybrid concept drift."

Data sources included system-generated logs, institutional exam records, and post-exam student surveys. Results indicate that the system reduced suspected incidents of misconduct by 20–25% compared to Ruled-based automated proctoring, while enabling scalability across multiple disciplines. Despite these improvements, student feedback highlighted concerns regarding privacy, continuous surveillance, and algorithmic fairness. To address these issues, the study introduces a responsible proctoring framework emphasizing transparency, data protection, bias mitigation, and accountability.

Experimental results demonstrate that the swimming robot can attain a peak speed of 6.88 body lengths per second on the surface, which significantly outperforms single-mode counterparts while maintaining robust attitude control during rapid transitions.

A comprehensive analysis of low-frequency noise contributions from key receiver (RX) blocks including low-noise amplifier (LNA), mixer, local oscillator (LO) buffer, and analog baseband (ABB) circuits is conducted.

    "abstract": "Data augmentation is an effective technique for tackling data sparsity in sequential recommendation (SR). Existing methods generate new data during the model training to improve the performance. However, deploying them on a backbone model requires retraining, architecture modification, or introducing additional modules and learnable parameters. These processes are time-consuming and costly for well-trained models, especially when the model and data scales become large. In this work, we explore the test-time augmentation (TTA) for SR, which augments the input sequences during the inference phase and then fuses the model's predictions to improve final accuracy. It avoids the significant overhead associated with training-time augmentation. We first experimentally examine the potential of existing augmentation operators for TTA and find that the Substitute and Mask consistently achieve better performance. Further analysis reveals that these two operators retain the original sequential pattern while adding appropriate perturbations. Moreover, the random selection of augmentation positions creates suitable augmented samples from both semantic and temporal perspectives. Meanwhile, we find that the fixed operation ratio limits the diversity of augmented data, and the TTA may impair the model's performance on long sequences. In addition, the two operators still face time-consuming similarity-based item selection or interference from mask tokens. Based on the analysis and limitations, we present TNoise and TMask. The former injects uniform noise into the representation, avoiding the computational overhead of item selection. The latter blocks mask tokens from participating in model calculations (TMask-B) or directly removes interactions that should have been replaced with mask tokens (TMask-R). Further, we sample the augmentation ratio from a uniform distribution to improve the data diversity. For short sequences, we introduce a sequence smoothing and lengthening method based on inter-item interpolation. For long sequences, we set a threshold to avoid the negative effects of TTA. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and generalizability of our method."

    "abstract": "Engineering and quality professionals routinely use flowcharts and dataflow diagrams to model processes and information movement. However, these tools do not explicitly expose design tradeoffs created by competing functional requirements. Many real-world systems must simultaneously satisfy conflicting objectives such as cost versus usability, sustainability versus manufacturability, and reliability versus convenience. This article introduces contradiction diagrams as a practical visual method for identifying, structuring, and resolving such conflicts during early design stages. Contradiction diagrams map helpful and harmful functions and represent their interactions through producing and counteracting relationships, enabling teams to explicitly define the sources of performance tension within a system. By making tradeoffs visible, the method supports systems thinking and complements TRIZ-based inventive problem solving and Express Situation Assessment and Management (ESAM) software. A consumer packaging case study involving the design of a smaller, environmentally responsible bottle cap illustrates the approach. Multiple contradictions are modeled, including reduced material usage versus ease of opening and leak prevention. The diagrams guide structured questioning that expands the solution space and encourages separation of coupled variables through geometry, material selection, sealing strategies, and ergonomic features. Results demonstrate that contradiction diagrams improve cross-functional communication, accelerate ideation, and help teams generate innovative concepts prior to formal trade studies. The method provides a lightweight, scalable complement to traditional process tools and offers a systematic pathway to more balanced, sustainable, and user-centered engineering solutions."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a two-phase machine-learning (ML)-based approach for the design and performance forecasting of a wideband circular microstrip switched-beam antenna operating at the 2.6 GHz mid-band for 5G communication. In Phase 1, five supervised learning algorithms Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Support Vector Regression (SVR) are employed to model the relationship between the antenna’s geometric parameters (inner radius, outer radius, and slot gaps) and its resonant characteristics. The DT model achieves the highest prediction accuracy when benchmarked against CST full-wave simulation results, enabling reliable estimation of center frequency and impedance bandwidth without repeated electromagnetic simulations. In Phase 2, three machine learning models DT, RF, and KNN are trained using CST-generated datasets to predict the main-beam direction and bandwidth of the switched-beam structure based on the number, location, and distribution of short-circuited holes. The DT model again outperforms the others, achieving 94.56% accuracy in beam-direction prediction and 99.03% accuracy in bandwidth prediction. A prototype antenna fabricated on an FR-4 substrate demonstrates four-direction beam switching (0°, 90°, 180°, and 270°) with a measured impedance bandwidth of 380 MHz (2.48–2.86 GHz), closely matching both simulation and ML predictions. Compared with conventional trial-and-error simulation-based design workflows, the proposed framework significantly reduces antenna design time while maintaining high prediction accuracy, demonstrating the practical effectiveness of ML-assisted design for compact, cost-effective, and energy-efficient 5G antennas."

    "abstract": "In 3GPP networks, Access Traffic Steering, Switching, and Splitting (ATSSS) is specified to enable network-assisted use of multiple paths based on a multipath-enabled QUIC tunnel. Using multiple paths can introduce packet reordering because of path asymmetry, loss, and differing delays. Packet reordering may be mistaken for congestion and thus lead to unnecessary reductions in throughput. While various packet-based schedulers have been proposed to address these issues, stream-aware concepts have not been widely explored when multiple end-to-end flows use the same tunnel. In this paper, we present our scheduling framework that supports stream-aware scheduling and compare state-of-the-art packet-based schedulers to stream-aware approaches in the multipath tunnel scenario, with particular focus on the Bandwidth-Limited Application Demand Estimating (BLADE) scheduler. Our results show that stream-aware scheduling concepts mitigate reordering and improve throughput in this scenario. This paper provides an overview of the current state of stream-aware scheduling for proxy scenarios. Future work is necessary and should investigate stream-aware techniques, adapt packet-based schedulers to be stream-aware, and propose novel stream-aware schedulers."

    "abstract": "Electrically small antennas face a seemingly insoluble dilemma. As engineers make headway in efficiency by boosting the device quality factor (Q), the bandwidth necessarily drops. Any wins in bandwidth conversely deteriorate the already low efficiency. The result is that cutting edge designs that boast of high efficiencies also have notoriously low bandwidths. This is untenable for commercial and military applications. One future platform that exemplifies this is the mechanical resonance based piezoelectric antenna array. The high Q piezoelectric material allows even a single 1D bar element to be four orders of magnitude more efficient than an optimized 3D metallic antenna at the same form factor but at a bandwidth roughly 1/1000th of the operating frequency. This work presents a method of partially overcoming these bandwidth deficiencies by utilizing a mechanical tuning method unique to piezoelectric antenna arrays. In such devices, the array spacing alters the stiffness of the piezoelectric elements which thus alters the resonance frequency without significantly diminishing the efficiency. Thus, a frequency band may be scanned by mechanically altering the array spacing. This frequency band is referred to as the mechanically tuned half-power bandwidth (MT-HPBW), which is roughly two orders of magnitude larger than the traditional HPBW. Additional improvements in bandwidth are realized by utilizing multiple resonance modes. An algorithm capable of performing full-wave simulations on such piezoelectric antenna arrays is presented with modifications with respect to previous work. Computational and design guidance is also provided based on the authors' own experiences."

Onboard motor commands and inertial measurement unit (IMU) signals are processed to enable the robot to essentially “feel” the presence of nearby obstacles through aerodynamic interactions. The physics of IPE, along with Shannon information, are used to tailor the input space and train a deep neural network (DNN) to estimate the distance to ground, ceiling, and wall features. Simulation and physical experimental results demonstrate reliable and robust obstacle detection and collision avoidance with a median distance estimation accuracy of 93.35%, 89.22%, and 90.67% for ground, ceiling, and wall, respectively. This new form of “sensing” is useful in environments with fog, smoke, dust, rain, or snow, where traditional proximity sensors and vision-based systems struggle to detect obstacles and determine distance."

Wind-solar towers use solar irradiance and wind speed to generate energy but due to the complex nature of interaction between the various environment variables, wind-solar towers are relatively hard to predict the thermal updraft due to the interaction between the solar irradiance, air temperature, and wind velocity. A complete dataset that covers 90 days is used, and various machine-learning models, such as linear regression, support vector machines, and neural networks, are tested to make a prediction of thermal updraft. The findings show that among all the alternative models, linear regression had a much superior predictability and efficiency in computation. The obtained result showed a close-toperfect fit, <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathrm{R}^{2}$</tex> being equal to 0.98 and indicating the extremely high ability of the regression model to make predictions of the updraft velocity under heterogeneous environmental conditions. Sensitivity analysis had demonstrated that solar irradiance and wind speed are the best predictors of thermal updraft thereby offering insights that would be adopted to streamline the hybrid renewable energy system, and energy forecasting with potential to boost power generation especially during days with low solar irradiance."

However, the three-phase current source rectifier has an inherent current ripple problem, which seriously affects the current quality on the output side. This paper reveals that the root cause of the current ripple of the DC bus inductor of the three-phase current source rectifier lies in the high-frequency ripple generated by the switching of the spatial vector sequence. An improved current source rectifier current ripple suppression scheme is proposed. By constructing a current compensation circuit through transformers, capacitors and inductors, the current ripple on the output side is effectively reduced, and the current quality is improved without changing the switching frequency. By further analyzing the working principle, the conditions for suppressing current ripple were derived, and the parameters of the circuit devices were designed in detail. Simulation verification was carried out on the Matlab/Simulink simulation software."

Two of the parasitic lines are designed to control the half-power beamwidth (HPBW) in the E-plane, whereas the other two control the H-plane. The coverage reconfigurability is achieved by activating or deactivating the PIN diodes of the parasitic lines. By turning OFF the PIN diodes of the parasitic lines, the influence of the parasitic lines can be minimized, resulting in a narrower beam. In contrast, turning the diodes ON broadens the radiation pattern. The measured results confirm the coverage adaptability, demonstrating HPBW switching from 102° to 155° in the E-plane and from 95° to 142° in the H-plane."

    "abstract": "In practical classification problems, imbalanced class distribution is very common. Traditional classification methods usually aim at optimizing the overall accuracy, which leads to classification decisions biased towards categories with a large number of samples. Similar to most traditional classifiers, Naive Bayes (NB) is sensitive to the class prior distribution and has poor recognition performance for minority class samples, which restricts its application in imbalanced classification. Therefore, we propose a Bayesian classifier based on distance-corrected multivariate kernel density estimation (BC-DMKDE). BC-DMKDE relaxes the assumptions regarding conditional independence and the normality of continuous variables in NB classifiers, by incorporating the multivariate kernel density estimation (MKDE). We also incorporate a distance-correction mechanism utilizing kernel density estimation, specifically to alleviate the impact of class imbalance and overlapping data samples. Across 18 real-world benchmarks, BC-DMKDE exhibits superior classification performance and robustness, outperforming existing methods at both the algorithm and data levels."

    "abstract": "The evolution of literary genres over time encapsulates deep cultural, linguistic, and philosophical shifts within human expression. The current work presents a new deep learning model, Neural Histories, which is intended to capture and track the diachronic development of English literary genres between the 18th and the 21stcentury. An annotated corpus of canonical and non-canonical texts was built, annotated in time, augmented by metadata of genre and divided into literary periods. Stylmetric features and semantic embeddings that used ELMo were obtained in order to represent surface-level and contextual regularities. Our models were Bi-LSTM and Transformer, with Time-Aware Neural Attention (TANA) being added to learn historical shifts in genre. They were tracked with the help of the Neural Dynamic Topic Modeling (NDTM), and the genre development was represented through Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) and PCA. The given Bi-LSTM + TANA model reached the average classification accuracy of 89.1, which exceeded those of standard Bi-LSTM (83.7) and Transformer-only models (86.3). Also, semantic drift indications have shown obvious changes, including how the genre of Gothic shifted to become the psychological horror and how Modernism shifted to fragmentation of identity. SHAP analysis was used to gain interpretability and the impact of narrative features, temporal markers and topic centroids was highlighted. This is not just a better way to perform genre classification, but it also provides a computational spectacle through which literary scholars can understand genre mutation, hybridity, and decline. This approach of reconciling computational linguistics and literary theory opens novel vistas of critical inquiry into the history of the genre in English literature: Neural Histories."

This paper proposes an electrocardiogram (ECG)-based biometric encryption framework that derives cryptographic keys from the unique, time-varying R wave to R wave intervals of a patient’s ECG signal. These person-specific keys enhance confidentiality, ensure authenticity and resist spoofing, thereby mitigating risks such as identity theft and data breaches. The research used the Massachusetts Institute of Technology-Beth Israel Hospital Arrythmia Database and achieved 89.74% accuracy, a false acceptance rate of 0.00%, a false rejection rate (FRR) of 21.05%, a true positive rate of 78.95%, a true negative rate of 100% and an equal error rate of 1.5%. Although the FRR indicates scope for optimisation, the results demonstrate the feasibility of integrating proposed biometric-driven encryption into telemedicine platforms.

However, during operation, these cables are subjected to coupled mechanical and thermal stresses, leading to heat accumulation and subsequent thermal degradation and carbonization of the insulation layer, which often precedes open-flame ignition. To enable early-stage fire warning and rapid suppression in underground utility tunnels, it proposes a novel carbonized-layer recognition model, YOLO-CC. The model facilitates real-time identification of carbonization evolution stages and prediction of future degradation trends based on detection results. Nine groups of heat accumulation experiments under various operating conditions were conducted, followed by quantitative analysis and predictive modeling using experimental data. Experimental results indicate that the YOLO-CC model achieves superior detection accuracy in carbonized-layer monitoring. Furthermore, the proposed time-series-based quantification and information prediction algorithms successfully delineate distinct carbonization evolution stages and precisely identify ignition points. Overall, the YOLO-CC framework establishes a new technical paradigm for early warning of high-voltage cable fires and provides a solid theoretical foundation for the development of intelligent early warning systems."

    "abstract": "The emphasis on data-driven control has increased in recent years, even though the concept is over 100 years old. In one class of such controllers, the objective is to identify a model of the controlled plant and then control using any model-based control technique. Alternatively, methods have been introduced to tune the controller's parameters using the available data directly. Apart from these two, methods have evolved recently based on using a simplified mathematical representation of the plant, typically called model-free control (MFC). MFC is attractive as the objective is to control a plant without explicitly using a mathematical model. It is advantageous if the complex process can be controlled using a simpler model that may not wholly represent the entire process. Many successful applications have been reported. In contrast, model-based control based on the mathematical description of the behaviour has been studied and extensively used. This paper addresses the question of which data-driven controller to use in the context of a class of nonlinear discrete-time systems. It compares a method based on partial linearisation with a technique based on feedforward neural networks. The former is a model-free control and requires no prior information about the plant's dynamics. The latter, a modelbased control technique with minimal prior information, can provide significantly better tracking performance."

In this paper, a Residual Sequence learning model is proposed that leverages the strength of both LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) design in forecasting short-acting insulin dosing from actual clinical data. The model is intended to detect both long-term patterns and short-term fluctuations in the glucose-insulin dynamics of patients.Intensive preprocessing methods were employed, including time-series transformation of glucose events, cyclical encoding of temporal features, and creating advanced lag-based and interaction features to learn historical and contextual physiological patterns.The Residual Sequence Learning Model model was compared with baseline hybrid LSTM-GRU, LSTM-Transformer, and GRU-Transformer architectures. The experimental insights demonstrate that the Residual sequence learning model performs noticeably better in prediction accuracy than the baseline hybrid LSTM-GRU model, with an improvement in R2 score from 0.62 to 0.805, a decrease in MAE from 1.43 to 1.29, and a decrease in MSE from 8.29 to 3.27. The outcomes show that the model has the potential to be a useful and customized decision-support tool for diabetes insulin treatment."

    "abstract": "The integration of Russian Formalist principles into cinematic analysis presents a novel opportunity to explore literariness through intelligent systems. In this work, the author suggests a computational model, which uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV) to address the topics of narrative structure, defamiliarization and repetition of motifs in movie texts and images. Basic Russian Formalist ideas like ostranenie (defamiliarization), fabula and syuzhet are formalized into Bi-GRU sequence modeling networks, YOLO vision systems to detect visual disruption and attention systems to mine motifs. Multi-modal embedding strategy is a strategy that combines both textual and visual attributes to derive a Cinematic Literariness Score (CLS). Assessment on 10 movies (Mirror, Persona, Rashomon, and The Color of Pomegranates) shows a high agreement in the case of expert critics, giving an average of 90.3, F1-score of 0.902, and Cohen kappa values of over 0.84. Scene-level defamiliarization detection represented consistent performance at the level of DII scores over 0.75 on highly formalist films. The human-AI consensus on identifying motifs was 91.4% and inter-rater reliability i.e. 0.85. The findings confirm the interpretive strength of the model, and its correspondence to the Russian Formalist theory. Combining narrative, linguistic, and visual, this framework provides explainable and quantitative research of cinematic literariness. New areas of research, such as cross-cultural adaptation to the narrative and intermediality, as well as AI-assisted film criticism, are also opened by the system. The work provides a fundamental connection between humanities and intelligent computation, both to narrative theory and media analytics."

To make the segmentation model more applicable to actual medical scenarios. We propose a multi-scale adaptive spatial attention network, which balances the high performance and computational efficiency of the model. A lightweight adaptive multi-branch convolution block is designed to balance accuracy and complexity, and the feature extraction ability of the network is enhanced without excessively increasing network parameters and ensuring lightweight. A spatial attention module that can dynamically adjust the obtained structural feature weights is designed, which not only improves the accuracy of the cup-disc segmentation task, but also significantly reduces the amount of parameters and reduces the computational burden. The Dice coefficients on the test set are 0.9676, 0.8563 for the optic cup region and 0.9632, 0.8871 for the optic disc region, respectively. The proposed method achieves competitive results compared to other state-of-the-art methods."

    "abstract": "In recent years, model predictive control methods have gained widespread application in permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) control due to their rapid response and suitability for multi-variable constraints. The traditional three-vector MPCC strategy has attracted scholarly attention for its potential to further enhance control accuracy by increasing the number of voltage vectors. Nevertheless, conventional three-vector MPCC still suffers from computational complexity, large torque ripple, and substantial fluctuations in the q-axis current. To further optimize control performance and reduce computational complexity, this paper proposes an enhanced three-vector MPCC strategy. This approach introduces a virtual voltage vector to mitigate steady-state error and dynamic fluctuations, while employing a space vector ratio method for precise calculation of vector action time. Concurrently, a binary search method is employed to determine the sub-sector where the reference voltage vector resides rapidly. Finally, simulation analysis under sudden load conditions for built-in permanent magnet synchronous motors validates the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed strategy."

    "abstract": "In scenarios involving non-contact millimeter wave (MMW) imaging, the information acquired through two-dimensional (2-D) imaging is inherently constrained, necessitating three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction to achieve comprehensive analysis. However, it is challenging to simultaneously fulfill the criteria of both accuracy and efficiency by employing solely time-domain or frequency-domain algorithms. In order to address this challenge, this paper proposes an efficient 3-D reconstruction algorithm based on the fusion of time-domain and frequency-domain for MMW radar. Firstly, the Flatiron Institute nonuniform fast Fourier transform (FiNUFFT) is employed to mitigate the effects of range cell migration in the range-height domain with a high computing efficiency. Subsequently, the accelerated fast factorized back projection (AFFBP) algorithm is applied in the range-azimuth domain. The fast Fourier transform (FFT) and spectrum shifting are adopted to implement the fusion of 2-D spectrums of each subaperture range-azimuth data, which circumvent the time-consuming 2-D interpolation used in the recursive fusion process of the FFBP algorithm and substantially improve both the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. The validity of the proposed algorithm is confirmed through simulation experiments and real data processing."

The proposed approach improves distributed machine learning security, privacy, and integrity, particularly in delicate fields like healthcare. Contributions from other datasets help the model get better, but patient data is kept private and blockchain guarantees the integrity of the updates to the model. ZeroKnowledge Proofs (ZKP) guarantee that customers can demonstrate the accuracy of their model upgrades without disclosing any personal information. FLBC- ZKP uses cryptographic proofs to remove this requirement for confidence. FLBC-ZKP models exhibit competitive accuracy rates in healthcare applications, guaranteeing confidentiality and privacy without compromising predictive performance. Contri- butions from other datasets improve the model, but patient information is kept confidential and the blockchain ensures the accuracy of model updates. Compared to regular FL, FLBC-ZKP delivers superior privacy and security through blockchain and ZKP, making it particularly suitable for sensitive healthcare data, while maintaining high accuracy.

This framework combines the strengths of knowledge-driven and data-driven approaches: the high-level strategy employs Behavior Trees for modular and interpretable task decision-making (e.g., active search, focused monitoring), providing the system with a reliable tactical baseline and rapid response capability. The low-level control utilizes an Actor-Critic based HRL architecture to manage heterogeneous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Unmanned Surface Vessels (USVs) for continuous action execution. To enhance training efficiency and policy stability, a curriculum learning mechanism and a progressive opponent modeling strategy are designed, alongside dedicated reward functions tailored for search and monitoring tasks. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively mitigates the cold-start problem in reinforcement learning, accelerates the training process, and ultimately converges to high-performance and stable cooperative policies. This research provides a structured, scalable, and interpretable solution for multi-agent cooperative decision-making in complex dynamic environments."

The proposed system, CrossAlign, uses task-adapted transformer encoders (BERT and RoBERTa) for text, a vision transformer backbone for images, cross-modal attention with contrastive learning, and parameter-efficient adapters for scalability.

    "abstract": "Phased array antennas are a cornerstone of next-generation communication and radar systems, where precise beam steering is essential. In practical applications, the use of 6-bit Beamforming Integrated Circuits (BFICs) imposes discrete phase control, while mutual coupling between antenna elements introduces significant errors, making conventional beam steering calculations based on Array Factor (AF) theory inaccurate. This paper proposes a novel deep learning framework to overcome these limitations. We designed and compared three deep learning architectures—Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)—to predict the optimal phase correction values for a 4x4 microstrip patch array. The models are trained on a dataset generated via full-wave electromagnetic simulations to learn the complex, non-linear relationship between the target beam angle and the required phase compensation. The results demonstrate that the proposed models, particularly the 1D-CNN, can effectively learn to compensate for mutual coupling and quantization effects, predicting the precise phase configurations required to steer the beam to the target angle with high accuracy. This approach enables real-time, high-precision phase calibration without the need for complex iterative simulations, paving the way for intelligent antenna systems."

    "abstract": "A power electronic device that is becoming more common in medium-voltage and high-power electric systems is the multilayer inverter. Because of their special construction, multilevel inverters can achieve high voltages with lower harmonic content and electromagnetic interference (EMI). By employing several semiconductor switches with the insertion of the lowest voltages in DC, the multi-level inverter produces alternating voltage that is higher power, smoother, and less distorted than the traditional two-level inverter. Multilevel inverter architectures offer the unique benefit of operating at high dc-bus voltages for greater power applications. Switching devices are connected in series to achieve this. As the number of output voltages grows the output voltage waveform's harmonic content decreases. Furthermore, alternating between different voltage levels reduces output voltage harmonics. These days, there are three distinct topologies that may be used: flying capacitor, diode clamped, and cascaded H-bridge. In this project, we will evaluate the THD of these multi-level inverters and examine the various multi-inverter topologies in MATLAB Simulink at a fixed level (i.e., at 11 levels) using various loads, such as a motor load and a series RLC load."

    "abstract": "The rapid expansion of cloud computing has made it increasingly difficult for users to determine the most appropriate cloud service provider (CSP). The provider offers diverse services, typically assessed based on quality of service (QoS) attributes, including throughput, reliability, availability, latency, and response time. Researchers often present these QoS attributes in a decision matrix and apply multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) algorithms to evaluate and rank the CSPs. However, in practical scenarios, not all CSPs satisfy every QoS attribute, leading to unavailable performance measure values in a decision matrix. To address this challenge, we develop a hybrid MADM framework for CSP selection that handles an incomplete decision matrix. The framework integrates QoS-aware MADM (QMADM) algorithms, QTOPSIS-W and QVIKOR-W with attribute weights (QMADM-W). It employs three imputation techniques to determine unavailable performance values: minimum (min), maximum (max), and mean. The weights are derived using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the analytic network process (ANP). Simulation results using the QoS for web services (QWS) dataset demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in QTPOSIS-W, with consistent and robust performance observed under the mean imputation technique through sensitivity analysis. The proposed algorithms offer a reliable solution for selecting an optimal CSP, even for an incomplete decision matrix."

For semi-structured data, we perform ontology-driven knowledge extraction to transform business data into a graph. We then integrate spatial relationships via URI matching and rule-based mapping to build a spatiotemporal knowledge graph of cultivated land, effectively coupling operational information with spatiotemporal information. The resulting graph supports rapid querying and underpins the construction of foundational knowledge bases for large models in the natural resources field."

A recent video augmentation strategy addresses scene bias by mixing human regions from one video with the background from another. However, this often produces artifacts due to limitations in the video mixing process, which degrade training quality. This study proposes a video augmentation strategy that produces compatible action-scene video pairs rather than choosing them randomly, to improve the quality of mixed videos. To achieve this, two compatibility metrics are introduced to guide this selection to significantly reduce the occurrence of visual artifacts and generate higher-quality augmented videos. Our method improves alignment between actions which leads to more effective augmentation. The performances are further enhanced by applying a temporal morphological operation to improve object detection consistency. Experimental results on the UCF101, HMDB51, and Kinetics-100 datasets show that our approach improves classification performance.

Moreover, most of the existing methods for finding the OSC do not take cost into consideration. To address the issues, the method of OSC selection based on cost-sensitivity and sequential three-way decision (S3WD) is proposed, which minimizes the total cost while preserving the classification ability. Firstly, a new strategy of optimal granularity selection that adopts attribute reduction followed by scale selection for MDS is proposed to remove the redundant attributes. Secondly, a new measurement of scale significance is defined and a forward heuristic optimal scale selection strategy is proposed. Finally, the OSC selection model based on cost-sensitivity and S3WD is proposed to determine the OSC with the minimum total cost while preserving the classification ability. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly reduce the cost of finding the OSC."

    "abstract": "In response to the challenge of non-native Chinese speech recognition under low-resource conditions, this paper proposes a LLM-based adaptive fine-tuning model featuring token bias adapter and convolutional adapter for accented Chinese speech recognition. The token bias adapter module is inserted between the self-attention layer and the feed-forward layer of the pre-trained large speech model to obtain the speech token deviation vector matching the target accent. A convolutional adaptation module is inserted after the feed-forward layer to capture local receptive field encoding and refine the feature representations. Experimental results on the open-source and self-built datasets encompassing eight nations demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, achieving a character error rate of 0.2088, with a parameter size approximately 2.65% of fully fine-tuned models."

    "abstract": "Current camera-based hand tracking is limited by occlusion and environmental factors, hindering practical applications in robotics and digital interaction. Although electromyography-based tracking offers a robust alternative, a fine movement regression, such as pen trajectory prediction, remains challenging. This study addresses the problem of predicting 2 dimensional axes’ velocities of a pen using 8-channel forearm electromyography signals. We propose a novel deep learning approach based on the decomposed electromyography methodology, which transforms complex raw signals into latent and independent muscle activation patterns for effective movement command learning. Furthermore, we integrate a signal reconstruction mechanism during the training process. By minimizing the reconstruction loss, the model is jointly optimized for both velocity decoding accuracy and physiological fidelity of the signal representation. This approach allows for the experimental validation of a model that utilizes the muscle signals alone to predict the continuous pen input, demonstrating the feasibility and potential for advancing camera-free digital handwriting and human-computer interaction."

This work proposes an automated diagnostic system for ADHD and ASD by investigating FC among brain regions. We used publicly available restingstate functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) data for ADHD, ASD and age-matched healthy (HC) subjects. The rsfMRI data helps to analyse the temporal activity in the brain, and computing FC using time-series data helps to capture the temporal correlation among regions. We used five diverse FC measures and performed three classification tasks: ASD vs. ADHD, ASD vs. HC and ADHD vs. HC. Further, we finetuned the pre-trained VGG19 model to develop a decision model. The best accuracy of 99.09% for ASD vs. ADHD, 78.18% for ADHD vs. HC and 65.46% for ASD vs. HC demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed method. The disrupted regions are also identified using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), an explainable artificial intelligence method, that are in accordance with the literature.

    "abstract": "Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a progressive retinal disease and a primary contributor to preventable blindness globally. Early detection through automated systems can significantly improve clinical outcomes, but such systems must be both accurate and interpretable to gain trust in medical settings. This research introduces an interpretable deep learning framework that integrates Ben Graham image enhancement with Grad-CAM++ visualization for robust DR grading. A modified MobileNetV3-Large architecture is employed, fine-tuned with a custom classifier and trained on a balanced dataset using weighted random sampling to address severe class imbalance across five DR stages. The pre-processing pipeline incorporates circular cropping and Gaussian unsharp masking, enhancing critical retinal structures such as microaneurysms, haemorrhages, and exudates, while preserving diagnostic integrity. Grad-CAM++ is used to generate pixel-level attention maps that provide insight into the model's decision process, making the predictions more explainable to clinicians. The model achieves a validation accuracy of 93.2 % reflecting high consistency across classes. Class-wise precision, recall, and F1 scores further confirm balanced learning and generalization. Visualizations consistently highlight clinically relevant regions, supporting the interpretability of the predictions. This combination of enhancement and explain ability techniques offers a practical and trustworthy approach to DR screening. The framework bridges the gap between deep learning performance and medical transparency, offering a deployable solution for real-world ophthalmic diagnosis and decision support."

Nevertheless, the heterogeneity of data modalities used to characterize collaborative entity profiles, along with the intricate nonlinear correlations embedded within such multi-source data, substantially elevates the challenge of precise entity performance forecasting. To tackle these obstacles and achieve reliable entity performance prediction, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional XGBoost-based entity profiling and prediction framework, encompassing three core modules: systematic data acquisition, multi-modal data preprocessing, and the construction of a customized multi-dimensional XGBoost model for entity profile inference. Moreover, to strengthen model interpretability—a critical requirement for governance decision-making—targeted feature importance analysis is implemented across distinct entity profiling labels, thereby revealing the quantitative and qualitative impacts of various factors on entity operational performance. Experimental validation is conducted using real-world industrial datasets from a Shanghai-based automotive manufacturer, and the results demonstrate that the proposed framework can not only conduct in-depth entity profile data analytics and achieve high-precision entity profile prediction, but also generate interpretable inference outcomes to underpin data-driven intelligent collaborative governance decisions.."

The main objective is to reduce frequency fluctuations and tie-line power deviations arising from sudden load variations, particularly under nonlinear conditions such as Generator Rate Constraints (GRC). The effectiveness of the proposed SSOA-PIDn controller is validated through simulation studies under two different operational scenarios. Comparative analysis reveals that the SSOA-based tuning achieves superior performance over classical and several well-known metaheuristic optimization methods in terms of Integral of Time-weighted Absolute Error (ITAE) and system settling time. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis under parameter uncertainties confirms the robustness and reliability of the proposed method for practical deployment in modern interconnected power systems."

Although research on high-resolution networks has achieved remarkable performance, their heavy reliance on standard convolutions results in a high parameter count and considerable computational burden. In response to this limitation, we introduce the Simplified Group Coordinate Attention Convolutional Network (SGGC-Net)—a redesigned lightweight high-resolution model that integrates two novel modules: the SGneck bottleneck module and the GCblock residual module. By effectively combining depthwise separable convolutions with linear operations and embedding a coordinate attention mechanism, our model significantly reduces complexity while preserving rich spatial information. Additionally, we incorporate an Unbiased Data Processing (UDP) to mitigate alignment errors and improve detection accuracy. Our method is evaluated on the MS COCO and MPII datasets, where it improves detection accuracy and outperforms heavier networks like HRNet. SGGC-Net reduces parameters and computational complexity by over 40% compared to HRNet, achieving a favorable trade-off between performance and resource efficiency for practical deployment in human keypoint detection."

    "abstract": "Mobile payment systems are growing in popularity as more people use smartphones, which also attracts fraudsters. As a result, mobile money fraud is increasing, especially in developing countries. However, security concerns in mobile money services have gained attention because weak security has kept many customers away. Fraud is not a new problem, but it still costs the global economy billions of dollars each year. Financial transaction data, including mobile money transactions, are mostly labeled as legitimate, making fraud detection difficult. Researchers have developed various fraud detection methods using various machine learning techniques like LGBM, random forests, SVM, deep learning, neural networks, XGBoost, and logistic regression have been tested to identify fraudulent transactions through data preparation, feature engineering, and model building. However, machine learning models trained on imbalanced data tend to be biased toward legitimate transactions, making them unreliable. This study aims to use machine learning classifiers to detect fraud in mobile money transfers. The data comes from real-time transactions that mimic common fraud schemes. This research explores the development and evaluation of ML models for fraud detection and proposes a solution using a hybrid ML approach with effective hyperparameter tuning, and the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). The results show that the proposed approach improves accuracy by addressing data imbalance. The findings contribute to the development of better fraud detection systems for mobile money services."

This paper designs and implements a set of interactive analysis web platforms for fundus images based on the SpringBoot framework to provide an integrated solution for the full-process intelligent diagnosis of fundus diseases. The platform completes the remote deployment and efficient scheduling of deep learning-assisted diagnosis models. At the same time, it focuses on front-end usability development and builds key modules such as user rights management, image secure upload, model online reasoning, dynamic visualization of analysis results, and historical record tracing. It supports users in the entire closed-loop process from image upload, intelligent analysis to report generation. Experimental results show that the platform is fully functional, and the average adaptation time for medical staff does not exceed 15 minutes. Regarding diagnostic performance, the integrated deep learning models achieved an average diagnostic accuracy of 96.5% and a Dice coefficient of 0.89 for choroid segmentation on the test dataset, verifying their clinical utility. In the performance test, under the pressure of 100 concurrent users, the average response time of the core model inference interface was less than 1 second, the throughput was stable at more than 41 req/s, and the system ran robustly. This platform has significantly improved the efficiency and accuracy of fundus disease diagnosis, provided reliable software framework support for AI technology to empower clinical research, and has strong engineering application value and clinical promotion prospects."

This paper presents a structured review and conceptual framework centered on the VELscope device, a non-invasive autofluorescence imaging system that employs blue light (400–460 nm) to excite intrinsic fluorophores. Healthy mucosa typically exhibits green fluorescence, whereas dysplastic or malignant tissues demonstrate loss of fluorescence (LOF), appearing darker under examination. No new experiments were conducted; instead, this work synthesizes current evidence on VELscope's working principles, diagnostic performance, and clinical relevance, while highlighting advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and spectroscopy. AI-based models, including machine learning and deep learning approaches, have shown promise in improving classification accuracy, while spectroscopy provides complementary biochemical confirmation. However, challenges persist, including high false-positive rates, inter-operator variability, and limited availability of large annotated datasets. The primary contributions of this work are twofold: (i) a systematic synthesis of existing VELscope-based literature and its integration with AI and spectroscopy, and (ii) the proposal of a conceptual AI-spectroscopy workflow to guide future research. This positions VELscope as a potential pathway toward intelligent, cost-effective, and community-deployable screening solutions for oral cancer."

Hence, this study proposes an optimization framework incorporating Future Load Profile Nominations (FLPN) as proactive, consumer-declared forecasts for energy dispatch planning, enabling a Proactive Energy Management (PEM) approach to grid operations. The IEEE 14-bus system is used as a testbed, with PV, BESS, and EV assets scaled proportionally to static loads at each bus. Dispatch optimization is performed under Philippine time-of-use pricing using a Monte Carlo approach to model FLPN uncertainty. Three scenarios are evaluated: (i) baseline dispatch without FLPN, (ii) FLPN-assisted dispatch with flexible EV charging, and (iii) FLPN-assisted dispatch with bidirectional Vehicle-to-Grid participation. Results show that while FLPN visibility alone yields limited operational benefits, its integration with flexible and controllable EVs achieves substantial improvements, reducing dispatch costs by up to 6.8% and lowering grid dependency up to 3%. This approach aims to contribute to achieving United Nation Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) and 13 (Climate Action) by promoting proactive, more resilient, and consumer-integrated energy management strategies."

    "abstract": "Interpretability is vital in safety-critical domains such as defense, where understanding model behavior is crucial for building trust, ensuring accountability, and supporting decision-making. Traditional local explanation techniques, such as Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), often neglect the causal relationships among input features. This oversight can result in misleading or spurious interpretations, particularly in complex, high-stakes environments. To address this limitation, we propose Causal LIME, an extension of LIME that incorporates causal graphs to guide the generation of perturbations in a manner consistent with the underlying data-generating mechanisms. This ensures that explanations respect the causal structure of the domain, leading to more trustworthy insights. We evaluate Causal LIME along three dimensions: (i) comparative analysis with traditional LIME, (ii) validation against permutation-based feature importance, and (iii) application to real-world military sensor data for vehicle classification. Experimental results demonstrate that Causal LIME produces more stable, causally grounded explanations, reinforcing its value in mission-critical AI applications where interpretability, reliability, and trust are paramount."

    "abstract": "In Singapore's polyclinics, touch-based self-service kiosks are widely used for administrative functions such as appointment scheduling and billing. However, these systems pose accessibility challenges for elderly patients, often resulting in increased staff workload and longer wait times. This paper presents VoCare AI, a voice-first conversational assistant designed to streamline healthcare administrative tasks through multiagent workflows powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). The system integrates a graph-based orchestration framework (LangGraph) with specialized agents that manage NRIC-based identity verification, appointment handling, billing queries, and general FAQ responses. It features a fine-tuned Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model adapted for Singapore-accented English (Singlish), trained on the IMDA National Speech Corpus to handle accent variability, code-switching, and elderly speech patterns. Evaluation results show that the best-performing ASR model achieved a Word Error Rate (WER) of 22.22%, while the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module demonstrated strong performance with 1.00 groundedness and 0.92 retrieval relevance. By focusing on Singapore's linguistic diversity and incorporating localized authentication mechanisms, this work demonstrates how AI-driven conversational agents can enhance accessibility and operational efficiency in public healthcare environments.

A MobileNetV2 architecture is used for species identification which involves features like rescaling, dense connections, and dropout that minimizes over fitting. The dataset includes both healthy and diseased fishes which are used for training and evaluating the model. Adam optimizer and early stopping methods are used for performance enhancement. The research emphasizes the ability of deep learning model to improve the efficiency and accuracy in fish species identification and disease detection by handling challenges like availability of high-quality dataset and challenges related to species diversity.

Proper and prompt fault localization is essential in supporting and ensuring stability of the system as well as reducing downtime. The proposed architecture PIA-GNN is a hybrid of graph neural networks and physics-informed attention created to learn topological and physical power grid laws. The framework treats buses as nodes and transmission line as edges and introduces electrical measures, and line parameters in the learning process and applies the laws of Kirchhoff in guiding attention weight. It is experimentally tested on real fault dataset that PIA-GNN achieves an accuracy of 98.99% in fault localization and is sufficiently robust in noisy, incomplete and dynamic working conditions. The attention mechanism has the capability of providing interpretable facts that they extract the role that important buses and lines are involved in the determination of a fault. Such results indicate that the framework is an exceptionally efficient, stable, and explainable model that offers practical help to grid operators to recognize, isolate as well as overcome faults using multi-faceted power systems."

Three key modules are proposed detailly, language indication enhancement, vision-language input enhancement, and dynamic prompt fusion. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated on three datasets: TNL2K, LaSOT, and OTB99-Lang.

    "abstract": "In recent years, autonomous inspection using unmanned devices has become increasingly vital in substations, with drones emerging as a preferred choice due to their maneuverability and ability to navigate complex, multi-level environments. Traditional real-time localization relies heavily on GPS; however, strong electromagnetic interference in substations severely limits GPS signal reliability, compromising positioning accuracy. Additionally, dynamic changes in the local environment, such as the appearance or disappearance of obstacles, render static prior maps insufficient, potentially leading to collisions. To address these challenges, we propose a navigation system for substation drones based on Lidar-Inertial Odometry (LIO), enabling robust localization while dynamically updating local prior maps and replanning local paths in response to real-time obstacle detection. Furthermore, considering the indoor-outdoor transitions typical of substations, we introduce a scene transition detection algorithm using local point cloud density, adaptively adjusting key parameters of the SLAM upon detecting environmental shifts. Field deployments confirm that our method delivers reliable navigation and robust obstacle handling, meeting the stringent demands of substation inspection."

To address this challenge, this paper proposes a Knowledge Graph Enhanced Bidirectional Intent-Aware Person-Job Recommendation Approach(KG-BIAM). The proposed method first constructs a domain-specific Knowledge Graph to enable multidimensional representation of user and job intents. Second, a cross-intent attention mechanism is designed to model the interaction between user intent and job intent, thereby enhancing matching accuracy. Finally, a multilayer graph convolutional network(GCN) is employed to aggregate semantic information from the Knowledge Graph and further refine the intent representations. Experimental evaluations are conducted on a real-world data set obtained from \"ZhaoPin.com\". The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing baseline models in key performance metrics such as AUC, F1-score and Balanced Accuracy, thereby validating its effectiveness."

Coefficient functions are estimated in a B-spline basis, and accuracy is evaluated by MAPE. To cope with limited abnormal data, we combine instance- and parameter-based transfer: an abnormal-trend coefficient learned from a source link is used to synthesize target abnormal samples around the target historical mean, and the predictor is retrained to adapt. Experiments on a Shenzhen link benchmark FANOVA against historical mean, LSTM, and SARIMA, indicating that the transferred model improves forecasting under abnormal congestion while maintaining strong performance in normal regimes."

To address this, the Duval Triangle and Duval Pentagon ratio characteristics were expanded as input features for the learning model, and the classification performance of RandomForest and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models was compared. Performance was validated using 5-fold cross-validation with five input feature sets. The MLP model achieved the highest performance when combined with absolute gas concentration and Duval Pentagon ratio characteristics, recording approximately 0.812 on the macro F1 metric.

Additionally, this research explores the development of AI-powered legal frameworks that facilitate global collaboration in cyber defence, guaranteeing that new technologies comply with transnational laws, ethical norms, and digital sovereignty. A proactive approach against ransomware, cyber espionage, and state-sponsored attacks is promoted by the incorporation of deep learning into the creation of cyber policies. This paper illustrates how AI-enhanced systems might increase international trust and resilience through case studies and simulated scenarios. In the end, this multidisciplinary approach offers a way to balance legal governance with technical innovation, strengthening global cybersecurity while upholding nation-state sovereignty."

The Kalman filter is used to obtain the IMU signals, while an adaptive filter is used to denoise the sEMG signals. From the combined IMU and sEMG recordings, clear trends emerge in peak leg curl power as a function of knee flexion angle; to visualize these patterns, we applied K-means clustering (k <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$=3)$</tex> to knee flexion angle <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\left(40^{\\circ}-115^{\\circ}\\right)$</tex> versus peak leg curl power (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$0.2-1.0 ~\\mathrm{W}$</tex>) across all repetitions, which revealed three regimes, low (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\approx 60^{\\circ}-80^{\\circ}, 0.5-0.8 ~\\mathrm{W}$</tex>), medium (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\approx 80^{\\circ}-95^{\\circ}$</tex>, <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$0.7-0.9 ~\\mathrm{W}$</tex>), and high (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\approx 95^{\\circ}-115^{\\circ}, 0.7-1.0 ~\\mathrm{W}$</tex>), highlighting typical performance zones.

The network employs MobileNetv4 as the backbone to substantially reduce computational complexity, integrates a coordinate attention mechanism to enhance spatial localization, and incorporates a squeeze-and-excitation-enhanced atrous spatial pyramid pooling (SE-ASPP) module for robust multi-scale feature extraction. Furthermore, a geometry-aware correction method is introduced to compensate for image misalignment and lens distortion by using the mortar pipe as a fixed geometric reference for accurate bow measurement. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high segmentation accuracy and low measurement error, while maintaining a lightweight structure suitable for real-time deployment on industrial edge devices.

    "abstract": "Network intrusion detection systems face significant challenges due to the extreme class imbalance in network traffic, where rare attack instances are vastly outnumbered by normal connections, as well as the inherent issue of varying sample difficulty. This paper proposes a dynamic adaptive framework for intrusion detection that incorporates both class frequency and sample difficulty. The framework employs a novel loss function that dynamically adjusts sample weights by integrating global class frequency information with real-time loss feedback. This approach simultaneously mitigates global class imbalance through inverse frequency weighting and prioritizes difficult-to-classify samples via a loss-adaptive mechanism. Comprehensive experiments on the NSL-KDD dataset demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances detection performance across multiple models. The MLP, LSTM, and CNN-LSTM models integrated with our framework achieved substantial improvements in macro-averaged metrics and notably increased recall rates for critical minority attacks. Specifically, the enhanced CNN-LSTM model improved the recall rate for R2L attacks by 27.11% and for U2R attacks by 11.50%. The proposed method provides an effective algorithm-level solution for addressing class imbalance in cybersecurity applications."

The employment of the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) Manifold Learning, and statistical analysis allowed the research to uncover hidden patterns of stress responses, assessing stress severity and binary classifications. Significant overlaps in moderate stress levels were observed between the mild and severe levels, confirming challenges in distinguishing stress levels. This led to the adoption of binary classifications, enhancing robustness and simplifying the outputs. Through statistical validation, it confirmed strong correlations between UMAP components and stress severity. Physiological markers, including HR, electrodermal activity (EDA), and accelerometer data (ACC), consistently exhibited high correlations with severe stress levels. While skin temperature (TEMP) and interbeat intervals (IBI) contributed to moderate stress differentiation. Finally, mild stress has a notable connection to blood volume pulse (BVP), IBI, and HR."

This paper rethinks the role of self-labeling in parametric classification for GCD and identifies that while self-labeling introduces training biases, it holds untapped potential for boosting model performance. We conduct an in-depth analysis of the reason why self-labeling fails in parametric classification and propose a Decoupled Self-labeling (DSL) approach that separates pseudo-labels generation from the predictive classification head. This design minimizes the learning bias introduced by unreliable pseudo-labels while preserving their utility for feature learning. Additionally, we introduce a label encoding risk minimization strategy that provides supervised guidance for unlabeled further extract valuable information from pseudo-labels. Comprehensive evaluations on GCD benchmarks demonstrate that DSL achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming parametric and non-parametric baselines, especially in the novel categories."

    "abstract": "Monitoring prediction is a key technology for cloud platforms to warn about risks and reduce business losses. Traditional monitoring prediction methods rely on large amounts of labelled data. These methods have high prediction errors and cannot easily lower data labelling costs or achieve accurate predictions. This paper focuses on two main limits of traditional methods: weak zero-shot inference (making predictions without prior examples) and poor capture of complex time-series features. This paper proposes an improved approach with three parts. First, a time-series feature encoder called PE-TSE is built (Piecewise Embedding-based Time-Series Encoder). It balances local features and maps them into a shared semantic space across different data types. Second, this paper adds a new attention mechanism called Cross-Var BiSA and a prediction head named CTPH (Convolutional Time-series Perception Head). This helps better capture dynamic relationships in time-series data with multiple variables and scales. Together, these form a general time-series forecasting model called PCC-GTF. It can adapt to new data and work well on unseen cases. This paper compares PCC-GTF with several mainstream forecasting algorithms. Our model performs significantly better on two key metrics: Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE) and Mean Scaled Interval Score (MSIS). This work provides a low-cost, high-accuracy solution for general time-series prediction in cloud monitoring."

However the major issue in the skin color recognition is the huge variation of tone with respect to race, region etc. Most of the methods and algorithms utilize the conventional RGB model for skin color recognition. However, this device dependent model has many limitations than advantages. So it is necessary to devise a unique color model for this skin color identification. The proposed method employed the derived YCbCr color space wherein the intensity (details) information is easily segregated from hue (color) information. The strong demarcation between the pixels identified by means of an appropriate and optimal threshold values of hue (chrominance) information i.e., chrominance red and green (Cb and Cr). The suggested method presents a simple but efficient way of solution to recognize human skin hue without complicated mathematical computation. This method is compared with RGB skin color segmentation to explore its supremacy. It is obvious that the planned scheme for the skin segmentation using threshold based YCbCr model offers a needy and valuable answer to many real time skin hue recognition applications wherein accuracy and computational cost is utmost important."

From this perspective, the vision inspection process detects surface defects in products before they are transferred to the client, making it a critical step in quality control. In this process, we focus not only on detecting defects to ensure credibility but also on removing false alarms, where nondefects are classified as defects, to improve company’s profits. However, most images in manufacturing datasets are assigned a single label, encoded as one-hot, to represent their class. This approach is not effective in alleviating false alarms, as all data points are assigned equal weight without reflecting the degree of defect. In this paper, we introduce defect degree-aware learning, which leverages defect degrees to rescale the weights, thereby enhancing product confidence and yield. Manually grading the degree is time-consuming and prone to human error. Therefore, we adopt both a metric learning scheme to automatically measure the degree and a learning-with-noisy-labels scheme to enhance robustness against noisy labels. In this manner, the proposed method improves performance compared to a vanilla supervised classification task, thus enhancing credibility with clients and contributing to profit growth."

This paper presents Project Akshara: A Deep Learning Microser vice for Low-Latency Indic Script Recognition, an end-to-end framework for accurate and efficient Kannada digit recognition. The Kannada-MNIST dataset, augmented with manually curated samples, was employed to train and evaluate three state-of theart deep learning architectures: EfficientNet-B0, GoogleNet, and SqueezeNetV2. Models were trained with a standardized 90-10 split and evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrices. Results demonstrate that EfficientNet-B0 achieved the highest accuracy (98.8 %), while GoogleNet reached 96.8% and SqueezeNet 95%. EfficientNet B0 also provided the best accuracy-efficiency trade-off, making it highly suitable for real-world applications.

In this paper, we formulate the problem as an online Prize-Collecting Traveling Salesman Problem (PC-TSP) with costs, capturing the inherent uncertainty and dynamic nature of search and rescue tasks. We propose an innovative approach that integrates the nearest-neighbor principle with an online linear programming strategy to guide UAVs in maximizing rescue success or the total value of discovered clues. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method over conventional offline planning techniques, highlighting its practical potential for real-time UAV decision-making in complex environments."

UAVs with mounted RIS can flexibly provide reliable connectivity to remote areas. In this paper, an RIS-mounted UAV is employed to improve the reliability of ship-to-shore communication. The proposed work aims to jointly optimize the beamforming vector of the transmit antenna (active beamforming), the phase shifts of RIS unit elements (passive beamforming) and the placement of an RIS-mounted UAV to maximize the receiver's capacity. The exact joint optimization for active/passive beamforming and positioning of RIS-mounted UAV is obtained by using Maximum Ratio Transmission (MRT) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). An approximate joint optimization, which maximizes an upper bound of the SNR, is also solved using MRT, semi-definite programming (SDP) with a closed-form solution for optimum position. It is found that when the distance between BS and user is equal to twice the height of UAV (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$D=2 h$</tex>), RIS should be placed vertically at the mid-point; for <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$D \\gg 2 h$</tex> the RIS may be placed directly above the BS or the user.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a graphene-based reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), comprised of a reflective type of meta-atoms. The proposed meta-atom consists of a split-ring resonator (SRR) with an engraved graphene strip at the top and a polyimide substrate backed by a gold reflector. The meta-atom is designed to obtain maximum reflection with 180°±10° phase difference. To achieve two discrete states, chemical potentials of 1 eV and 0.01 eV are considered across the graphene strip for the ON and OFF states, respectively. The proposed RIS provides a 60 GHz bandwidth in the 0.26-0.32 THz range, corresponding to a fractional bandwidth of 21%. The RIS with 30×30 meta-atoms is analyzed for 2D beam steering. The RIS can steer the electromagnetic waves up to ± 30° with low scan loss of 1.1 dB at 0.27 THz. The proposed RIS facilitates electromagnetic wave manipulation, resulting in improved signal coverage and dynamic beam steering for 6G applications."

    "abstract": "Facial recognition in the low-resolution environments remains as a critical challenge for security and surveillance systems. This paper comprehensively evaluates two advanced deep learning models: MobileNetV2 and EfficientNetB0 across four facial datasets: LFW, LFW Funneled, TinyFace and a locally collected low-resolution dataset (Local LR). Using PyTorch with extensive data augmentation, model's performance was assessed on metrics: Accuracy, Loss, F1-score and ROC AUC. The experimental results shows that EfficientNet-B0 achieves higher accuracy on challenging lowresolution datasets like TinyFace (69.64%) compared to MobileNetV2's 61.86%). EfficientNet-B0 shows 29.3% reduction in test loss and 6.4% higher F1-score maintaining comparable performance on higher-resolution datasets (97.81% on Local LR). MobileNetV2 shows more computational advantages with fewer parameters and lower FLOPs in comparison to EfficientNet-B0. This makes it more suitable for edge deployments despite slightly lower accuracy (96.43%) on LFW compared to EfficientNet-B0 (96.97%). These findings provide quantitative benchmarks for model selection. Results are highlighting EfficientNet-B0's strength in feature extraction from low-quality images and reflects the efficiency benefits of MobileNetV2 which is offering practical guidance for implementing facial recognition systems in real-world scenarios where image resolution and hardware constraints vary significantly."

Traditional methods begin training with randomly chosen initial parameters and need numerous pilot symbols, which can be impractical in scenarios such as when a unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) serves as the access point, collecting data from massive device sensor networks. In this work, we focus on adaptive learning with minimal pilot symbols to train the neural network to classify devices by their I/Q imbalances. Reptile is an efficient meta-learning algorithm designed to help models rapidly adjust to new tasks with minimal training data. By employing Reptile, we pre-train neural network model parameters offline, facilitating rapid online adaptation and fine-tuning for effective identification of new devices. Simulations indicate that Reptile surpasses conventional methods in device identification with fewer pilot symbols."

Large-scale forest monitoring is facilitated by the advancement in both remote sensing technologies and Deep Learning (DL). In particular, change detection methods have emerged as a promising approach for monitoring forest dynamics at both spatial and temporal scales. Thus, this study comprehensively compares diverse deep learning architectures (U-Net, U-Net++, Attention U-Net, ResU-Net, DeepLabV3+, and MobileNetV2) for monitoring and evaluating deforestation dynamics in Wilpattu National Park, Sri Lanka, over three time periods from 2015 to 2024. The models were trained using $128 \\times 128$ Landsat image patches generated through bitemporal stacking following early fusion approach. The subset of two Landsat spectral bands ensures a compact and computationally efficient dataset. The model performance is evaluated using metrics such as F1-score, Precision, Recall, Accuracy, and Kappa. Experimental results indicate that UNet and ResU-Net are effective in capturing forest loss regions across all temporal intervals. However, a gradual decline in performance was observed over successive time periods, reflecting the growing spatial and spectral complexity of deforestation patterns. This underscores the need to design models that maintain consistent performance across temporal shifts, ensuring robust long-term deforestation monitoring."

    "abstract": "Retaining and attracting the best talent is increasingly becoming a challenge to organisations in the modern fast changing business environment. A way to optimise the use of talent acquisition and retention strategies is to harness the transformative power of introducing Artificial Intelligence (AI) and big data into the Human Resource (HR) management practice. To enhance the HR analytics architecture to accommodate the employee lifecycle of decision-making, this paper proposes a scalable HR analytics architecture to utilize AI and Big Data. The structure assists business to identify high potential recruits, reduces the recruitment duration, and better predicts employee turnover through predictive analytics, machine learning, and real-time data processing. It also facilitates career and personalised employee engagement programs, which increase organisational commitment and job satisfaction. The structure has been designed in a way that it can be scaled to the needs of different organisations in terms of size and can also be flexible to adapt across industries. We show how this concept can be useful in retention rate increase and recruitment efficiency using a case-based approach. Ethical concerns and the problem of data protection are also discussed to ensure proper use of AI. Ultimately, this paper focuses on the strategic usefulness of AI-based HR analytics in developing a data-wise, resilient workforce and ensuring competitive advantage in the digital age."

Signal sampling in spatial domain can thus be converted to samplings in the wavenumber domain, enabling image reconstruction via fast Fourier transform (FFT). An attention U-Net is introduced to improve the imaging quality with interpretability. The proposed method is FFT-based and independent of antenna array configuration, showing potential for deployment in distributed communication networks.

    "abstract": "To address the mutual coupling issues among the resonant element parameters in the LCC-S type magnetic coupling wireless power transmission (MC-WPT) system (which would increase the design difficulty and reduce the transmission efficiency), this paper proposes an improved multi-objective optimization algorithm based on NSGA-II. By using strategies such as Levy flight, random walk, and adaptive weights, the algorithm's global and local search capabilities are enhanced, and the convergence speed is accelerated. This method achieves the optimal configuration of system parameters under multiple constraints. Firstly, through the topological analysis of a typical MC-WPT system, its inherent limitations are determined. Then, a LCC-type composite compensation network is proposed to construct a more efficient LCC-S topological structure. Next, the optimization objective is to maximize the transmission efficiency of the LCC-S compensation topology structure, and the parameters of the resonant frequency, mutual inductance coefficient, and load resistance of the system are set as optimization variables. The improved algorithm is simulated, and the optimal solutions of the variables and the optimal values of the transmission efficiency are obtained. A magnetic coupling resonant WPT system experimental platform is built, and experiments are conducted to study the effects of working frequency, mutual inductance coefficient, and load resistance on the transmission efficiency. The results of the algorithm optimization are basically the same, and a comprehensive analysis of the optimization results shows that the LBA algorithm is effective for optimizing the transmission efficiency parameters."

Advances in the 4th Industrial Revolution have enabled utilization of machine learning techniques in different fields of civil engineering. This study develops an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) enhanced by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to predict rebar corrosion in polypropylene fiber reinforced concrete (PFRC). Accelerated corrosion tests were performed using the impressed current method on samples with varying polypropylene fiber content, concrete cover (CC), and bar diameter (BD). Experimental results showed that the 3-7-1 network structure (NS) (3 input neurons (IN), 7 hidden neurons (HN), 1 output neuron (ON)) achieved the highest accuracy with correlation coefficient (R) of 0.98969, mean squared error (MSE) of 0.18846, and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 7.832 %. Employing the generated connection weights (CW) from the governing model (GM), through Olden's connection weights approach, observed that the concrete cover had the most significant influence on corrosion (-43.231%), followed by bar diameter (33.717%) and fiber content (-23.052%). It highlights that increasing concrete cover and fiber content significantly reduces corrosion in PFRC, which may be used by civil engineering professionals as it offers insights for enhancing the durability of reinforced concrete structures. This approach supports SDG 9 (Sustainable Development Goal 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) by promoting resilient, innovative construction methods and contributes to SDG 11 (Sustainable Development Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities) by enhancing the longevity and sustainability of urban infrastructure."

To address this issue, this study plots the mover velocity-time curves in three different application fields, defining them as sinusoidal, square-wave-like (trapezoidal), and triangular wave motion modes based on their shapes. A transient field simulation model of the Tubular Permanent Magnet Linear Generator (TPMLG) is established to comparatively analyze the energy conversion efficiency of the generator under these motion modes. First, a correlation coefficient is introduced to derive the analytical expression between the back electromotive force (back-EMF) and the mover velocity. Subsequently, the amplitude and harmonic content of the back-EMF under the three motion modes are simulated and analyzed. The results indicate that the back-EMF waveform under sinusoidal motion exhibits the highest amplitude, but its total harmonic distortion (THD) is significantly higher than that under triangular and square-wave-like motions. In contrast, the back-EMF amplitude under square-wave-like motion is relatively small. Comprehensive analysis shows that the TPMLG achieves the optimal power generation efficiency when the mover operates in triangular wave motion. This research provides a theoretical reference for the selection of operating modes of linear generators in practical engineering applications."

The classical representations might not be precise and lack flexibility, and this is the reason why powerful deep learning methods have been employed to achieve high predictive accuracy by exploiting all available medical information during analysis. This paper gives an in-depth analysis of contemporary deep learning processes in cardiovascular risk prediction. It criticizes the traditional methods and shows shortcomings of these methods then provides a predictive model which is a combination of both methods. One of the main implications of the research concerns the capability of deep learning in handling multidimensional medical information. To overcome the inefficiency and the limitations of diagnosis of the existing systems, the research proposes the implementation of a hybrid system combining both RFGB (Random Forest Gradient Boosting) and YOLO (You Only Look Once). RFGB has the power of both Random Forest as well as Gradient Boost in the features selection and classification, whereas YOLO is used to perform real-time analysis of the medical objects, which enhances their prediction ability. The model under consideration is compared with another classifier, including Decision Tree and Naive Bayes, which are used in the binary classification (YES/NO). With a best accuracy of 96%, the RFGB-YOLO hybrid clearly outreach other existing models as it provides a safe path in predicting heart attacks."

The key idea is to construct each attribute vector by averaging the embeddings of diverse style prompts that contain the target attribute in their descriptions. Analysis of the embedding space shows that tokens representing the same attribute form tight clusters, indicating that compact prototype vectors can effectively capture their semantic meaning. Experiments show that our model achieves comparable word error rates and automatic evaluation scores to the baseline with the text encoder. These results demonstrate that lightweight attribute representations can successfully replace large text encoders in production-oriented TTS, reducing the model size by 38% without compromising perceived quality."

    "abstract": "Twisted string actuators (TSAs) have emerged as promising actuators in robotics owing to their compliant, lightweight nature, and high transmission ratios. However, practical utilization of TSAs remains limited due to their restricted stroke length and intrinsically nonlinear transmission ratio (TR). While variable-radius pulleys (VRPs) can mitigate these issues, they exhibit poor scalability as their volume grows disproportionately with the required stroke or compensation TR range. This paper proposes the dual variable-radius drum TSA (DVRD-TSA) and mathematically proves that its architecture offers superior scalability and compactness compared to existing mechanisms as performance demands increase. For a baseline comparison to validate our model, we fabricated a prototype and compared it to a conventional TSA under constant load conditions with identical initial length. The experiment confirmed that our DVRD-TSA delivers a substantially larger linear stroke (210.3 mm, 72.5%) compared to conventional TSA (85.3 mm, 29.4%), while maintaining a comparable peak torque (25.82 Nmm vs. 24.21 Nmm), and successfully tracks its target near-constant transmission ratio (1.475 rd/mm) with low error. This work presents a compact, passive, and scalable solution that overcomes two major drawbacks of TSAs, nonlinear TR and limited stroke, thereby making them a more compelling option for robotic applications."

    "abstract": "Fast and safe motion is crucial for the successful deployment of physically interactive robots. Parallel robots (PRs) offer the potential for higher speeds while maintaining the same energy limits due to their low moving masses. However, they require methods for contact detection and reaction while avoiding singularities and self-collisions. We address this issue and present SafePR - a unified approach for the detection and localization, including the distinction between collision and clamping to perform a reaction that is safe for humans and feasible for PRs. Our approach uses information from the encoders and motor currents to estimate forces via a generalized-momentum observer. Neural networks and particle filters classify and localize the contacts. We introduce reactions with redundancy resolution to avoid self-collisions and type-II singularities. Our approach detected and terminated 72 real-world collision and clamping contacts with end-effector speeds of up to 1.5m/s, each within 25-275ms. The forces were below the thresholds from ISO/TS 15066. By using built-in sensors, SafePR enables safe interaction with already assembled PRs without the need for new hardware components."

    "abstract": "Prostate cancer grading, using the International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) system, for treatment decisions is highly subjective and requires considerable expertise. Despite advances in computer-aided diagnosis systems, few have handled efficient ISUP grading on whole slide images (WSIs) of prostate biopsies based only on slide labels. In this scenario, TSOR is developed, where a novel task-specific self-supervised learning (SSL) framework is used for patch-level pretraining. This is fine-tuned using ordinal regression for WSI-level ISUP grading. One of the main challenges faced by deep learning (DL) in ISUP grading, is the learning of patch-level features based on slide labels. Though using models pretrained at patch-level using SSL or other paradigms is the most obvious choice here, the diversity of training samples plays a crucial role in effective pretraining. However, pretraining on a large database of different histopathology images becomes computationally expensive. Therefore, a patch-level dataset (relatively balanced with respect to the patch-level grades) is initially created for effective SSL-based pretraining. As stain-variation across centers leads to difficulty in generalization, an additional loss term is incorporated to effectively learn the stain-agnostic patch-level features. As it is desirable that misclassification be as close as possible to the actual grade, in medical images, we fine-tune the pretrained network for WSI-level ISUP grading using an ordinal regression-based approach. Experimental results on the most extensive prostate cancer grade assessment (PANDA) challenge dataset, and the SICAPv2 dataset, demonstrate the effectiveness of TSOR compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods."

    "abstract": "Deadlock and blocking issues have received more and more attention in automated manufacturing systems (AMSs). This article studies an adaptive supervisory control problem for AMSs with multiple unreliable resources which may fail at any time. By using general Petri nets (PNs), each processing stage in the AMSs under consideration allows to utilize multiple types and quantities of resources. Based on a transformation technique, a general net is first converted to an ordinary net. In an ordinary net, a set of formulas is used to check the undermarked siphons, each of which is designed as a control place to prohibit it from being undermarked. By analyzing the relationship between the unreliable resources and the detected siphon, an adaptive controller is designed which can automatically adjust working modes such that the undermarked siphon caused by resource failures is marked. Finally, an adaptive supervisory controller is iteratively synthesized for AMSs with unreliable resources to ensure the controlled system can execute continuous operations even if unreliable resources malfunction. A representative example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of our approach."

    "abstract": "This article presents an adaptive neural network (AdNN)-based fault detection framework for the thermal processes of lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries governed by 2-D semilinear partial differential equations (PDEs) with partially known dynamics. To address the challenges of unknown nonlinear heat generation and limited sensor measurements, a two-stage approach combining reduced-order modeling with adaptive neural observation is proposed. First, a computationally tractable reduced-order model is derived through spectral approximation techniques. An adaptive neural observer is then designed to simultaneously estimate battery states and unknown nonlinear dynamics using only available surface temperature measurements. For robust fault detection, a hybrid scheme is developed that integrates model-based residual generation with data-driven threshold generation. Experimental validation on a pouch-type battery demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method in reliably detecting thermal abnormalities."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as powerful tools for hardware design, with recent work exploring their ability to generate register-transfer level (RTL) code directly from natural-language specifications. This paper presents a critical review and empirical evaluation of LLM-based RTL generation. We examine thirty-one published efforts, classifying their use of techniques such as fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, retrieval-augmented prompting, and multi-agent orchestration across eight methodological dimensions including debugging support, post-RTL metrics, and benchmark development. Building on this synthesis, we experimentally evaluate frontier commercial and open-weight models—GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1-mini, Claude Sonnet 4, and Llama 4 Maverick —on the VerilogEvalV2 and RTLLMv2.0 benchmarks under both single-shot generation and a lightweight ReAct-style reflection loop, with compilation and simulation performed through Icarus Verilog interfaced via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Results show that these models achieve up to 89.74% on VerilogEval and 96.08% on RTLLM, matching or exceeding prior domain-specific pipelines without specialized fine-tuning. Detailed failure analysis reveals systematic error modes, including FSM mis-sequencing, handshake drift, blocking vs. non-blocking misuse, and state-space oversimplification. Finally, we outline a forward-looking research roadmap toward natural-language-to-System-on-Chip (SoC) design, emphasizing realistic benchmarks and open flows, richer specification formalisms, AI–human collaborative design environments, and system-level feedback that spans physical design, firmware, and design space exploration. Together, this work provides both a synthesis of recent advances and a baseline evaluation of frontier LLMs, highlighting opportunities and challenges in moving toward AI-native electronic design automation."

    "abstract": "The adoption of artificial intelligence models (e.g., DNN models) in internet of things has boosted computing demands in edge computing. Frequent model retraining, necessitated by concept drift, further increases resource usage, while model compression sacrifices model performance for computing efficiency. However, few works study computing instance allocation problem considering dynamic model retraining and compression, especially under varying workloads and model performance degradation. In this work, we model the problem as a joint online model retraining, compression, and instance allocation problem in edge computing networks considering model performance and instance cost. Solving the online problem is challenging since it is a non-linear binary programming problem with time-coupling instance switching cost. We first solve the online problem under fixed compression and propose an efficient online algorithm. Specifically, we first linearize the non-linear term, then regularize the time-coupling switching cost to decouple the problem, and finally use a randomization rounding method to derive the integral solution. We prove that our algorithm achieves a constant optimality gap. We then solve the online problem under flexible compression and propose a lightweight online algorithm. We extend the linearization method and decouple the problem into each time slot, and demonstrate our algorithm achieves an optimality gap depending on the time period. Simulations demonstrate that our algorithm can achieve a balance between instance cost and model performance in both fixed compression and flexible compression scenarios."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in low-altitude economy (LAE) networks, which is crucial for the flight safety of low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). We derive the expected achievable rate (EAR) as a novel performance metric to evaluate the ISAC system performance under uncertain predicted direction. Both accurate beam direction prediction and beam resource allocation are essential for achieving fair EAR performance for multiple UAVs. However, the trajectories of the UAVs exhibit non-Gaussian deviations from the predefined trajectories. Moreover, the beamwidth and power density are interdependent for EAR performance. Motivated by this, we propose a transformer-based multitype weighting network (TMW-Net) to obtain accurate UAV state prediction under non-Gaussian scenarios. Building upon the state prediction results, we develop a joint beamwidth and power density allocation (JBPDA) method to maximize the minimum EAR for multiple UAVs. The proposed method searches for an auxiliary variable by establishing a power consumption-based feasibility evaluation problem, which is transformed into a simpler form through the cases of symmetric and asymmetric beam allocation. Finally, the numerical results show that the proposed TMW-Net has higher beam direction prediction accuracy. Furthermore, the designed JBPDA method can achieve a trade-off between communication and sensing in the ISAC system."

    "abstract": "Temporal Action Segmentation (TAS) is fundamental to video understanding, aiming to recognize and segment actions within untrimmed videos. While over-segmentation errors have received considerable attention, the equally critical issue of out of-context errors stemming from the neglect of implicit causal relationships between actions remains under-explored. However, constraining these unknown causal relationships at the frame level—including identifying causal links and strengths—presents a significant challenge, leading to notable research gaps. To tackle these challenges, we define a Temporal Action Causal Model (TACM) for the TAS task as declarative guidance, which efficiently injects the causal relationship between actions into frame variables in a generated manner. To this end, we propose the Causal Action Segmentation Refiner (CaASR), a refinement framework designed to mitigate out-of-context errors in segmentation results of backbone models. By reconstructing the causal generation process of post-segmentation frame variables, CaASR constrains causal relationships between actions and ensures the reliability of generated causal relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CaASR significantly enhances both segmentation performance and interpretability across various backbone models, including state-of-the-art methods."

This paper proposes a speed ripple suppression based on stability-enhanced ADALINE for PMSM drives. Under unknown system delay conditions, the integral saturation characteristics in the ADALINE network are extracted to obtain system instability information. An anti-instability disturbance sliding mode tracking controller is constructed to extract the phase delay of the speed ripple suppression system and optimize the phase convergence trajectory. Besides, according to the desaturation mapping relationship of the speed ripple sine-cosine components, a phase delay adaptive selection strategy is proposed to achieve adaptive regulation for phase delay, enhancing the speed ripple suppression system stability when the ripple frequency exceeds the speed controller cutoff frequency. The stability and convergence are analyzed in detail. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified on a 2.2 kW PMSM drive platform."

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI)-driven identity (ID) systems (document onboarding, wallet-based credential presentation, fraud/risk scoring) increasingly face regulatory obligations requiring demonstrable accountability, traceability, and technical documentation. Yet current compliance practice remains predominantly document-centric and manual, making it difficult to keep evidence synchronized with rapidly evolving systems and models.We present a compliance-as-code approach for AI-driven ID workflows that (i) maintains clause-to-control traceability under policy/configuration evolution, (ii) treats evidence completeness as an enforceable property via fixed monitoring-window semantics (silence is non-ambiguous), and (iii) exports evidence and outcomes as Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL)-native assessor packages (Component Definition, System Security Plan, Assessment Results, and automatically generated POA&M), where missing evidence is automatically materialized as structured findings and remediation items. We implement our approach using policy-as-code enforcement (OPA/Rego), CI configuration testing (Conftest), release-time provenance gates (policy bundle digests), runtime decision logging, and an evidence graph that binds events/resources to control IDs, releases, and hashes. We evaluate on two publicly reproducible ID workloads (MIDV-500 onboarding and OpenID4VP/W3C VC DM v2.0-aligned wallet verification). Across four releases, our prototype generates complete OSCAL packages with hash–linked evidence resources, automatically emits POA&M items for evidence gaps, surfaces window-level staleness as findings, and shows no material latency overhead under measured load. These results suggest that compliance-as-code can improve assessability and evidence integrity/attribution within a bounded threat model and control scope, as well as make AI-driven ID systems’ assurance more maintainable and assessor-ready."

    "abstract": "The rapid growth in the number of vehicles has intensified traffic congestion and increased the frequency of rule violations, which remain a major contributing factor to severe accidents, particularly on highways, where high-speed collisions often result in substantial loss of life and property. Therefore, the early, accurate, and automated detection of such violations is crucial for enhancing traffic safety. This study presents a real-time violation detection system designed to identify critical highway infractions, including reversing vehicles, illegally stopped vehicles in the right lane, and unauthorized presence of pedestrians or animals on the roadway. The proposed framework employs an image processing pipeline integrated with a distributed event-driven architecture. Using a topic-based publish/subscribe messaging model built on Apache Kafka, the system efficiently disseminates detected violation events and corresponding visual evidence to authorized units in real time. The architecture is scalable and extensible, enabling the incorporation of additional violation types and analytical modules with minimal system reconfiguration. Experimental evaluations demonstrated that the system achieved reliable detection accuracy under appropriate camera placement and operational conditions, offering a practical foundation for next-generation intelligent transportation and traffic enforcement systems."

    "abstract": "Least-squares reverse time migration (LSRTM), a linearized inverse problem, provides high-resolution subsurface images by minimizing the misfit between observed and simulated data. LSRTM can be implemented in both time and frequency domains. Compared to time-domain LSRTM, frequency domain LSRTM (FLSRTM) offers advantages in handling multi-shot datasets. In addition, wavefield extrapolation needs to be performed only once at the initial iteration of the LSRTM process, provided that Green’s functions can be stored directly in memory. However, the memory required to store Green’s functions increases exponentially, being proportional to the dimensionalities of both model and data spaces. To address this memory issue, we propose a memory-efficient FLSRTM approach based on low-rank approximation via Tucker decomposition. In our FLSRTM method, the Green’s functions for all shot and receiver positions at a given frequency are decomposed into a core tensor and several factor matrices. Based on optimal ranks determined by an energy preservation criterion, the core tensor and factor matrices are truncated, thereby significantly reducing the dimensionality of the Green’s functions. Numerical tests on a modified Marmousi2 velocity model demonstrate the feasibility and substantial memory efficiency of our FLSRTM approach, while preserving the accuracy of migration images. Furthermore, a field data example confirms the practical applicability of our FLSRTM approach."

The wideband optimal noise performance and input matching of the LNA are achieved using a compact configured-coupled transformer (CCT). I/Q generation is achieved in the LO buffer chain based on a wideband transformer-based quadrature coupler.

This technique has important ramifications for a number of applications, including as human-computer interface and surveillance tracking. A unique deep learning architecture for face expression identification is presented in this study. ResNet50v2 and VGG16 are two well-known convolutional neural network designs that are examined in our method. Both networks have been modified to efficiently extract facial features. To improve the network's capacity to record channel-wise dependencies within feature maps, we integrate squeeze-and-excitation blocks. To further encourage the model to produce condensed and informative feature representations, a self-attention regularization term is added. The CNN algorithm is used in this paper. CNNs are a class of neural networks that are mostly utilized for computer vision applications and image recognition. It is composed of multiple filter layers that come after the completely linked layer and the pooling layer. CNNs are excellent tools for tasks like image classification, object recognition, and partitioning because they are adept at learning the spatial hierarchies of data from images. The primary goals of this method are to determine the configuration that maximizes performance for the CNN-based image processing task and automate the hyperparameter tuning procedure that permits efficiency."

Four scenarios were simulated using HOMER Pro: a baseline solar-wind-battery system, a PEM fuel cell-supported system, a diesel-backed configuration, and an MPPT-optimized system. The MOO process minimized the Total Net Present Cost (TNPC), power losses, CO<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf> emission and unmet load while the fuzzy-based MCDM analysis incorporated expert evaluation of environmental, technical, and feasibility criteria to rank system alternatives. Results show that although rural clients often prefer systems with lower initial cost and higher reliability, such as diesel-based setups, these options lead to higher operating costs and CO<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf> emissions over time.

This paper addresses the accuracy limitations of the existing Ternary Bloom Filter (TBF) by re-evaluating the Counting Bloom Filter (CBF) under identical memory constraints and introducing a novel structure called the Revolving Bloom Filter (R-BF). The proposed R-BF retains the simple counter-based design of BF but incorporates a revolving mechanism in which counters reset to zero upon reaching their maximum value, thereby enabling precise representation of subset summaries. We apply both CBF and R-BF to a binary trie-based set reconciliation algorithm. Experimental results under identical memory conditions demonstrate that the proposed CBF and R-BF significantly improve the detection accuracy of distinct elements compared to the TBF-based approach. The proposed method is expected to be effectively applicable to distributed data synchronization and replica reconciliation under resource-constrained environments such as IoT and edge computing devices."

    "abstract": "5G base stations (BSs) operating in the FR1 n78 band (3.3–3.8 GHz) may cause adjacent-band interference to fixed-satellite service (FSS) downlinks in the 3.7–4.2 GHz band. This paper quantitatively analyzes adjacent-band interference from 5G BS emissions in both in-band emission (IBE) and out-of-band emission (OOBE) scenarios. To evaluate the impact on FSS downlink performance, this paper proposes a comprehensive methodology that combines simulation of 5G signal propagation with field measurements. The interference power levels obtained from both approaches are then applied to a system-level FSS receiver model using RF front-end circuit simulation to assess the potential degradation in satellite signal quality."

    "abstract": "This paper conducts research on the inter-turn short-circuit (ITSC) fault of dual three-phase permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSM). A mathematical model of the dual three-phase motor is established, and all ITSC fault states are analyzed. The corresponding fault dataset is constructed through field-circuit coupling simulation. Furthermore, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network model is built, and a strategy combining random selection and Bayesian optimization is adopted to determine the hyperparameters of the network. The model training results and 5-fold cross-validation results show that the network has high data fitting accuracy and good generalization ability. The lightweight characteristic of this model enables it to be deployed on a FPGA hardware platform, allowing it to participate in the real-time fault diagnosis and control decision-making of dual three-phase motors."

    "abstract": "A model that protects cloud systems from rapidly changing phishing and malware threats by employing both traditional deep learning techniques and signature-based models in combination. Those technologies are either obfuscation-based or zero-day. Attacks fail to get through, because manipulation can't succeed -not even in adversarial cases. However, these high false positives can't generalize to anything else and are quickly faced with their own limitations. The innovation deep adversarial learning framework applies a generator-discriminator architecture based on the CNN, Bi-LSTM, and attention, with enhanced robustness and feature adaptation capabilities. These adversarial data simulate evasive behavior, so that the model can now identify previously unknown attacks while keeping accuracy. For scalability and low-latency inference, this technique uses multi-domain feature fusion and edgecloud deployment. When analyzing the results of a hybrid phishing and malware dataset, we find that it gives 98.9% (F1 = 0.985) phishing accuracy and 99.3% (F1 = 0.993) malware accuracy, with a false positive rate of 1.2%. At the same time, over dynamic cloud environments, existing deep URL and API-sequence models are outperformed by it on the aspects like adaptability, detection consistency computational efficiency across."

A non-destructive method combining microwave reflection measurements and machine learning is proposed for rapid and effective quality control. The fundamental principle involves measuring the microwave reflection coefficient (S11) of milk samples over a frequency range of 100 MHz to 3.4 GHz. Adulterants such as water, salt, sugar, starch, or cow's milk alter the dielectric properties of the camel milk, each producing a unique \"fingerprint\" in the measured reflection signal. These distinct spectral signatures were then used as inputs to train machine learning models. The developed system demonstrates a robust capability to classify common adulterants and quantify them at different concentration levels, presenting a promising, field-deployable technology for ensuring the authenticity and safety of camel milk."

Using extensive parametric analysis, we explored structural dimensions, including gap size, length and width, impact electric field, trapping performance, and localized surface plasmon resonance. Our findings demonstrated that while width primarily affected near-field strength, increasing length caused a redshift in the resonant frequency. We obtained a peak optical force of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$-1.57 \\text{nN}/\\mathrm{W}_{\\mu \\mathrm{m}^{-2}}$</tex> at 7.3 THz frequency on a nanoparticle by introducing an 8 nm gap between the two bow-tie triangles, which is twofold higher than that of the gapless bow-tie structure.

The findings provide actionable insights for retailers to optimize strategies and for platform operators to refine algorithmic frameworks.Research findings indicate: (1) Both comprehensive rankings and review rankings show significant positive correlations with sales volume, where improved rankings can drive sales growth; (2) In comprehensive rankings, the number of reviews, store ratings, and logistics ratings positively influence sales while prices negatively correlate; in review rankings, logistics ratings demonstrate particularly prominent effects; (3) Comprehensive rankings exhibit a \"Matthew effect\" where high-volume groups show heightened sensitivity to ranking changes, whereas review rankings demonstrate monotonically increasing effects with sales groupings.It is suggested that retailers should formulate differentiated strategies according to the characteristics of the ranking mechanism, and the platform can implement ranking compensation mechanism and dynamic weight algorithm to promote fair competition."

This paper presents the Phishing URL Classification Bot (PURL-Bot) that integrates advanced preprocessing and powerful extraction of URL features with a strong Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) classifier to accurately classify the Phishing URLs. PURL-Bot uses the Phish Tank URL database and classifies the URLs in two categories: Normal and Phishing. Furthermore, the bot will have an intelligent chatbot system, where users can inquire about the threats of phishing, the classification details, and the performance of the system through active inquiries. The PURL-Bot performance is evaluated experimentally with an accuracy of 99.24%, precision of 99.24%, recall of 99.22% and F1-score of 99.23% that are significantly better than the available solutions.

    "abstract": "Coal mining continues to be one of the most hazardous industrial activities due to the prevalence of toxic gases, poor ventilation, spontaneous combustion, and risks of structural collapse. The old system of monitoring that is based on manual inspections or single sensors has not been effective enough and as a result, there are delays in the detection of hazards and the inefficiency of safety measures. In order to overcome these issues, this study suggests a real-time coal mine safety system, which integrates the Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled logical sensors, edge computing, and smart alerting systems. The methodology includes system requirement analysis, logic sensor fusion, IoT hardware implementation with NB-IoT communication, real time data acquisition, initializing Kalman filters, and predicting anomalies by using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The results of the experiment indicate that the sensors of neither methane nor carbon monoxide gas had an average accuracy of 97.4% and the NB-IoT communication framework showed a packet delivery ratio of more than 97.5% at a distance of 500 meters with a latency of less than 205ms. The Hazard risk scoring system had accurate classification of safe, warning, hazardous, and critical conditions whereas the LSTM-based predictive analytics model gave an average performance of 95.2% when multiple hazard scenarios were considered. The tests of system reliability also showed that the system had an uptime of 98.5% even when the failure rate of sensor nodes was lower than 30% which supported fault-tolerant design and redundancy models. The results validate the fact that the combination of logical sensors and intelligent IoT systems would guarantee real-time and accurate safety monitoring, and the number of risks to miners would go down considerably. The system has the benefit of being a scalable approach that can be deployed to other high-risk industries that might need continuous monitoring of the environment and human safety."

    "abstract": "Urbanization, characterized by the movement of populations from rural to urban areas, is reshaping societies globally. This transformation is driven by economic, social, and environmental factors that make urban areas appealing, offering better jobs, access to healthcare and education, and improved infrastructure. However, urbanization also presents significant challenges, including the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect, which exacerbates living conditions in densely populated cities by increasing surface and air temperatures compared to surrounding rural areas. This study addresses the UHI phenomenon and heat vulnerability by conducting an Urban Heat Island and Heat Vulnerability Index (HVI) assessment, incorporating ground validation, for Makati City, Philippines. The UHI Map was developed using Landsat 8 satellite Land Surface Temperature (LST) data. The HVI Map was developed using Landsat 8 Data Product and Demographic data to identify areas at higher risk of adverse heat-related effects. Each indicator scores were normalized, scored, and aggregated to calculate an HVI score for each barangay. Ground validation was performed to verify the results from the UHI and HVI maps. A prototype device was designed, consisting of sensors for ambient temperature and relative humidity, a memory device for data storage, and a battery with a one-month operational lifespan. Three devices were deployed in barangays identified by the HVI Map: two in the most vulnerable barangays and one in the least vulnerable barangay. Over a month, the devices recorded temperature and humidity data, which were analysed to corroborate the maps' findings. The UHI and HVI maps identified areas within Makati City that are most susceptible to heat-related health impacts, offering critical insights for policymakers and urban planners. The integration of socio-economic and environmental factors ensures a holistic understanding of heat vulnerability, enabling evidence-based strategies to mitigate risks. The findings support urban planning efforts aimed at reducing heat exposure through increased vegetation, improved building designs, and the development of heat-resilient infrastructure. Additionally, this research contributes to achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11, Sustainable Cities and Communities, by promoting strategies for creating inclusive, safe, and sustainable urban environments."

    "abstract": "Human emotion analysis is a complex and multidisciplinary task. Researchers have explored various input modalities voice, image, brain signal to detect emotional states. Among these, voice-based analysis has become popular and practical due to its ease of data collection. It is especially useful for identifying emotional states like stress (e.g., sad, angry) or relaxation (happy). Emotion recognition from voice can provide valuable insights for psychologists and medical professionals. With the advancement of deep learning, this paper presents a novel approach for stress and relaxation detection using a MaskNet module. The proposed framework works in three stages. In the first stage, pre-processing is performed to enhance the audio signal by removing silent segments. In the second stage, features are extracted using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) along with their first-order (Δ) and second-order (ΔΔ) derivatives to capture temporal variations. In the final stage, emotion classification is carried out using a hybrid CNN–LSTM architecture integrated with a multiplicative masking mechanism. This approach improves both the discriminative power and noise robustness of the model. Experimental results on the RAVDESS and EMO-DB datasets show a 6.3% increase in accuracy and a 4.9% improvement in F1-score compared to traditional emotion recognition architectures."

Stage two integrates a fine-tuned InceptionV3 classifier enhanced with a CatBoost-based ensemble to distinguish glaucomatous eyes. Grad-CAM and Grad-CAM++ provide visual explanations that highlight model attention regions, supporting clinical interpretability.

The core mechanism of MLPS is to compute an intervention direction and then apply the matrix sign function (Msign) to extract a more robust guidance vector. This Msign vector more accurately corrects dynamic biases in the latent space, guiding the model to generate outputs faithful to visual facts. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method significantly reduces hallucinations, improving the overall evaluation score by up to 32.2% compared to baseline methods."

The primary goal of this study is to facilitate independent and accurate coin recognition through an accessible and user-friendly auditory feedback system. The system leverages computer vision and artificial intelligence to distinguish between various denominations based on their visual features. To train deep learning models, a custom dataset consisting of 1,419-coin images was manually collected, ensuring diversity in coin orientation, lighting conditions, and background environments to reflect real-world usage. Three deep learning architectures-Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), ResNet50, and VGG16-were selected for evaluation, given their proven efficacy in image classification tasks. These models were trained and validated on the prepared dataset, and their performance was compared in terms of accuracy. Among the three, the CNN model outperformed the others, attaining an accuracy of 99.89%, demonstrating its superior capability in recognizing coin types with high precision and minimal error. The finalized CNN model was then integrated into a functional hardware prototype which combines the trained model with a camera module and a microcontroller-based processing unit. Upon capturing an image of the coin, the system classifies its denomination and provides real-time auditory feedback, thereby enabling blind or visually impaired users to accurately identify coins without external assistance."

    "abstract": "Microwave resonator sensors exhibit three distinctive advantages over conventional analytical methods: real-time monitoring capacity, label-free detection mechanism, and high integration with microfluidic systems. The working principle exploits dielectric characterization through measurable resonant frequency shifts caused by dielectric constant variations in biological analytes. In this paper, an integrated microwave microfluidic sensing chip is proposed for the detection of white blood cells (WBCs, THP-1) and circulating cancer cells (CTCs, MCF-7). The proposed dual-band multi-gap coupled resonator (DMCR) is constructed on a glass substrate with copper structure gaps to generate resonance, exhibiting high sensitivity at both resonance frequency. The polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based microfluidic chip employs a spiral channel architecture to achieve continuous cell separation through the synergistic effects of inertial lift forces and Dean vortices. The spiral microfluidic device achieves 74.13% separation efficiency for WBCs and 84.6% for CTCs at designated outlets, with detection sensitivities of 3.51 MHz/(10⁴ cells/mL) and 11.6 MHz/(10⁴ cells/mL) for MCF-7 and THP-1 cell lines, respectively. This label-free platform demonstrates a certain degree of specificity through the integration of microwave resonator sensors and microfluidic sorting mechanisms, showing significant potential for clinical liquid biopsy applications requiring non-invasive analysis of circulating tumor cells."

    "abstract": "Evidential deep learning (EDL) models, based on Subjective Logic, introduce a principled and computationally efficient way to make deterministic neural networks uncertainty-aware. The resulting evidential models can quantify fine-grained uncertainty using learned evidence. However, the Subjective-Logic framework constrains evidence to be non-negative, requiring specific activation functions whose geometric properties can induce activation-dependent learning-freeze behavior-a regime where gradients become extremely small for samples mapped into low-evidence regions. We theoretically characterize this behavior and analyze how different evidential activations influence learning dynamics. Building on this analysis, we design a general family of activation functions and corresponding evidential regularizers that provide an alternative pathway for consistent evidence updates across activation regimes. Extensive experiments on four benchmark classification problems (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet), two few-shot classification problems, and blind face restoration problem empirically validate the developed theory and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed generalized regularized evidential models."

    "abstract": "Fact and common-sense reasoning grounded in metaphorical imagery constitute a more challenging form of visual question answering (VQA). Under this form, models typically cannot obtain answers directly from images. Models first need to identify and comprehend the metaphorical components within the image, subsequently integrating prior knowledge to establish the mappings between the target and source domains depicted in the image. To evaluate this capability, we propose a VQA benchmark based on metaphorical images (<bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">METAVQA</b>), which measures the understanding of the model of metaphorical images in the form of VQA. Experimental results indicate that interpreting metaphorical images requires robust prior knowledge and a strong ability to understand abstract components, which remains a challenge for LLMs. To improve the metaphorical understanding capability of LLMs, we propose a knowledge-enhanced method (KEMU). This method utilizes LLMs to extract image triplets, retrieve implicit metaphorical knowledge, and reason through questions step-by-step using chain of thought prompting, and pretrained classifier to match the refined reasoning output to the provided answer choices. Validated on the METAVQA dataset, KEMU outperforms LLMs in both one-hop and multi-hop questions.

Despite the advances in flexible sensors and skins, tactile sensing at the fingertip of robotic hands remains an open question. Exploiting embedded six-axis force/torque (F/T) sensors for external stimuli estimation, namely, intrinsic tactile sensing, seems to be an effective solution. Here, we present OriCube, an origami-inspired, fingertip-size (14.5 × 14.5 × 12.5 mm<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>), lightweight (4 g), fully integrated, inductive six-axis F/T sensor. It utilizes an origami coil array to achieve self-decoupled six-axis F/T measurements by detecting the displacements and rotations of a metal shell via eddy–current coupling. A modular silicone spring-based elastomer design allows fine-tuning of the stiffness and performance of each axis independently. The calibrated OriCube exhibits a high resolution of 0.01% F.S. (23 N), low crosstalk (2%), high stability (<0.2% drift in 6 h), and insensitivity to strong magnetic field changes. It is capable of detecting light touch by a feather as well as high impact force when hammered.

    "abstract": "Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) may progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or die from other causes during long-term follow-up, making it essential to properly account for competing risks in prognostic modeling. However, most existing CKD prediction models rely on hazard-based measures, which primarily reflect relative effects, lack clinical interpretability, and cannot directly quantify survival time lost due to disease progression or death. To address this limitation, we adopted the restricted mean time lost (RMTL), an absolute and intuitive measure of survival time loss, and developed a dynamic prediction model under competing risks. Given the rich time-dependent covariate information in longitudinal CKD data and the clinical need for patients to understand their disease progression at different stages, we developed a dynamic RMTL prediction model that incorporates the landmark approach. The model captures how covariate effects evolve over time, offering insights into the dynamic impact of clinical variables, and enables individualized prediction of survival time loss over a future window from any given prediction time point. We evaluated its statistical properties through Monte Carlo simulations and demonstrated its practical utility using CKD patient data from the AASK cohort. The results showed that the proposed model yields accurate and robust estimates, captures time-varying covariate effects, and outperforms conventional static models in predictive performance. By quantifying survival time loss under competing risks, the dynamic RMTL model offers clinically interpretable and individualized risk estimates, supporting personalized risk assessment and intervention planning in chronic disease management."

    "abstract": "Feature selection is one of the hot issues in machine learning. It reduces storage pressure by effectively screening features and has become a very practical data preprocessing method. At present, most feature selection algorithms apply <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\ell _{2,1}$</tex-math> </inline-formula>-norm on the transformation matrix to calculate the scores for all features and then select appropriate features according to these scores. But their sparsity is limited, and meaningless regularization parameters increase the cost, making it prone to falling into local optimum. To solve the above difficulties, this article proposes a novel max–min robust unsupervised feature selection via sparse subspace (MMRUFS), which considers both the reconstruction term and variance term of data, so that the model can not only fully retain the original information of data, but also make the data more dispersed. Second, <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\ell _{2,0}$</tex-math> </inline-formula>-norm constraint is used on the transformation matrix to directly select the optimal feature subset, avoiding the fine-tuning of regularization parameters. To enhance the robustness, MMRUFS carefully designs mark weight vector to make the model treat normal samples and outliers differently and achieves the effect of anomaly detection. Finally, MMRUFS is solved by designing the surrogate matrix, and its convergence is strictly guaranteed, experimental results reveal that MMRUFS outperforms other feature selection algorithms on multiple real-world datasets."

The system achieved a pose detection accuracy of 91.20% and 85.12 on daytime and nighttime test sets, respectively. Validation on the external MMCows dataset confirmed its robustness and generalizability across different barn layouts (overall accuracy of 93.84%). Regarding localization accuracy, the proposed method achieved 93.28% and 95.74 on daytime and nighttime test sets, respectively. By relying solely on RGB cameras, the method ensures low cost, scalability, and ease of deployment.

The device converts pressure-induced resistance variations into voltage amplitude changes via mutual inductance, enabling wireless, low-power, and fully non-invasive detection without reliance on resonance frequency tracking. Device achieved a sensitivity of 40 mV/kPa (≈ 5.32 mV/mmHg) on an artificial-eye platform, with a resolution of ≈ 0.172 mmHg, and 5.83 mV/mL in porcine-eye experiments, showing consistent linearity and stability. The amplitude-based and wireless readout demonstrated strong immunity to frequency drift, low noise, and sub-millisecond response time (< 1 ms). These results verify the feasibility of the dual-coil mutual-inductive architecture as a promising solution for continuous, non-invasive, and clinically practical IOP monitoring."

Two key difficulties arise: the feedback path must operate at a higher sampling rate, and accurately modeling the nonlinear distortion of wideband signals becomes increasingly difficult. Leveraging the characteristics of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) signals, this letter proposes a subcarrier-level DPD with undersampled feedback for wideband signals. The proposed method reconstructs the frequency-domain (FD) subcarriers before aliasing from the undersampled feedback signal, enabling subcarrier-level frequency-selective predistortion. The experimental results for a 300-MHz OFDM signal demonstrate that the proposed method effectively suppresses the power amplifier’s (PAs) nonlinearity and reduces the feedback sampling requirement."

A joint supervision strategy, combining weighted cross-entropy loss and Dice loss, is designed. It balances sample weights and mitigates class imbalance among tumor subregions (enhancing tumor (ET), edema, necrotic core). Experiments on the BraTS2019 dataset show the model achieves average Dice scores of 0.8376 (ET),0.8259 (tumor core, TC), and 0.8896 (whole tumor, WT). This outperforms the baseline U-Net by 10.4%, 14.4%, and 1.99% respectively. Ablation studies confirm CBAM boosts small tumor detection sensitivity by 9.88%. In class-imbalanced scenarios, the joint loss increases training stability by 23.5%.

Existing chunking methods inevitably trade off between semantic coherence and computational efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose Structural Chunking, a novel paradigm that integrates semantic cohesion with structural consistency by leveraging both surface- and physical-level document features. Unlike purely semantic methods, Structural Chunking quantifies structural patterns and fuses them with semantic embeddings to compute a semantic-structural cohesion score. Chunk boundaries are then detected where this composite distance sharply increases. Experiments on five BEIR benchmark datasets demonstrate that Structural Chunking achieves the most consistent recall and average precision across domains, outperforming semantic and statistical baselines while maintaining stable chunk-size distributions. The results indicate that incorporating structural hierarchy into the RAG preprocessing pipeline substantially enhances retrieval efficiency and contextual fidelity, suggesting a new direction for structure-aware information retrieval."

    "abstract": "The object here for IoT in health’s scenario translates to being observed toward the goal of health, in real time. The latter is particularly critical for heart conditions, where early notice can literally mean the difference between life and death. Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD) is still one of the top killers in human premature death. It is this latter fact that demands some real solution if we are going to be monitored outside of the hospital. Standard tracking systems are out of reach for the people who need them most, often in remote areas or underresourced regions such as a country or an unprofitable inner city. In this work, an experimental dataset of wearable ECG monitors in the smart glove with sensors is utilized. It's been able to monitor heart rates around the clock outside of a hospital, and in some cases where there is no doctor present at all. The main steps in the proposed procedure would be to gather data wirelessly into ECG sensors, perform real-time risk estimation at the edge and send (e.g., as Bluetooth message) its result for cloud processing backend. The uniqueness of our system is providing a community level emergency alerting system to the health care workers at risk with positions who are alerted in case of very high risk. Meanwhile, the reliability is guaranteed by evaluating performance measures such as detection accuracy, latency and energy consumption in this work. The results indicate that the proposed system yields high accuracy for detection and immediate response, and therefore constitute an efficient heart risk management tool in everyday life."

Previous studies on both dehazing algorithms and feature descriptors were examined with the aim to select the most suitable algorithm for the input image based on the explicit indices of the image itself. The examined dehaze algorithms can be categorized in two groups: Image restoration based on physical model (GMRF, Optical filtering, DCP, Bayesian net, Pre-record data set) and Image improvement with image parameters (Wavelet, Retinex, High frequency enhancement, Histogram equalizing). The implemented system was validated through a series of object detection experiments using real-world hazy images.

The experiment results show that the wind-sand environment has a limited effect on the DC breakdown voltage of the gap, and the changes in sand concentration, particle size and charge-to-mass ratio only cause slight voltage fluctuations. Finally, the promoting and suppressing effects of dust on discharge were explored in terms of photoionization, electric field distortion and electron capture of dust particles. The results can provide experimental basis and theoretical reference for the design of external insulation of transmission lines in sand-dust areas."

    "abstract": "The human brain processes visual information significantly faster than text, making image-based communication a powerful tool in human-computer interaction. While voice-based systems like Siri and Alexa have advanced speech recognition, directly converting voice into meaningful images remains an emerging and underexplored area. This paper presents an intelligent, end- to-end framework for voice-to-image generation that integrates deep learning and natural language processing models. The system first converts voice input to text using an advanced automatic speech recognition (ASR) model, Wav2Vec 2.0. The transcribed text is semantically analyzed using BERT or GPT-based models to extract descriptive and contextual features. These features are then processed by a diffusion-based image generation model to produce highfidelity visuals. A CLIP-guided feedback loop further ensures semantic alignment between the input voice and the generated image. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance over existing methods, with lower Word Error Rates (WER), improved Frechet Inception Distance (FID) scores, and higher semantic alignment. This work opens promising avenues for real-time voice-driven image generation in domains such as accessibility, creative design, and virtual storytelling."

This research compares AI-based computer vision models Fast R-CNN, YOLOv7 Tiny, and VGG19 for real-time wildlife detection and species identification. YOLOv7 Tiny is the most suitable for real-time monitoring, while VGG19 achieves high accuracy in species identification but is not suitable for real-time detection due to its high computational cost and slow inference speed. Fast R-CNN struggles with detecting small objects due to limitations in region proposal generation and feature extraction. Even with YOLOv7’s strong performance, further improvements using Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN) and object segmentation can enhance accuracy. AI-based solutions provide scalable and automatic wildlife conservation, helping to protect species and combat poaching."

Initially, a 4-port antenna is designed for the 5.9 GHz V2X band (5.68 – 5.98 GHz), while the SIWs are used efficiently to isolate the antenna ports. These SIW yields an electrically unaffected area at the middle of the substrate, which allows to design additional radiating elements. An additional 4-port MIMO antenna for the 5G-NR (24.12 GHz – 32.7 GHz) communication and a Ku-band antenna for the satellite communication (11.2 – 12.1 GHz) is designed at the middle part of the substrate. The antenna occupied a very compact size of 44.5 × mm 44.5 mm, and both simulated and measured results show an excellent result including bandwidth, gain, and radiation efficiency. Moreover, by controlling the port excitation at both V2X band and 5G mmWave band a full 360° beam-steering can be achieved."

    "abstract": "Marker-based motion capture system (MCS) is the gold standard for analyzing human motion. But in the real world its usage in large-scale applications is limited by its inherent inaccuracy and practical difficulties. These real-world difficulties can be addressed with a marker-less motion capture system. However, its accuracy in quantifying joint Range of Motion (ROM) has not been verified across shoulder movements. In this study, we simultaneously captured marker less and marker-based motion data on six healthy participants performing shoulder abduction and adduction movements. Based on the results we calculated the RMSE value for abduction 0.80° and for adduction 0.683° between both the systems during each movement. The findings imply that the accuracy of the markerless Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) system in ROM measurement is comparable to that of the marker-based system. However, particularly when it comes to shoulder ROM measurements, the direction and positioning of the reflective markers of the OptiTrack system have a significant impact on measurement accuracy."

    "abstract": "To detect, forecast, and represent features in real-time from the Internet of Things (IoT) as well as edge computing scenarios, we present the Evaluation of an EDM Using LSTM in a Secure IoT Environment (EDLSSI) model. This framework amalgamates edge deep learning to achieve real-time event detection, prediction, and feature representation in environmental and IoT contexts. The system is powered by an EventDetection Model (EDM) that employs correlation analysis to identify the factors that most influence events. Using the Gramian Angular Field (GAF) method, sensor data are transformed into pictures so that deep learning can be performed at the network edge. The model makes use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and also an ABiLSTM which improves prediction accuracy by considering long-range context and using an attention mechanism. The Grey Wolf Optimisation (GWO) is responsible for the fine-tuning of the ABiLSTM hyperparameters, and it mimics the hunting strategies of the wolves in a pack. A Residual Group Attention Network (RGA-Net) is implemented to raise the level of feature learning while the computational load is being kept at a minimum. The performance measures show an extraordinarily high overall accuracy of 98.57 %, leading to the correct classification of 1300 out of 1407 attack instances, which corresponds to a True Positive Rate (TPR) of 98.11 %. It also accurately identified 345 normal events, achieving a TPR of 97.18 %, with 10 instances misclassified as attacks, and a high precision for both attack and normal event classifications at 99.05 % and 93.21 % respectively. During training, the model achieved a precision of 97.0 %, a recall of 97.6 %, and an F1-score of 97.2 %, while testing results improved these to 98.9 % precision, 99.2 % recall, and an F1-score of 99.0 %. The AUC scores showed improvement from 97.6% in training to 99.2 % in testing. Accuracy reached 99 % between epochs 15 and 23. EDLSSI was able to obtain its peak performance metrics, the accuracy was 99.1 %, the precision was 98.7 %, the recall was 99.0 %, and the F1score was 98.9 %."

Doctors usually use chest X-rays to detect signs of pneumonia, but manual examination can be time consuming and prone to errors. To support this, AI systems can be used to identify pneumonia faster and more accurately. These systems can analyze X-ray images and recognize pneu monia patterns automatically. Advanced methods enhance the performance of these systems by leveraging knowledge from other imaging tasks or focusing on the most critical regions of the image. Additionally, there are approaches to train these systems with minimal labeled data. Some tools can also highlight the exact lung area affected by pneumonia, providing more detailed insights to doctors.

The second analyzes the correspondence between the radar signal waveform and airflow and belt signal from polysomnography (PSG), and a novel apnea detection algorithm is introduced to assess breathing events based on radar waveforms. To validate the proposed framework, a K-band 4T8R FMCW radar was designed, fabricated, and ceiling-mounted in a home scenario. Radar data were synchronously recorded with PSG for comparison. Various abnormal breathing events, including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), hypopnea, and central sleep apnea (CSA), were accurately detected, demonstrating the framework's feasibility and robustness for long-term home health monitoring applications."

The proposed approach systematically minimizes sidelobes and the half power beamwidth (HPBW), achieving beampattern decoupling and interference suppression superior to the recently reported results in literature.

This would enable more efficient planning and utilization of different solar resources. The results of the study provide a strong foundation for further investigation and useful solar energy forecasting applications. Additionally, this work contributes to the growing body of research demonstrating the ability of deep learning and machine learning models to accurately estimate renewable energy.

In the proposed method, a control system stabilizes the penguin's attitude on an invariant manifold (equilibrium point) to prevent the penguin robot from falling over. The state feedback control was designed separately for the penguin robot's right and left legs during each stance, when one leg remains on the ground so that the control system can switch between left and right control depending on the body's tilt. Furthermore, reinforcement learning was performed using a penguin robot equipped with these control methods. Simulation results demonstrated that a stable stepping motion could be generated by employing posture stabilization control for fall avoidance. Additionally, the learning results showed that forward motion could be acquired from the stepping motion."

    "abstract": "The problem of task allocation in multi-robot systems (MRTA) is critical for optimizing performance in various applications, such as warehouse automation and search and rescue operations. Current algorithms often fail to consider real-life complexities like robot dynamics and energy consumption, leading to inefficiencies. This study aims to address these gaps by proposing improved versions of the auction algorithm (A) and the enhanced auction algorithm (EA), focusing on optimizing task allocation by considering task complexity and robot capabilities. The methodology involves using auction and extended auction algorithms as the backbone, with two improved algorithms proposed to enhance fairness and efficiency. An energy handling function is also incorporated. Six scenarios were simulated, involving 10, 15, and 25 robots with 100 and 200 tasks, respectively. The mean and standard deviation of completion times were computed to evaluate performance. Results indicate that the improved auction (IA) algorithm consistently outperforms the auction (A) algorithm, while the improved enhanced auction (IEA) algorithm generally performs better than the enhanced auction (EA) algorithm. For instance, in scenarios with 25 robots and 200 tasks, the standard deviation of A, IA, EA, and IEA is <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$62.7 \\mathrm{s}, 51.7 \\mathrm{s}, 21.3 \\mathrm{s}$</tex> and 20.5 s, respectively. A lower standard deviation indicates a better distribution. Additionally, the energy handling function significantly improved task allocation efficiency. In conclusion, our improved algorithms demonstrate better performance with the added energy handling function enhancing practical applicability, reducing the standard deviation of completion time by 42.2s (comparing A with IEA). Future work should address real-life robot dynamics and communication delays to further improve the system's efficiency and effectiveness."

Utilizing GIS and Python-based analytical methods, this preliminary investigation offers a comparative assessment of landslide and forest fire susceptibility. Datasets from MODIS fire sites, SRTM DEM, Landsat8/9, and rainfall correlation models were used to provide slope, NDVI, and elevation features. Python module based rasterio, Numpy, Scikit-learn was used to analyze and assess the normalized raster layers to provide the initial susceptibility indicators. An elevation-slope correction value of r=0.46 and a vegetation-slope correlation coefficient of r=0.68 were found by statistical analysis, suggesting that topographic and vegetation stress factors are important in the occurrence of the hazards. According to the thermal response, roughly 53.1% of the Nilgiris as per the study area is classified as having fire risk and 67.9% of the territory is classified as being in landslide susceptibility zone. The results show how Geo-AI based spatial modelling may enhance risk management and encourage sustainable land-use planning in mountainous areas, while also offering preliminary insights into multihazard interactions in the Nilgiris."

    "abstract": "In urban environments, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) positioning is highly susceptible to Non-Line-ofSight (NLOS) errors, resulting in severe degradation of positioning accuracy. GNSS positioning accuracy depends not only on the precision of the observations but also on the spatial geometry of visible satellites, which is commonly quantified by the Position Dilution of Precision (PDOP). Satellites with higher PDOP contributions play a crucial role in improving geometric structure and overall accuracy. However, existing NLOS mitigation approaches mainly focus on removing or deweighting NLOS signals while overlooking the influence of satellite geometry. In dense urban areas, the deterioration of geometric distribution often has a greater impact on positioning accuracy than signal quality, leading to amplified errors and reduced reliability. To address these issues, this paper proposes a stochastic model optimization method driven by intelligent NLOS recognition, in which a Graph Neural Network (GNN) is employed for NLOS signal recognition to jointly enhance GNSS positioning performance. The GNN model extracts environmental and spatial features from sky-view images to achieve accurate NLOS signal recognition. Based on these recognition results, a stochastic model optimization strategy is designed to dynamically adjust the observation weights of NLOS signals according to both signal quality and geometric contribution to PDOP. The proposed framework is integrated into single-point positioning and validated using dynamic datasets collected in Guangzhou city and German cities. Experimental results demonstrate that the GNN model achieves an NLOS recognition accuracy exceeding 80%, while the optimized stochastic model surpasses traditional empirical models, improving positioning accuracy by 28.15%, $12.63 \\%, 60.78 \\%$, and 44.43% in the north, east, vertical, and 3D components, respectively. These results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method and provide a promising solution for robust GNSS positioning in complex urban environments."

The DGS consists of a narrow slot etched along the feedline path of each antenna element. At the same time, the SRR is positioned between the antenna elements to suppress surface wave propagation and near-field coupling. The proposed structure achieves over 3 dB improvement in isolation, reducing mutual coupling from –16.53 dB to below –20 dB.

This study proposes an intelligent framework that integrates crowdsourced cellular geodata with fuzzy logic inference to optimize mobile network selection and radio technology mapping across maritime zones. Using publicly available OpenCellID data, k-means clustering was applied to stratify cell tower distributions and determine radio-type availability in key land and offshore locations. Then a fuzzy inference system (FIS) was developed to assess the preference of the mobile network operator and predict the optimal radio technologies, GSM, UMTS, or LTE, based on signal strength, tower proximity, sample density, and location priority. Visualization techniques, including geospatial graphs, surface response maps, and signal overlays, were used to validate the FIS outputs. The results show that Smart (MNC 3) is the top choice of operators due to its strong coverage of LTE at ground stations and reliable UMTS access in maritime areas. This radio mapping is an important reference point for creating adaptable data routing strategies, which are crucial to maintaining efficient low-power communications with MAVs that can handle delays. This approach contributes to a scalable, data-driven methodology to enhance wireless communication reliability in maritime Internet of Things (IoT) systems."

The paper focusses on important uses of AI, such as autonomous reaction processes, dynamic risk assessment, and early warning systems. It also looks at how AI can speed up recovery efforts both during and after disasters and enable more effective resource allocation. In order to build infrastructure that not only survives shocks but also learns and changes from each incident, a multidisciplinary strategy integrating engineering, data science, and emergency management is suggested. To illustrate the real-world advantages and difficulties of this integration, case studies of AI-enabled disaster response systems in utility networks, transportation, and urban planning are examined.

One of the key challenges in this domain is the complexity of processing unstructured long clinical notes containing sensitive information. Moreover, limitations persist in effectively processing long texts and integrating multiple information sources. This paper therefore proposes a method integrating two medical data sources: structured demographic and admission data, unstructured long clinical notes. Both can be then transformed into a unified text input. This data combination simultaneously leverages quantitative information from tabular data (demographic and initial admission information) and rich supplementary information from clinical notes (medical history, detailed symptoms, etc.), providing a more comprehensive picture of patient condition and improving prediction performance. Additionally, the paper proposes applying masked language modeling to enhance the ModernBERT model to create more effective general representations of entire patient texts compared to traditional approaches that rely solely on BERT. Evaluated on MIMIC-III data, our resulting Ad-ModernBERT model can yield better LOS predictions consistently in many experiments."

To evaluate the effectiveness and reception of the generated jokes, we conducted a human-centered evaluation involving 32 participants with diverse personality profiles. Evaluators rated the jokes across four humour dimensions: Funniness, Offensiveness, Surprise, and Reality Representation. Our findings reveal notable variations in humour perception across personality types based on MBTI. For instance, Sentinels responded more positively to the generated jokes, while Analysts tended to rate them lower across most categories. Additionally, a strong correlation between perceived funniness and surprise highlights the role of unexpectedness in humour appreciation. These results underscore the importance of personality-aware humour generation and suggest that current AI models require further refinement to effectively cater to diverse audiences."

In this paper, we propose inferring interaction relationships among UAVs in a swarm using trajectory data without prior knowledge of control protocols. First, we dynamically segment the trajectory sequences using the Minimum Description Length (MDL) criterion. Subsequently, we construct a cross-lagged panel network (CLPN) for each segment to model temporal dependencies and directional influences between agents, thereby identifying potential causal or leader-follower relationships. Finally, we perform community detection on the inferred networks to uncover latent group structures within the swarm. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high accuracy, effectively capturing the underlying interaction patterns and group structures within UAV swarms."

    "abstract": "Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs) are the basic building blocks of the intelligent transport system as they provide real-time communication between vehicles and infrastructure. Nevertheless, in urban settings where the node density and mobility rates are growing, there are extreme latency and load balancing challenges, as well as spectrum usage. The present paper is a proposal of a Latency-Aware Load Management architecture of Cognitive VANETs implemented with a hybrid model of a metaheuristic Latency-Aware Load Manager (Grey Wolf Optimizer-Differential Evolution (GWO-DE)). The vehicles have cognitive radios that do dynamic spectrum sensing to adjust their communication strategies depending on the real time conditions of the traffic. The suggested methodology is a multi-objective optimization problem, in which the end-to-end latency is minimized, the load is distributed to roadside units (RSUs) and the packets are delivered. An ad hoc latency parameter is created involving end to end delay, queue length, and ratio of packet loss, which dictates offloading as well as channel allocation. The hybrid GWO-DE solution combines the global exploration capabilities of the Grey Wolf Optimization and the adaptive mutation abilities of Differential Evolution to give a powerful answer to dynamic network problems. The outcomes of the simulation prove that the suggested GWO-DE model is superior to the conventional approaches such as PSO, GWO, and DE. The suggested system is characterized by a mean packet delivery accuracy of 95.89% and minimal end-to-end latency by up to 30 and a <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$18-22 {\\%}$</tex> energy saving, respectively, when using higher node densities. This shows its scalability, flexibility and energy efficiency in next-generation VANET applications. The suggested system will provide low-latency and reliable communication needed in safety critical vehicular applications within smart cities and autonomous driving ecosystems."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the low-power potential of SiGe HBTs in V-band low noise amplifier(LNA) designs. An LNA consisting of a single-stage cascode circuit has been designed in the IHP 130nm SiGe technology. Different biasing conditions of the transistors have been investigated to find the optimum for low-power, low-noise and high-gain operation. The current density has been chosen to achieve a proper balance between the gain and noise performance. To minimize the DC power, the supply voltage has been chosen to be the lowest required to ensure sufficient gain and noise figure. The device dimensions of the LNA have been determined to enable a low-loss broadband input matching by solely using a single series inductor. The designed LNA achieves a minimum noise figure of 2.4dB under a nominal supply voltage of 0.6V. The noise figure on average is 2.8dB from 54GHz to 67GHz. At the nominal supply voltage, the LNA consumes only 1.4mW DC power and provides a gain of around 14dB and a bandwidth of 7.3GHz."

We exploit VCVS characteristics to actively control the termination reflection coefficient and extract specific reflection components from time-domain transmission (TDT) waveforms. Existing approaches either oversimplify R–C reflections or require long channels with well-separated phenomena. By varying channel impedance and delay, we demonstrate the proposed method’s capability to decompose complex reflection waveforms under single-loading conditions. Results confirm accurate decomposition across diverse scenarios. While multi-loading environments introduce further complexity, their investigation is reserved for future work."

    "abstract": "A medical image analysis task, such as biomedical image segmentation, and anomaly detection, are the foundations of medical image analysis applications such as tumor localization, organ border delineation, and retinal disease screening. Our recommendation is to use a U-Net-based convolutional neural network to detect anomalies and segment biomedical images in real-time. The encoder-decoder architecture with skip links gives the possibility of highlevel feature representation and also preserving the spatial information. Robustness is enhanced by data augmentation, drop out regularization and batch normalization. The framework was trained and tested on benchmark data, such as ISBI (cell tracking), DRIVE (retinal vascular segmentation) and BraTS (brain tumor). The experimental outcomes show that the performance of the segmentation is good; Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) is 96.27, the Jaccard Index is 93.81, its Precision is 95.44 and Recall is 94.63. A side variational autoencoder with an AUC score of 0.982 and 95.68 % accuracy is employed to identify anomalies. With the example of an NVIDIA RTX 3090, it takes the model only 42 ms to operate on an image, showing almost real-time performance. The proposed U-Net has better segmentation results of 3-5 percent and reduced inference time by 18 percent against state-of-the-art and traditional CNN methods. Since DSC can be reduced by up to 7 % by removing the hybrid anomaly detection module and skip connections, ablation studies confirm their importance. These findings indicate the reliability and scalability of UNet based architectures to biological image analysis in real time. Through effective segmentation and efficient anomaly-detecting, the proposed system demonstrates high potentials in helping to make automated clinical decisions."

To address this challenge, we propose SwitchMix, a dual-level mixedteacher framework designed to progressively narrow the crossmodality discrepancy for unsupervised thermal object detection. The proposed method integrates image-level and sample-level domain mixing to align modality specific spectral and semantic representations, while a teacher-student paradigm gradually shifts supervision from RGB to thermal domains. By periodically activating two complementary teachers, the model assimilates both local and global domain knowledge. Experiments on the FLIR and KAIST datasets demonstrate SwitchMix consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation approaches in both accuracy and robustness. These results highlight the potential of SwitchMix as a generalizable domain adaptation solution for applications such as autonomous driving, defense systems, and intelligent surveillance."

Integrating a Speaker Encoder, an Accent Encoder, and a Voice Conversion model, our system enables real-time accent conversion with minimal processing delays. Unlike traditional AC methods which require native-accented input and suffer from lengthy processing times, our approach operates independently of native utterances, leveraging recent advances in speaker-independent phonetic posteriorgrams for accent conversion. Trained on an extensive dataset encompassing a diverse range of non-native and native English accents, our model proficiently captures intricate phonetic and prosodic nuances, thus facilitating highly accurate native accent synthesis. The proposed system is distinguished by its operational immediacy and reduced computational demands, rendering it a viable solution for immediate application scenarios."

Such data limit the utility of the resulting 3D scans for subsequent point-cloud-based learning and analysis. This study addresses this issue by predicting facial landmarks in the mask region of 3D masked face point clouds using only facial landmarks outside the mask region. To this end, we propose a simple two-stage model that first applies positional encoding to non-mask facial landmarks and then uses an MLP regressor to estimate the missing landmarks in the mask region. The model is trained on an unmasked face dataset and qualitatively evaluated on a masked face dataset from the same survey. As a result, we observed both cases in which mask-region landmarks were accurately reconstructed and failure cases where large variations in facial shape led to unstable predictions. Based on these observations, we analyzed the limitations and underlying causes of the our setting and discussed possible directions for future research."

This paper presents ChurnOnt, an ontology-driven framework that integrates domain knowledge into churn prediction pipelines. We design a churn ontology covering customer, contract, and service concepts, and populate it with real-world telecom and banking datasets to build a knowledge graph. Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules encode expert knowledge and allow a reasoner to infer high-level semantic features (e.g., HighRiskCustomer). These ontology-derived features, combined with baseline attributes, are used to train machine learning models. Our experiments show that ontology-enhanced models improve recall and F1-score for churners, providing more accurate detection of customers at risk. Beyond predictive gains, the ontology also generates human-understandable explanations for churn predictions, bridging the gap between data-driven accuracy and business interpretability.

    "abstract": "The transition to digital psychiatric records introduces distinctive challenges, due to the sensitivity of content and the conversational style of clinician-patient dialogues. Prior evaluations of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems in psychiatry showed that while Word Error Rate (WER) remains consistently low, Diarization Error Rate (DER) is highly variable. Although synchronous speaker diarization is desirable for real-time transcription, it suffers from processing instability and limited platform availability. On the other hand, asynchronous diarization requires audio recording, introducing serious privacy risks and regulatory barriers in Mental Health Services (MHS). Both approaches also rely on voice-based separation and identification of speakers, which is less effective when speakers share similar demographic traits, such as gender or age, leading to elevated diarization error rates. These aspects position diarization as the main bottleneck in the adoption of ASR workflows in psychiatry. This study addresses these challenges by combining synchronous speech-to-text (STT) transcription with large language model (LLM) based diarization. This approach removes the reliance on voice-based speaker separation and eliminates the need to store or process raw audio, which improves privacy protection for highly sensitive clinical data. Six state-of-the-art LLMs: GPT-5, Grok-4, DeepSeek Reasoner, Perplexity Sonar Pro, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Claude Sonnet-4 were evaluated on three psychiatric session transcripts without labels, representing female-female (FF), female-male (FM), and male-male (MM) speaker pairs. Each transcript was merged into unsegmented text, and models were tasked with assigning labels based on provided context of psychiatric treatment sessions. DER was computed using the punctuation-segmented method from prior ASR research. The results show that LLM based DER ranged between <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$0-4 \\%$</tex>, compared to ASR based diarization where DER reached up to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{5 2. 2 \\%}$</tex> in some cases. Moreover, the persistent minor errors were largely benign affirmations that did not alter the factual meaning or clinical interpretation. This demonstrates that synchronous STT combined with LLM diarization functions as Privacy Enhancing Technology (PET). This approach provides a more accurate, stable, and privacy-aligned alternative for psychiatric documentation, enhancing clinical workflow efficiency while addressing the limitations of both synchronous and asynchronous speaker diarization."

It is necessary to predict the labor cost of power transmission line construction and achieve quantitative control. This paper proposes a prediction algorithm for the unit price of labor cost in transmission line construction based on the PM interval estimation algorithm. Firstly, analyze the characteristics of the labor cost unit price in power transmission line construction, and establish an interval fluctuation model for the labor cost unit price. Secondly, a time series analysis was conducted on the interval fluctuation model of the unit price of labor costs, and a time series interval prediction model for the unit price of labor costs was established. Then, the PM interval estimation algorithm is employed to identify the parameters of the time series interval prediction model, thereby enabling the prediction of the unit price of labor costs. Finally, the accuracy of the prediction model was verified and analyzed using actual engineering data. The prediction model can effectively predict the unit price of labor cost, further supporting the control of labor costs in the transmission lines construction."

Meanwhile, LLM-based models seldom incorporate explicit spatial semantics. We propose POI-LLM, which augments a partially frozen LLM with spatial knowledge for spatial-temporal modeling. We partition urban space into network-consistent parcels and enriches them with point-of-interest (POI) embeddings. A lightweight cross-attention module aligns parcel spatial embedding with temporal embedding to form inputs to LLM, which captures long-range spatiotemporal dependencies. Experiments on real Origin-destination(OD) flow datasets offer evidence that POI-LLM is a powerful spatial-temporal learner that outpeforms state-of-the-art models. This show that explicitly encoding spatial semantics and selectively adapting LLMs offers an efficient and effective route to spatial-temporal modeling."

CRBP utilizes the Bosphorus 3D Face Database, reconstructing textured 3-D meshes for each individual and producing six canonical 2-D projections. To improve model compatibility and minimize background noise, each projection is processed using YOLOv8 for face detection. This results in two organized subsets, namely, CRBP-Raw (full scene) and CRBP-YOLOv8 (face-cropped). This dual-format design facilitates thorough benchmarking of pose-invariant, occlusion-resilient, and expression-aware models within a convolutional neural network-compatible image space. Dataset statistics indicate that YOLOv8 enhances facial alignment, however, it also introduces sample selection bias, especially in extreme yaw and occlusion scenarios.

    "abstract": "The apparel industry has witnessed a significant shift toward 3D virtual design, driven by advances in simulation and digitization technologies. Central to this transformation are digital twins, which allow designers to test and refine garment designs virtually, reducing reliance on physical prototyping. A critical aspect of this process is accurately capturing the drape behavior of fabrics, as it impacts both the aesthetic and functional properties of garments. Traditional fabric digitization methods involve mechanical testing of fabric samples, but they are labor-intensive, costly, and require specialized equipment. Recently, AI-based digitization techniques have emerged, offering potential advantages in terms of cost and logistics, though their accuracy remains uncertain. This study addresses the gap in knowledge regarding the accuracy of AI-based fabric digitization by utilizing the Cusick drape test—a standardized method for assessing fabric drape behavior. We introduce a reference digitization pipeline based on traditional mechanical testing and perform a comprehensive comparative study of six commercially available digitization methods, including both traditional and AI-based approaches. Using a diverse set of fabrics, we evaluate the accuracy of the digitized fabrics against real-world measurements. Our results demonstrate that AI-based methods can achieve competitive accuracy, while also highlighting areas for further improvement. We present a publicly available dataset containing real fabric properties, their digitized versions, as well as their corresponding real and digital drape metrics, which can serve as a valuable resource for further research and development in fabric digitization."

    "abstract": "Recently, the integration of the efficient feed-forward scheme into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has been actively explored. However, most existing methods focus on sparse view reconstruction of small regions and cannot produce eligible whole-scene reconstruction results in terms of either quality or efficiency. In this paper, we propose FreeSplat++, which focuses on extending the generalizable 3DGS to become an alternative approach to large-scale indoor whole-scene reconstruction, which has the potential of significantly accelerating the reconstruction speed and improving the geometric accuracy. To facilitate whole-scene reconstruction, we initially propose the Low-cost Cross-View Aggregation framework to efficiently process extremely long input sequences. Subsequently, we introduce a carefully designed pixel-wise triplet fusion method to incrementally aggregate the overlapping 3D Gaussian primitives from multiple views, adaptively reducing their redundancy. Furthermore, given the fused 3DGS primitives with accumulated weights after the fusion step, we propose a weighted floater removal strategy that can effectively reduce floaters, which serves as an explicit depth fusion approach that is tailored for generalizable 3DGS methods and becomes crucial in whole-scene reconstruction. After the feed-forward reconstruction of 3DGS primitives, we investigate a depth-regularized per-scene fine-tuning process. Leveraging the dense, multi-view consistent depth maps obtained during the feed-forward prediction phase for an extra constraint, we refine the entire scene's 3DGS primitive to enhance rendering quality while preserving geometric accuracy. Extensive experiments confirm that our FreeSplat++ significantly outperforms existing generalizable 3DGS methods, especially in whole scene reconstructions. Compared to conventional per-scene optimized 3DGS approaches, our method with depth-regularized per-scene fine-tuning demonstrates substantial improvements in reconstruction accuracy and a notable reduction in training time."

Unlike prior MRI-compatible SEA designs, our module uses a transmission force sensing SEA architecture, with four off-the-shelf compression springs placed between the gearbox and motor housings. To enable precise torque control, we develop a controller based on a disturbance observer, specifically designed for velocity-sourced motors. This controller improves torque regulation, even under varying external impedance, enhancing the actuator’s suitability for MRI-guided medical interventions. Experimental validation confirms effective torque control in both 3 Tesla MRI and non-MRI settings, achieving a 5% settling time of 0.05 s and steady-state error within 2.5% of the actuator’s maximum output torque. Notably, the controller maintains consistent performance across both low- and high-impedance conditions."

    "abstract": "A fundamental requirement for real-world robotic deployment is the ability to understand and respond to natural language instructions. Existing language-conditioned manipulation tasks typically assume that instructions are perfectly aligned with the environment. This assumption limits robustness and generalization in realistic scenarios where instructions may be ambiguous, irrelevant, or infeasible. To address this problem, we introduce RAtional MAnipulation (RAMA), a new benchmark that challenges models with both unseen executable instructions and defective ones that should be rejected. In RAMA, we construct a dataset with over 14 000 samples, including diverse defective instructions spanning six dimensions: visual, physical, semantic, motion, safety, and out-of-context. We further propose the rational vision-language-action model (RationalVLA). It is a dual system for robotic arms that integrates the high-level vision-language model with the low-level manipulation policy by introducing learnable latent space embeddings. This design enables RationalVLA to reason over instructions, reject infeasible commands, and execute manipulation effectively. Experiments demonstrate that RationalVLA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on RAMA by a 14.5% higher success rate and 0.96 average task length in the CALVIN simulation environment, while maintaining competitive performance on standard manipulation tasks. Real-world trials further validate its effectiveness and robustness in practical applications."

    "abstract": "The escalating spread of Pine Wilt Disease (PWD) presents a severe threat to forest ecosystems, while predicting its complex spatiotemporal dynamics remains a major challenge. To address this, we developed a novel deep learning framework integrating a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to deconstruct and predict the Occurrence of PWD (OPWD) in China for the period 1982–2022. Using GeoDetector, we identified 16 key factors and quantified their contributions, revealing that human-mediated factors (e.g., wood-processing factory density, road network density) are the dominant drivers of PWD spread, exhibiting strong synergistic interactions. The GCN-LSTM model demonstrated exceptional predictive performance, significantly outperforming conventional models with an overall accuracy of 0.93 and an AUC of 0.87. Crucially, the model deconstructed the spread of PWD into two distinct mechanisms: a stable, localized continuous spread governed by natural factors, and a volatile, long-distance leaping spread driven primarily by human activities. This mechanistic deconstruction provides a robust explanation for the historical patterns of the epidemic. This study provides not only a highly accurate predictive tool for large-scale PWD monitoring but also a powerful analytical paradigm for disentangling the drivers of biological invasions, underscoring the imperative for developing spatially explicit, mechanism-aware management strategies to effectively combat the global threat of PWD."

The model has been tested on a large set of 53 international foods both vegetarian and non-vegetarian.VGG19 was chosen because it has good performance in features detection, and Grad-Cam shows the regions on the image that affect the choices made by the model, making the process of classifying images more transparent and credible. This intelligible AI system enables users/researchers to visualize and confirm classification performance. Through experimental research, it is proven that the Grad-CAM-improved version of VGG19 classifier yields a staggering 96% accuracy compared to traditional machine learning models like Naive Bayes and Decision Tree. The identified method demonstrates the high potential of real-time applications in monitoring food intake and in dietary assessment."

    "abstract": "Fingerprint biometrics plays a crucial role in biometric identification, especially in applications such as criminal investigations. Although recent progress in recognition methodology has significantly enhanced automated fingerprint recognition, these systems still rely heavily on the quality of the input fingerprints. In criminal investigations, fingerprints are often of low quality due to their incidental deposition from natural oils and sweat, rather than being deliberately captured under controlled conditions. This degradation can significantly impact usability and identification accuracy, underscoring the need for effective Fingerprint Quality Assessment (FQA) methods. In this paper, we establish the Crime Scene Fingerprints quality assessment Dataset (CSFD-10k), the largest dataset of its kind, containing 11,500 fingerprint images from real criminal investigations. Of these, 10,000 samples are assigned Mean Opinion Scores (MOSs) for correlation testing, while the remaining 1,500 are labeled based on matching performance for generalizability testing. All labels are provided by frontline criminal police officers. Using this dataset, we propose a deep neural network-based Dual-Branch FQA (DB-FQA) framework that integrates image-level and edge-level features. The DB-FQA enhances ridge details by transforming raw grayscale fingerprints into edge maps using the Logical/Linear operator. A dual-branch network processes both the raw fingerprint and the edge map, and the Multi-scale Adaptive Cross feature Fusion (MACF) module fuses these features, guided by the edge map to highlight quality-related regions of interest. Extensive experiments demonstrate the robustness and superiority of our proposed method, offering substantial support for forensic fingerprint biometrics.

    "abstract": "Text removal is an important task in processing both scene and document images. However, existing scene text removal (STR) methods are primarily focus on scene text images. The STR models (trained by scene text images) perform poorly on document images with dense, complex textured backgrounds. We discover that the limitations of existing methods can be attributed to the difficuties in background features estimation in the regions to be erased, which is based on the knowledge from neighboring regions in the input images and priors learned from the training data. The background features estimation performance degrades under the cross-domain scenarios, and compromises the quality of STR results. To address these issues, we introduce DiffEraser, a novel text removal framework that leverages prior knowledge from the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) for removing text in both scene and document images. Our DiffEraser incorporates two key innovations to fully exploit the prior knowledge of LDM. First, we replace the conventional Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE) encoder with a Diffusion-Prior (DP) encoder, aiming to integrate the heterogeneous information from the LDM prior knowledge in latent space with the multi-level encoded features of the input image. Second, we introduce a Latent-Fusion (LF) decoder that integrates the heterogeneous features from both the LDM and DP encoders to generate high-quality text-erased results. To evaluate the generalization performance of our DiffEraser, we focus on the cross-domain protocols and construct a document image dataset, NPID295, which contains 295 types of passports and identity cards. Notably, when trained on a scene text dataset, DiffEraser significantly outperforms existing STR methods in the challenging NPID295 dataset. The resources of this work will be available online upon acceptance."

    "abstract": "Videos captured under real-world adverse weather conditions typically suffer from uncertain hybrid weather efforts. However, existing algorithms can only remove one type of weather degradation at a time and deal with different weather conditions with separate models, thus may fail to handle real-world stochastic hybrid scenarios. Besides, the model training is also infeasible due to the lack of paired video data to characterize the coexistence of multiple weather. To ameliorate the aforementioned issue, we propose a novel unified model, dubbed UniWRV, to remove multiple heterogeneous video weather degradations in an all-in-one fashion. Specifically, to tackle degenerate spatial feature heterogeneity, we propose a tailored weather prior guided module that queries exclusive priors for different instances as prompts to steer spatial feature characterization. To tackle degenerate temporal feature heterogeneity, we propose a dynamic routing aggregation module that can automatically select optimal fusion paths for different instances to dynamically integrate temporal features. Furthermore, we propose a real-world adaptation training scheme that leverages CLIP priors to provide semantic supervision for unlabeled real-world weather-degraded videos, thereby enabling the model to better cope with the diverse and complex real-world weather conditions. Additionally, we managed to construct a new synthetic video dataset, termed HWVideo, for learning and benchmarking multiple hybrid adverse weather removal, which contains 15 hybrid weather conditions with a total of 1500 adverse-weather/clean paired video clips. Real-world hybrid weather videos are also collected to facilitate model generalizability. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our UniWRV exhibits robust and superior adaptation capability in multiple heterogeneous degradations learning scenarios, including various generic video restoration tasks beyond weather removal."

    "abstract": "Fog computing providers have started providing services in closer proximity to the users by leasing the unused computational resources of users' devices. The leased devices are increasingly used for many time-sensitive and IoT applications. Despite the advantages of Fog, due to the highly mobile and dynamic nature of Fog devices, the resources or devices may fail at any time or may not always be available for the processing of the applications, which leads to degradation of service quality and an increase in application processing time. Hence, effective selection of the resources in the Fog computing environment by considering mobility, heterogeneity, and failure of devices is a complex task. Traditional resource selection techniques may not be applied directly in Fog computing environments due to their dynamic and unique resource characteristics. Therefore, this article proposes a Markov chain-based resource selection model to improve the quality of service by minimizing disruptions and managing device failures. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is evaluated using simulations, which take failure traces, current resource usage, and mobility as input from a dataset archive. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in terms of average disruption rates, average latency, and average overutilization. Our analysis shows significant improvements in average latency reduction of approximately 11.83%, and an average overutilization improvement by 16.17%."

This is because NN abandons the strong a priori knowledge of neuroscience and completely relies on training to extract EEG features. How to integrate the characteristics of neural signals into the design of the basic operator of the NNs while retaining its learning ability is the focus of this work. In this work, we proposed a function predefined convolutional NN (FPCNN) to search for the best frequency points and channel weights to decode spontaneous EEG signals. Among the FPCNN, a novel function predefined convolutional (FPC) layer adopts a learnable way to search for the key spatial–frequency parameters of spontaneous EEG, making its parameters have clear physical meanings. Furthermore, a trainable quadrature detector (TQD) based on FPC was constructed, and the quadrature characteristic was utilized to ensure the capture of complex phase change signals. The core contribution of our method lies in the proposal of a novel NN operator for decoding spontaneous EEG, and a quadrature scheme for handling the phase changes of signals. The experimental results show that the proposed FPCNN significantly improves the performance by 2.09% (<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${}^{\\ast } $</tex-math> </inline-formula>), 3.08% (<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${}^{\\ast } $</tex-math> </inline-formula>), and 3.41% (<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${}^{\\ast \\ast }$</tex-math> </inline-formula>), respectively, compared with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on three spontaneous EEG datasets. Moreover, the training and testing time cost of FPCNN in a non-GPU environment only takes 67.96 and 19.36 s per epoch. Its savings in computing resources and time are very beneficial for EEG processing in diverse environments. In addition, visualization experiments demonstrated the interpretability and stability of the proposed FPCNN. The experimental results show that our method is efficient, stable, and interpretable. This work has effectively improved the decoding efficiency of spontaneous EEG signals and demonstrated the power of combining traditional signal processing methods with NNs."

    "abstract": "To address the issue of degraded positioning accuracy in the Inertial Navigation System/Global Navigation Satellite System (INS/GNSS) integrated navigation systems caused by inaccurate measurement noise statistics and sudden abnormal measurements in complex environments, an INS/GNSS navigation method based on an improved Levenberg-Marquardt-Gauss-Newton (LM-GN) iterative optimization is proposed. This approach identifies and handles abnormal measurements using residual chi-square detection and applies an improved LM–GN iterative mechanism to correct the identified anomalies. By integrating a trust-region strategy with the LM/GN algorithm, an adaptive damping factor and iterative step selection mechanism are constructed. This design ensures numerical stability while improving iteration efficiency and reducing computational load. The corrected measurements are then fused within a Kalman filter framework, enabling adaptive adjustment of the filter gain and effectively suppressing the impact of abnormal measurements on state estimation. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with the conventional Kalman filter and the Sage–Husa adaptive filter, the proposed method improves velocity accuracy by 58.7% and 37.6%, respectively, and position accuracy by 43.4% and 21.7%, significantly enhancing the positioning accuracy and robustness of INS/GNSS integrated navigation systems"

Massive amounts of data, such as power generation capacity, load information, grid operation status, control instructions and user electricity consumption data, need to interact at high speed and reliably among all links of power generation, transmission, distribution and consumption. Against this backdrop, the research on the security of data transmission in power systems is of crucial and far-reaching significance. In response to the challenges faced by existing algorithms in terms of anti-attack capability, device integration, and standardization, this paper proposes a light image encryption scheme based on hybrid chaotic mapping and dynamic pixel diffusion. This scheme uses chaotic laser in the light domain for carrier masking, and implements efficient chaotic scrambling and diffusion operations in the digital signal processor in the electrical domain. The aim is to construct a multi-level and highly secure photonic-cooperative encryption system. The simulation results show that this scheme maintains a nearly linear speed encryption efficiency while demonstrating excellent robustness against chosen plaintext attacks and noise interference, and it can well accommodate the existing optical communication frame structure."

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed growing interest in personalized federated learning (pFL), which effectively addresses the concurrent needs for privacy protection, collaborative model training, and handling of statistical heterogeneity inherent in non-IID client data. Typical pFL approaches aim to capture both global patterns and client-specific representations from decentralized datasets to mitigate the effects of data heterogeneity. Nevertheless, the personalized features currently extracted tend to be imprecise and often contain noise, thereby limiting the effectiveness of personalization on local clients. To tackle this issue, we propose FedCFS (Federated Conditional Feature Selection). FedCFS dynamically gates raw features into global-robust features (i.e., features with limited contribution to model performance) and local-sensitive features (i.e., features with significant contributions to model performance), while filtering out noise; The two pathways are then fed into the global and personalized heads correspondingly. This sample-level operation allows FedCFS to perform feature decoupling at a more granular level compared to existing pFL approaches. Comprehensive evaluations on computer vision and natural language processing tasks demonstrate that FedCFS surpasses 11 state-of-the-art methods, exceeding the best traditional and personalized baselines by up to 28.64% and 1.07%, respectively."

A predictive model consists of three major components. A predictive model comprises three key components. It starts with a basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is then improved using advanced regularization and evaluation techniques. Finally, an ensemble model is constructed by integrating the custom CNN with pretrained architectures like MobileNetV2 and ResNet50. In addition, the ensemble system incorporated gradual unfreezing, data enhancement, and explainability using Grad-CAM. To make it easily accessible, realtime deployment through a Gradio interface was also implemented. These features achieved significant improvements in the user interpretability, accuracy, and robustness of the model. Its potential utility in clinical settings for the early detection of Alzheimer’s disease is highlighted."

However, the practical issue of asynchronous data streams, caused by differing sampling rates, is often overlooked in extended object tracking (EOT). This asynchronicity prevents the direct application of high-performance single-sensor EOT methods and introduces significant fusion errors, especially during target maneuvers where the kinematic and extension states are tightly coupled. This work bridges this gap by adapting an expectation-maximization-based EOT method for a practical dual-sensor asynchronous setup. A motion-model-based prediction strategy is utilized to align the sensor data temporally, enabling effective fusion. The entire tracking system is validated through simulations of a scenario involving a coordinated turn. Results demonstrate that the proposed integration provides an effective solution for asynchronous sensor fusion."

Additionally, the proposed design includes more slotted structures per unit length than conventional slotted waveguide array antennas, resulting in increased field leakage and improved PHC. The simulated PHC of the proposed antenna is 269 MW. The proposed antenna has a length of 8.1λ, a measured gain of 17 dBi, and a side lobe level (SLL) of 10.4 dB.

To support training and evaluation, we collect an indoor dataset of $\\mathbf{2 5, 7 4 3}$ paired IR-depth frames from 7 subjects.

    "abstract": "The sheer increase in the number of connected devices of the 5G and beyond wireless networks has compounded the pressure on smart and dynamic spectrum sharing. Conventional spectrum allocation algorithms such as static assignment, game-theoretic optimization, and single-agent reinforcement learning struggle with the high-dimensional, diverse, and time-varying characteristics of cognitive radio environments. To overcome these difficulties, the proposed study proposes a Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) framework that can be used to facilitate cooperative and decentralized spectrum management between multiple cognitive radio users. The agents set policies in a collaborative manner, and each can learn the best policies using Deep Q-Networks (DQN) with Actor-Critic system aggregation around each agent independent of the other agent, observing local environmental states, which include channel occupancy, signal-to-interference-plusnoise ratio (SINR), and transmission power levels of the agent. The suggested framework exploits the idea of interagent communication and experience sharing and reduces spectral collisions, increases throughput, and maximizes energy efficiency. The proposed MADRL-based model under dynamic traffic and user mobility conditions has a 32 % improvement in spectrum utilization efficiency, 25% decrease in interference, and 20 % energy saving as compared to conventional Q-learning and single-agent DRL frameworks. Combining multi-agent coordination and deep reinforcement learning offers scalability, adaptability and robustness needed in next-generation cognitive 6 G networks to provide intelligent, selforganizing, and sustainable spectrum management. This research is expected to result in a very adaptive spectrum allocation scheme that will allow improving the performance, reliability, and spectral fairness of a network in heterogeneous and high-density communication scenarios."

Furthermore, two additional isolation zeros are created by adding parallel open-circuited stepped-impedance stubs to the output ports. This configuration achieves an impressive 90% isolation fractional bandwidth while also enhancing passband selectivity. To address the harmonic responses that are inherent in the wideband design, a broadband band-stop filter is incorporated at the input port. This filter generates three transmission zeros at 7.3 GHz, 10 GHz, and 12.63 GHz, enabling a significant 20 dB suppression of the second harmonic. The proposed design successfully provides a high-performance power divider that addresses two critical limitations of conventional structures."

    "abstract": "Pneumonia remains a major global health challenge, particularly in regions where radiological expertise is limited. While deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved expert-level accuracy on well-curated chest X-ray datasets, their performance degrades significantly when applied across domains due to distributional discrepancies, or domain shift. In this study, we present a Domain-Adversarial Neural Network (DANN)-based framework for unsupervised cross-dataset pneumonia detection. Our approach employs a DenseNet121-based feature extractor shared between a label classifier and a domain discriminator connected via a Gradient Reversal Layer (GRL). The model is trained on the pediatric Kermany dataset and evaluated on a balanced subset of the NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset without access to target labels. To mitigate the severe class imbalance in the source domain, class-weighted binary cross-entropy loss is used. Our proposed DANN architecture achieves an area under the ROC(Receiver Operating Characteristic curve)curve (AUC) of 0.6803 and an F1-score of 0.6762 on the target domain, outperforming multiple non-adapted CNN baselines. Further validation is provided through UMAP visualizations, which illustrate improved feature alignment across domains. In addition, McNemar’s test (p < 0.001) confirms the model’s ability to learn robust, domain-invariant representations. The key contribution of this work is the development and validation of a DANN-based framework that explicitly addresses the pediatric-to-adult domain shift in pneumonia detection, validated using UMAP visualization and McNemar’s test, providing one of the first systematic demonstrations of adversarial domain adaptation for medical imaging."

    "abstract": "UPI has transformed the way consumers pay online, making the transaction faster and easier. It is now used for everyday activities such as shopping, bill payment, and money transfers. However, as more people use UPI, the frequency of fraud instances has increased. Fake QR codes, fraudulent links, and other deceptive approaches are common tricks. To address this issue, we developed a system that detects fraud using machine learning. It operates in two steps. In the first stage, we identify fraud using models such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression that learn from previous transaction data. The second level focuses on unknown threats.We use techniques such as clustering and Isolation Forest to identify unique QR codes or URLs that could suggest new types of fraud. Each stage generates a fraud score, which we combine for greater accuracy. We also used Gradio to construct a simple real-time alert interface. This enables payment providers to promptly detect and prevent suspicious conduct, protecting both users and companies."

    "abstract": "Agriculture is crucial for developing economies. Particularly in India, a large portion of the population depends on agriculture for their livelihood. However, there are many challenges in disease prediction and optimizing the use of fertilizer. This paper presents the novel aspects of recommending appropriate treatments for plants. We use deep learning (DL) to design system for detecting plant leaf diseases, addressing the current research challenges for fertilizer optimization. We have implemented advanced convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures: MobileNetV2, EfficientNetB0, and ResNet50 to classify plant leaf images. We used ten categories, including bacterial, fungal, and viral diseases, as well as healthy leaves. The system was trained and evaluated using a large, multimodal dataset. We observed that EfficientNetB0 achieved superior performance with a higher accuracy of 96.73% compared with both Mo-bileNetV2 and ResNet50 in effectively classifying plant leaf diseases. Our findings show that early disease diagnosis and customized treatment recommendations made possible by the suggested framework can greatly enhance agricultural decision-making."

    "abstract": "In the current construction of smart grids, the safe operation of low-voltage meter boxes is of great significance to the stability of the power system. However, influenced by factors such as poor contact, overload, and ambient temperature rise during long-term operation, these meter boxes are prone to burn faults, which in severe cases can lead to power interruptions and fire risks. To address this issue, this paper proposes a deep learning-based method for detecting burn faults in low-voltage meter boxes. First, the SMOTE oversampling technique is introduced to augment minority-class samples, alleviating the issues of small sample size and class imbalance, thereby enhancing the model's ability to identify burn faults. Then, the Transformer model is utilized to model multi-dimensional time-series data such as voltage, current, and power factor. Based on the self-attention mechanism, this model effectively captures long-term dependencies and potential anomaly patterns. On this basis, this paper constructs the TransSMOTE-BurnAlert framework, integrating the synergistic effects of data augmentation and deep modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves remarkable performance in the fault detection task, with a classification accuracy of 81.33% and a recall rate of 81.33%. This study provides robust technical support for the intelligent detection of burn faults in low-voltage meter boxes, contributing to the safe and stable operation of the distribution system."

    "abstract": "Density peak clustering (DPC) is a clustering algorithm based on fast search and discovery of density peak points. In recent years, DPC has gained widespread attention from researchers due to its advantages of not requiring the pre-specification of the number and shape of clusters, and being insensitive to noise and outliers. However, since the density and density peak point calculations of DPC are dependent on Euclidean distance, there are two problems: 1) it is not suitable for manifold structures, and 2) it inevitably faces the “curse of dimensionality” in complex high-dimensional data, which can lead to a decline in the algorithm's clustering performance. To address these two problems, this paper proposes the U-DPC method, which utilizes the UMAP algorithm, one of the most outstanding algorithms in manifold learning, to preprocess the data by reducing its dimensions, and then uses the DPC algorithm to complete the clustering. Experimental results show that compared with DPC, the clustering performance of U-DPC algorithm on high-dimensional data, such as single-cell sequencing and images, is improved by over 20% in terms of the ACC metric."

    "abstract": "With the rapid growth of short-video platforms, fake video news has become a critical issue, characterized by its high deceptiveness and severe social consequences arising from its multi-modal nature. This paper focuses on a subtle yet insidious variant: fake news with multi-modal contextual inconsistencies. In such content, creators deliberately embed semantic contradictions across modalities and disrupt context within modalities to mislead viewers. Existing methods, however, struggle to detect these manipulations effectively, largely because they lack deep modeling of contextual relations and fail to replicate the staged, iterative attention mechanisms of human cognition. Addressing this gap, we propose a cognitive-inspired architecture named the Multi-stage Multi-modal Contextual Attention Network (MMCAN). By employing a six-stage cascaded design, MMCAN progressively fuses features from text (e.g., headlines, subtitles), visuals (e.g., frames), and audio (e.g., speech, background music) to simulate the human cognitive process of iterative verification. Empirical results on a public dataset demonstrate that our model significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods. Our study highlights that incorporating cognitive principles and modeling both intra- and inter-modal dependencies are essential for advancing multi-modal fake video news detection."

Unlike typical RIS designs that use patterned films laminated onto glass, our method directly forms a metal mesh grid on a transparent glass substrate and mounts electronic components such as PIN diodes or varactors using surface-mount technology (SMT). This process removes the need for a separate film layer, maintains transparency, and simplifies fabrication. The transparent and integrated structure allows the RIS to be installed on building windows or glass walls without additional support, enabling it to function as a coverage enhancement repeater. This design offers a practical and scalable way to apply RIS in future 6G communication environments. A protective cover glass may also be considered in future designs to enhance environmental durability for outdoor deployments."

    "abstract": "In off-road autonomous navigation, both localization and perception suffer from significant uncertainty due to irregular terrain, vegetation occlusion, and sparse sensor measurements. Traditional path planning methods generally optimize efficiency, comfort, or energy consumption, but rarely account for the uncertainty of localization and environment modeling. This often leads to unreliable trajectories in challenging environments. To address this issue, we propose an uncertainty-aware path planning framework that explicitly integrates dual uncertainty constraints from both RF-LIO-based(Tightly coupled positioning) localization and DEM-based terrain perception. Specifically, localization uncertainty is quantified from the covariance of RF-LIO pose estimation, while perception uncertainty is modeled from DEM(Digital Elevation Model) cell statistics including point density, elevation variance, and missing-data ratio. These two uncertainty costs are incorporated into a unified planning cost function for both global and local planners. Experimental results in grassland, forest, gravel, and slope environments demonstrate that the proposed method improves task success rate and navigation robustness by avoiding high-uncertainty areas, while maintaining reasonable efficiency."

The shape of the wind box and the deflector plate are parametrically modelled by the sixth-order Bézier curve. An integrated Bayesian agent model fusing Gaussian process regression (GPR), gradient boost tree (LSBoost) and neural network (NN) is constructed to achieve high-precision prediction and uncertainty quantification through Softmax adaptive weighted fusion with cross-validation error. On this basis, a ParEGO multi-objective optimization strategy based on the Bayesian optimization framework is introduced to screen the Pareto solution set by Sobol sequence sampling with non-dominated ordering. The results show that the method can effectively achieve the three-objective co-optimization under the limited sample condition. The maximum deviation is found to be no more than 12% by Fluent numerical simulation verification, which verifies the reliability of the EBSM model. The simulation results of the whole duct flow field are highly consistent with the measured data, and the air outlet is more uniform."

These findings highlight both the promise and challenges of OES-based neural regression, providing a foundation for extending this methodology to Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) processes, where energy efficiency and carbon reduction are of greater importance. In the future, the approach may support real-time monitoring and closed-loop gas control for sustainable semiconductor thin-film manufacturing."

    "abstract": "The research suggests a Federated Deep Learning Framework to Privacy-Preserving Cancer Diagnosis which is aimed at allowing several medical institutions to engage in collaborative learning without breaching the confidentiality of patient information. It consists of the Z-Score Normalization of standardized preprocessing, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) of the most suitable features and BiLSTM with Attention classifier, which exploits intricate temporal and spatial interactions among multi-modal cancer data. The system is implemented with TensorFlow Federated (TFF), guaranteeing decentralized training and safe aggregation of the parameters, without having to exchange raw data. It has been shown through experimental tests to have an accuracy of 95.7, large convergence rate, and communication efficiency. The hybrid privacy policy is a way of reducing leakage risk and still retaining model robustness. The study lays the groundwork toward a scalable and secure framework of distributed cancer diagnostics, the inter-institutional cooperation, the increased accuracy of early detection, and the adherence to the current healthcare data privacy standards."

    "abstract": "High-fidelity image reconstruction under unknown degradation conditions is a persistent challenge in computer vision. Classical restoration methods are usually based on task related priors or guided learning of known distortions which restrict their application in natural contexts. The paper presents a new Dual-Attention Diffusion Vision Network (DADV-Net) with Zero-Shot Adaptation to be used to perform robust and perceptually accurate image reconstruction. The presented model is a U-Net-based diffusion generative backbone with two-attention modules Global Self-Attention as a semantic structure preservation and Local Cross-Attention as a texture refinement, which allows it to acquire rich contextual priors and reconstruct images even in the case of severe degradation. To boost the generalization, we add a Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layer that is trained through meta-learning to enable the model to change dynamically to new types of degradation without requiring retraining. Assessments in ten standard and real-world degradation environments show that DADV-Net performs better than state-of-the-art baseline on both fidelity and perceptual quality. The model attains the highest PSNR of 34.3 dB, SSIM of 0.964, and the zero-shot generalization rate of 84.7 % and with steadily increasing LPIPS and inference rates. The method of Ablation establishes the personal contribution of both dual-attention and zero-shot layers. Moreover, the subjective ratings of human beings put DADV-Net in the forefront of the most aesthetically appealing image among various standards. The results indicate that the architecture proposed can be a scalable, general purpose solution to image reconstruction across domains."

    "abstract": "The burgeoning LEO (low-Earth-orbit) satellite applications necessitate cost-effective phased-array antennas for the large-scale deployment of satellite internet terminals. Conventional aperture-shared phased arrays exhibit high manufacturing costs due to complex multi-layer stacking structures. To address this problem, this paper proposes a high-tolerance planar coupler based on low-cost BGA (ball grid array) split integration. This design utilizes a split architecture, which decouples the antenna elements from the feed network. As a result, the physical integration constraints between the active circuit and the passive antenna are eliminated. This significantly reduces fabrication complexity and manufacturing costs for phased arrays. The return loss of the planar coupler from 10.7 to 14.5 GHz is greater than 13 dB. The amplitude imbalance is less than 0.7dB, and the phase difference is 90° ± 6°. Finally, the design also tolerates processing variations during BGA assembly, enabling low-cost mass production of phased arrays."

FIoU calculated the diagonal distance of the overlap area of the IoU of the real box and the predicted box. Compared with the center point distance of CIoU, the diagonal distance is more suitable for the calculation of the IoU Loss function of the occluded target. The CIoU in the algorithm was replaced by FIoU to improve the regression accuracy of the algorithm for the occluded target. A multi-scale convolution module DCD is proposed for small target problem. The module uses convolution of different scales to extract features of different scales, and fuses channel features of four convolution channels to exchange channel information. To obtain a more comprehensive and rich feature representation. A multi-scale convolutional network is constructed by replacing common convolution in C2f with DCD module to improve the effect of small target detection. The experimental results were compared and verified on the KITTI target detection dataset, and finally the ablation experiment was conducted and compared with the current mainstream detection algorithms, which fully proved the effectiveness of DF-YOLOv8."

To address this, we demonstrate an interference suppression scheme in which an MPT transmitter sniffs Wi-Fi frames and uses the extracted channel state information (CSI) to form a null in a Wi-Fi device. However, the accuracy of this scheme is limited by hardware-induced phase offsets. Therefore, to compensate, a two-step calibration method was employed. In a proof-of-concept experiment, this calibration reduced phase estimation error from over 20° to under 5°, which improved the null depth by up to 11.0 dB for a total interference suppression of over 20 dB. This work experimentally verifies that null-steering based on sniffed frames is a viable strategy for MPT and Wi-Fi coexistence."

In a bid to avoid these constraints, the proposed Scalable VLSI Design Framework to Edge AI Acceleration in Real-Time Audio-Visual Processing Systems is a synthesis of hierarchical dataflow-based VLSI architecture, systolic array-based parallel computing, and dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) as means of optimizing performance. Swift compression-conscious interconnects and dynamic hardware division are also built in to the design in order to create the efficient synchronization of audio and visual channels. The proposed model is analysed with 7 nm CMOS technology that demonstrates the notable enhancements in throughput processing and efficiency of power along with interference latency estimation which is less than 10 ms per frame and accuracy enhancement of 13% which is better than the other existing frameworks.

The framework utilizes Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to minimize the dimensionality of the data makes it efficient to compute and extracts 29 statistical and signal-based features from time and frequency domains for each PCA stream. A lightweight neural network with polynomial activation enables encrypted inference without revealing sensitive input data. Evaluated on the CSI-HAR dataset, the model achieves 94.05% accuracy on both encrypted and plain data, demonstrating that strong privacy preservation can be achieved without sacrificing performance. While the system ensures secure inference, it incurs additional latency due to encryption overhead, which may limit its use in low-latency real-time applications. This makes the framework especially relevant for privacy-sensitive cases like monitoring the stereotypical motor movement (SMM) of autistic children in home or healthcare settings."

    "abstract": "This study explores the application of machine learning techniques to reconstruct poetic imagination from English literary texts, bridging computational modeling with human creativity. The structure of the corpus through which the features of the Shakespearean and Sylvia Plath pieces are encoded accommodates structural peculiarities and aesthetic elements that are hybridized based on syntax, semantics, and poetic stylization with the help of hybrid embeddings. The transformer-based model is used to deduce the latent imaginative intent of metaphor, symbolism and tone. Moreover, such generative problems as line continuation, thematic transposition, or style mimicry are carried out with fine-tuned large language models. The explainable AI methods utilizing Lisp machine interpretation are incorporated so that the features could be highlighted to drive imaginative reconstructions. The outcomes show that the model performs well with regard to several measures. The Imaginative Fidelity Score (IFS) ranged at an average of 0.89 and the averages of the affective match between the categories of emotion were at 87%. The average score of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$4.47 / 5$</tex> based on human judgments was on imaginative authenticity and stylistic coherence. Also, thematic transpositions maintained symbolic mapping at an accuracy of more than 90.6% on more complex transitions such as the mapping of Loss to Transformation. This overlap of the fields of computational linguistics and poetic aesthetics creates opportunities in AI-assisted literary criticism, creative writing, and affective computing. The system proposed does not just analyze the poetic texts but also adds to them being a co-creator of the literary exploration. The project could be extended in the future to incorporate cross-lingual poetic re-construction, the inclusion of multimodal metaphors and modeling cultural or historical context to add additional layers to imaginative expressions. The results highlight how subtle human creativity can be represented by the aesthetic of algorithms, to which education, digital humanities, and literary AI applications are relevant."

Stress may be similar to eustress and stress which is distress, and chronic distress causes dire health problems because of hormonal fluctuations including a rise in cortisols and adrenaline. In this study, an ensemble ML model, which is a combination of the Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) is proposed to facilitate efficient stress management.

However, students' logbook entries are sometimes descriptive, unclear and incoherent. This might be due to them not having a critical reader in mind when writing. This paper evaluates the impact of a structured series of embedded workshops designed to enhance logbook writing skills among Applied Computing students to prepare them for their eightmonth internship under an Integrated Work Study Programme (IWSP). Generative AI (GenAI) took on the role of an interactive and critical reader: as a group of clients in a Requirements Engineering (RE) exercise (lesson 1), as a writing coach (lesson 2) and as an editor (lesson 3). Data was collected via a comparison of students' logbook entries in lesson three compared to lesson one and an end-of-workshop survey. The primary improvements observed between the students' logbook submissions were in critical analysis, content relevance and depth, and the integration of supporting ideas. The survey findings revealed that GenAI, when deployed as a user, helped generate ideas during brainstorming sessions and provided a basic and structured skeleton to kickstart the writing process. GenAI, as a coach, helped students be more objective by considering multiple perspectives. As an editor, it offered clarity and formatting suggestions, which helped students write more clearly and coherently. The findings underscore the effectiveness of AI-assisted workshops in preparing students for industry by developing essential written communication skills, thereby fostering better project documentation and reporting practices."

Complementarily, the inverse design model enables recovery of optimized design configurations from target spectral responses. Both models demonstrate high prediction accuracy, achieving normalized mean absolute error (MAE) below 0.02.

We focus on techniques for load balancing and data distribution in parallel SpMV, aiming to maximize computational resource utilization. We propose two algorithms for SpMV that attempt to overcome the shortcomings of Flat-SpMV, namely the use of fixed-size vectors and the performance degradation due to irregular matrices. In the first work, we use variable-sized vectors to reduce the partial results, as opposed to fixed-sized vectors used in Flat-SpMV. Further, as the irregular nature of the matrix caused Flat-SpMV to perform slower in warp-level analysis, we developed a new method by reorganizing the sparse matrix structure and applying a variant of Flat-SpMV to it. It outperformed other approaches on more than 70 % of the input matrices."

    "abstract": "This paper deals with the experimental study to investigate the effect of polarization diversity on antenna signal reception at a receiver, employing an array antenna with the same and different polarization configurations. Two linear antenna polarizations, i.e., horizontal and vertical, are configured and examined in an anechoic chamber using a triangular array antenna. The transmitter employs polarization diversity, while the receiver evaluates received power signal. The variations in power level of signal reception across different polarization configurations are also presented. The investigation results demonstrate that the use of polarization diversity significantly affects the level power of receiving antenna and stabilizes the power signal reception of receiver."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA and BLOOM have revolutionized natural language processing by enabling advanced applications like dialogue systems, summarization, and reasoning. However, their extensive computational demands in terms of GPU memory, processing power, and bandwidth make them unsuitable for execution on consumer-grade or low-resource devices. Current solutions often rely on centralized cloud APIs, which introduce privacy risks, high costs, and dependency on external infrastructure. To overcome these limitations, this research proposes a distributed inference framework that partitions LLMs layer-wise across multiple devices connected via a trusted local network. Each device, acting as either a client or server, contributes according to its computational capacity. Servers host subsets of model layers, while clients orchestrate inference by routing inputs across available servers. The system integrates Hivemind's decentralized hash table (DHT) built on libp2p for expert discovery, pipeline parallelism for distributed execution, 8-bit quantization for memory efficiency, and KV catching for fault tolerance. Evaluation results across LAN and internet environments validate feasibility, demonstrating that models like GPT-2 can be executed on consumer laptops with 4GB VRAM. This work highlights the potential for democratizing access to powerful AI capabilities through collaborative inference."

    "abstract": "This study applies Life Data Analysis (LDA), particularly Weibull distribution modeling, to evaluate and compare the reliability, failure patterns, and operational lifespans of High-Pressure Sodium Vapor (HPSV) and Light Emitting Diode (LED) streetlights using real field data. Although LED streetlight technology gained international traction around 2012, its long-term performance was not well documented at the time. In Malaysia, Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) began widespread deployment of LED streetlights in 2016. This study utilizes actual operational and failure data from thousands of units to conduct a statistically rigorous analysis. LDA is a methodical reliability engineering approach that uses time-to-failure data to predict product life and identify failure trends. The Weibull distribution, a versatile tool in LDA, was employed to model failure behaviors of both HPSV and LED lights. In addition to failure modeling, the Mean Time to Failure (MTTF) was calculated for both lighting technologies, serving as a fundamental indicator of reliability. The results demonstrated that LED streetlights possess a significantly higher MTTF compared to HPSV units, confirming their longer lifespan and superior durability in outdoor conditions. These findings reinforce the reliability advantages of LED systems and align with their design intent of long-term, low-maintenance operation."

The system is highly accurate in behavior detection because it focuses exclusively on six behaviors lying, standing, walking, eating, drinking, and mounting. The data used for the study were gathered in two dairy farms in Hohhot City, Inner Mongolia, where high-definition cameras recorded multi-angle footage of approximately 500 cows. To improve the video quality, the frames were converted into time-series data, which greatly reduced sampling bias. The feature extraction network was augmented with a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) and a Spatial Attention Module (SAM). The module merges spatial and channel attention methods so that the machine can better “see” the object of the research and reduce the background noise. Hyperparameters were fine-tuned by Bayesian methods, thus allowing the algorithm to switch easily between exploration and exploitation so as to improve the validation accuracy. Various metrics such as IoU, Precision-Recall curves, and Cohen's Kappa were employed to assess the accuracy and reliability of the model. The accuracy of the model was improved from 0.60 to over 0.95 by the 150th epoch, Cohen's Kappa ranged between 0.90 and 0.94, and the overall accuracy was between 0.93 and 0.95."

    "abstract": "Timely recognition of skin cancers improves survival chances, yet automated diagnosis is hindered by subtle lesion similarities and uneven class distributions. This study proposes a dual-stream ensemble that integrates EfficientFormerV2 with the Swin Tiny Transformer for multiclass dermoscopic classification using the HAM10000 dataset. Both networks were pretrained on ImageNet and subsequently fine-tuned; their predictions were merged through two strategies: (1) probability-level fusion via weighted soft voting and (2) a meta-ensemble in which a logistic regression model learns from the concatenated logits of both backbones. Unlike earlier works that rely on a single CNN or transformer, this framework leverages the complementary strengths of a lightweight CNN–transformer hybrid and a hierarchical vision transformer. Experiments show that the Swin Tiny model achieves the highest accuracy (∼90%), whereas the logistic-regression ensemble delivers the best balance across classes (macro F1 = 0.8800) and strong discrimination capability (ROC-AUC = 0.9814), with clear improvements on infrequent lesion types such as AKIEC and DF. We also assess inference cost and model size, highlighting EfficientFormerV2’s suitability for resource-limited deployment. While evaluation is restricted to HAM10000, future work will include cross-dataset studies and integration of clinical metadata. Overall, the proposed approach demonstrates potential as a reliable, scalable decision-support tool in dermatological practice."

While low-inductance solutions have been demonstrated for planar packages, existing interconnects for vertical package structures result in high inductance per unit length. The coaxial gate/kelvin interconnect proposed here has been shown to reduce per-unit length gate-loop inductances in vertical package structures by 50% or more, enabling more advanced vertical package structures. The proposed on-chip coaxial interconnect also results in significant decoupling between the gate and power loops, enabling faster switching and better control of parallel die. This paper explores several materials and techniques for implementing coaxial interconnects. The resultant electrical characteristics, bond strengths, and viability of these approaches were evaluated. A solution for limiting mechanical stress in the bond between the die and the coaxial interconnects due to mechanical loading on the unbonded end was developed. To demonstrate the viability of the proposed interconnect solution, a package prototype which includes coaxial gate/kelvin interconnects was fabricated and characterized."

Existing solutions mainly rely on meta-heuristic algorithms that use fitness-based evaluations, which often incur high computational overhead, slow convergence, and limited scalability, particularly in real-time or high-precision monitoring scenarios. In this paper, we examine the relationship between effective coverage area and redundant distances in an analytical manner. We then propose reformulating WSN coverage optimization as a Distance-Gradient based convex optimization problem, which can be subsequently solved using the first-order Gradient Descent algorithm or the second-order quasi-Newton algorithm. Extensive comparative experiments against five representative meta-heuristic methods, the Virtual Force Algorithm (VFA) and a general convex optimization algorithm (CVX), demonstrate that our approach achieves near-optimal coverage while preserving network connectivity within milliseconds, highlighting its advantages over existing methods for WSNs coverage optimization."

The required field magnitude is achieved by modulating the leakage factor along the antenna, for which an approximate formula derived in the last century continues to be widely used nowadays. However, this expression assumes the field transverse profile inside the guiding structure does not change along its length. This contribution revisits this well-known formula in order to obtain it from a rigorous approach assuming a leaky rectangular waveguide supporting a TE field configuration. Thus, the origin of the limitation of the maximum leakage factor value is explained for this scenario, its influence is quantified by establishing a numerical criterion, and the validity of the approximate formula is justified. Finally, some analytical examples are discussed, showing how the approximate leakage factor differs from the more accurate numerically computed one in limit cases, and how the radiation patterns are affected."

This study investigates the influence of electrode material, geometry, and thickness on the performance of M13-based piezoelectric nanogenerators through Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and MATLAB Simulink circuit simulations. Four electrode materials-gold, silver, copper, and stainless steel-were examined with varying thicknesses (20 µm, 120 µm, and 200 µm) and geometries (square and rectangular). Simulation results revealed that gold square electrodes at 20 µm achieved the highest voltage output, reaching 10.383 V. Statistical analysis using one-way ANOVA confirmed the significance of material selection and geometry in optimizing energy conversion efficiency. The test displayed scores of 0.2017, 0.1845, and 0.2953 for the square electrodes with thicknesses of 20 µm, 120 µm, and 200 µm, respectively, indicating minimal discrepancies between them. Furthermore, circuit simulations demonstrated that energy harvested using the optimal configuration could be effectively stored in a lithium-ion battery. Among the chosen electrode materials, gold generated the quickest charging time of 371.42 hours with and without load, while stainless steel charged the slowest. Notably, thinner electrodes produced better voltage and power outputs, while increased thickness resulted in diminished performance. These findings highlight the critical role of electrode design in enhancing the performance of biologically inspired PENGs and pave the way for their integration into self-powered wearable electronics and biomedical sensors. Future research should explore experimental validation and assess long-term environmental durability for real-world applications."

    "abstract": "The imperative for early and accurate detection of Ganoderma Boninense infections in oil palms is paramount to mitigating the devastating impact of basal stem rot. This disease poses a significant threat to palm oil production and the economic stability of affected regions. Conventional detection methods rely heavily on visual inspection or destructive laboratory analysis, which are time-consuming, labour-intensive, and cost-inefficient for large plantations. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel method for Ganoderma detection using frame-based hyperspectral imaging captured by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The approach incorporates feature-based band registration to correct spectral misalignments, followed by dimensionality reduction using principal component analysis (PCA). Support vector machines (SVMs) were evaluated for classification alongside a fine-tuned ResNet50 model. The results demonstrated that the TF- ResNet50 model achieved an accuracy of 84%, with a sensitivity of 74% for early infected trees and a specificity of 86% for healthy trees, underscoring the potential of UAV-based hyperspectral imaging for scalable, non-destructive disease monitoring in oil palm plantations."

    "abstract": "To circumvent the issue of significant space occupation and limited detection range associated with commercial 24 GHz radar sensor and to seamlessly integrated into smart devices, this paper proposed a new ultra-compact and highly isolated frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar sensor which is appropriate for short range object detection applications. The proposed ultra-compact radar sensor is designed with a shared circular polarization (CP) TX-RX antenna, featuring extensive object detection range which is achieved by using characteristic mode analysis (CMA) decoupling method to attenuate the port-to-port leakage. The Infineon radar Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit (MMIC) is then integrated with proposed antenna, enabling it to accomplish the function of detection. The proposed radar antenna was measured, demonstrating a peak gain of 5.66 dBic for port 1 and 4.09 dBic for port 2 with respect to a port-to-port isolation greater than 30 dB. Additionally, the performance of the proposed 24 GHz radar sensor was evaluated by building holistic radar signal processing platform, showing an augmented detection range from 1 m to 11 m."

    "abstract": "The invaluable coral reefs, which are essential for marine ecosystem worldwide and especially in India, face serious threats from global warming, sea water pollution, and increasing sea temperatures. This environmental destruction causes extreme coral bleaching, illness, and ecosystem collapse, damaging sea life and effecting communities in the coastal regions which are dependent on these ecosystems for sustenance. Traditional methods for monitoring coral health, like manual surveys, are slow, costly, and obstructing rapid, comprehensive understanding. To solve this problem, our project presents an automated, efficient approach for coral reef health evaluation using deep learning on underwater images. We started with data collection and expansion, generating a dataset of over 100,000 coral images for model training using image augmentation. During the second phase, ten diverse deep learning models, including custom CNNs and pre-trained architectures like InceptionV3, were created. The third phase focused on fine-tuning these models, resulting in considerable increases in performance. Specifically, models like SimpleCNN and InceptionV3 achieved a remarkable 96% classification accuracy on a 20,000-image test set, successfully solving problems like class imbalance and overfitting. This project provides a strong groundwork for a reliable coral health monitoring system, offering marine experts a fast, accurate instrument for monitoring reef conditions and detecting initial signs of stress indicators, ultimately safeguarding India's invaluable coral reef biodiversity."

Its growing integration into voice assistants and IoT devices raises a critical privacy and security concerns related to sensitive information leakage that leads to identity theft, and voice cloning. Existing privacy-preserving methods provide partial safeguards but are still vulnerable to data breaches. The proposed method converts raw speech at the input stage into a representation that is unintelligible to humans, thereby safeguarding sensitive information while preserving the essential features required for downstream tasks. Its effectiveness is demonstrated through successful implementation on four speech emotion recognition models, followed by performance evaluation. Furthermore, we conducted a comparative feature analysis between the standard and privacy-preserving domains to highlight the method's robustness and effectiveness."

To simplify the solving process, the optimal objective and constraints are decomposed into X and Y directions. Then, the nonlinear optimal control problem is transformed into linear control problem. Furthermore, the optimal tracking control model is discretized and the problem can be simplified into nonlinear programming (NLP). Finally, numerical simulations are provided to show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approaches."

    "abstract": "Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL), as an advanced distributed learning paradigm, introduces edge computing layers to enhance system scalability but simultaneously expands the attack surface for poisoning attacks. Traditional defense mechanisms typically rely on single-metric approaches, which prove inadequate against sophisticated poisoning strategies in hierarchical architectures. To address these limitations, we propose a robust HFL framework that employs dual-metric malicious model detection. Our approach integrates Euclidean distance and cosine similarity measurements to comprehensively evaluate model updates from both clients and edge servers. We further leverage Shapley values to ensure fair assessment of model contributions under non-IID data distributions. Additionally, we implement a K-means based clustering mechanism to automatically identify and filter malicious models without requiring predefined thresholds. Rigorous testing on Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets in heterogeneous data environments and multiple attack scenarios validates that our method robustly defends against hierarchical poisoning attacks while preserving model accuracy competitive with state-of-the-art approaches."

Firstly, neighborhood buckets are enhanced by introducing the median, which improves the robustness of neighborhood partitioning against data noise, with its superiority theoretically demonstrated. Secondly, within the hierarchical classification framework, a lower approximation is defined by linearly combining sibling labels and farthest labels, constructing a positive region that balances both local discriminability and global semantic differences. Based on this, a Neighborhood Bucket-based Sibling/Farthest Label Feature Selection algorithm (NBSF) is designed. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets show that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing representative methods in terms of robustness, classification accuracy, and computational efficiency, providing effective theoretical support and implementation approaches for feature extraction and granularity optimization in hierarchical structured data."

The model, which is developed based on PyTorch, has an accuracy of 94.5% and is better in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score than the traditional CNNs, the VGG16 model, and ResNet50. The findings prove that the optimized architecture is highly effective besides being applicable to real time implementation in clinical environments.

By eliminating the need for wearable sensors, these technologies create new opportunities for health monitoring, human–machine interaction, and privacy-conscious observation in daily life. Over the past decade, we have developed a variety of signal processing frameworks that include high-resolution human imaging, motion tracking, and physiological signal estimation. These frameworks are grounded in mathematical models of body shape, displacement waveforms, and pulse wave propagation and leverage techniques such as signal decomposition, array processing, and multi-radar fusion. Our approaches have led to practical applications such as sleep apnea detection, multi-person respiratory monitoring, and radar-based individual identification.

To address these issues, this work introduces a novel, end-to-end machine learning framework that integrates advanced preprocessing, hyperparameter optimization, and ensemble learning tailored specifically for large-scale, imbalanced fraud data. Leveraging the IEEE-Computational Intelligence Society (IEEE-CIS) fraud detection dataset, a real-world benchmark characterized by missing values and extreme imbalance-we performed comprehensive preprocessing, including imputation, normalization, and feature selection, to improve model readiness and stability. Unlike prior studies that typically optimize individual models, the proposed framework employs Optuna with Tree-structured Parzen Estimators (TPE) for systematic hyperparameter tuning across multiple classifiers: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM. The novelty of this approach lies in the construction of a weighted voting ensemble of the top-performing gradient boosting models (XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM), where weights are adaptively assigned based on model-specific performance. This ensemble consistently outperformed the individual models, achieving the highest Area Under the Curve (AUC) and demonstrating superior robustness across all evaluation metrics, including precision, recall, and the F1-score."

Methods: The study applied both Fuzzy Set and Rough Set Theories to classify instances in the Wisconsin dataset. Key metrics for evaluation included accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, AUC-ROC, and robustness against data noise. Findings: Fuzzy Set Theory demonstrated an accuracy of 95%, sensitivity of 96%, and an AUC-ROC of 0.97, showcasing its superior performance in managing imprecision in data. Rough Set Theory, while slightly less effective in these metrics with an accuracy of 93% and an AUC-ROC of 0.95, excelled in interpretability and managing data with less noise. Novelty: This study uniquely quantifies and contrasts the capabilities of Fuzzy Set Theory and Rough Set Theory in the context of breast cancer diagnostics, a critical area in medical technology. By providing empirical data on key performance metrics under standardized conditions, it fills a gap in existing literature that often discusses these theories separately or qualitatively. Furthermore, the analysis of these frameworks' robustness against data noise introduces a novel perspective on their practical applicability in real-world clinical settings, offering valuable insights for future CAD system enhancements."

To address this, the Analog Devices CN0566 (ADALM-Phaser) kit was integrated with a PlutoSDR and controlled through MATLAB and Python environments to perform both simulated and realworld beamforming experiments. Direction-of-Arrival (DOA) estimation algorithm using Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) was implemented to demonstrate adaptive beam steering and interference suppression. System calibration ensured consistent phase and gain across all array elements, while measured radiation patterns confirmed precise beam steering toward target directions. Experimental results demonstrate that the SDR-based phased array can dynamically steer beams and mitigate interference effectively.

The evolution of electrical properties, including surface charge decay rate, breakdown strength, and volume conductivity, was systematically characterized for samples aged for different durations. In addition, changes in the cross-sectional micromorphology were examined to correlate structural degradation with performance deterioration. The results indicate that high-temperature thermal oxidation induces molecular chain scission within the polyimide matrix. With prolonged aging, the volume conductivity increases, the surface charge dissipates more rapidly, and the breakdown strength decreases markedly. These findings provide valuable insights into the degradation mechanisms of polyimide films and offer a basis for assessing the reliability of motor insulation systems operating under high-temperature environments."

    "abstract": "The classic Snake game has long served as a common benchmark for testing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents. While traditional open-field versions provide a simple platform for training, they often fail to properly evaluate an agent’s ability to generalize, as agents can exploit repetitive, memorized patterns rather than developing adaptive strategies. To address this limitation, an \"obstacle-rich\" Snake environment is introduced in which static obstacles are randomly positioned at the start of each episode. This setup introduces spatial constraints that demand more complex reasoning and prevent reliance on brittle policies. A Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) agent is designed for this setting, supported by a compact 16-dimensional state representation incorporating diagonal obstacle detection for enhanced navigation in cluttered spaces. Comparative and ablation experiments demonstrate that the proposed representation, together with the stability of the DDQN framework, are both crucial for achieving strong performance. The findings demonstrate that this environment serves as a rigorous benchmark for policy generalization in DRL-based pathfinding. These findings have direct implications for real-world scenarios, such as the navigation of autonomous robots in constrained settings."

    "abstract": "Network penetration Testing (or pentesting) is a positive way to find vulnerabilities associated with the increasingly complex world of IoT, Cloud, and 5G. In this discussion paper, we examine the evolution of declining penetration testing tools, from simple tools such as Nmap and Metasploit, to the emergence of sophisticated Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered platforms like Darktrace and GuardiCore. We discuss the categories of known vulnerabilities, including misconfiguration, weak authentication, and outdated software, and how different AI model architectures, particularly reinforcement learning and large language models, can be leveraged to address components of the mission, such as automating reconnaissance, identifying vulnerable systems, and generating exploitation vectors. Although AI will increase speed, scale, and ease of use, challenges such as trust, explainability, and robustness against adversarial attacks remain significant hurdles. We underscore the necessity of a hybrid, human-in-the-loop model where AI augments human expertise, a framework often mandated by compliance and ethical considerations. In this respect, we identify the need for a strong explainability framework and a consideration of ethical issues and auditability aspects throughout any automated testing framework. Lastly, we suggest future planning for research and development into kinds of autonomous (self- learning) frameworks that will grow with changing adversarial threats using AI, while also lamenting the diminishing role of humans to augment (collaborate with) AI, in what is an important field of cybersecurity."

    "abstract": "To efficiently transmit desired signals to devices via beamforming, accurate estimation of the Direction of Arrival (DOA) is essential. For two-dimensional (2D) Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems, a DOA estimation method based on the Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm using virtual antennas has been proposed. However, because the virtual antennas are positioned between the real antennas, the effective aperture cannot be extended, resulting in limited resolution. Furthermore, the conventional way of noise generation for virtual antennas often produces unstable variance, leading to larger estimation errors. This paper proposes an improved method that enhances resolution by extending virtual antenna placement beyond the real array and stabilizes the noise variance through a refined generation process. Simulation results confirm that the proposed method achieves superior resolution and lower estimation error compared to conventional techniques."

Consequently, the effectiveness of e-commerce AI personalization tools is often hampered in the non-Western markets due to their lack of cultural and linguistic adaptation. To address this problem, this study employs recommendation systems and Natural Language Processing NLP tools that work with Arabic dialect variations and cultural nuances, which it faces in the Middle East. The aim is to create an AI framework incorporating personalization technology and a cultural adaptation approach in order to provide tailored and ethical suggestions. This study converted deep learning-based recommendation systems to work with Arabic datasets and improved Transformer-based NLP to get better sentiment analysis and user experience optimization. Hofstede’s cultural dimensions provide a framework for advisor-tailored recommendations and the factors for Middle Eastern consumer preferences, religious issues, and shopping behavior. Finally, the proposed framework shows clear superiority in both personalization, based on the accuracy of the suggested items and their sentiment interpretation. It also introduces a bias evaluation methodology capable of decreasing 25% the level of demographic biases, establishing a benchmark for responsible AI practices. A significant conclusion of the results is that they demonstrate the growth of Middle Eastern e-commerce through improved user engagement and trust. This research demonstrates how AI systems could help users to become attached with their cultural identity and increase inclusivity and scalability in e-commerce domain."

Typically, SAR systems operate on a much wider bandwidth than RFI and interference appears only in a few subband components. Hence, the DSF can filter out the subband components polluted by interference in a wide signal spectrum. We construct the DSF model based on a low-rank representation (LRR-DSF) framework and derive its closed-form solution via the alternating-direction method of multipliers (ADMM). In each iteration, the optimal filter weights are updated until the model is convergent. We can apply the trained filter to homologous interference (HI) with the same spectral characteristics for rapid suppression. Real spaceborne SAR data working in the C-band are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."

Depth perception is divided into three levels: short-range, mid-range and long-range based on alpha power activity elicited from EEG signal recordings from the occipital, parietal, and prefrontal regions of the brain. The proposed neuro-fuzzy model combines the power associated with understanding EEG signals with the adaptable reasoning of fuzzy logic to classify something based on considerable variability between each of the individuals tested. Results indicate that the classifier can reliably differentiate depth perceptual abilities and thus represents an efficient method to assess a characteristic by non-invasively measuring brain electrical activity. This method has potential applications in several high stakes fields where accurate spatial judgments are critical, such as aviation; real time procedures, such as surgery that requires accurate depth cues; or clinical processes, such as diagnosing depth perceptual impairments. The primary contribution of this work is a neuro-physiological signal processing and intelligent classifier used together as a measuring tool in either applied settings or as scientific research in the field of vision science or cognitive neuroscience."

    "abstract": "Smart warehousing has been more rapidly developed with automation, the Internet of Things as well as data analytics requiring more flexible and intelligent methods of inventory management. In dynamic and uncertain situations where demand changes, lead times, and resource constraints, traditional inventory control methods are unable to adjust in some cases. This research presents a Model Predictive Control (MPC) dynamic inventory management strategy in smart warehouses. Mathematical proactive decision-making, which leverages real-time data and predictive modelling, enhances inventory levels, minimises retaining and shortage costs, and makes operations more responsive with MPC. The proposed solution unites inventory dynamics, system constraints, and demand forecasting into a predictive control mechanism, which reinvents decisions by new data feeds again and again. Based on results of the simulation, the MPC-based model proves to be significantly superior to conventional methods in the dimensions of resilience, adaptability, and cost effectiveness in a variety of operating conditions. The system is also designed in a modular form which also enables real-time feedback and automatic control, which is achieved by the seamless interaction with the IoT devices and warehouse management system (WMS). This paper illustrates how inventory management can be transformed in smart storage through MPC as a means of offering a scalable and ingenious method of managing complex logistics environments that harbor much uncertainty and unpredictability."

The hybrid framework suggested identifies relational structures of biomolecular markers using Johnson graphs which is preferred because of its combinatoric features and high capacity to describe connected subsets. These structures are then captured and categorized using the AI techniques, such as deep learning and pattern recognition models, with a level of accuracy that was not achievable before. With this method, diagnostic uncertainty on complicated oncology data sets is successfully removed and concealed connections are made apparent through translation of gene-expression profiles and mutation landscapes into Johnson-graph topologies. Therefore, the combination of AI and Johnson-graph decomposition provides an enormous jump in accuracy of structurally informed diagnosis of cancer. This paper also details the hybrid structure that uses Johnson graphs to reveal patterns of relationships of biomolecular markers whose richness is combinatorially rich and accurately represent interconnected subsets. Subsequently, AI algorithms, such as deep learning and classical pattern-recognition algorithms, are applied to these structures to obtain, so far, unsurpassed accuracy of understanding and classification capabilities. Diagnostic ambiguity in the high-dimensional oncological data is reduced by the methodology, and latent interactions are revealed by reconstruction of the gene-expression data and mutational landscapes using Johnson-graphs. It has the ability to be modified to fit a variety of cancer types and omics platforms due to its inherent flexibility thus providing it with the ability to become a revolutionary tool in precision oncology."

However, most existing methods focus on supine posture, limiting their effectiveness in real-life scenarios where individuals may sleep in various postures. This paper proposes a robust algorithm for accurate heart rate estimation across various sleeping postures. The chest displacement is first demodulated from the MIMO radar beat signals. A hybrid filtering technique is then applied to suppress the respiratory fundamental and harmonic components. Finally, cross-correlation is used to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the separated heartbeat motion, ensuring reliable performance under posture-induced signal degradation. In the left lateral posture, the proposed algorithm effectively separates heartbeat motion and enhances its SNR, enabling accurate heart rate estimation, whereas conventional method suffers from severe interference by respiratory harmonics and noise. In continuous heart rate monitoring experiments across four sleeping postures, the proposed algorithm achieves over 90% accuracy, achieving up to 18.34% improvements over conventional method, confirming its robustness and accuracy under sleep postural variability."

Building on earlier conceptual and architectural work, we implemented the Mesh CoP in a real-world setting, combining peer collaboration with collaborative game mechanics designed to simulate threat scenarios and encourage proactive engagement. Participants took part in structured activities that emphasized shared learning, challenge-based interaction, and reflection. Using a pre-post experimental design, we measured changes in cybersecurity knowledge and behavioral responses, focusing on indicators such as response frequency, accuracy, and consistency. Results demonstrated statistically significant improvements in both, with stronger alignment between what participants knew and how they responded.

    "abstract": "Large-scale Low Earth Orbit (LEO) constellations such as Starlink and OneWeb are creating highly dynamic inter-satellite networks, where rapid topology evolution poses major challenges for routing optimization. To guarantee end-to-end Quality of Service (QoS) under such spatio-temporal dynamics, this paper proposes a Spatio-Temporal QoS-A* (ST-QoS-A*) routing algorithm. Built upon the Time-Expanded Graph (TEG) model, the algorithm introduces a transmission-time-aligned cost accumulation mechanism and a physically admissible heuristic bounded by light-speed propagation delay, ensuring both temporal consistency and optimality. The algorithm is still effective under polar orbits, despite minor performance reduction due to frequent occlusions. An event-driven adaptation mechanism further enables real-time responses to congestion and link disruptions. A dynamic simulation platform integrating AGI STK 12 and MATLAB is developed to validate the proposed approach. Compared with traditional shortest-path routing, ST-QoS-A* increases the task success rate by over 100\\%, reduces the average propagation delay by 10–20\\%, and decreases the maximum link load by more than 60\\%.The results demonstrate that ST-QoS-A* effectively balances delay, congestion, and stability while maintaining low computational complexity, providing a practical and scalable solution for QoS-aware routing in future space–ground integrated networks."

    "abstract": "In many real world applications, such as customer behavior analysis, data distributions evolve gradually over time. Traditional clustering methods, which retrain models from scratch at regular intervals, often fail to preserve the fine grained dynamics within clusters as they evolve. In this paper, we propose an incremental clustering framework that maintains cluster continuity across sequential time periods. Our approach clusters new incoming data independently and then maps the resulting clusters back to existing clusters by computing cosine similarity between cluster centroids. If a sufficiently similar match is found, the cluster is continued; otherwise, a new cluster is initialized. This method enables accurate tracking of cluster evolution over time, capturing subtle shifts in cluster characteristics without abrupt reassignments. Experimental results on synthetic and real world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in preserving cluster lineage and detecting emerging behaviors. Our framework offers a simple yet powerful solution for time sensitive applications where maintaining historical cluster context is critical."

Stabilizing multi-rotor systems becomes increasingly challenging in the presence of external disturbances. This work has been implemented in a twin rotor MIMO (TRMS) system that mimics a helicopter model. This study introduces an innovative method for regulating the pitch angle of a twin-rotor MIMO system through a variable-gain sliding-mode controller.

    "abstract": "To increase the quality of the diagnostics and reduce the mortality rates, melanoma must be identified at the initial phase of its development, yet the automated skin lesion analysis is becoming a challenging task due to irregular structure, inter-class similarity, and imaging artifacts. In this paper, the proposed multi-scale contextual feature fusion network (MCFF-Net) that has proven to be effective in the recognition of skin lesions is proposed as the solution to these problems. Compared to the more traditional multi-scale methodologies, MCFFNet is a model that contains a contextual attention mechanism that aids in the capture of the semantic dependence between lesion areas and their surroundings to ensure the further differentiation of visually similar classes. It is based on the idea of learning both finegrained textures and deep semantic details, using a hierarchical multi-scale extraction block and then adapting to combine shallow and deep features without lesion edges, an idea referred to as context-guided fusion. A refining process further cancels the background noise and sharpens the contours in order to make it robust in a wide imaging condition. It is highly tested over benchmark dermoscopic datasets, such as ISIC2018 and HAM10000. Experimental findings indicate that MCFFNet has a total accuracy of 98.3%, better sensitivity, specificity and AUC than state-of-the-art techniques. The combination of contextual feature fusion can considerably improve the boundary delineation and misclassification rates and makes MCFF-Net a promising and stable framework to be used in clinical practice to detect early-stage melanoma."

    "abstract": "With the large-scale integration of doubly-fed wind turbines ( DFIG ), the influence of its dynamic characteristics on the transient stability and power quality of the power grid is becoming increasingly prominent. However, since the wind turbine control strategy and electromagnetic model are often provided in the form of ' black box ', the internal mechanism is opaque, which makes it difficult to accurately simulate the fault response of the unit. Therefore, the identification method of the key parameters inside the unit from the external operation data has become the core path to break through the ' black box ' limitation, which can not only construct a general high-precision ' white box ' simulation model, but also provide theoretical support for transient stability assessment and low voltage ride through (LVRT) capability optimization. In this paper, a differential evolution control parameter identification method based on time domain response sensitivity weight is proposed to solve the problem of DFIG black box modeling. Firstly, the time-domain sensitivity model of control parameters covering the whole working range is constructed. On this basis, a DE optimization algorithm with adaptive sensitivity weight is designed. By dynamically adjusting the mutation amplitude and crossover probability, the accuracy of parameter identification is improved. The typical simulation results show that the proposed method is superior to the traditional DE algorithm in terms of identification accuracy, computational efficiency and working condition adaptability."

The proliferation of medical data has catalyzed the application of machine learning (ML) for developing robust diagnostic decision-support systems. This study conducts a rigorous comparative analysis of four prominent ML algorithms for the task of breast cancer prediction using the benchmark Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. We evaluate two classical models, Gaussian Naive Bayes and a Decision Tree Classifier, against two state-of-the-art gradient boosting ensemble methods, XGBoost and CatBoost. The models are systematically assessed using a suite of performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Our experimental results demonstrate the marked superiority of ensemble techniques, with the CatBoost classifier achieving the highest classification accuracy of 97.36 %. This performance surpasses that of the other tested models and is competitive with established benchmarks in the literature. Feature importance analysis derived from the CatBoost model identifies cell nucleus characteristics such as ‘mean radius’, ‘mean texture’, and ‘mean perimeter’ as the most influential predictors, aligning with established clinical pathology. This work underscores the potential of advanced boosting algorithms like CatBoost to provide reliable, data-driven predictions, thereby offering a valuable tool for healthcare professionals in the early detection of breast cancer."

The process of choosing the best renewable energy source is challenging and involves evaluating numerous conflicting factors, including cost, efficiency, resource availability, and environmental impact. This study proposes a novel decision-making framework that incorporates the Fuzzy Harmonic Mean Aggregation operator for Heptagonal fuzzy numbers (FHM_HFN) operator and the Techniques for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method into the multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) Approach. The FHM_HFN operator effectively aggregates expert opinions by capturing the interrelationships between criteria and dealing with data uncertainties. The results of the real-time example show how well the proposed fuzzy decision-making approach works to offer a systematic and transparent approach to evaluating and selecting the renewable energy. The proposed fuzzy harmonic mean operator for the HFN is used to integrate the outcomes of the fuzzy evaluation.

    "abstract": "The integration of high-penetration renewable energy has led to a reduction in the equivalent inertia of power systems, making frequency stability a critical issue. This poses severe challenges to the speed, adaptability, and coordination of traditional Under-Frequency Load Shedding schemes. To address this, this paper proposes a cooperative adaptive load shedding strategy based on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning. Firstly, the regional power grid is partitioned into multiple agent regions based on electrical coupling, establishing a centralized training with decentralized execution control architecture. Secondly, a novel reward function integrating global frequency stability and local economic objectives is designed to guide the agents to cooperatively learn the optimal load-shedding policy. Then, the Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm is employed to train the agents, enabling each of them to make fast, distributed decisions relying solely on local observations. Simulation results demonstrate that in low-inertia scenarios caused by high-penetration renewable, the proposed strategy, compared to traditional methods, can effectively raise the frequency nadir by over 0.3 Hz, reduce the total shed load by 10%, and shorten the frequency recovery time. Furthermore, the strategy providing a novel solution for frequency stability in new-type power systems."

    "abstract": "This study investigates the role of CT in shaping students’ AI literacy and its subsequent influence on autonomous learning (AU) within Thai higher education. Adopting a mixed-methods design, the quantitative phase surveyed 512 undergraduate students from over 20 universities, while the qualitative phase engaged five students based on their CT scores using convenience sampling. Structural Equation Modeling confirmed that CT significantly predicts AI literacy, and AI literacy, in turn, strongly predicts AU, establishing its mediating role between CT and AU. Complementary qualitative findings revealed clear behavioral distinctions: students with high CT skills consistently used AI as a supportive tool for brainstorming, verification, and reflection, whereas students with low CT skills tended toward passive reliance on AI outputs with limited evaluation or concern for long-term implications. The findings underscore CT as a foundational competency for effective AI use and autonomous learning. Pedagogical implications highlight the value of embedding structured reflection activities to encourage students to critically evaluate AI outputs and strengthen their reasoning. In addition, the study emphasizes the importance of clear institutional guidelines and regulations on AI use. Together, these measures ensure that AI serves as a scaffold for learning rather than a replacement for independent effort, preparing students to become autonomous, critical, and responsible learners in an AI-driven society."

    "abstract": "In this paper, a novel bipolar cubic magnetic coupler (BC-MC) for multidirectional WPT system is proposed for charging cluster AUVs. Specifically, the presented BC-MC transmitting coil is composed of four L-shaped coils connected in series, which can supply power to multiple bipolar arc-shaped receiving coils positioned around it. A multi-objective genetic algorithm is employed to optimize the coil parameters, aiming to achieve enhanced coupling and reduced volume. In addition, an LCC-S compensation topology is adopted to stabilize the current in Tx coil under dynamic load variations. An experimental WPT prototype is built and the effectiveness of the proposed BC-MC was verified by the measurement results. While satisfying optimal load, the system can achieve 92.45% efficiency at a power level of 200 W for four AUVs."

    "abstract": "In February of this year, Microsoft released their Majorana 1, a quantum computing unit using topological qubits. Quantum computing is threatening to undermine traditional encryption techniques, and UAV technologies are promising to improve farming, city management, and search and rescue. It is therefore important for us to assess the impact of post-quantum encryption on FANETs as a matter of urgency. This research is the first known to the authors to address KEMs within a FANET setting. This research uses UB-ANC, a NS3-based UAV network simulation technology, and liboqs, a quantum security library, to evaluate the preparedness of FANETs for encryption in this new paradigm. Each of these KEMs are assessed on 3 points: number of successful key exchanges, throughput, and time to complete the key exchange. Beginning by completing a number of exchanges on FANETs of 4, 10 and 20 static UAVs to establish potential candidates, then run 30 minute survey missions on each of those candidates at each network size. These algorithms are evaluated both as KEMs intended to be used in hybrid encryption, and as public key encryption schemes. Evidence is found that Kyber and ML-KEM are both feasible solutions, at all security levels within applications, which require a less than 32 bytes to be transmitted within a single exchange. Evidence that BIKE, at lower security levels, or within smaller UAV networks, is a functional solution is also found. Ultimately, it is our belief that there is promise within hybrid encryption for FANETs, but the use of KEMs as public key encryption is not yet feasible."

    "abstract": "Conventional PID controllers face a major drawback in that their parameters cannot be adjusted automatically, while the Gazelle Optimization Algorithm (GOA) is often limited by slow convergence and a tendency to fall into local optima. To overcome these challenges, this study proposes an improved algorithm, GOA-MDES, which combines Mean Differential Evolution and the Simplex Method. The ball-and-beam system, a nonlinear and open-loop unstable benchmark, is employed as the validation platform. The improved algorithm is first evaluated using standard benchmark functions and then applied to PID parameter tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that the GOA-MDES-tuned controller achieves superior performance in terms of steady-state error, settling time, and overshoot when compared with GOA, GWO, and PSO. Moreover, the proposed algorithm shows clear advantages in both convergence speed and accuracy. These findings verify the effectiveness of GOA-MDES and highlight its potential as a general-purpose method for PID parameter tuning in nonlinear control systems."

The outer loop antenna consists of multiple segments of capacitive and inductive elements, while the inner loop antenna is a simple square loop antenna, and both antennas have a feed point. When the loop is wound counterclockwise, left-handed circularly polarized (LHCP) waves are obtained below the balance frequency (3GHz), and right-handed circularly polarized (RHCP) waves are obtained above the balance frequency (when wound clockwise, the opposite is true). The antenna has an extremely wide axial ratio bandwidth, with a 3dB axial ratio (AR) relative bandwidth of 25.4% (2.20GHz~2.84GHz) in the lower frequency band and 17.1% (3.27GHz~3.88GHz) in the higher frequency band. At the same time, the radiation patterns of LHCP and RHCP are compared, and the paper also reveals the gain bandwidth and matching characteristics - the impedance bandwidth in the S band (2~4GHz) is very wide."

    "abstract": "Detecting small objects on water surfaces is challenging due to tiny target size, wave and reflection interference, and limited annotations. Traditional methods struggle with accuracy–efficiency trade-offs, especially for densely distributed vessels. We propose MG-Det (Multi-Granularity Guided Detection), a framework tailored for water-surface small object detection. MG-Det adopts a coarse-to-fine inference: a global model ensures high-recall candidate regions, while a lightweight model refines detection within selected windows. A region filtering module reduces redundant inference for efficiency. To further enhance robustness, targeted augmentations—compression, color perturbation, and light-shadow adjustment—improve small object representation. Experiments on a private vessel dataset and the WSODD benchmark show that MG-Det achieves superior accuracy (AP) and efficiency (FLOPs, FPS) compared to mainstream methods. With strong deployability, MG-Det suits edge scenarios such as unmanned surface vehicles, water monitoring, and maritime search and rescue."

This study describes a Multilingual Document Processing System that uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to extract, query and summarize text in multiple languages. The system employs advanced OCR models to correctly recognize text from scanned documents, images, and handwriting in various scripts. By incorporating RAG, it improves comprehension and response generation, allowing users to retrieve and summarize information in English even when the original language is different. This approach takes advantage of recent advances in natural language processing, large language models (LLM), and multimodal AI to address challenges in multilingual data accessibility, knowledge synthesis, and real-time communication. The system provides a scalable AI-driven solution to improve document processing, eliminate language barriers, and increase global user engagement.

    "abstract": "The financial services industry increasingly relies on data-driven quantitative investing, with large language models (LLMs) advancing decision-making through improved financial semantic understanding, news-driven forecasting, and trading signal generation. However, traditional risk metrics like volatility, Value-at-Risk, and Maximum Drawdown often fail to capture the dynamic complexity of markets, leading to undetected risks or excessive trading. We propose ALERA, an LLM-based multi-agent framework that uses entropy to quantify decision-making uncertainty and assess risk across four dimensions: expert disagreements, historical experience, market volatility, and stock correlations. ALERA mitigates long-term information forgetting with a memory pool and incorporates stock interactions for robust risk assessment. Our contributions include pioneering entropy-based risk quantification, a unified framework for dynamic trading strategies, and extensive empirical validation showing superior performance in return and Sharpe ratio compared to baseline methods. Specifically, ALERA achieves an annualized return of 26.32% and a Sharpe Ratio of 1.71 for AAPL, with a cumulative return of 6.31% and a maximum drawdown of 3.63% over a three-month period from August to November 2024, outperforming baselines like MACD, KDJ+RSI, ZMR, and SMA."

    "abstract": "The speed with which deadly diseases are spreading around the world has made it even more important to have good models that can identify when epidemics will happen. Most of the time, traditional ways of predicting epidemics are based on data from the past and the knowledge of experts. These methods may not be able to handle the complexity of new diseases well. This essay looks at how to create and use advanced AI systems that can predict when an epidemic will happen. These studies use many types of machine learning methods, like decision trees, support vector machines (SVMs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), to look for trends in data about early disease spread or guided learning. We suggest a unified method that uses real-time data from social media sites, public health sources, and weather data to make the model better at making predictions. The study also utilizes reinforcement learning techniques to continuously enhance forecasts based on new data received, and the researchers test those algorithms using a variety of data to see how well they work. This includes information about past outbreaks, maps and health reports from various regions. The results demonstrate that the AI-powered method makes high-quality predictions, is timely and offers a substantial flexibility benefit compared to off-the-shelf methods. Combining AI algorithms and real-time monitoring systems can also be used by health organizations and states to inform resourcing, plan actions and mitigations against the spread of outbreaks. The results highlight the potential that AI could have for shaping global health policy and making disease control more nimble and effective."

    "abstract": "This article focuses on the low-conservative stability criteria of delayed neural networks (DNNs). To achieve this goal, new techniques are developed to effectively utilize more system-related information. To use the time-varying delay information, some delay-product terms are introduced into the Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF), and an extended matrix-injection-based transformation method, which introduces delay-derivative-dependent slack matrices while obtaining the negative definite condition, is proposed. With respect totheuse of activation function information, the terms related to the activation function are fully augmented in the LKF. In particular, by considering the sector-constraint information of the activation function, a new nonlinear-function-dependent functional term is established, and a sector-constraint-dependent matrix-separation-based inequality is developed. By applying the above techniques, several improved stability criteria are derived, and two typical examples are provided to illustrate the advantages of the proposed methods."
